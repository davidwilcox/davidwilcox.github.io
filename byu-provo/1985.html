<h1>ery of Godliness - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I rejoice in the privilege of presenting to the young and rising generation some basic concepts about the deepest and most profound doctrine of the gospel.<br><br>It is the first principle of revealed religion, the great cornerstone upon which all else rests, the foundation for all of the doctrines of salvation.<br><br>I shall speak of what the revealed word calls the mystery of godliness.<br><br>If our vision is blurred where this doctrine and these concepts are concerned, or, if knowingly or unknowingly we have fallen prey to any of the false sectarian notions that abound with reference to them, our progress toward eternal life will be slow indeed.<br><h2><b>Comprehending the Mystery of Godliness</b></h2><br>A mystery, so the dictionary says, is "something beyond human comprehension." Defining the word from a theological standpoint, it says a mystery is "an article of faith beyond human comprehension, as the doctrine of the Trinity."<br><br>How apt this illustration is! If there was ever something beyond human comprehension, it is the sectarian doctrine of the Trinity.<br><br>This doctrine defines God and the Godhead as a three-in-one spirit essence that fills the immensity of space; it teaches that it and they are without body, parts, or passions; it acclaims that it and they are unknown, unknowable, and uncreated, and specifies, in the creeds, that unless we believe all these things we cannot be saved.<br><br>It is true that finite man cannot comprehend his Infinite Maker in the full sense of the word. We cannot tell how gods began to be or from whence existent matter came.<br><br>But we are duty-bound to learn all that God has revealed about himself and his everlasting gospel. If we are to gain eternal life we must come to know the Great God and his Only Begotten, whom he sent into the world. And this probationary estate is the appointed time to begin to know God, and to learn his laws, and thereby to start the process of becoming like him. If we do not so begin we shall never receive the promised reward.<br><br>Because God stands revealed or remains forever unknown, and because the things of God are known only by the power of the Spirit, perhaps we should redefine a mystery. In the gospel sense, a mystery is something beyond<i>carnal</i>comprehension.<br><br>The saints are in a position to comprehend all mysteries, to understand all doctrine, and eventually to know all things. These high levels of intelligence are reached only through faith and obedience and righteousness. A person who relies on the intellect alone and who does not keep the commandments can never, worlds without end, comprehend the mystery of godliness.<br><br>There is probably more ignorance and confusion as to the mystery of godliness than there is about any other doctrine. As set forth in the three creeds of Christendom--the Nicene, the Apostles', and the Athanasian, which God himself said were an abomination in his sight--and as defined in the articles of religion of the various denominations, this doctrine is a mass of confusion and a mountain of falsity.<br><br>Even in the Church, thanks to a lack of knowledge and to intellectuality and the worldly enticement to conform to the general beliefs of an apostate Christendom, there are those who have fallen prey to many false delusions about deity. By way of illustration let us note some of the problems.<br><h2><b>Who and What Is God?</b></h2><br>Is there a God? If so, who or what is he? Is he the laws and forces of nature? Or an image of mud or gold? Or is he Baal, the resurrected son of El to whom the Canaanites offered human sacrifices? Is he Allah or Buddha or the confusing and contradictory nothingness described in the creeds of Christendom?<br><br>Is there such a thing as the Trinity in which the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are three gods, and, yet one god, a god who neither hears, nor speaks, nor appears, as did the one worshipped by the ancients?<br><br>Is God omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent, or are these descriptive designations part of the legends of sectarianism?<br><br>Are there three gods or one? Why does Jesus say his Father is greater than he, and Paul say Jesus is equal with the Father? Why the great scriptural emphasis on proclaiming that three gods are one, and that the Lord our God is one Lord?<br><br>What of the mystery of our Lord's birth? Indeed, why should God even have a son? Is Jesus the Son of Man, or the Son of God, or is there a difference? Was it necessary to have a Savior and Redeemer, or is the Koran correct in teaching that God had no need for a son because Allah has but to speak and a thing is done?<br><br>By what power could Jesus atone for the sins of the world, or rise from death's dark tomb, or ascend physically into heaven? Is the atonement truly infinite and eternal, applying to all worlds and all created things?<br><br>Why does an angel say to John, "I am Alpha and Omega," and when John falls at his feet to worship him, say: "See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God" (Revelations 1:8, 19:10)?<br><br>Why does Jesus say: I am the Son of God, and I said such and such unto mine Only Begotten, when in fact the Only Begotten is the offspring, not of the Son, but of the Father?<br><br>Why does Christ say: I am the Father and the Son and I created man in mine own image--when in fact Christ is the Son and not the Father, and when man was created, not by the Son, but by the Father?<br><br>What relationship do we have with the Lord? Do we worship the Father and him only, or do we also worship the Son? Should we seek for some special relationship with Christ, or does the plan of salvation call for us to seek the Spirit and thereby gain a oneness with both the Father and the Son?<br><br>All these are but sample questions, questions that raise some of the issues relative to the mystery of godliness.<br><h2><b>Understanding Through the Power of the Spirit</b></h2><br>It is our friend Paul who tells us: "Without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory" (1 Timothy 3:16).<br><br>We agree. But all these things are beyond carnal comprehension. God dwelling in the flesh! How can anyone understand such a pronouncement unless quickened by the power of the Spirit?<br><br>The revealed word to Joseph Smith announces that endless torment does not last forever, and that eternal damnation is of limited duration. In spite of the plain meaning of words, the divine word is that eternal punishment and endless punishment do in fact have an end.<br><br>"For, behold, the mystery of godliness, how great is it," the Lord says, as he gives to these words a special scriptural definition. As he says, this is done so that the concepts involved "might work upon the hearts of the children of men, altogether for my name's glory" (D&amp;amp;C 19:6–12).<br><br>As it is with such a mystery as God dwelling in the flesh, or as eternal punishment having no reference to the duration, but rather to the kind of punishment, so it is with all else embraced within the designation the mystery of godliness.<br><br>The doctrine is what the doctrine is, and the concepts are what the concepts are. It is of no moment whatever that they spread confusion among uninspired worshippers at divers shrines, or among intellectuals whose interest in religion is purely academic and who rely on the power of the mind rather than the power of the Spirit for understanding.<br><br>Gospel truths are known and understood only by the power of the Spirit. Eternal life--which is to know God--is such an infinitely great reward that men must study, ponder, and pray, with all their hearts, to gain the needed knowledge.<br><br>The Lord gives his truths line upon line and precept upon precept to those who believe and obey. Saving truths come by revelation to prophets, not by reason to false priests or doctors of debate, dissension, and divisiveness.<br><br>Let us, then, consider the mystery of godliness from the Lord's standpoint, setting forth correct principles, which will enable all who are spiritually enlightened to keep themselves on the proper path.<br><br>Let us do so with courage and without fear, but in reverence and with an open mind. If we are contrite and receptive, if we truly desire truth, and if we are guided by the Spirit in our search, we shall come off triumphant. We shall embrace every true principle and shunt every false doctrine back into the enveloping darkness from whence it came.<br><h2><b>Search Deeper and Deeper</b></h2><br>As we walk the razor's edge--the razor that divides truth from near truths, which sometimes have a pleasing attraction--let us be mindful of these words of the Prophet Joseph Smith: "The Savior has the words of eternal life. Nothing else can profit us. . . . I advise all to go on to perfection, and search deeper and deeper into the mysteries of Godliness"<i>(Teachings,</i>p. 364).<br><br>Let us ponder these basic concepts:<br><br><b>1. God is the Supreme Being.</b>He is the only supreme and independent being in whom all fulness and perfection dwells. He is the Creator, Preserver, and Upholder of the universe and all that in it is. He is without beginning of days or end of life, and by him all things are. He is the object of all proper worship and from him all good gifts flow. He presides over and governs all things and therefore has no equal. That there is and can be only one supreme being is axiomatic. There can be three equal beings who possess the same character, perfections, and attributes, but there is and can be only one who is supreme, who is the head, and to whom all others are subject.<br><br><b>2. He is a holy man and has a body of flesh and bones.</b>It is written: "No unclean thing can dwell . . . in his presence; for, in the language of Adam, Man of Holiness is his name, and the name of his Only Begotten is the Son of Man, even Jesus Christ" (Moses 6:57). That is, he is Ahman, and the name of his Only Begotten is Son Ahman.<br><br>And as it was with Jesus, the Son, who came forth in the resurrection with a glorified, immortal, resurrected body of flesh and bones, so it was with his Father before him. Joseph Smith said: "God himself was once as we are now, and is an exalted man, and sits enthroned in yonder heavens!"<i>(Teachings,</i>p. 345). Truly, truly, it is written: "The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's" (D&amp;amp;C 130:22).<br><br><b>3. He is the Eternal Father, the Father of Spirits.</b>God lives in the family unit and is the Father of Spirits, of spirit men and spirit women, hosts of whom are now being born as mortal beings. He is, "Our Father which art in heaven" (Matthew 6:9). We are his children, and we are governed by his laws and are subject to his chastisement, all of which caused Paul to say: "We have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?" (Hebrews 12:9).<br><br><b>4. He is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent.</b>Let there be no mistake about this. God has all power; he is the Almighty. He knows all things, and there is nothing in all eternity, in universe upon universe, that he does not know. Joseph Smith so taught, and all our scriptures, ancient and modern, bear a concordant testimony. He is not a student god, and he is not progressing in knowledge or learning new truths. If he knows how to create and govern worlds without number, and all that on them is, what is there left for him to learn? Also, he is omnipresent, meaning that by the power of his spirit he is in all things, and through all things, and round about all things.<br><br><b>5. What is the nature of God's life?</b>The name of the kind of life that God lives is eternal life. One of his names, speaking in the noun sense, is Eternal, and he simply uses that name to describe the kind of life he lives. Eternal life consists of two things: (1) life in the family unit and (2) having the fulness of the Father, which is all power in heaven and on earth. It is because God has eternal life that he became the Father of Spirits as well as the creator and governor of all things.<br><br><b>6. Whence came the plan of salvation?</b>It is simply the laws and ordinances by obedience to which men may gain eternal life and thus become as God is and be gods in their own right. Joseph Smith said: "God himself, finding he was in the midst of spirits and glory, because he was more intelligent, saw proper to institute laws whereby the rest could have a privilege to advance like himself. . . . He has power to institute laws to instruct the weaker intelligences, that they may be exalted with himself, so that they might have one glory upon another, and all that knowledge, power, glory, and intelligence, which is requisite in order to save them in the world of spirits" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 354).<br><br><b>7. Who are Elohim and Jehovah?</b>They are the Father and the Son. The Everlasting Elohim is the Great God by whom all things are; the Eternal Jehovah is his Firstborn in the spirit and his Only Begotten in the flesh. Jehovah is thus our Elder Brother, and as such was subject to the same plan of salvation, the plan given of Elohim for the salvation of all his children.<br><br>While yet in the premortal existence, Jehovah advanced and progressed until he became like unto God. Under the direction of the Father he became the Creator of worlds without number, and thus was himself the Lord Omnipotent.<br><br><b>8. Christ was chosen in the premortal existence as the Savior and Redeemer.</b>After the Father had presented his plan of salvation to all his spirit children, after it had been taught so that all understood that what Elohim proposed would enable his spirit children to gain eternal life, after all the hosts of heaven had been taught what they must do in connection with their coming mortal probation--after all this the Father of us all called a Grand Council. We were all present to hear his voice and to accept or reject the proposal he then made.<br><br>In that council he said: "Whom shall I send to be my Son, to work out the infinite and eternal atonement, to put into full operation all of the terms and conditions of my plan to save my children." There were two volunteers--a conforming and obedient Jehovah and a rebellious and disobedient Lucifer.<br><br>The choice was made and the decree sent forth. The Father named his Beloved and Chosen One; he chose the Lord Jehovah who was the Creator of all things, and who was then the Lord Omnipotent. He would be the one born as the Lord Jesus Christ. And this Chosen One was then foreordained and acclaimed as the Lamb slain from the foundation of the earth.<br><br><b>9. Man was created and commanded to serve the Father.</b>It is written: "He created man, male and female, after his own image and in his own likeness, created he them; And gave unto them commandments that they should love and serve him, the only living and true God, and that he should be the only being whom they should worship" (D&amp;amp;C 20:18–19).<br><br>Please let these words of scripture sink into your heart and do not be confused about them. In order to gain salvation, we worship the Father and him only. He created us, he provided the plan of salvation, he called Christ to be the Savior and Redeemer, and he is the one that we and Christ shall be like if we are true and faithful in all things. We shall refer hereafter to the sense in which we worship Christ.<br><br><b>10. Man fell, became mortal, and entered a probationary estate.</b>Created in a paradisiacal state in which there was no disease nor sorrow nor death--a state of innocence in which he could have no joy for he knew no misery, in which he could do no good, for he knew no sin--man, in conformity with the divine purpose, fell.<br><br>Temporal and spiritual death entered the world. Man became mortal. For the first time he could procreate and provide bodies for the spirits yet in the premortal existence. Truly, "Adam fell that men might be" (2 Nephi 2:22–25). We entered a probationary estate in which we are tried and tested to see if we will do all things whatsoever the Lord our God shall command us.<br><br><b>11. The Father provided a Savior and Redeemer.</b>The eternal plan of salvation consists of the Creation, the Fall, and the Atonement. The Father having created man in his own image, and Adam having fallen that mortal man might enter his probationary estate, it but remained for the Father to provide a Savior and Redeemer. This he did in the person of his Only Begotten.<br><br>Thus Christ came into the world to ransom men from the temporal and spiritual death brought about by the fall of Adam. Thus all men are redeemed from the temporal death through the resurrection. All became immortal. "As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive" (1 Corinthians 15:22). And thus all men may be redeemed from spiritual death if they believe and obey, if they are true and faithful, if they keep the commandments.<br><br><b>12. Christ is the Mediator.</b>Man in his fallen state is forever lost unless he rises from the Fall and regains the spiritual life that once was his. He must return to that God from whose presence he departed when he left the paradisiacal confines of Eden. Christ's mission is to bring to pass this reunion. He mediates the cause of the children of men so they can once again be in harmony with their Maker.<br><br>"God our Saviour," Paul tells us, "is willing to have all men to be saved." In order to be saved, he says, they must "come unto the knowledge of the truth which is in Christ Jesus, who is the Only Begotten Son of God." He is the one who is "ordained to be a Mediator between God and man."<br><br>Then our ancient apostolic friend makes this great declaration: "For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; Who gave himself a ransom for all" (JST<i>,</i>1 Timothy 2:3–6).<br><br>Ponder this concept: There is one God, one Supreme Being, one above all who dwells in heaven. He appointed a man--Christ Jesus, Paul calls him--to be a mediator between the Father and his fallen children. And this mediator, though serving as a man when he atoned for the sins of the world, has now become as his Father and reigns with him in everlasting glory.<br><br><b>13. The gospel is the plan of reconciliation.</b>Through the mediation of Jesus Christ it is within the power of fallen man to be reconciled with the Father. Christ's ministry is one of reconciliation; as he is a mediator, so he is a reconciler. And we as his servants are appointed to labor in a like manner.<br><br>Paul tells us that God "hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation." This doctrine is, he continues, "that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them," on conditions of faith and repentance. And he "hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation," making us, thus, "ambassadors for Christ," and enabling us to say to all men: "We pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God" (2 Corinthians 5:18–20).<br><br><b>14. Christ is our advocate.</b>We have an advocate, eternal in the heavens, one who knows our infirmities, our sufferings, and our sorrows, because he too was subject to the flesh, and suffered beyond our comprehension while he dwelt as a man. Indeed, he was "a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief," and he bore "our griefs, and carried our sorrows" (Isaiah 53:3–4).<br><br>These are his words as he now pleads our cause in the courts above: "Father, behold the sufferings and death of him who did no sin, in whom thou wast well pleased; behold the blood of thy Son which was shed, the blood of him whom thou gavest that thyself might be glorified; Wherefore, Father, spare these my brethren that believe on my name, that they may come unto me and have everlasting life" (D&amp;amp;C 45:4–5).<br><br><b>15. Christ is the God of our Fathers.</b>He is the God of Adam, and Enoch, and all of the saints who were before the flood. He is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and of all the holy prophets. As Jacob the Nephite said,<br><br><i>We knew of Christ, and we had a hope of his glory many hundred years before his coming; and not only we ourselves had a hope of his glory, but also all the holy prophets which were before us.</i><br><br><i>Behold, they believed in Christ and worshiped the Father in his name, and also we worship the Father in his name.</i>[Jacob 4:4–5]<br><br>Thus all of the ancient saints--all those from Adam to Noah, and from Noah to Abraham, and from Abraham to Moses, and from Moses to the coming of Jesus in the flesh--all of the truly faithful ones of old had the gospel. They were baptized and received the gift of the Holy Ghost; they were endowed with power from on high; they received the blessings of celestial marriage. The gospel is everlasting, and all men in all ages are saved by obedience to the same laws and the same ordinances.<br><br><b>16. Christ is the Promised Messiah.</b>For 4,000 years--from Adam to John the son of Zacharias--all of the prophets foretold the coming of the Messiah, the Deliverer, the Holy One who would deliver his people, redeem the faithful, and ransom all men from death, hell, the devil, and endless torment. All of the ancient saints testified of a Christ who would come to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man, even as we testify of a Risen Lord who has taken captivity captive and opened the gates of heaven to all who believe and obey.<br><br><b>17. The mystery of the birth of our Lord.</b>To those with spiritual insight and understanding there is no mystery. The Lord Jehovah, the Firstborn spirit, Son of the Father, was born as the Lord Jesus. God was his Father and Mary was his mother. He was the Only Begotten in the flesh. From his Father, who is a holy man, he inherited the power of immortality, which is the power to live everlastingly; from his mother, a choice and chosen vessel of the lineage of David, he inherited the power of mortality, which is the power to die.<br><br>Thus, being dual in nature, he was able to lay down his life and to take it again. Thus he gave up the ghost at Golgotha, and three days later took up his partially embalmed and anointed body as it lay lifeless in an Arimathean's tomb.<br><br><b>18. Christ ministered among mortals.</b>Though our Blessed Lord came into the world to die upon the cross for the sins of the world, though that was the chief intent and purpose of his mortal ministry, though his assigned ministry was to atone for the sins of the world--yet, while he was here, he restored the fulness of the gospel to the earth and taught its doctrines through all Judea and Galilee and beyond.<br><br>But, be it remembered, the gospel he taught originated with God his Father. "My doctrine is not mine," he said, "but his that sent me. If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself" (John 7:16–17).<br><br><b>19. Christ worked out his own salvation.</b>This is something of which uninspired men have no comprehension. Truly, he was the Lord Omnipotent before the world was; truly, he was like unto the Father in the premortal life; truly, he was the Son of God here on earth--and yet, with it all, as with all the spirit children of the same Father, he too was subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Father's plan.<br><br>He also was born on earth to undergo a mortal probation, to die, to rise again in immortal glory, to be judged according to his works, and to receive his place of infinite glory in the eternal kingdom of his Everlasting Father. How well Paul said:<br><br><i>Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;</i><br><br><i>And being made perfect, he became the author</i>[that is, the cause]<i>of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.</i>[Hebrews 5: 8–9]<br><br><b>20. Christ worshipped the Father.</b>This also is something that is seemingly unknown in the sectarian world. Of course our Blessed Lord, the Lord Jesus himself, the one who is our Savior and Redeemer, of course he worshipped the Father. How else could he (not having received the fulness at the first, as John tells us) go from grace to grace until he received the fulness of the glory of the Father?<br><br>Why else would he say to Mary Magdalene as she bowed before him on the resurrection morning: "Go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God" (John 20:17)? Note it and note it well--Elohim is the God of Jehovah as truly and as fully as he is our God. And as Christ worshipped the Father, so must it be with us if we are to go where Christ is and be like him, according to the promises.<br><br><b>21. Christ--the Atoning One and the Crucified One.</b>That which happened in Gethsemane and at Golgotha constitutes a mystery we cannot comprehend. We do not know how a God could bear the sins of all men on conditions of repentance. We cannot fathom the agony involved when Jesus, suffering both body and spirit, sweat great drops of blood from every pore. We only know that it was part of the plan of the Father and that our Lord drank to the full the cup that was his.<br><br>In Gethsemane, perhaps for three hours or more, and then again during the final three hours on the cross of Calvary, in agony beyond comprehension or compare, Jesus worked out the infinite and eternal atonement. For our purposes it suffices to know that this ordeal, plus his rising in glorious immortality, has brought to pass the immortality of all men and made eternal life available to all the obedient.<br><br><b>22. Christ--the Resurrected One and the Ascended One.</b>As the sun crowns the day and banishes the darkness of the night, so the resurrection crowns the Atonement and forever abolishes the death that otherwise would have been eternal. Out of the agonies of the one came the glory of the other.<br><br>Christ our Lord rose in glorious immortality, the firstfruits of them that sleep, and then, ascending to his Father, he received all power in heaven and on earth. And in a way incomprehensible to us, the effects of his resurrection shall pass upon us all, and we too shall have power, if true and faithful in all things, to ascend to heights beyond the stars.<br><br>Now, if time and circumstances permitted, we might continue our presentation and add another score or a hundred headings to those so far named--all shedding light upon that which is mysterious to the carnal mind.<br><br>Perhaps you should continue the inquiry, resolving such mysteries as the following:<br><br>How the Holy Ghost can be a personage of spirit and yet convey his gifts to millions of mortals at one and the same time.<br><br>What eternal covenant was made relative to man--by God the First, and God the Second, and God the Third--before the foundations of the earth.<br><br>How and in what manner we worship Christ when the revealed word decrees that we should worship and pray to the Father and to him only and to none other.<br><br>How and in what manner the Lord Jesus both worships the Father and is an equal to him.<br><br>What is meant by the numerous scriptures that say Christ is the Father as well as the Son.<br><br>Why angels sometimes speak in the first person as though they were Christ, and why Christ himself often speaks in the first person as though he were the Father.<br><br>Why our great goal in life should be to gain the Spirit of the Lord as our companion, and what results will flow from such an attained eventuality.<br><br>And so on and so on and so on.<br><br>The scriptures are in our hands. The door to investigation and research and learning is never closed. We are all expected to learn the same truths, live the same laws, and open the same door to the same mysteries.<br><br><i>For thus saith the Lord--I, the Lord, am merciful and gracious unto those who fear me, and delight to honor those who serve me in righteousness and in truth unto the end.</i><br><br><i>Great shall be their reward and eternal shall be their glory.</i><br><br><i>And to them will I reveal all mysteries, yea, all the hidden mysteries of my kingdom from days of old, and for ages to come, will I make known unto them the good pleasure of my will concerning all things pertaining to my kingdom.</i><br><br><i>Yea, even the wonders of eternity shall they know, and things to come will I show them, even the things of many generations</i>.<br><br><i>And their wisdom shall be great, and their understanding reach to heaven; and before them the wisdom of the wise shall perish, and the understanding of the prudent shall come to naught.</i><br><br><i>For by my Spirit will I enlighten them, and by my power will I make known unto them the secrets of my will--yea, even those things which eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor yet entered into the heart of man.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 76:5–10]<br><br>Now this work in which we are engaged is true. And the doctrines which we proclaim are God's eternal truth. And as the Lord lives, they will endure in time and in eternity. He has placed us here in a mortal circumstance and commanded us to seek him and to strive to be like him. He has given us an abundant amount of revealed truth in the holy scriptures. They are before us; they are available to each of us on the same basis. The prophet said that God has not revealed anything to Joseph that he will not reveal to the Twelve and to the least and last Saint as soon as he is able to bear it.<br><br>My prayer is that we, the rising and young generation in whose hands the future and destiny of the Church lies for the decades and ages that are ahead before the second coming of the Son of Man, will take the challenge and search deeply and learn the mysteries of godliness and let them be the standard around which we rally and be the guide that directs our lives in all that we do. If this be our course, we will surely have peace and joy and happiness in this life, and be inheritors of eternal life in the world to come, which may God grant for all of us, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Bruce R.

<h1>: Things We Have Learned Together - Jeffrey and Patricia Holland</h1>
<br>
<br>
<b>Jeff:</b>Each time we have given an address to this student body, we have started off with a moment or two together, usually including a couple of jokes about my father-in-law. Then we have each presented individual messages. Today we are going to do something a little different--we are both going to stay up here because our message today is a shared one. What you see is what you get--the two of us--"The Pat and Jeff Show." Indeed, we have tentatively entitled our remarks "Some Things We Have Learned--Together" and we hope both the audience and the television camera can handle two of us at once.<br><br><b>Pat:</b>We are going to talk about some of the "before" and "after" of marriage--our marriage. But this will be slightly different from what might seem a traditional BYU sermonette on the subject. For one thing, this year we reach a milestone in our lives--we will have lived as long married to each other, twenty-two years, as we did before marriage. Surely that ought to justify some sort of sage advice from us.<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>Yes, I was told on that fateful day in 1963 that with marriage I had come to the end of my troubles. I just didn't realize which end they were speaking of.<br><br><b>Pat:</b>The last thing we want to do is sound self-righteous, so our first assurance is that our marriage is<i>not</i>perfect, and we have the scar tissue to prove it. To quote my father, the rocks in Jeff's head have not yet filled the holes in mine.<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>So forgive us for using the only marriage we know, imperfect as it is, but for some time now we have wanted to reflect back on the half of our lives spent together since we were students at BYU and to see what, if anything, it might mean to you as you look ahead twenty-two years from now.<br><br><b>Pat:</b>Before you get up and leave, let me again reassure you that this isn't going to be the usual BYU talk on matrimony, important as that is. For one thing, we are going to try to apply these little lessons we have learned to all of you--single or married. For another thing, we fear that too many of you, especially the<i>women</i>in our student body, are too anxious about the subject already. So please don't be anxious.<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>On the other hand, I know a few<i>men</i>around here who ought to be a little more anxious than they are.<br><br><b>Pat:</b>Well, you're the president. Do something about it!<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>Brethren, get anxious. Or, to be slightly more scriptural, get "anxiously engaged."<br><br><b>Pat:</b>For all of the rest of you out there, women and men, we really believe romance and marriage, if they are going to come, will come a lot more naturally if you worry about them a lot less. By the same token we also know that is easy to say and hard to do. It's hard because so much of our young life in the Church is measured on a precise time sequence. We are baptized at eight. At twelve the young men are ordained deacons and the young women enter Mutual. Then we date at sixteen, graduate from high school at eighteen, and go on missions at nineteen or twenty-one.<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>But then, suddenly, it is less and less structured, less and less certain. When do we marry? Surely in a Church manual somewhere there must be a specific year for that! Well, there<i>isn't.</i>Matters of marriage are much more personal than a prepublished celestial calendar would allow. And so our anxiety level leaps.<br><br><b>Pat:</b>With that acknowledgment we are aware that some of you will not marry during your years at BYU, nor perhaps during the years thereafter. By talking on this subject we do not intend to make it more painful for some than it already is, but rather to draw some observations from our own marriage that might be of value to all of you--younger, older, married, or single. We pray for the blessings of the Lord to help us share something of our brief, ordinary, and sometimes tumultuous life together.<i>Another</i>twenty-two years of working things out would let us give a<i>much</i>better talk.<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>With that long introduction I don't know whether this is our first piece of counsel or our last, but in any case, don't rush things needlessly and unnaturally. Nature has its rhythms and its harmonies. We would do well to fit ourselves as best we can<i>with</i>those cycles rather than frantically throwing ourselves against them. As suggested a moment ago, I know that for some of you "rushing things" is<i>not</i>the problem. For the group whose progress is being measured in glacial centimeters, forget this part of the message. But for the rest of you, be calm, be patient, be happy with the season you are in.<br><br><b>Pat:</b>As we look back on it now, twenty-two seems, if anything, pretty young to be getting married, though that was the right time for us. When it is right, it should be pursued, and for some that will be younger--or older--than others. But don't march to an arbitrary drummer who seems to be beating a frenzied cadence to the passing years.<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>Twenty-one--<br><br><b>Pat:</b>(Oh, dear, I'm facing ... )<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>Twenty-two--<br><br><b>Pat:</b>(Will I ever find him?)<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>Twenty-three--<br><br><b>Pat:</b>(Oh, woe is me, woe is me.)<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>Twenty-four--<br><br><b>Pat:</b>(Death, make me thine! O grave, receive me!)<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>Well, that's a little melodramatic, but not much.<br><br><b>Pat:</b>We know of a few--not many, but a few--who have panicked that she ...<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>or he ...<br><br><b>Pat:</b>has not yet hit that matrimonial target established at ten years of age,<i>or,</i>worse yet, one established by a well-meaning aunt whose greeting every Christmas seems to be, "Well, you've been at BYU a full semester now. Have you found Mr. Right?"<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>Or that solicitous uncle who says, "You've been home from your mission six weeks now. I guess wedding bells will be ringing soon, won't they?<i>They will, won't they?"</i><br><br><b>Pat:</b>Of course, we are not the best ones in the world to speak on that<i>particular</i>aspect inasmuch as we were engaged thirty days after Jeff got home from his mission.<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>Well, I had a solicitous uncle.<br><br><b>Pat:</b>But you also have to remember--and this is the point we hope to make here--that we knew each other well for two years before we started dating, dated another two years before Jeff's mission, and then wrote for those two years he was away. That's six years of friendship before we were engaged. Besides, when I first dated Jeff I couldn't stand him. (I just throw that in as reassurance to you women out there who are dating men you can't stand.)<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>I throw it in as reassurance to the men who can't be stood!<br><br><b>Pat:</b>Then, still not to be outdone in the waiting game, I left for New York the day after we were engaged, leaving Jeff to hammer away at school while I studied music and filled a stake mission three-fourths of a continent away from him. That added another ten months, so I think it's fair to say we didn't rush things.<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>Quite apart from the matter of school or missions or marriage or whatever, life ought to be enjoyed at every stage of our experience and should not be hurried and wrenched and truncated and torn to fit an unnatural schedule which you have predetermined but which may not be the Lord's personal plan for you at all. As we look back with you today, we realize we have probably rushed too many things and been too anxious and too urgent for too much of our life, and perhaps you are already guilty of the same thing. We probably all get caught thinking real life is still ahead of us, still a little farther down the road.<br><br><b>Pat:</b>Don't wait to live. Obviously, life for all of us began a long time ago--twenty-two years longer for us than for you--and the sand is falling through that hourglass as steadily as the sun rises and rivers run to the sea. Don't wait for life to gallop in and sweep you off your feet. It is a quieter, more pedestrian visitor than that. In a church which understands more about time and its relationship to eternity than any other, we of all people ought to savor every moment, ought to enjoy the time of preparation<i>before</i>marriage, filling it full of all the truly good things of life--one of the most valuable of which is a university education.<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>Before we leave this subject, let me add just one other related caution. In my professional and ecclesiastical life working with young adults--roughly the same second-half period of my life that corresponds to our marriage--I have regularly run into young men and women who are looking for that idealized partner who is some perfect amalgamation of virtues and characteristics seen in parents, loved ones, Church leaders, movie stars, sports heroes, political leaders, or any other wonderful men and women they may have known.<br><br><b>Pat:</b>Certainly it is important to have thought through those qualities and attributes which you most admire in others, and which you yourself ought to be acquiring. But remember that when young people have visited with Sister Camilla Kimball about how wonderful it must be to be married to a prophet, she has said, "Yes, it is wonderful to be married to a prophet, but I didn't marry a prophet. I just married a returned missionary." Consider this statement from President Kimball on such down-to-earth choices:<br><br><i>Two people coming from different backgrounds soon learn after the ceremony is performed that stark reality must be faced. There is no longer a life of fantasy or of make-believe; we must come out of the clouds and put our feet firmly on the earth....</i><br><br><i>One comes to realize very soon after the marriage that the spouse has weaknesses not previously revealed or discovered. The virtues which were constantly magnified during courtship now grow relatively smaller, and the weaknesses which seemed</i>so<i>small and insignificant during courtship now grow to sizable proportions....</i><br><br>...<i>yet real, lasting happiness is possible....</i>[and it] is within the reach of every couple, every person. "<i>Soul mates" are fiction and an illusion; and while every young man and young woman will</i>seek with all diligence and prayerfulness to find a mate with whom life can be most compatible and beautiful, yet it is certain that almost any good man and any good woman can have happiness and a successful marriage if both are willing to pay the price. [Spencer W. Kimball, "Marriage and Divorce,"<i>Speeches of the Year</i>(Provo, Utah: BYU Press, 1976), pp. 145–46; emphasis added]<br><br>On that note let us share with you a little "stark reality" of our own. Jeff and I have conversations from time to time which bring us down "out of the clouds," to use President Kimball's phrase.<br><br>Do you want to know what I have told him he does that irritates me the most? It is that he walks everywhere in a hurry--first five, then ten, then fifty feet in front of me. I have learned now to just call out and tell him when he gets where he's going to save me a place.<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>Well, as long as we are telling secrets, do you want to know what irritates me? It is that she is always late and that we are therefore always running to get somewhere, with me first five, then ten, then fifty feet in front of her.<br><br><b>Pat:</b>We have learned to laugh about that a little, and now compromise--I watch the time a bit better, he slows down a stride or two, and we actually touch fingertips about every other bounce.<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>But we don't have everything worked out yet--like room temperatures. I used to joke about LDS scripturalists who worried about the body temperature of translated beings. I don't joke anymore, because I now worry seriously about my wife's body temperature. She has an electric blanket on high for eleven months of the year. She suffers hypothermia at the Fourth of July picnic. She thaws out from about 2:00 to 3:30 on the afternoon of August 12th, then it's bundle-up time again.<br><br><b>Pat:</b>He ought to talk. He throws the window open every night as if he's Admiral Peary looking for the South Pole. But just let someone suggest a little winter morning's jogging and he sounds like a wounded Siberian sheepdog. Mr. Health here can't tie his shoelaces without taking oxygen.<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>As for different backgrounds, it's hard to think two kids from St. George could have different backgrounds--or even any background at all. But regarding financial matters, Pat came from a family in which her father was very careful with money (and therefore always had some to share generously) while I came from a family in which my dad grew up without any money but later spent it as generously as if he had. Both families were very happy, but when the two of us came together it was "Hail, Columbia..."<br><br><b>Pat:</b>"... and the devil take the hindmost." That introduces to us another of those "stark realities" of marriage. To quote Elder Marvin J. Ashton in an address he recently gave to the membership of the Church:<br><br><i>How important are money management and finances in marriage and family affairs? Tremendously. The American Bar Association recently indicated that</i>89<i>percent of all divorces could be traced to quarrels and accusations over money.</i>[Another study]<i>estimated that</i>75<i>percent of all divorces result from clashes over finances. Some professional counselors indicated that four out of</i>[every]<i>five families</i>[wrestle]<i>with serious money problems....</i><br><br>...<i>A prospective wife could well concern herself not with the amount her husband-to-be can earn in a month, but rather how will he manage the money that comes into his hands....</i><i>A prospective husband who is engaged to a sweetheart who has everything would do well to take yet another look and see if she has money management sense.</i>[Marvin J. Ashton, "One for the Money,"<i>Ensign,</i>July 1975, p. 72]<br><br>Controlling your financial circumstances is another one of those "marriage skills"--and we put that in quotation marks--that obviously matters to everyone and matters<i>long</i>before entering into marriage. It matters while you're here at the university and you should learn to use a budget right now--today--this moment. One of the great laws of heaven and earth is that your expenses need to be less than your income. You can reduce your anxiety and your pain and your early marital discord--indeed, you can reduce your<i>parents'</i>anxiety and pain and marital discord right now!--if you will learn to manage a budget.<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>As part of this general financial caution, we encourage, if necessary, plastic surgery for both husband and wife. This is a very painless operation and it may give you more self-esteem than a new nose job or a tummy tuck. Just cut up your credit cards. Unless you are prepared to use those cards under the<i>strictest</i>of conditions and restraints, you should not use them at all--at least not at 18 percent or 21 percent or 24 percent interest. No convenience known to modern man has so jeopardized the financial stability of a family--especially young struggling families--like the ubiquitous credit card. "Don't leave home without it?" That's precisely why he is leaving home--<br><br><b>Pat:</b>and why she is leaving him! May I paraphrase something President J. Reuben Clark said once in general conference:<br><br>[Debt]<i>never sleeps nor sickens nor dies; it never goes to the hospital; it works on Sundays and holidays; it never takes a vacation;</i>...<i>it is never laid off work .</i>. . ;<i>it buys no food; it wears no clothes; it is unhoused .</i>. . ;<i>it has neither weddings nor births nor deaths; it has no love, no sympathy; it is as hard and soulless as a granite cliff. Once in debt,</i>[it]<i>is your companion every minute of the day and night; you cannot shun it or slip away from it; you cannot dismiss it; ... and whenever you get in its way or cross its course or fail to meet its demands, it crushes you.</i>[J. Reuben Clark, Jr.,<i>CR,</i>Apr. 1938, p. 103]<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>Your religion should protect you against immorality and violence and any number of other family tragedies which strike at marriages throughout the land. And if you will let it, your religion will protect you against financial despair as well. Pay your tithes and offerings first. No greater financial protection can be offered you. Then simply budget what is left the rest of that month. Make do with what you have. Do without. Say no. Your head can be held high even if your clothing is not the most stylish nor your home the most regal. It can be held high for the simple reason that it is not bent or bowed with the relentless burden of debt.<br><br><b>Pat:</b>Well, that's more than we intended to say about money, but we remember when we were your age.<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>I remember last month.<br><br>This last topic is the most difficult of all, and probably the most important. I hope we can communicate our feelings about it. Much has been said to you during your dating years about the impropriety of intimacy before marriage. We have spoken on that here in this setting in earlier speeches-dev. It is a message we hope you continue to hear often and one which we hope you honor with the integrity expected of a Latter-day Saint man or woman. But in these concluding moments we wish to say something about intimacy<i>after</i>marriage, an intimacy that goes far beyond the physical relationship a married couple enjoys. Such an issue seems to us to be at the very heart of the true meaning of marriage.<br><br><b>Pat:</b>Marriage is the highest and holiest and most sacred of human relationships. And it is, because of that, the most intimate. When God brought Adam and Eve together before there was any death to separate them, he said, "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh" (Genesis 2:24). To reinforce the imagery of that unity, the scriptures indicate that God had figuratively taken a rib from Adam's side to make Eve, not from his front that she should lead him and not from his back that she should despise him, but from his side, under his arm, close to his heart. There, bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh, husband and wife were to be united in every way, side by side. They were to give themselves totally to each other, and to "cleave unto [each other] and none else" (D&amp;amp;C 42:22).<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>To give ourselves so totally to another person is the most trusting and perhaps the most fateful step we take in life. It seems such a risk and such an act of faith. None of us walking toward the altar would seem to have the confidence to reveal<i>everything</i>that we are--all our hopes, all our fears, all our dreams, all our weaknesses--to another person. Safety and good sense and this world's experience suggest that we hang back a little, that we not wear our heart on our sleeve where it can so easily be hurt by one who knows so much about us. We fear, as Zechariah prophesied of Christ, that we will be "wounded in the house of [our] friends" (Zechariah 13:6).<br><br>But no marriage is really worth the name, at least not in the sense that God expects us to be married, if we do not fully invest all that we have and all that we are in this other person who has been bound to us through the power of the holy priesthood. Only when we are willing totally to share life does God find us worthy to give life. Paul's analogy for this complete commitment was that of Christ and the Church. Could Christ, even in his most vulnerable moments in Gethsemane or Calvary, hold back? In spite of what hurt might be in it, could he fail to give all that he was and all that he had for the salvation of his bride, his church, his followers--those who would take upon them his name even as in a marriage vow?<br><br><b>Pat:</b>And by the same token, his church cannot be reluctant or apprehensive or doubtful in its commitment to him whose members we are. So, too, in a marriage. Christ and the Church, the groom and the bride, the man and the woman must insist on the most complete union. Every mortal marriage is to recreate the ideal marriage sought by Adam and Eve, by Jehovah and the children of Israel. With no hanging back, "cleaving unto none other," each fragile human spirit is left naked, as it were, in the custody of its marriage partner, even as our first parents were in that beautiful garden setting. Surely that is a risk. Certainly it is an act of faith. But the risk is central to the meaning of the marriage and the faith moves mountains and calms the turbulent sea.<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>It would be worth our time with you today if we could impress upon you the sacred obligation a husband and wife have to each other when the fragility and vulnerability and delicacy of the partner's life is placed in the other's keeping. Pat and I have lived together for twenty-two years, as she said earlier--roughly the time that each of us had lived alone prior to the wedding day. I may not know everything about her, but I know twenty-two years' worth, and she knows that much of me. I know her likes and dislikes, and she knows mine. I know her tastes and interests and hopes and dreams, and she knows mine. As our love has grown and our relationship matured, we have been increasingly open with each other about all of that for twenty-two years now, and the result is that I know much more clearly how to help her and I know exactly how to hurt her. I may not know all the buttons to push, but I know most of them. And surely God will hold me accountable for any pain I cause her by intentionally pushing the hurtful ones when she has been so trusting of me. To toy with such a sacred trust--her body, her spirit, and her eternal future--and exploit those for my gain, even if only emotional gain, should disqualify me to be her husband and ought to consign my miserable soul to hell. To be that selfish would mean that I am a legal, live-in roommate who shares her company, but I am not her husband in any Christian sense of that word. I have not been as Christ is to the Church. We would not be bone of one bone, and flesh of one flesh.<br><br><b>Pat:</b>God expects a marriage, not just a temple-sanctioned understanding or arrangement or live-in wage earner or housekeeper. Surely everyone within the sound of my voice understands the severe judgment that comes upon such casual commitments before marriage. Today I want you to know that I believe there is an even more severe judgment upon me<i>after</i>marriage if all I do is share Jeff's bed and his work and his money and, yes, even share his children. It is not marriage unless we literally share each other, the good times and the bad, the sickness and the health, the life and the death. It is not marriage unless I am there for him whenever he needs me.<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>You can't be a good wife or a good husband or a good roommate or a good Christian just when you "feel well." A student once walked into the office of Harvard Dean LeBaron Russell Briggs and said he hadn't done his assignment because he hadn't felt well. Looking the student piercingly in the eye, Dean Briggs said, "Mr. Smith, I think in time you may perhaps find that most of the work in the world is done by people who aren't feeling very well" (quoted by Vaughn J. Featherstone, "Self-Denial,"<i>New Era,</i>November 1977, p. 9). Of course, some days are going to be more difficult than others, but if you leave the escape hatch in the airplane open because you think even before takeoff you may want to bail out in<br><br>midflight, then I can promise you it's going to be a pretty chilly trip less than fifteen minutes after leaving the ground. Close the door, strap on those seat belts, and give it full throttle. That's the only way to make a marriage fly.<br><br><b>Pat:</b>Is it any wonder that we dress ourselves in white and go to the house of the Lord and kneel before God's administrators to pledge ourselves to each other with a confession of Christ's atonement? How else can we bring the strength of Christ to this union? How else can we bring his patience and his peace and his preparation? And above all, how else can we bring his permanence, his staying power? We must be bonded so tightly that<i>nothing</i>will separate us from the love of this man or this woman.<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>In that regard we have that most reassuring of all final promises;<i>that the power which binds us together in righteousness is greater than any force--any force--which might try to separate us.</i>That is the power of covenant theology and the power of priesthood ordinances. That is the power of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br><b>Pat:</b>Just one concluding experience which, although taken from our marriage, has application to you right now--young or old, married or single, new convert or longtime member. Twenty-two years ago (we're coming full circle to close on that number) Jeff and I, marriage certificate in hand, made our way to Brigham Young University. We put all we owned in a secondhand Chevrolet and headed for Provo. We were not uneasy. We were not frightened. We were terrified. We were little hayseeds from St. George, Utah, and here we were in Provo--at Brigham Young University, where the world was to be our campus.<br><br>The housing people were very helpful in providing lists of apartments. The registration staff helped straighten out some transfer credits. The folks in the employment center suggested where we might work. We pieced together some furniture and found some friends. Then we splurged, left our new $45-a-month, two-room-and-a-shower apartment to have an evening meal in the Wilkinson Center cafeteria. We were impressed and exhilarated and still terrified. We knew we were on the greatest of all possible campuses.<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>I remember on one of those beautiful summer evenings walking up from our apartment on Third North and First East to the brow of the hill where the Maeser Building so majestically stands. Pat and I were arm in arm and very much in love, but school had not started and there seemed to be so very much at stake. We were nameless, faceless, meaningless little undergraduates seeking our place in the sun. And we were newly married, each trusting our future so totally to the other, yet hardly aware of that at the time. I remember standing about halfway between the Maeser Building and the President's Home and being suddenly overwhelmed with the challenge I felt--new family, new life, new education, no money and no confidence. I remember turning to Pat and holding her in the beauty of that August evening and fighting back the tears. I asked, "Do you think we can do it? Do you think we can compete with all these people in all these buildings who know so much more than we do and are so able? Do you think we've made a mistake?" Then I said, "Do you think we should withdraw and go home?"<br><br>As a brief tribute to her in what has been a very personal message anyway, I guess that was the first time I saw what I would see again and again and again in her--the love, the confidence, the staying power, the reassurance, the careful handling of my fears, and the sensitive nurturing of my faith, especially faith in myself. She (who must have been terrified herself, especially now, linked to me for life) nevertheless set aside her own doubts, slammed shut the hatch on the airplane and grabbed me by the safety belt. Of course we can do it," she said. "Of course we're not going home." Then, standing there, almost literally in the evening shadows of a home we would much later, for a time, call our own, she gently reminded me that surely others were feeling the same thing, that what we had in our hearts was enough to get us through, that our Father in Heaven would be helping.<br><br><b>Pat:</b>If you stand on the south patio of the President's Home you can see the exact spot two vulnerable, frightened, newly married BYU students stood twenty-two years ago, fighting back the tears and facing the future with all the faith they could summon.<br><br>Some nights we stand and look out on that spot--usually nights when things have been a little challenging--and we remember those very special days.<br><br>Please don't feel you are the only ones who have ever been fearful or vulnerable or alone--before marriage or after. Everyone has, and from time to time perhaps everyone will yet be.<br><br>Help each other. You don't have to be married to do that. Just be a friend, be a BYU student and all that that means. Be a Latter-day Saint. And if you are married, no greater blessings can come to your union than some of the troubles and challenges you'll face if you'll rev up your motor and bear straight ahead through lightning and thunder and turbulence and all.<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>Paraphrasing James Thurber in one of the best and simplest definitions of love ever given, "Love is what you go through together" ("Thurber,"<i>Life,</i>March 14, 1960, p. 108). That counts not only for husbands and wives but also parents and children, brothers and sisters, roommates and friends, missionary companions, and every other human relationship worth enjoying.<br><br>Love, like individuals, is tested by the flame of adversity. If we are faithful and determined it will temper and refine us, but it will not consume us. Enjoy what you now have. Be a disciple of Christ. Live worthy of marriage even if it doesn't come soon. And cherish it with all your heart when it does. We say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Jeffrey R.

<h1>e You to Declare? - Ardeth G. Kapp - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I recall vividly my first experience on this campus as a student many years ago. More recently, I was a faculty member in the College of Education, then served for a time in the area of Student Life. Today I return not as a student or as a faculty member, but rather as one anxious to open my heart and be allowed the sacred privilege of touching yours. I want to communicate soul to soul about a few things I have learned since those early years at BYU--things that<i>really</i>matter (and I have come to know there aren't a lot).<br><h2><b>Heading Toward the Border Crossing</b></h2><br>Come with me then, if you will, back to that last day of finals. The semester had ended (it was a quarter in those days) and I, with others, piled into a friend's old car. There were always more people than comfort would allow, but what we lost in comfort we saved in cost. With tuna sandwiches or whatever was left in the cupboard, we headed north. We were going home--to Canada.<br><br>At the border crossing, before the eyes of the customs officials, we were required to open our suitcases. And there was the grey-white laundry that you hoped your mom could remedy because of your weekly decisions to mix whites and coloreds and have a full batch. (That way you could save a quarter.) The customs officer stirred around as he routinely asked, "What have you to declare?" There was never much to declare--just our name, our destination, and our present place of residence. It is this brief moment at the border crossing, responding to the customs official's inquiry, "What have you to declare?" about which I wish to share some ponderings with you--ponderings and insights I have gathered over the years.<br><br>Wise travelers usually make a list of the valuables they are carrying to facilitate the passage through customs and expedite their arrival home. I refer now, of course, not to a trip to Canada or Mexico, not even to Germany or Italy, but rather to our ultimate journey, yours and mine--our journey to our eternal home, and the border crossing--and how we will each respond to the question "What have you to declare?"<br><br>As I anticipate that great moment, I believe the list we will each be required to present will not be written with ink but, as Paul described, "with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-cor/3.3?lang=eng#p2">2 Corinthians 3:3</a>). I believe it will be the evidence of our love for each other that will qualify us for passage. And the customs official, who will that be? Nephi tells us what we might expect there.<br><br><i>Behold, the way for man is narrow, but it lieth in a straight course before him, and the keeper of the gate is the Holy One of Israel; and he employeth no servant there; and there is none other way save it be by the gate; for he cannot be deceived, for the Lord God is his name.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.41?lang=eng#p40">2 Nephi 9:41</a>]<br><br>As I, in my times of quiet meditation, consider the ecstasy and joy of any experience we have had in this life, I believe it will be paled by what we will experience in that moment when we give an accounting to the Holy One of Israel, a silent declaration of accountability that will speak loudly of how we exercised our agency, of the choices we made, and, finally, of the values and principles we claimed as our very own to protect us and direct us over the treacherous narrow passages on our journey.<br><h2><b>Returning Home Safely</b></h2><br>I know something about the risk of traveling over icy, wintry roads when travel warnings are posted and the danger of blizzards and cold temperatures threaten our safety and sometimes delay our progress while loved ones--Mom and Dad, brothers and sisters, special friends--take turns standing watch at the kitchen window at least one hour before our expected arrival. I knew in those days that family prayers had been fervently offered in our behalf that we might return home safely. Can you, in the quiet of your thoughts, sense that moment of greeting, even if you haven't had such an experience?<br><br>Contrast to that the tragedy if the highway patrol had to report to anxious loved ones that the mountain pass and highway were steep and slick, that you must not have read the warning signs, or that you were sleepy and not alert enough to respond to the dangers, that you had missed a turn--and no one survived. Think of those loved ones at the window.<br><br>With these two contrasted homecomings before us, I want to share with you what I believe the joy will be as we approach our heavenly home. But first let us consider what road signs we are following to secure such a homecoming and, specifically, our safe travel.<br><br>Would you knock on the door of your own soul and inquire within concerning the markers, road signs, or values that you declare publicly and privately--the ones<i>you</i>have determined to follow? If we only use external markers (like other people's values or rules and regulations or policies--yes, even BYU standards), if we use only external signals and signs to determine our course, what will happen on a stormy night when the clouds and fog obscure the signals and we are alone in the dark? It isn't a committee or an institution or a crew that determines our course.<br><br>A writer tells about attending a dance in a country where there had been a revolution. The lights were turned out during the playing of the national anthem. As one leader explained, "This is a social affair, and we don't want to see who won't stand up." We must have our<i>own</i>clearly defined values burning brightly within; only then do we have an inner court to which we can appeal for judgment of our performance--judgment of<i>our</i>performance, not someone else's.<br><br>Orson Whitney, writing about a definition for sin, has helped me understand the need for guidance from our own inner lighthouse. He says,<br><br><i>Sin is the transgression of divine law, as made known through the conscience or by revelation. A man sins when be violates his conscience, going contrary to light and knowledge--not the light and knowledge that has come to his neighbor, but that which has come to himself. He sins when he does the opposite of what he knows to be right.</i>[Orson Whitney, quoted by Bruce R. McConkie,<i>Mormon Doctrine</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1966), p. 735]<br><h2><b>Making Good Choices</b></h2><br>I find myself reaching and stretching when I learn of others who navigate so very well in troubled waters. Even more heroic is the conduct of those who make choices in waters which appear to be calm and of little concern to others. Let me explain what I mean with this account told by a young journalist in his own words.<br><br><i>I was . . . driving to a scene I didn't want to see. A man . . . had accidentally backed his pickup truck over his baby granddaughter in the driveway of the family home. It was a fatality.</i><br><br><i>As I parked. . . I saw a stocky, white-haired man in cotton work clothes standing near a pickup. Cameras were trained on him, and reporters were sticking microphones in his face. Looking totally bewildered, he was trying to answer their questions. Mostly he was only moving his lips, blinking and choking up.</i><br><br><i>. . . I can still see in my mind's eye that devastated old man looking down at the place in the driveway where the child had been. Beside the house was a freshly spaded flower bed, and nearby a pile of dark, rich earth.</i><br><br><i>"I was just backing up there to spread that good dirt," he said to me, though I had not asked him anything. "I didn't even know she was outdoors." He stretched his hand toward the flower bed, then let it flop to his side.</i><br><br><i>. . . I went into the house to find someone who could provide a recent photo of the toddler. A few minutes later, with all the details in my notebook and a . . . studio portrait of the . . . child. . . in my. . . pocket, I went toward the kitchen where the police had said the body was.</i><br><br><i>. . . Entering the kitchen, I came upon this scene:</i><br><br><i>On a Formica-topped table, backlighted by a frilly curtained window, lay the tiny body, wrapped in a clean white sheet. Somehow the grandfather had managed to stay away from the crowd. He was sitting on a chair beside the table in profile to me and unaware of my presence, looking uncomprehendingly at the swaddled corpse.</i><br><br><i>The house was very quiet. A clock ticked. As I watched, the grandfather slowly leaned forward, curved his arms like parentheses around the head and feet of the little form, then pressed his face to the shroud and remained motionless.</i><br><br><i>In that hushed moment I recognized the makings of a prize-winning news photograph. I appraised the light, adjusted the lens setting and distance, locked a bulb in the flashgun, raised the camera and composed the scene in the viewfinder.</i><br><br><i>Every element of the picture was perfect: the grandfather in his plain work clothes, his white hair backlighted by sunshine, the child's form wrapped in the sheet, the atmosphere of the simple home. . . . Outside, the police could be seen inspecting the . . . pickup while the child's mother and father leaned in each other's arms.</i><br><br><i>I don't know how many seconds I stood there unable to snap that shutter. I was keenly aware of the powerful story-telling value that photo would have, and my professional conscience told me to take it. Yet I couldn't make my hand fire that flashbulb and intrude on the poor man's island of grief.</i><br><br><i>At length I lowered the camera and crept away shaken with doubt about my suitability for the journalistic profession. Of course I never told the city editor or any fellow reporters about that missed opportunity for a perfect news picture.</i><br><br><i>Every day, on the newscasts and in the papers, we see pictures of people in extreme conditions of grief and despair. Human suffering has become a spectator sport. And sometimes, as I'm watching news film, I remember that day.</i><br><br><i>I still feel right about what I did.</i>[James Alexander Thom, "The Perfect Picture,"<i>Readers Digest,</i>Aug. 1976, p. 113–14]<br><br>As we look back to yesterday, last week, and last year, the question is "Do we feel right about what we did?" As you and I travel the treacherous way of mortal life, we kick up dust in our daily living. We make mistakes, but in quiet moments of meditation when the dust settles and we examine our thoughts and actions to carefully and honestly determine what it is we have to declare, all of us are required to make continuous "inflight correction."<br><br>I like what C. S. Lewis has to say about that process. He says, "A wrong sum can be put right: but only by going back till you find the error and working it afresh from that point" (C. S. Lewis,<i>The Great Divorce</i>[New York: Macmillan Company, 1948], p. 6). And who determines if it is an error? The regulations and policy officers? Yes, if they must, but hopefully not. To them it may not even be seen as an error. But that may not excuse you in your own mind. Let me tell you about this old wallet that was returned to me by a BYU student after nine years.<br><h2><b>Answering the Hard Questions</b></h2><br>As a student at BYU years ago, I had used the telephone in the Joseph Smith Building and had carelessly left my wallet in the booth. After returning to the lost and found department regularly for several days, I finally gave up my desperate hope of ever getting my wallet and the much needed money back. Nine years later, on a snowy afternoon, the mailman delivered a letter. It began, "To Whom It May Concern." The letter stated that I was involved in some unfinished business at BYU. I wondered what unfinished business I needed to set in order. I found the name of the person who had signed the letter in the Salt Lake telephone directory. I dialed the number. I identified myself. The author of the letter began unfolding her story. As the words spilled out, I learned that this young woman was now a wife and mother, but earlier she had been in nurse's training at BYU. She had worked and put herself through school, but she needed an additional ten dollars for tuition, so she had turned to her boyfriend for help. She had promised to return the loan by the following Friday. When Friday arrived, in spite of her earnest prayers, she was still short ten dollars.<br><br>Seemingly without reason she had walked into the telephone booth and found an old worn wallet. She held her breath as she opened it to find a single ten dollar bill. Then the question: Was this indeed an answer to her prayer? She had learned that Satan knows when we are being tested and when we might weaken under pressure. She told of paying her boyfriend, whom she later married, graduating in nursing, and now raising a beautiful family.<br><br>She then poured out her heart as she told of her suffering for what she acknowledged as sin--sin because she had known better. For nine years, through many moves, the old burden had lain deeply tucked away in her top dresser drawer. It seemed impossible for her to throw away the wallet, though she considered it many times. There is no way you can throw away a wrong, and yet, there was no way, as far as she knew, to return the wallet--there was no identification.<br><br>One day while she was straightening the drawer, the old wallet surfaced again. This time she felt she must get rid of it, but only the right way. She thoughtfully opened the old wallet once again, and while examining it this time her fingers uncovered a small orange card tucked away in a tiny compartment not previously noticed. The card gave the address of the Calgary Clinic in Alberta, Canada, where the medical exam for the student's visa had been given. With a prayer in her heart she took a chance and sent the letter "to whom it may concern" to the Calgary Clinic to be forwarded if possible. Contact had been made, but the wallet was yet to be returned. During the telephone conversation she indicated the wallet would be mailed that very day. I asked her if she would consider delivering the wallet in person. She seemed a little embarrassed at the thought until I assured her it would be an honor and a privilege to meet a person possessing such honesty of character. She agreed that she would deliver it. At the appointed hour we met in my office. As I approached, she smiled nervously and then stood up. As though she had rehearsed this experience in her mind a hundred times, she reached out her steady hand, looked me squarely in the eye, and handed me the wallet as she whispered, "Will you please forgive me? I want to be honest." Words could not come. I could only reach for her hand and nod affirmatively.<br><br>As I frequently finger this old wallet that now lies in my top drawer, I ask myself "How honest do<i>you</i>want to be?" I've learned you must spend a little time walking around inside yourself to answer the hard questions in life.<br><br>In the novel<i>The Chosen,</i>by Chaim Potok, the Jewish father cries out to the master of the universe as he addresses him in prayer in behalf of his son who has a brilliant and capable mind. He says, "A mind like this I need for a son? A<i>heart</i>I need for a son, a<i>soul</i>I need for a son,<i>compassion</i>I want from my son, righteousness, mercy, strength to suffer and carry pain,<i>that</i>I want from my son, not a mind without a soul!" His son, speaking of his father, says, "He taught me to look into myself, to find my own strength, to walk around inside myself in company with my soul" (Chaim Potok,<i>The Chosen</i>[New York: Fawcett Crest Books, 1967], p. 265).<br><br>When you walk around inside yourself and find your own strength and live in company with your own soul, can you answer the questions the way you would like to? Would you have snapped the shutter of the camera in that private moment? And what about the wallet? When we get a wrong sum can we put it right? In a public setting, would there ever be a chance that you would succumb to the pressures of power or prestige or position or popularity? Might you one day have to report to a judge, as did Jeb McGruder, who was sentenced to ten years in federal prison for his part in Watergate? He spoke to Judge Sirrica, saying, "My ambition obscured my judgment. Somewhere between my ambition and my ideals, I lost my ethical compass" ("Confession of Jeb McGruder,"<i>Salt Lake Tribune,</i>22 May 1974).<br><h2><b>The Signals That Would Save Us</b></h2><br>Our values, our road signs that keep us on course and on schedule, are not to be tucked away in a drawer for safekeeping but carried daily, used continuously, tested against our performance regularly, and literally worn out as a constant measuring device that keeps us accountable. The powers and plans of Satan are cunning and subtle and very real. You are not unfamiliar with the pirates that would attempt to board your ship almost daily, who would rob you of your treasures, your peace of mind, your self-discipline, your clear conscience, your commitment, your integrity, your morality, even your eternal destiny if possible, and leave you shipwrecked, washed up on shore. I believe the most destructive threats of our day are not nuclear war, not famine, not economic disaster, but rather the despair, the discouragement, the despondency, the defeat caused by the discrepancy between what we believe to be right and how we live our lives. We are on a stormy sea. These are threatening times and we may be ignoring or even cutting ourselves loose from the very signals that would save us.<br><br>I'd like to tell you about the time I and other family members crossed that Canadian-U.S. border with our Dad and Mom on our way back home, knowing that for Dad it would be the last time. As we cleared customs, Dad raised up from his sick bed in the back of the car and commented, "This prairie has never looked so beautiful. It's at its very best for my last inspection."<br><br>During our brief stay in our old hometown, we sauntered, haltingly, down the gravel road past the tall cottonwood trees where the old school had been. Dad took the lead. "It was the old bell," he said, and we all looked in the same direction, seeing it clearly in our mind's eye. "The school bell kept us in line." "There were two bells," he went on, "a fifteen-minute bell would ring six times, giving ample warning before the final five-minute bell sounded a simple ding dong--and you'd better be there." His weakened voice increased in intensity as he added, "It's important to listen for the bell."<br><br>As we mused together in silence for a time, I pondered the possibility of my own inner bell being silenced, if only for a moment--just a rest break, maybe. As if reading my thoughts, Dad lay back by the soft, grassy ditch where we had stopped and began with a familiar phrase we had all learned to love. "I remember the story in the old fourth-grade reader," he said. He began his story.<br><br>"There was an old and very large Inchcape Rock. It got its name from being located just one inch below the water's surface where it couldn't be seen, and it lay dangerously in the path of the mariners returning from sea. Many seamen had lost their ships and their lives because of the rock, especially in times of storm. There was an abbot in the small seashore town of Aberbrothok who devised a solution to this life-threatening hazard. With great care and in the face of considerable danger, the abbot fastened a buoy with a large bell on it to the Inchcape Rock. From then on the bell rang continuously and faithfully with the motion of the waves of the sea. Ralph, the Rover, was a bit of pirate, and he disliked the praises the abbot received from the mariners whose lives he spared. So one day, Ralph, the Rover, cut the bell from the Inchcape Rock."<br><br><i>Down sank the Bell with a gurgling sound; The bubbles rose, and burst around.</i><br><i>Quoth Sir Ralph, "The next who comes to the Rock,</i><br><i>Won't bless the Abbot of Aberbrothok."</i><br><i>Sir Ralph, the Rover, sailed away,</i><br><i>He scoured the seas for many a day.</i><br><br>"On his way back it was night and the sea was high and he thought the moon would be up. In the darkness he said, with great anxiety, but only to himself, 'I wish I could hear the bell of the Inchcape Rock,' " and the rhyme continued:<br><br><i>Sir Ralph, the Rover, tore his hair;</i><br><i>He cursed himself in his despair.</i><br><i>The waves rush in on every side;</i><br><i>The ship is sinking beneath the tide.</i>["The Inchcape Rock," Robert Southey]<br><br>Dad's stories always stood without any editorializing--left for me to figure out the message. I am not sure how I felt then, but in years since I have come to feel that rather than wishing to silence the bell within, I feel myself strain a little that I might hear it more clearly.<br><h2><b>Make Ready for the Final Crossing</b></h2><br>I hope we will always have a quiet longing for our heavenly home that keeps us always on course and on schedule with an anxiousness at the proper time to arrive at customs, eager to give an accounting. After our trip to Canada, Dad talked about going home on that final journey, and we talked together of the border crossing. His body now weighed less than 100 pounds, and his mortal journey was coming to a close. Dad talked about the sweetness and sacredness of these times and spoke of the nearness of the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, the gatekeeper. Life had presented ample and enough struggles, and he had used them to prove himself worthy and to cleanse his soul. And he was ready for the border crossing.<br><br>That last day, Dad spoke of Addison, his younger brother who had gone before him. I wondered if his brother, and maybe his mother and father, were standing at the kitchen window an hour before his expected arrival, anxious for his safe return home.<br><br>By midafternoon I had decided to sit with Dad. It seemed his eyes were open, yet he wasn't seeing me. I took his hand in mine, a hand that had spanked me and blessed me and caressed me throughout my life. "Dad," I whispered. He didn't respond. "If you know I'm here, please squeeze my hand." I wasn't sure if there was a squeeze, but it didn't seem like it. I bent over and put my cheek next to his very bony cheek with my hand on the other side of his face. I waited just a second, then straightened up. He looked at me just a moment, and in his eyes I saw complete peace. Joy, trust, confidence, and anticipation all mingled together in that look. He was ready for the border crossing and the gatekeeper, the Holy One of Israel. A tear escaped the corner of his eye. I pressed my cheek to his again. There are things we cannot find words or even sounds to express, but in that moment I had some sense of what that final crossing might be and the ecstasy that we'll never fully understand in this life.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, we will arrive at a border crossing and have an opportunity to make a declaration. We will remember then that we were free according to the flesh "to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.27?lang=eng#p26">2 Nephi 2:27</a>). The choices we make each day of our lives will make us what we are at that time. When we open our luggage on our final journey and make our declaration, will we be carrying grey-white laundry as evidence of the unwise choices we have made along the way? There will be for each one of us many unwise choices, but when we do our part, a cleansing can take place and we will not be ashamed, but we will be so very, very grateful.<br><br>Alma's teaching explains it for us.<br><br><i>For there can no man be saved except his garments are washed white; yea, his garments must be purified until they are cleansed from all stain, through the blood of him of whom it has been spoken by our fathers, who should come to redeem his people from their sins.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.21?lang=eng#p20">Alma 5:21</a>]<br><br>We are his children, you and I--the very ones for whom he gave his life. God is our father, and he loves us very much. He wants us to come home, to his home--our home after the completion of our time here. I know he guides us and comforts us and forgives us, that he hears our knock and waits at the gate for our return. And to the question "What have you to declare?" the answer will be written in the fleshy table of our heart, our journey at a glance. May we stand in confidence as evidence of our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, daily repentant, living true to the ordinances and covenants which qualify us for the companionship of the Holy Ghost and prepare us to stand as a witness of Christ at all times.<br><br>I bear you my solemn witness from years past, but now more surely than ever before in my life, perhaps because there has been an increased urgency and diligence in knocking and listening: I know he is near and hears and speaks to our minds, and we can know that with a sure conviction that cannot be denied. To this I bear my testimony and witness in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Ardeth G.

<h1>eableThings of the Kingdom - Dean L.. Larsen - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In a revelation to Joseph Smith, the Lord gave this simple description of the plan of life and salvation:<br><br><i>And this is my gospel--repentance and baptism by water and then cometh the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost, . . . which showeth all things, and teacheth the peaceable things of the kingdom.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 39:6]<br><br>It is apparent from this statement that those who follow the principles of the gospel should be able to experience the "peaceable things." Yet in this stressful period in which we live, we frequently encounter people who seem to be doing the best they know how to avoid the evils of the world, who desire very much to be good, but who suffer from unhappiness, frustration, and confusion. It is one of the paradoxes of our time.<br><br>Tonight I would like to share with you some thoughts and suggestions about how we might better enjoy the "peaceable things of the kingdom" and free ourselves from the despondency and hopelessness that sometimes seem to beset so many.<br><br>All of us feel the urgency to perfect ourselves--to learn, to grow, to achieve, to produce. Some of these pressures can be constructive and helpful if they are not allowed to become overwhelming, especially if they are generated by our own initiative.<br><h2><b>Learn Patience</b></h2><br>One of the first important lessons of survival in this stressful time is to learn patience. Perfection is not achieved in one spasmodic burst of effort. As we move along the path of progress, we must find moments of enjoyment and refreshment along the way.<br><br>Orin L. Crain had this need in mind when he penned the following lines:<br><br><i>Slow me down, Lord!</i><br><i>Ease the pounding of my heart</i><br><i>By the quieting of my mind.</i><br><i>Steady my hurried pace</i><br><i>With a vision of eternal reach of time.</i><br><i>Give me,</i><br><i>Amidst the confusion of my day,</i><br><i>The calmness of the everlasting hills.</i><br><i>Break the tensions of my nerves</i><br><i>With the soothing music of the singing streams That live in my memory.</i><br><i>Help me to know</i><br><i>The magical restoring power of sleep.</i><br><i>Teach me the art</i><br><i>Of taking minute vacations of slowing down<br><i>to look at a flower;<br><i>to chat with an old friend or make a new one;<br><i>to pet a stray dog;<br><i>to watch a spider build a web;<br><i>to smile at a child;<br><i>or to read a few lines from a good book.</i><br><i>Remind me each day</i><br><i>That the race is not always to the swift;</i><br><i>That there is more to life than increasing its speed.</i><br><i>Let me look upward</i><br><i>Into the branches of the towering oak</i><br><i>And know that it grew great and strong</i><br><i>Because it grew slowly and well.</i><br><i>Slow me down, Lord,</i><br><i>And inspire me to send my roots deep</i><br><i>Into the soil of life&#39;s enduring values</i><br><i>That I may grow toward the stars</i><br><i>Of my greater destiny.</i></i></i></i></i></i></i><br>[Reprinted in the<i>Ogden Standard Examiner</i>by Abigail Van Buren]<br><br>Such interludes as Mr. Crain recommends help us to recognize the "peaceable things" and to rejuvenate our energies and commitment for a renewed effort.<br><br>On one occasion Joseph Smith made the following declaration:<br><br><i>When you climb up a ladder you must begin at the bottom, and ascend step by step, until you arrive at the top; and so it is with the principles of the gospel--you must begin with the first, and go on until you learn all the principles of exaltation. But it will be a great while after you have passed through the veil before you will have learned them. It is not all to be comprehended in this world; it will be a great work to learn our salvation and exaltation even beyond the grave.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 348]<br><br>Jacob&#39;s citation of the Zenos allegory in the Book of Mormon makes much the same expression:<br><br><i>Ye, shall clear away the branches which bring forth bitter fruit, according to the strength of the good and the size thereof. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . wherefore ye shall clear away the bad according as the good shall grow, . . . until the</i><br><br><i>good shall overcome the bad.</i>[Jacob 5:65–66]<br><br>Some of us create such a complexity of expectations for ourselves that it is difficult to cope with the magnitude of them. Sometimes we establish so many particulars by which to evaluate and rate ourselves that it becomes difficult to feel successful and worthy to any degree at any time. We can drive ourselves unmercifully toward perfection on such a broad plane. When this compulsion is intensified by sources outside ourselves, the problem is compounded. Confronting these demands can bring mental and emotional despair.<br><br>Everyone needs to feel successful and worthy in some ways at least part of the time. The recognition of our frailties need not propel us to try to achieve perfection in one dramatic commitment of effort. The best progress sometimes comes when we are not under intense duress. Overzealousness is at least as much to be feared as apathy. Trying to measure up to too many particular expectations without some sense of self-tolerance can cause spiritual and emotional "burn-out."<br><br>In order to avoid the effects of too many external and internal pressures, it is not necessary nor wise to withdraw from all of life&#39;s challenges. This would only compound our difficulties. To enjoy the "peaceable things of the kingdom," we must find warm acceptance, love, and understanding from those who have the most direct influence on our lives.<br><br>It is helpful to remember the Savior&#39;s parable of "counting the cost" (Luke 14:28) before we launch into any enterprise. When we simultaneously branch out into too many channels, we may not have the strength or the resources to sustain the effort and frustration will result.<br><br>Having patience requires that we maintain a proper balance in our lives. Bryant S. Hinckley had this in mind when he said,<br><br><i>If we are over enthusiastic, our enthusiasm may become fanaticism. If we are strongly emotional, our emotion may lead to hysterics. If we are excessively imaginative . . . we may become visionary and flighty. . . . If we have a superabundance of courage, it may manifest itself in recklessness. . . . If we are super-sympathetic, our sympathy can become a weakness and run into sentimentalism. If we are original, our originality may become an eccentricity. Piety may become sanctimoniousness. And so every virtue may become a vice--every grace a defect. It is the fine balance of these virtues that makes the strong man.</i>[Bryant S. Hinckley,<i>A Study of the Character and Teachings of Jesus of Nazareth: A Course of Study for the Adult Members of the Aaronic Priesthood</i>(Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1950), pp. 169–70]<br><h2><b>Accept Yourself</b></h2><br>Before concluding my comments on the importance of learning patience, it is important to say something about the need for developing an appropriate degree of self-tolerance. While we cannot allow ourselves to become slothful and lackadaisical in our efforts toward self-improvement, we cannot afford to lose all sense of patience and charity toward ourselves when we occasionally come short of perfection.<br><br>We are more than mechanical units. Our personalities are a process of becoming, they are growing--an inner flowering. This development does not occur in one day. We are like all others in some respects, but in some respects each of us is unique. There has never been anyone exactly like you. There never will be. Never will anyone possess your special individuality and your particular possibilities.<br><br>In light of these facts, one of the least profitable things we can do is to compare ourselves with others. Generally, when we make such comparisons, we match our weaknesses against the most prominent talents and virtues of those we admire or envy. No one comes out well in this useless game. Its effects can be devastating.<br><br>It is necessary to accept ourselves with a self-love that is neither vain nor selfish, but rather one that is tolerant and understanding, one that we might feel toward an old friend. Your friend may have his flaws. He has limitations, but over the years you have come to recognize his good qualities. Sometimes you simply put up with him when he is overbearing and foolish. But he is your friend.<br><br>Part of enduring to the end is related to our attitudes toward ourselves. When we have a high enough regard for ourselves, we can overcome setbacks and still go forward. It is difficult to defeat a person who is determined to endure in this sense.<br><h2><b>Develop an Attitude of Trust</b></h2><br>I believe another quality we must have in order to enjoy the peaceable things of the kingdom is a trust in the ultimate triumph of good over evil. Sometimes much desired blessings for which we have worked hard to qualify seem to be long in coming. At other times the unfairness and arrogance of others appear to go unpunished. There are times when we cannot seem to see our way through a maze of difficulties and hard times to a satisfactory conclusion. These are some of the most severe tests of our mortal existence.<br><br>True religious faith helps us to establish such a trust. Experience ultimately teaches us that honest effort will finally be rewarded, and that wickedness, in the end, will not produce happiness. When we cannot see the end from the beginning as the Lord does, it is sometimes a challenge to trust in his promise. But experience will confirm the validity of the trust.<br><br>Lorenzo Snow, who knew something of challenge and disappointment in his own lifetime, once made this observation to the Saints who were weighed down by the severity of their circumstances:<br><br><i>How ill-qualified we were one year ago to pass through the scenes through which we have been led with success. From which let us realize the folly of an over-anxiety to pry into the scenes that are lying before us, inasmuch as God will prepare a way by a gradual process, step by step, and leading us forward in a manner that will prove easy as we pass along, but which, if presented to our view at once, would seem insurmountable.</i><br><br>There is the story of two neighboring farmers--one a habitual Sabbath breaker, and the other a faithful observer of the Lord&#39;s day. On one occasion the Sabbath observer severely chastised his neighbor for working his farm on Sundays rather than attending to his religious devotions. This led to an argument and a challenge. "Let us put the matter to a test," the Sabbath breaker said. "We will select two pieces of ground of equal size and fertility. On them we will plant the same crop. My piece of ground I will work only on Sundays, and you will work yours on the other days of the week. Then we will see who gets the greater harvest."<br><br>The challenge was accepted and the conditions were faithfully observed. As the harvest was gathered in, the Sabbath-observing farmer was disappointed to learn that the piece of ground farmed by his neighbor had produced the greater yield. The Sabbath breaker exulted in his apparent triumph and his discrediting of the contention of his faithful neighbor.<br><br>"You have forgotten one important thing," protested the Sabbath observer. "The Lord doesn&#39;t always settle his accounts in October."<br><br>Related to this same matter of trust is the principle taught in the Savior&#39;s parable of the talents. You will recall that in this story an honorable effort, given to the full by the two honest servants, brought the same reward from the master, even though the product of their efforts was not the same.<br><br>It has seemed to me that built into the conscience of every human soul is the most accurate determiner of whether we are living in such a way to merit the ultimate blessings promised to the faithful. We point to this determiner when we say, "Be honest with yourself." A person does not easily deceive his own conscience. Deep within our own hearts we generally know when we have paid the price, when we have done the best our personal resources and abilities would have allowed us to do at the moment, regardless of the outcome of our effort or the way it may be viewed by others. It is at these times that we know real peace, even though the product of our effort may not be all that we would have hoped it to be. The full return on this kind of investment cannot always be determined at the next audit period.<br><br>When Jesus was crucified by his detractors, it appeared to all observers--even to his disciples--that his efforts had accounted for nothing. But the Savior knew he had paid the price. History has borne record to the quality of his investment.<br><br>Another factor that has a bearing upon whether or not we experience peace in our lives has to do with our being able to realistically respond to expectations that others have for us and the demands they sometimes make of us. In responding to these expectations, we must successfully evaluate between fundamentally important values and the sometimes superficial or outward performances that others may expect from us. This requires that we recognize real truth and demonstrate integrity to it. Peace of mind comes when we know we are doing the right things for the right reasons.<br><br>For some reason, one of the most common methods many of us use to motivate is to develop feelings of guilt within ourselves or in others for whom we have a responsibility. Guilt feelings are a natural product of an injured conscience. When we willfully violate a valid code of conduct, we suffer the consequences of our infraction in the internal conflict that occurs within our own souls. Such feelings, painful and remorseful though they may be, can generate the desire to repent and improve. They can be useful, constructive emotions that propel us forward to greater perfection. But purposefully generating feelings of guilt over some shortcoming as a means of motivating action or promoting more compliant behavior is rarely productive. The devastating effect of a child&#39;s constantly being told that he is stupid, lazy, or ugly has been well documented in behavioral studies. When anyone&#39;s honest effort to<i>do</i>better or to<i>be</i>better is met by debilitating criticism, real motivation and incentive are often destroyed. All of us profit from encouragement and from occasional constructive correction. But we must be helped to feel that we are valued and appreciated in spite of our shortcomings.<br><br>I have been appalled when I have heard leaders attempt to extort greater devotion and exertion from young missionaries by telling them they will never rise above the level of their performance on their missions. This is foolishness. I have lived long enough to see<br><br>many contradictions to this contention. It is as though our performance in any given period of our lives rivets us forever to an inescapable course. If this were a true principle, repentance and reformation would be impossible.<br><h2><b>Give of Yourself to Lift Others</b></h2><br>My final suggestion for experiencing peaceable things probably has the best possibility for producing immediate results. It is a simple formula that will almost always work. Raise your own spirits by finding something to do that will lift others. Nothing seems to have a greater power for turning us away from our own self-pity and despondency than to focus upon something good we can do for someone else who has a need.<br><br>Erich Fromm has said:<br><br><i>The most important sphere of giving .</i>. .<i>is not that of material things, but lies in the specifically human realm. What does one person give to another? He gives of himself, of the most precious he has, he gives of his life. This does not necessarily mean that he sacrifices his life for the other--but that he gives him of that which is alive in him; he gives him of his joy, of his interest, of his understanding, of his knowledge, of his humor, of his sadness--of all expressions and manifestations of that which is alive in him .</i>. . .<i>He does not give in order to receive; giving is in itself exquisite joy. But in giving he cannot help bringing something to life in the other person, and this which is brought to life reflects back to him; in truly giving, he cannot help receiving that which is given back to him.</i>[<i>The Art of Loving</i>(New York: Bantam Books, Inc., 1970), p. 20–21]<br><br>And Leona Fetzer Wintch adds this:<br><br><i>A famous man recently summed up his life&#39;s work by saying he had given so much away, he had only a little of himself left to die. He forgot that the bookkeeping of life&#39;s ledger shows that the more a man gives of his love and of himself, the more he has. There are no limits to which the soul can extend itself, and this boundless dominion is immeasurably increased by the very act of sharing.</i>[<i>Life is Fissionable</i>]<br><br>I am continually impressed by some instruction the Savior gave to his disciples near the close of his mortal ministry. It has the nature of being "bottomline" to all of his gospel teaching. You will be very familiar with this scripture, but consider it again--carefully--as I read it to you, especially within the context of my remarks to you tonight.<br><br><i>When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:</i><br><br><i>And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:</i><br><br><i>And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</i><br><br><i>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</i><br><br><i>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat:</i><br><br><i>I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</i><br><br><i>Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</i><br><br><i>Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</i><br><br><i>When saw we thee a stranger and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?</i><br><br><i>Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</i><br><br><i>And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</i><br><br><i>Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</i><br><br><i>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:</i><br><br><i>I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.</i><br><br><i>Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?</i><br><br><i>Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.</i><br><br><i>And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.</i>[Matthew 25:31–46]<br><br>I think there is nothing we can do to develop godlike qualities that is more important than giving of ourselves in the way described here by the Savior. It seems to make the ultimate difference with him when it comes to the time of judgment. And I believe it has some of the highest prospects for helping us overcome any unhappiness we may be experiencing ourselves.<br><br>It would not be appropriate if I did not mention personal prayer and regular study of the scriptures as having a great influence in lifting us from feelings of frustration or despondency. As we pass through the challenges, the setbacks, and the occasional disappointments that all of us experience, may we gain reassurance from the recognition that achieving perfection is a long-term endeavor and that we can trust in the fact that right will prevail. And may we have the charity toward ourselves and others that will allow us to enjoy regularly the "peaceable things" of the kingdom, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Dean L. Larsen was a member of the Presidency of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 3 February 1985.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>39;s Roles: A Message to Our Granddaughters - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Because some may not agree with what I have to say, I would direct these remarks primarily to our granddaughters. The rest of you are invited to listen.<br><br>On Brittany's last birthday, I told her mother with considerable grandfatherly pride that I thought I detected some seeds of promise developing in Brittany. Of course I feel the same way about Nicole, Melissa, Kelly Ann, Katy, Sarah, and little Ashley, our other granddaughters.<br><br>I do not want to tell you girls what you must be. That is for each of you to decide. You have your free agency. Each of you will have to work very hard to learn all you can and develop your skills. It will not be easy to achieve anything really worthwhile. I want only to tell you what I think will help bring to you identity, value, and happiness as a person. I also want to challenge you to reach your potential, to become a person of great worth, to become a great woman. Because you descended from great women, each of you has the potential to become a great woman.<br><br>Now you need to know that to me great does not necessarily mean your becoming a great doctor, lawyer, or business executive. You may, of course, become any of these if you so desire, if you work hard enough, and I would be proud of such an achievement. However, to me greatness is much, much more. I hope that each of you girls will become an individual of significant worth and a person of virtue so that your contributions are maintained in both human and eternal terms.<br><h2><b>You Have a Great Mission</b></h2><br>Elder Boyd K. Packer tells me that among the species of birds where both male and female sing, they sing a different melody. Yet it is pleasant to hear them singing at the same time, and they harmonize beautifully together!<br><br>There can be no question but that women are wonderful and special. You also have a great mission, a great errand, and a great calling. The work of God was devised by God for both men and women. "All those who receive my gospel are sons and daughters in my kingdom" (D&amp;amp;C 25:1). Being born as women brings to you many endowments that are not common to men and therefore make you unique.<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball, in speaking of the roles of men and women, said in a way that adds some personal perspective,<br><br><i>Within those great assurances, however, our roles and assignments differ. These are eternal differences--with women being given many tremendous responsibilities of motherhood and sisterhood and men being given the tremendous responsibilities of fatherhood and the priesthood--but the man is not without the woman nor the woman without the man in the Lord....</i><br><br><i>Remember, in the world before we came here, faithful women were given certain assignments while faithful men were foreordained to certain priesthood tasks. While we do not now remember the particulars, this does not alter the glorious reality of what we once agreed to. You are accountable for those things which long ago were expected of you just as are those we sustain as prophets and apostles! ... This leaves much to be done by way of parallel personal development--for both men and women. </i>[Spencer W. Kimball, <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a style="color: #33cccc;" href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1979/11/the-role-of-righteous-women?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"The Role of Righteous Women,"</a></span> <i>Ensign, </i>Nov. 1979, p. 102]<br><br>This statement suggests that before we were born we made certain commitments, female and male, and that we agreed to come to this earth with great, rich, but separate gifts. We were called, male and female, to do great works, with separate approaches and separate assignments and accordingly were given different songs to sing.<br><br>You say, Where do I begin? Rather than beginning with a wish list of all the things you want in life, the real question may be what you are not willing to do without. You should select two or three of life's experiences you are absolutely sure you want to have--you should not leave important things to chance. Then you should think about what you can contribute to society by way of service to the Church, home, and community. You need also to think of what life will demand from you. Everything has its price. Much is expected of us.<br><br>It is unfortunate that it is taking so long to bring full economic justice to women. The feminization of poverty is both real and tragic. That is why you should work very hard to prepare for your future with some marketable skills.<br><br>The struggle to improve the place of women in society has been a noble cause, and I sincerely hope the day will come when women with equal skills will be fully equal with men in the marketplace. However, this is an issue of equality, not sameness, and does not mean that women should be the same as men or try to do things the way men do them. Although some jobs that are traditionally masculine are now being done by women, it is possible for them to be done in a feminine way, and yet be done equally as well, or possibly even better.<br><br>Over a hundred years ago, in 1872, Eliza R. Snow said that some women "are so radical in their extreme theories that they would set her in antagonism to man, [and] ... make her adopt the more reprehensible phases of character which men present, and which should be shunned or improved by them instead of being copied by women" ("Woman's Status," <i>Woman's Exponent, </i>15 July 1872, p. 29). Becoming like men is not the answer; being who you are and living up to your potential and commitment is.<br><br>You cannot trust the many conflicting voices that clamor about what women should or should not do in today's society. Some of the loudest voices we hear are echoes of others who, rather than being unhappy with their role as women, seem actually out of harmony with themselves and out of tune with life in general.<br><br>Women today are being encouraged by some to have it all: money, travel, marriage, motherhood, and separate careers in the world. Sarah Davidson, in an article titled "Having It All," comments about forging an identity, building a career, developing a craft, and having a family. She answers the question about how the woman who is intent on having it all can coordinate the roles of professional life, marriage, and motherhood:<br><br><i>I do not yet understand how a woman can successfully split herself between home and the marketplace. Fifteen years of feminist theory and action have taught us that sacrificing one for the other does not satisfy, but having both together simultaneously is so difficult that no one I know has found anything but the most quirky and incomplete solution. </i>[Sarah Davidson, "Having It All," <i>Esquire, </i>June 1984, p. 54]<br><br>Some will no doubt disagree with this conclusion, and there may be many exceptions, but she goes on to tell of three women who are partners in a New York law firm, and observes that their personal lives are terrible. Continues Sarah Davidson: "The problem, of course, is that family happiness is less clearly definable and often more elusive than career success" ("Having It All," p. 56). For some the answer has been to find and marry a man who will assume the female roles. But such men are rare. It seems to be much more difficult for men to assume female roles in the home than for women.<br><br>The same author says:<br><br><i>At some point along the way a number of us woke up and found that we were wonderfully self-sufficient and successful and our lives were empty. There was no one to share it with, no living, growing ties to the future. Something vital had been discarded, and we scurried to recapture it. </i>["Having It All," p. 56]<br><br>As Sarah Davidson approached forty, she and her husband were blessed with a baby. Of this phenomenon she says:<br><br><i>This baby was the great missing link for me, the one thing I have longed for in my life that, once realized, brought the satisfaction I'd hoped for....</i><br><br><i>Nothing in my life prepared me for the happiness, the wholeness I felt when my son was born. I am embarrassed to tell you how many nights I would walk into his room and just stand at the crib, my heart brimming....</i><br><br><i>... The bond between a mother and child is so special--it's in the soul....</i><br><br><i>... All my time is spent on three things: baby, work, and keeping the marriage going.</i><br><br><i>I find I can handle two beautifully. When my husband is out of town, or when I'm between projects and not working, things go smoothly. But three pushes me to the edge. Someone is unhappy, something is always getting short shrift. </i>["Having It All," p. 54–60 passim]<br><br>No doubt it would help if husbands would follow the counsel of the late Elder G. Homer Durham: "Man, as well as woman, has obligations to learn the difficult art of fatherhood in homemaking. This is not a task just for the woman" ("Woman's Responsibility to Learn," <i>Woman </i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1979], p. 36).<br><h2><b>The Seasons of Life</b></h2><br>And so, my dear granddaughters, it would seem that you cannot do all of these things well at the same time. You cannot eat all of the pastries in the baking shop at once. You will get a tummyache. You cannot be a 100 percent wife, a 100 percent mother, a 100 percent church worker, a 100 percent career person, and a 100 percent public service person at the same time. How can all of these roles be coordinated? Says Sarah Davidson:<br><br><i>The only answer I come up with is that you can have it sequentially. At one stage you may emphasize career, and at another, marriage and nurturing young children, and at any point you will be aware of what is missing. If you are lucky, you will be able to fit everything in. </i>["Having It All," p. 60]<br><br>Sequentially is a big word meaning to do things one at a time at different times. In the Book of Ecclesiastes, it says: "To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven" (Ecclesiastes 3:1). It seems that the new roles of women have not decreased their responsibility because, while the new roles are challenging, the old roles of wife and mother are in the soul and cry out to be satisfied. It is in the soul to want to love and be loved by a good man and to be able to respond to the God-given, deepest feelings of womanhood--those of being a mother and nurturer. Fortunately, women do not have to track a career like a man does. A woman may fit more than one career into the various seasons of life. She cannot sing all of the verses of her song at the same time.<br><br>Granddaughters, do not be deceived in your quest to find happiness and an identity of your own. Entreating voices may tell you that what you have experienced in your own homes--that which you have seen your mothers and grandmothers do--is old-fashioned, unchallenging, boring, and drudgery. It may have been old-fashioned and perhaps routine; at times it was drudgery. But your mothers and grandmothers have sung a song that expressed the highest love and the noblest of womanly feelings. They have been nurturers and teachers.<br><br>I join Brigham Young in saying: "Daughter, use all your gifts to build up righteousness in the earth" (Susa Young Gates and Leah D. Widtsoe, <i>The Life Story of Brigham Young </i>[New York: Macmillan Co., 1930], p. 307). I hope you would acquire all of the knowledge you can. Become as skillful as you can, but not exclusively in new careers at the expense of the primary ones, or you may find that you have missed singing the song you were supposed to sing.<br><h2><b>Establish Your Priorities</b></h2><br>Some divisive voices would suggest that the wants and needs of women in society have changed and that political power is the primary interest and need of women in this day. This would not seem to be so. A recent poll indicated that the present individual priorities of women are:<br><br>1. A strong family.<br><br>2. Raising children.<br><br>3. Growing spiritually.<br><br>4. Economic equity.<br><br>This means that the values of women in this country are compatible with, but perhaps not quite as strong as, the values of women in our Church. You need not be defensive or ashamed of these priorities of family, children, church, and equal economic opportunities.<br><br>Your grandmother and I urged your mothers to get an education, not only to help them in their homemaking but also to prepare them to earn a living outside the home if that became necessary. Going to college is a wonderful experience, but the dollars, the effort, and the time are much better used if the education also prepares the student to have a marketable skill.<br><br>I have said that you are wonderful, special, and unique for many reasons. Let me tell you some of these reasons.<br><br>Women seem to arrive at decisions based upon a different value system. I have noticed that your grandmother thinks considerably from her heart. My approach seems more logical. Your grandmother is concerned about how those decisions affect people around her. Beverley Campbell talks about it this way: For a woman, "her primary concern is what will be the greatest good for the greatest number of those around her. In value terms, this would be called 'care' and 'mercy.' For men, the research indicated that the moral thought process was probably much more direct. It generally boiled down to hard and fast rules of right and wrong, of black and white" (Beverley Campbell, "Understanding the Uniqueness of Woman," unpublished manuscript).<br><br>Sister Campbell says:<br><br><i>Could it be that we, each of us, man and woman, were endowed at the time of creation with two distinct but equally important traits, traits which are both essential and complementary and are to be used together in wisdom for the greatest good of all mankind? </i>["Understanding the Uniqueness of Woman"]<br><br>It may not be possible for economic reasons, but if you have the choice, do not abandon too quickly the full-time career of marriage and mothering. Some may criticize you and say that you have no gumption, that you lack brains, that you have no ambition, or even that you are seeking to get your fulfillment from others. As you go forward with a professional career, remember that no one will love you more than those in your own home. In the business or scientific world, probably no one would consider you to be perfect. But your little ones, for a time, will think you are perfect. If you are wise, they will adore you for eternity. No one will need more of your time and energy and attention on a twenty-four-hour basis than your family. Their needs will not go away during the daytime working hours. There is the advantage that in working twenty-four hours a day on family relations, you are working on eternal relations. Thus you will also have more time to serve in the administration of the Lord's church on earth where your service is valued and needed. You don't have to earn money to be important. You may choose not to sell your time.<br><br>I hope your husbands will be more helpful than I have been, but homemaking is whatever you make of it. Every day brings satisfaction along with some work which may be frustrating, routine, drudgery, and unchallenging. But it is the same in the law office, the dispensary, the library, or the store. There is, however, no more important job than homemaking. As C. S. Lewis said, it "is the one for which all others exist."<br><h2><b>Seek First the Kingdom of God</b></h2><br>You all know that I adore your grandmother. To me, she is the greatest person in the world. She has done more for me than anyone except my own mother who gave me life. I hold this view, not <i>in spite </i>of the fact that she is a woman, but <i>because </i>she is a woman. She has brought to flower and fruitage many of the divine qualities of womanhood at their noblest and best. I can give you no better model.<br><br>Now it is very important, whatever you do, that you seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness (see Matthew 6:33). It is important that you accept without reservation the Savior for what he was, and Joseph Smith for what he said he was, and President Spencer W. Kimball for what he is. God will not ennoble a person, man or woman, who refuses to uphold by faith, prayer, and works those whom God has called and ordained to preside over them. So, my dear granddaughters, you will want to sustain the priesthood authority.<br><br>Some women may feel it is subversive to their free agency to be directed by the power of the priesthood. This feeling comes from misunderstanding. There should be no compulsion, duress, or unrighteous dominion involved in priesthood authority. President Stephen L Richards stated:<br><br><i>Our accord comes from universal agreement with righteous principles and common response to the operation of the Spirit of our Father. It is actuated by no fear except one. That is the fear of offending God, the Author of our work.</i> [<i>CR, </i>October 1938, p. 116]<br><br>Following the priesthood of the Church is an expression of faith in the Lord's continuing guidance of his Church. It is a willing acceptance of the principle of divine agency.<br><br>Girls, you must practice virtue in its largest sense. Of the many definitions of virtue, such as moral excellence, right action and thinking, goodness of character, and chastity in women, I also appreciate the definition in theology. Virtue in theology is an order of the angels. You cannot become great women if you are not also good women. You will become great women if you join an order of angels. You may ask, "How do I join an order of angels?" My answer is that you must hunger and thirst after righteousness. William Law, an eighteenth-century clergyman, said: "If you have not chosen the Kingdom of God first, it will in the end make no difference what you have chosen instead."<br><h2><b>Hunger and Thirst After Righteousness</b></h2><br>I will tell you of one of the great women I have known for over forty years. Sister Isabelle Bangerter, age ninety-three, is the mother of eleven outstanding children. My missionary companion, Elder Wm. Grant Bangerter, is the second eldest of these children. Our governor, Norman Bangerter, is the tenth child. She has a posterity of over two hundred and forty. All those who are married have been married in the temple. All of the males but two have gone on missions. There have been no divorces among her family. As I have wondered what made Isabelle Bangerter so great, I have concluded that it was because she has hungered and thirsted for righteousness. She sang all of the verses of her song in her home and in the Church.<br><br>President Kimball said it well when he stated:<br><br><i>Among the real heroines in the world who will come into the Church are women who are more concerned with being righteous than with being selfish. These real heroines have true humility, which places a higher value on integrity than on visibility. Remember, it is as wrong to do things just to be seen of women as it is to do things to be seen of men. Great women and men are always more anxious to serve than to have dominion. </i>[Spencer W. Kimball, "The Role of Righteous Women," <i>Ensign, </i>November 1979, p. 104]<br><br>Next to last, you will have to answer to your natural womanly instincts which the Prophet Joseph said are according to your natures. You should respond generously to these instincts and promptings to do good. With your very being held still, you should listen to the whisperings of the Holy Spirit. You should follow the noble, intuitive feelings planted deep within your soul by deity in the previous world. In this way you will be responding to the Holy Spirit of God, and will be sanctified by truth. By so doing, you will be eternally honored and loved. Much of your work is to enrich mankind. Care and mercy seem to be a dominant refrain of the song you have the opportunity to sing. I hope you will not leave any of the melody unsung.<br><br>Lastly, how do I think you, my beloved granddaughters, may become great women? You should cultivate and employ generously your noble womanly instincts of care and mercy. You should always hunger and thirst after righteousness within the framework of the revealed gospel of Jesus Christ. And, finally, most of what you do should be done within an eternal perspective.<br><br>That this may be so, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>James E. Faust was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 12 February 1985.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<br>
President Holland's remarks about my former athletic accomplishments remind me that there is some virtue in growing older. That virtue is: (1) record books become covered with dust, and (2) memories of people tend to become fuzzy. Therefore, one can ride the bench with a team at the university, yet ten years later, in the minds of most, have been a regular performer. Twenty years after graduation, he is remembered as an all-conference player. Thirty years later, he is an all-American. In just two more years, if dust is not blown off the books and memories refreshed, I fully expect to be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts.<br><br>As I listened to President Holland's introductory comments, I was reminded of an exchange of greetings I had with President Marion G. Romney a few years ago. Early one morning we met on an elevator. I observed that he appeared tired though the day was only beginning. In an attempt to lift his spirits, I asked: "How are you on this beautiful, bright morning?"<br><br>"Oh, about average," he drawled.<br><br>"Well, average for you," I said, "is far above average for the rest of us."<br><br>He paused a moment, and then, with a twinkle in his eye, closed the conversation with these words: "My boy" (he calls all of us boys), "you are very kind, but you are not the least bit honest."<br><br>I am grateful to this kindly, but "slightly dishonest" gentleman who sits behind me. He is a special friend of ours, and he is the one who represents you and this unique university so admirably. It is always a pleasure and honor to visit with the Hollands and you on this campus and recall some very cherished memories of years past.<br><br>After much thought and prayer, I have determined to speak with you about<i>memory--</i>a subject that I have already introduced in part. I am not qualified to treat this topic as a professional psychologist would, nor as someone else would who understands the wonders of the human mind. I do, however, want to share with you some thoughts and feelings about memory and remembering as related to the gospel and our spiritual welfare.<br><br>It seems incredible to me that one's brain has the storage capacity of one quadrillion bits of information. If this is true, allowing for the possible error of ten or twelve bits, why does one have such difficulty memorizing the thirteen articles of faith, the six missionary discussions, the basics of a biology course? Or, why is it so hard to recall one's home telephone number on the spur of the moment? Perhaps your professors can provide answers to these questions.<br><br>It is equally amazing to me that there is a close relationship between memory and mood, memory and testimony, memory and models, memory and thoughts, and memory and you. Permit me to share some ideas about these five relationships in a gospel context.<br><h2><b>Memory and Mood</b></h2><br>Memory, according to the experts, often conditions our moods. Those who remember only the disappointing experiences of life tend to become bitter and cynical. Those who recall only their enemies and the forces mustered against them may lose their courage. Those who recall only past injuries may continue to feud with the world. But those who recall the positive and encouraging things remain bright and optimistic.<br><br>I remember one missionary with whom I labored who had a very sour disposition. His companions claimed that he was raised on lemon juice, dill pickles, and sauerkraut. Obviously, he was consumed with a heavy burden of unpleasant memories.<br><br>One insightful writer observed: "The memory is a window through which life is viewed. The color of that window determines the color of our world" (Dr. Ernest A. Fitzgerald). How awful it would be for one to walk through life with everything distorted by the red of anger, blue of despair, black of fear, or green of envy.<br><br>I do not know the color of Enos's life when he went into the forests to hunt beasts and had his wrestle before God. One is led to think that it was somewhat gray, for he had not received a remission of his sins. However, as he stimulated his memory by recalling the words of eternal life spoken by his father, and as he reflected upon the joy of the Saints, the cloud of gloom was dispelled. Through prayer and the exercise of faith, Enos emerged from the woods colored in the rays of light (see Enos 1:1­8).<br><br>I know the color of Alma's life as he and others sought to destroy the church of God. He states that when he remembered all his sins, he was racked with eternal torment. Then, when he remembered all that his father had prophesied about Christ's atonement, something marvelous occurred. He said:<br><br><i>And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more.</i><br><br><i>And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!</i><br><br><i>Yea, I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains. Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy.</i>[Alma 36:19­21]<br><br>Elijah is another interesting case in point. Even though he had slain the prophets of Baal and witnessed heavenly powers, he lost his courage and the desire to live when hunted by wicked Queen Jezebel. It required an angel, the whisperings of "a still small voice," and other reassurances to change his mood (see 1 Kings 19).<br><br>I would ask, Do you allow your mind to wallow in memory of past hurts and injuries, thus becoming blind to everything else? Or, do you recall the positive and encouraging things that cause your life to remain bright and optimistic? What is the color of your memories? Remember, the memories are yours, and the palette and brushes are in your hands. Be certain that you use the right colors as you paint the past and niche it in your mind.<br><h2><b>Memory and Testimony</b></h2><br>In our missionary service, we frequently invite our investigator friends to obtain a testimony by reading the Book of Mormon and praying about its contents. Our point of reference is chapter 10 of Moroni, verses 3­5. We usually say to our friends: "Read this book and ask God if it is not true." Then we promise, as the book states, that "he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost."<br><br>I don't fault any who have used the process described above. I do, however, suggest a better and more successful approach. Let me read the verses and highlight four steps to a testimony, two of which are often neglected:<br><br><i>Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall</i>(1) read<i>these things, . . . that ye would</i>(2) remember<i>how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and</i>(3) ponder<i>it in your hearts.</i><br><br><i>. . . I would exhort you that ye would</i>(4) ask<i>God . . . if these things are not true; and . . . he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.</i>[Moroni 10:3­5; emphasis added]<br><br>I emphasize two words,<i>remember</i>and<i>ponder.</i>I do so because I feel strongly that reading the things of God without remembering and pondering how those things fit into the divine scheme tends to confuse, not enlighten. Enlightenment occurs and truth is revealed as things are fitted together in an understandable way. In the process, the mind is stimulated, memory is stirred, and the heart is prepared to respond to the whisperings of the Spirit.<br><br>Ammon rehearsed many truths to King Lamoni before he was converted. Among other things:<br><br><i>. . . he began at the creation of the world, and also the creation of Adam, and told him all the things concerning the fall of man, and . . . laid before him the records and the holy scriptures of the people, which had been spoken by the prophets.</i>[Alma 18:36]<br><br>Similarly, Aaron did the same with the father of Lamoni. He, as did Ammon, preached of Adam, the Fall, the plan of redemption, and the atonement of Christ. All of this was done to place things in proper perspective and to build the foundations of a testimony.<br><br>When your testimony sags or appears to stumble along the way, why not remember the goodness of the Lord? In the process of positive recall, perhaps you can experience the spiritual healing which King Lamoni and his father experienced. How very exhilarating it is to ponder the merciful nature of God, and how very healing it is to remember the eternal gifts of Christ.<br><h2><b>Memories and Models</b></h2><br>Most of us have been deeply influenced by other men and women. I suspect that this is the way it should be. It was Elder Talmage who wrote that the Father's original purpose was "to use persuasive influences of wholesome precept and<i>sacrificing example</i>with the inhabitants of the earth, then to leave them free to choose for themselves" (James E. Talmage,<i>The Articles of Faith,</i>12th ed. [Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1924], p. 55; emphasis added).<br><br>All of us, I would guess, have a model or hero tucked away in the recesses of our memory. You could have many. From time to time you may think of that model, and from him or her draw needed inspiration. This is particularly true when the hill you are required to climb seems insurmountable or the decision to be made seems especially difficult.<br><br>Helaman knew the value of memories and models, for he instructed his sons:<br><br><i>. . . I have given unto you the names of our first parents who came out of the land of Jerusalem; and this I have done that when you remember your names ye may remember them; and when ye remember them ye may remember their works; and when ye remember their works ye may know how that it is said, and also written, that they were good.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, my sons, I would that ye should do that which is good, that it may be said of you, and also written, even as it has been said and written of them.</i>[Helaman 5:6­7]<br><br>You should not clutter your memories with men or women of doubtful reputation. They will disappoint you and drag you downward. But, rather, you should selectively place in your mind the giants of goodness and, each time you think of them, resolve that you will walk in their footprints and go beyond their mark. This is especially important as you trudge that long walk toward a college degree.<br><h2><b>Memory and Thoughts</b></h2><br>"The mind," it is said, "feeds on the food that is placed at its disposal." Therefore, "what we give to our minds will eventually determine what they contain" (Dr. Ernest A. Fitzgerald). This certainly is no startling fact; everyone seems to know it. Yet, people continue to read pornographic materials, view smutty and suggestive films, and sing songs with filthy lyrics. Wittingly or not, those who do these things will store polluted memories and reap the bitter pill.<br><br>I find it difficult to understand how some members of the Church can blatantly disregard this divine injunction:<br><br><i>. . . let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.</i><br><br><i>The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:45­46]<br><br>What a gold mine of promises are cradled in this scripture! Who in his right mind would place in jeopardy the promise of confidence, the doctrine of the priesthood, and the companionship of the Holy Ghost?<br><br>Christina Rossetti wrote:<br><br><i>I have a room where into no one enters</i><br><i>Save I myself alone.</i><br><i>There sits</i>a blessed memory<i>on a throne</i><br><i>There my life centers.</i><br>[Emphasis added]<br><br>If we counted or enthroned our blessings more, our memories would become pleasant and our lives would be much happier. I like these thoughts:<br><br><i>The sun was shining in my eyes</i><br><i>And I could hardly see</i><br><i>To do the necessary task</i><br><i>That was allotted me.</i><br><i>Resentment of the vivid glow</i><br><i>I started to complain</i><br><i>When all at once upon the air</i><br><i>I heard the blindman's cane.</i><br>[Earl Musselman]<br><br>Over and beyond the counting of blessings and the garnishing of thoughts with virtue, let me share one more thing pertaining to memory and thoughts. A noted physician counseled:<br><br><i>Know the great souls that make up the moral radium of the world. You must be born of their spirit, initiated into their fraternity. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . As the soul is dyed by the thoughts, let no day pass without contact with the best literature of the world. Learn to know your Bible. . . .</i>[I would add "and the other standard works of the Church."]<i>In forming character and in shaping conduct, its touch has still its ancient power. Fifteen or twenty minutes day by day will give you</i>fellowship with the great minds of the race,<i>and little by little as the years pass you extend your friendship with the immortal dead.</i>They will give you faith in your own day.<i>Listen while they speak to you of the fathers.</i><br><br><i>. . . Life is a straight, plain business</i>[game],<i>and the way is clear, blazed for you by generations of strong men, into whose labours you enter and whose ideals must be your inspiration.</i>[Dr. William Osler,<i>A Way of Life</i>(New York: Paul B. Hoeber, Inc., Medical Book Department of Harper and Brothers, 1937), pp. 37­38; emphasis added]<br><br>Do not become enslaved by destructive or degrading thoughts. They can become as strong and debilitating as Satan's iron chains. There is an old story about a man who was recalling the hardships of his early life. He exaggerated to such limits that his wife felt constrained to correct him. "Be quiet," he said to her. "Half of the fun of remembering the good old days is rearranging them." To rearrange one's memories may not be too bad, if we don't embellish to the point that we lose contact with reality or truth.<br><br>I was in a meeting with one of the Brethren when he was requested to tell a story, one he had related on many occasions. Knowing of man's tendency to embellish when something is recounted over and over again, he smiled and asked: "Do you want me to tell it as I told it last time or as it actually happened?"<br><br>Do not forget that memory and thoughts are inseparably connected; one runs into the other. So garnish your thoughts with virtue, count your blessings, and have fellowship with the great minds of the race. Those actions will build you a sacred sanctuary of pleasant memories.<br><h2><b>Memory and You</b></h2><br>Nearly four years ago, I read these words:<br><br><i>It is said that God gave us memory so we could have roses in winter. But it is also true that without memory we could not have self in any season. The more memories you have, the more "you" you have. That is why, as Swift said, no wise man ever</i><br><br><i>wished to be younger.</i>[George F. Will, "On Turning 40,"<i>Newsweek,</i>27 April 1981, p. 104]<br><br>I did not fully appreciate memories and self until I, with the help of others, compiled my oral history. I gave my wife a rough copy of my life story and asked her to edit it. My instructions were: "You know me better than I know myself, so please read it carefully and polish the manuscript."<br><br>A half hour later, when I returned to see how she was doing, she was crying. I said, "My goodness, is it that bad?"<br><br>"No," she answered, "It is that good!"<br><br>"Have you made any changes?" I asked.<br><br>"No," she replied, "It is you speaking, and I don't want to erase or edit you out of the record."<br><br>We later gave bound copies of my history to our children. Both of us knew that the thing would probably be placed on a shelf and read only sometime. A few weeks ago, however, one of our daughters said to me: "Dad, I love you so very much."<br><br>I wondered what was wrong and I asked: "What brought this on?"<br><br>She explained, "It was your oral history; I have been reading about your life." She added, "I did not realize that you had done . . . I didn't know that you had experiences such as . . ."<br><br>Do we not read that records kept by the ancients enlarged the memory of the people? Of course it is true. Records do preserve language, safeguard truth, and inspire future readers, if they are kept properly.<br><br>What a pity it would be if your children and grandchildren were denied that part of you that really should be recorded. Make certain that you are transmitting to your posterity, along with other graces of life, your innermost thoughts, your poignant feelings, and your sincere testimonies. You owe the rising generation this blessing and more.<br><br>Enlarge the memories of those who follow you with your records, leave for them a part of you, and extend to them an opportunity to hold you in cherished memory.<br><h2><b>Closing Comments</b></h2><br>There is so much more that could be said about memory and remembering as related to you and the gospel of Jesus Christ. For instance, I've said nothing about the need to remember our sacred covenants, our vows, our ordinances. I've said nothing about all of the "types and shadows" mentioned in the scriptures that have been given to direct our thoughts in the proper direction and to keep us in the right path. Nor have I alluded to the role that memory will play on Judgment Day. I leave it up to you to research the subject further and to fill in all the blanks.<br><br>I do pray that you will sanctify yourselves through repentance and believing in God's promise: "He who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more" (D&amp;amp;C 58:42).<br><br>At the same time, I pray that you will live so that your name will appear on the list of the righteous, and that it can be written in that "book of remembrance" which serves as a registry "for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name" (3 Nephi 24:16).<br><br>I testify of the importance of memory. It does mold our moods. It is associated with testimony. It should include models of righteousness. Of a certainty, it is the product of thoughts. And, in the end, it is you.<br><br>I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Carlos E.

<h1>rine and Covenants—A Scripture for All Seasons - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The Doctrine and Covenants should be one of the most important volumes in our lives. Let me share with you a statement from President Harold B. Lee:<br><br><i>I say that we need to teach our people to find their answers in the scriptures. ... But the unfortunate thing is that so many of us are not reading the scriptures. We do not know what is in them, and therefore we speculate about the things that we ought to have found in the scriptures themselves. I think that therein is one of our biggest dangers of today.</i>[Harold B. Lee,<i>Ensign,</i>December 1972, p. 3]<br><br>The Doctrine and Covenants should be dear to us, as Latter-day Saints, for at least two reasons.<br><br>First, it contains revelations provided for us in our day. The other scriptures are also of great value to us, but they spoke to people of other generations in other days. The Doctrine and Covenants is our scripture, directed specifically to our generation.<br><br>Second, it is the only volume of scripture that includes as its introduction a revelation given by the Lord for that purpose. The preface, or first section of the Doctrine and Covenants, is a revelation from the Lord introducing the Doctrine and Covenants. Listen to these great and sacred words from section one:<br><br><i>Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith the voice of him who dwells on high, and whose eyes are upon all men; yea, verily I say: Hearken ye people from afar; and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen together.</i><br><br><i>For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to escape; and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 1:1–2]<br><h2><b>Our Book of Commandments</b></h2><br>Originally called the Book of Commandments, the Doctrine and Covenants is a compilation of revelations, mostly given during the period from 1823 to 1847. However, the most recent additions to this volume were made in 1981. It covers the rise and the development of the restored Church in our day. The revelations were gathered for publication by a committee chaired by Joseph Smith and were presented to a general assembly of the Church in Kirtland in August 1835. Not only was the volume of scripture accepted at that time, but various groups of the Church bore witness that the revelations came from the Lord.<br><br>Elder John A. Widtsoe tells us that the divine being speaking to us in the Doctrine and Covenants is Jesus of Nazareth. Apparently the Father does not speak in these revelations. He speaks through the Son. It is a fundamental doctrine of this Church that the Father has commissioned his Son, Jesus Christ, to look after the affairs of the earth and that all things pertaining to the Church are done by him. Although we pray to the Father in the name of the Son, the Son is the person who speaks to us in the Doctrine and Covenants.<br><br>Some of the revelations are actually words spoken by heavenly beings. Many of the revelations are in the language of Joseph Smith and succeeding prophets. The ideas and impressions were given to them by the Holy Ghost and they were written in the best language at their command. The value of these revelations to all Latter-day Saints and to the entire world is clear. Listen to this from the first section:<br><br><i>Search these commandments, for they are true and faithful, and the prophecies and promises which are in them shall all be fulfilled.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 1:37]<br><br>Says Heber J. Grant concerning the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>I wish that I had the ability to impress upon the Latter-day Saints the necessity of searching the commandments of God, the revelations from the Lord, the Creator of heaven and earth, as contained in the Doctrine and Covenants. If we as a people would live up to those wonderful revelations that have come to us, we would be a bright and shining light to all the wide world.</i>[Heber J. Grant,<i>CR,</i>October 1927, p. 4]<br><br>Also, in the introduction of the Doctrine and Covenants, we read these words:<br><br><i>Although most of the sections are directed to members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the messages, warnings, and exhortations are for the benefit of all mankind, and contain an invitation to all people everywhere to hear the voice of the Lord Jesus Christ, speaking to them for their temporal well-being and their everlasting salvation. ... In the revelations one hears the tender but firm voice of the Lord Jesus Christ, speaking anew in the dispensation of the fulness of times; and the work that is initiated herein is preparatory to his second coming, in fulfillment of and in concert with the words of all the holy prophets since the world began.</i>[D&amp;amp;C, Explanatory Introduction]<br><br>Within the inspired pages of this volume of sacred scripture is the doctrinal foundation of what we stand for and what we do as a church. It not only teaches the basic doctrines upon which the Church is founded, but, as the seeker of truth reads and studies and prays, the Holy Ghost will bear witness to that person of its truthfulness.<br><br>Question: We are all acquainted with the practice of convening in stake conferences. Where did that practice originate?<br><br>Answer: From D&amp;amp;C 20:61.<br><br><i>The several elders composing this church of Christ are to meet in conference once in three months, or from time to time as said conferences shall direct or appoint.</i><br><br>Verse 81 of that section tells what should happen at those conferences.<br><br>Question: Although mentioned in various scriptures, where did the specific practice of administering to the sick come from in this dispensation?<br><br>Answer: From D&amp;amp;C 42.<br><br><i>And the elders of the church, two or more, shall be called, and shall pray for and lay their hands upon them in my name; and if they die they shall die unto me, and if they live they shall live unto me.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 42:44]<br><br>This scripture goes on to say that should they die, death will be sweet to them and they will not taste of death as such.<br><br>So it goes--principle after principle and practice after practice are outlined for the Church by the Savior and recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants.<br><h2><b>Revelation for All Times</b></h2><br>We do not practice parts of the Doctrine and Covenants today. The law of consecration is not lived today in its fulness. Polygamy was given by revelation and taken away by revelation. From 2 Peter 1:20–21 we read:<br><br><i>Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.</i><br><br><i>For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</i><br><br>From this we learn that holy men are to interpret scriptures for the Church, and this will supersede all private interpretations by individuals or groups. These holy men of today are the First Presidency, who, as the presiding high priests of the Church, have the right of officiating in all offices in the Church.<br><br>Following the guidance of the living prophet is the key to understanding scripture and what the Lord requires of us in this day and age. No person can call another person or himself to act in behalf of the Church without being called and duly authorized. This is from section 42:<br><br><i>Again I say unto you, that it shall not be given to anyone to go forth to preach my gospel, or to build up my church, except he be ordained by some one who has authority, and it is known to the church that he has authority and has been regularly ordained by the heads of the church.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 42: 11]<br><br>What about our everyday problems? How does this great volume of scripture deal with the challenges we face each day of our lives? More and more, we are finding that many young people and even older people are suffering from the overriding feelings of guilt in their lives. If anything goes wrong, they look for immediate causes and end up blaming themselves or someone else.<br><br>"I'm not dating, so I'm not attractive enough" or "My inner self is not what it should be." The result is guilt.<br><br>"My parents are not getting along," or "My parents are divorced," or "Somehow it must have been something I did or did not do." The result is guilt.<br><br>"We want to have children and we can't. It must be punishment for something I have or haven't done." The result is guilt.<br><br>"I want a happy-ever-after life. I have been trying to follow a list of things that will make me happy, but the trials keep coming, and I'm not always happy." The result is blaming myself or someone else.<br><br>"How come my problems aren't getting solved? If the gospel is the gospel of healing and peace, why hasn't more of it come to me?" These questions go on and on with some.<br><br>Let's turn to the life of Mary Fielding Smith, wife of Hyrum Smith. This was her first marriage and his second. She came into a family where five children were left without a mother when the first wife died. By June 1839 Mary and Hyrum had been married for eighteen months. During that short period they had been driven from two homes, Hyrum had been imprisoned for six months, Mary had been bedridden for four months with a pregnancy, and now, without financial resources, they were struggling to establish another home. Listen to this excerpt written at the time by Mary to her brother Joseph Fielding:<br><br><i>It is now little more than a month since the Lord, in his marvelous power, returned my dear husband, with the rest of the brethren, to their families, in tolerable health. We are now living in Commerce, on the bank of the great Mississippi river. The situation is very pleasant; you would be much pleased to see it. How long we may be permitted to enjoy it I know not; but the Lord knows what is best for us. I feel but little concern about where I am, if I can keep my mind staid upon God; for, you know in this there is perfect peace.</i>[Don Cecil Corbett,<i>Mary Fielding Smith, Daughter of Britain; Portrait of Courage</i>(Salt Lake City, UT: Deseret Book Co., 1966), p. 99]<br><br>Let us go to the imprisonment that Mary spoke of. It was in Liberty Jail that the prayer and prophecies in sections 121 and 122 were written. Meeting frustrations and problems that do not seem to go away is not only a problem that we face from time to time, but the Prophet Joseph also suffered such adversity as these verses will attest. (Remember now that they had been in jail for months without the opportunity of due process. Their living conditions were horrible.)<br><br><i>O God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place?</i><br><br><i>How long shall thy hand be stayed, and thine eye, yea thy pure eye, behold from the eternal heavens the wrongs of thy people and of thy servants, and thine ear be penetrated with their cries?...</i><br><br><i>Remember thy suffering saints, O our God; and thy servants will rejoice in thy name forever.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:1–2, 6]<br><br>Part of the answer to that prayer comes in section 122. Note that the Lord did not say to Joseph that the afflictions would be lifted, but instead he said that, in fact, it could get worse. The Lord also told Joseph that his friends still stood with him. He pointed out that this whole process was for the purpose of giving him experience. Trials are necessary to become like the Savior, whose name we have taken upon ourselves at baptism.<br><br><i>And if thou shouldst be cast into the pit, or into the hands of murderers, and the sentence of death passed upon thee; and if thou be cast into the deep; if the billowing surge conspire against thee; if fierce winds become thine enemy; if the heavens gather blackness, and all the elements combine to hedge up the way; and above all, if the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good....</i><br><br><i>Therefore, hold on thy way, ... for their bounds are set, they cannot pass. Thy days are known, and thy years shall not be numbered less; therefore, fear not what man can do, for God shall be with you forever and ever.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 122:7, 9]<br><br>The message? Well, we should not be going out looking for problems. But one reason we are here in this life is to gain experience. This comes from meeting and overcoming trials. Just as the Savior met his trials, so we must meet our trials if eventually we are to become like him. Living the gospel does not always make the problems go away, but it can and does give us purpose and has the power to give us peace and healing as we meet our own trials.<br><h2><b>The Importance of Developing Faith</b></h2><br>Some people want quick and easy answers for everything, but this desire works directly against the development of the principle of faith. Without faith it is impossible to please God (see Hebrews 11:6). If we are going to do the best we can, maybe it is not so important how things turn out as how we meet a particular trial. Maybe the important thing is how we act as we are going through the difficulty--how we pray, how we keep our covenants, how we treat one another, whom we try to blame, how well we forgive ourselves and others--and then move onward.<br><br>The Lord offers the kind of peace and joy and healing that keeps us going and gives us purpose and direction, but maybe all our problems do not get solved. Some live with the same burdens and trials for a lifetime, but in the process they develop in their lives the kind of peace the gospel has to offer and the kind our friend Mary Fielding Smith made mention of.<br><br>Is this not the message we get from these passages:<br><br><i>Be patient in afflictions, for thou shalt have many; but endure them, for, lo, I am with thee, even unto the end of thy days.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 24:8]<br><br><i>Be patient in afflictions, revile not against those that revile. Govern your house in meekness,</i><br><br><i>and be steadfast.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 31:9]<br><br><i>For I will forgive you of your sins with this commandment--that you remain steadfast in your minds in solemnity and the spirit of prayer.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:61]<br><br>The Doctrine and Covenants will lead to a solution of our problems as we face them from day to day.<br><br>Although our Father in Heaven cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance, nevertheless we are his sons and daughters and in his eyes we are of great value.<br><br>We are told in D&amp;amp;C 18:10 to "remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God." This worth is constant and does not depend on how much we accomplish or how popular we are or how many honors we attain in life. We do not become more worthwhile by accomplishing more, and we do not become less worthwhile by accomplishing less. Our worth before God is not dependent upon what we accomplish. You may not be the most popular person on campus and you may not be BYU's next starting quarterback. You may not be getting a 4.0 this semester. But these are not connected with your worth. Your worth is great.<br><br>If you sin, the Lord does not want you to hate yourself, for you are one of his creations. Hate the sin, but do not hate yourself.<br><br>The principle of repentance is not merely the process that those few go through who really have problems. For one who has taken upon himself the name of Christ, repentance is a way of life. Repentance means progress. Repentance is a means of lifting the burden. Repentance is healing. Repentance is peace. Repentance, properly directed, is the means the Lord has given us to bring us within the circle of the Atonement. It can lift us from our sins and make us whole again. Perhaps it is not well enough understood. Listen to this definition found in the Bible dictionary:<br><br><i>The Greek word of which this is the translation denotes a change of mind, i.e., a fresh view about God, about oneself, and about the world. Since we are born into conditions of mortality, repentance comes to mean a turning of the heart and will to God, and a renunciation of sin to which we are naturally inclined. Without this there can be no progress.</i><br><br>With this in mind, consider again these scriptures:<br><br><i>Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God;</i><br><br><i>For, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh; wherefore he suffered the pain of all men, that all men might repent and come unto him.</i><br><br><i>And he hath risen again from the dead, that he might bring all men unto him, on conditions of repentance.</i><br><br><i>And how great is his joy in the soul that repenteth!</i>[D&amp;amp;C 18:10–13]<br><br><i>Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more.</i><br><br><i>By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins--behold, he will confess them and forsake them.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 58:42–43]<br><br><i>Nevertheless, he that repents and does the commandments of the Lord shall be forgiven.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 1:32]<br><br>As the great tapestry of revelation unfolds in the Doctrine and Covenants, we come to know a Savior who has suffered for all of us. He took upon himself our sins, and his suffering is effectual for us if we would but come to him. He understands about our weaknesses, and he takes into account the intent of our hearts. The important thing is that none of us must ever stop the ongoing process of repentance. Some things may have to be worked at again and again before they are out of our lives. He is only displeased with us when we stop trying.<br><h2><b>Receiving Personal Revelation</b></h2><br>No volume of scripture spells out how to receive personal revelation from the Lord any better than does the Doctrine and Covenants. A pattern is established for all of us in these words to Oliver Cowdery:<br><br><i>Oliver Cowdery, verily, verily, I say unto you, that assuredly as the Lord liveth, who is your God and your Redeemer, even so surely shall you receive a knowledge of whatsoever things you shall ask in faith, with an honest heart, believing that you shall receive....</i><br><br><i>Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart.</i><br><br><i>Now, behold, this is the spirit of revelation.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 8:1–3]<br><br>But the Lord also told Oliver Cowdery:<br><br><i>Remember that without faith you can do nothing; therefore ask in faith. Trifle not with these things; do not ask for that which you ought not.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 8:10]<br><br>The Lord more carefully defines this process in a further revelation to Oliver Cowdery. Note the different ways that he says he will convey his mind and will:<br><br><i>Behold, thou knowest that thou hast inquired of me and I did enlighten thy mind; and now I tell thee these things that thou mayest know that thou hast been enlightened by the Spirit of truth;...</i><br><br><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, if you desire a further witness, cast your mind upon the night that you cried unto me in your heart, that you might know concerning the truth of these things.</i><br><br><i>Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter? What greater witness can you have than from God?</i>[D&amp;amp;C 6:15, 22–23]<br><br>Also to Oliver Cowdery, these words were spoken:<br><br><i>But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</i><br><br><i>But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of thought that shall cause you to forget the thing which is wrong.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 9:8–9]<br><br>How will you know if the Lord is speaking to you? He tells us three ways in these revelations. He will speak peace to your mind, he will enlighten your mind, and he will cause that your bosom shall burn within you. He says that the answer will come to your mind and to your heart.<br><br>What are the preparations you must make according to these revelations? You must study it out in your mind and you must ask in prayer. Actually it is more than just asking--the words say, "cry unto me in your heart that you might know the truth concerning these things." It is one thing to ask and it is another thing to truly humble yourself and with all the energy of your soul cry unto Heavenly Father in your heart that you might know the truth.<br><br>This is not your only preparation. The Lord also says that you must ask in faith with an honest heart, believing that you shall receive. In other words, you know he will answer you. And when he does, you must be honest enough to act on that answer. You will humbly and earnestly inquire until the answer comes.<br><br>The Lord also says this process is very sacred; you must not trifle with it or speak of it lightly. You should be thoughtful enough not to ask for things that you should not ask for.<br><br>How do you receive a "no" answer? What kind of an experience is that? Well, there will be no such burning feelings and/or there will be a stupor of thought and you will forget the thing that you have asked about.<br><br>So, on one hand will come the feelings of peace and warmth and assurance, and on the other hand there will be either nothing or feelings of radical misgivings. President Marion G. Romney describes the process in this way:<br><br><i>In praying, I try to follow the teachings of these scriptures. When confronted with a problem I prayerfully weigh in my mind alternative solutions and come to a conclusion as to which of them is best. Then in prayer I submit to the Lord my problem, tell him I desire to make the right choice, what is, in my judgment, the right course. Then I ask him if I have made the right decision to give me the burning in my bosom that He promised Oliver Cowdery. When enlightenment and peace come into my mind, I know the Lord is saying yes. If I have a "stupor of thought," I know he is saying no, and I try again, following the same procedure.</i>[Marion G. Romney,<i>The New Era,</i>October 1975, p. 35]<br><h2><b>A Divine Invitation</b></h2><br>As a sort of second witness to receiving revelation, the Lord has given us the scriptures and the words of the living prophet and also the opportunity to counsel with our local priesthood leaders about matters. The Lord is not divided. He will not tell his Church to do one thing and an individual to do something else. This very clear and sacred process of receiving answers to prayers is ours because we have the Doctrine and Covenants.<br><br>The Doctrine and Covenants is a divine invitation to come to a knowledge of the Father and the Son, to understand better the role of the Lord as Savior and Redeemer and as the author of our salvation, to understand why his Church is organized the way it is and what its divine mission is to the people of the world. This sacred book also enables us to follow the tender watchful care of God over the infant Church during its days of numerical weakness when it was first getting started.<br><br>For one who will faithfully and prayerfully read this great volume of scripture, there will come into his heart a greater witness and love for God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ. Greater peace and understanding will come and greater determination in fulfilling the divine calls that come to us to serve in the Church.<br><br>Just as we see the tender watchful care of the Lord over the infant Church, so will we begin to see with greater clarity the tender watchful care of the Lord in our own individual lives and how he carefully leads us through the trials and challenges of this mortal probation.<br><br>The Doctrine and Covenants has been written for us in our day. It is one of the standard works. It provides us an opportunity to know and understand deity in a most personal and direct way.<br><br>May the Lord bless us that we will take advantage of that which he has revealed to us and understand it and put it into our lives.<br><br>I bear you my witness that this work is true, that God does live, that Jesus is the Christ, and that they have revealed to us their words, their mind, and their will so that we may live in the world but not needlessly suffer the pains and ills of the world, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Loren C.

<h1>ing of Repentance - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The simplest and most basic principles of the gospel are sometimes those least understood. One of the most fundamental gospel principles is repentance. The mere announcement of the word "repentance" will cause some of you to conclude at the outset that you've already "heard it all," to tune out the speaker, or to allow your mind to wander to your studies, to dating, or simply to daydream. But I would like to give you a new insight into the principle of repentance and show you how relevant and helpful repentance can become for you. Even though some of you may qualify for or hold a temple recommend, many of you at the moment may fail to comprehend the full meaning of repentance and the great blessings it can bring you.<br><h2><b>A Matter of Great Worth</b></h2><br>All of us need to understand and appreciate that repentance is the mechanism for personal growth and development. Repentance is so fundamental that the Lord gave a revelation to Oliver Cowdery through the Prophet Joseph Smith in which he said:<br><br><i>Say nothing but repentance unto this generation; keep my commandments, and assist to bring forth my work, according to my commandments, and you shall be blessed.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 6:9]<br><br>The Lord repeated this statement word for word to Hyrum Smith as recorded in Doctrine &amp;amp; Covenants 11:9. Later he gave two other identical revelations on repentance, one revelation following the other, and then concluded with these words:<br><br><i>And now behold, I say unto you, that the thing which will be of the most worth unto you will be to</i>declare repentance unto this people,<i>that you may bring souls unto me, that you may rest</i>with them<i>in the kingdom of my Father.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 15:6, 16:6; emphasis added]<br><br>Why would the Lord give two identical revelations--and have them published in the Doctrine and Covenants--one following the other word for word, unless they were especially intended to be given not only to them but to all of us?<br><br>And now<i>I must repent--</i>for there<i>is</i>one word that is different, but very important, in each of these revelations. In section 15 the fourth word is "John" and in section 16 the fourth word is "Peter." The first revelation was addressed to John Whitmer and the second revelation to Peter Whitmer. I feel justified in applying these revelations to all of us because of this repeated instruction. In the first revelation I can place my own name so that it is addressed to me: "Hearken, my servant Theodore!" In the second revelation you can insert your own name to make it apply to you: "Hearken, my servant Bill, or my handmaiden Sue!" Thus these revelations can apply to you and to me to help us understand that the thing of greatest worth to each of us is to declare repentance, not only to others, but to ourselves as well. In fact, the importance of repentance is stressed seventy-one times in the Doctrine and Covenants alone! The Lord is a master teacher and knows the value of repetition in learning. It is time to understand why and how repentance is a matter of such great worth to you in your individual life!<br><h2><b>The Meaning of Repentance</b></h2><br>Just what<i>is</i>repentance? Actually it is easier for me to tell you what repentance is<i>not</i>than to tell you what repentance<i>is.</i><br><br>My present assignment as a General Authority is to assist the First Presidency. I prepare information for them to use in considering applications to readmit transgressors into the Church and to restore priesthood and/or temple blessings. Many times a bishop will write: "I feel he has suffered enough!" But suffering is not repentance. Suffering comes from<i>lack</i>of complete repentance. A stake president will write: "I feel he has been punished enough!" But punishment is not repentance. Punishment<i>follows</i>disobedience and<i>precedes</i>repentance. A husband will write: "My wife has confessed everything!" But confession is not repentance. Confession is an admission of guilt that occurs<i>as</i>repentance begins. A wife will write: "My husband is filled with remorse!" But remorse is not repentance. Remorse and sorrow continue because a person has<i>not</i>yet fully repented. But if suffering, punishment, confession, remorse, and sorrow are not repentance, what<i>is</i>repentance?<br><h2><b>Repentance in the Old Testament</b></h2><br>To answer this question, let us go back to the Old Testament. The Old Testament was written in Hebrew and the word used for this concept of repentance is "shube:" Let me read a passage from Ezekiel 33:8–11 and insert the word "shube" along with its English translation to help us understand what repentance is:<br><br><i>When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.</i><br><br><i>Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to</i>[shube, or]<i>turn from it; if he do not</i>[shube, or]<i>turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.</i><br><br>When a person despairs and says: "There is nothing left for me!" "All hope is gone!" "I can't be forgiven!" "What purpose is left in life?" "I might as well be dead!" God instructs the "watchman on the tower" to<br><br><i>Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked</i>[shube, or]<i>turn from his way and live:</i>[shube, shube!]<i>turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?</i>[Ezekiel 33:8–11]<br><br>I know of no kinder, sweeter passage in the Old Testament than those beautiful lines. Can you hear a kind, wise, gentle, loving Father in Heaven pleading with you to "shube" or turn back to him, to leave unhappiness, sorrow, regret, and despair behind and now turn back to your Father's family where you can find happiness, joy, and acceptance among his other children? In the Father's family, you are surrounded with love and affection. That is the message of the Old Testament, and prophet after prophet writes of "shube," which is that turning back to the family of the Lord where you can be received with joy and rejoicing. There is an implicit message there that we in the family of Jesus Christ ought never forget. We must receive the former transgressor back into this family with open arms and comfort and bless him for making the change. That is what Isaiah had in mind when he wrote:<br><br><i>Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near;</i><br><br><i>Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him</i>[shube, or]<i>return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon</i>[if he will only shube]. [Isaiah 55:6–7]<br><br>Throughout the Old Testament, a fundamental theme is forsaking or turning from evil and doing instead that which is noble and good. Not only must we change our ways; we must as well change our very thoughts which control our actions. Repentance is a turning back to God!<br><h2><b>Repentance in the New Testament</b></h2><br>Let us now turn to the New Testament which was written in Greek. How did those Greek writers translate the word "shube" into Greek and still retain its concept of repentance? They used the word "metaneoeo," which is a compound word of two parts. The first part, "meta," we use as a prefix in our English vocabulary. When we eat we convert food by a process of metabolism into fat, muscle, and connective tissue. When we see a crawling caterpillar stop, attach itself to a limb and spin a cocoon, the insect inside its silken case undergoes metamorphosis. It changes its form into a moth or a beautiful butterfly. The prefix "meta," then, refers to change.<br><br>The second part of the word "metaneoeo" is subject to various spellings. The letter "n," for instance, is sometimes transliterated as "pn," as in the French word "pneu," meaning an airfilled tire. We also find "pneu" in our word pneumatic, as, for instance, a pneumatic hammer or a pneumatic drill, which are air-driven tools. It is also found in our word pneumonia, which is an air sickness of the lungs. There are several spellings of this root and many meanings attached to this word which can mean air, mind, thought, thinking, or spirit, depending on how it is used.<br><br>The Greek usage of words is similar to that of English, as, for example, with the word "spirit." To a child, spirit might mean a ghost; to you, spirit may mean influence such as team spirit or the spirit of Elijah. But to me--since I was an organic chemist during my university years--or to a pharmacist, spirit simply means ethyl alcohol. In the context where "meta" and "neoeo" are used in the New Testament, the word "metaneoeo" means a change of mind or thought or thinking so powerful and so strong that it changes our very way of life. I think "metaneoeo" is an excellent translation of "shube." The meaning of both these words is to turn or change from evil to righteousness and God.<br><br>But trouble came when Greek was translated into Latin. Only the educated people spoke Greek. When the New Testament was translated into Latin for the use of the common people who spoke that language, an unfortunate choice was made in translation. "Metaneoeo" was translated into the word "poenitere." The root "poen" in that word is the same root found in our English words punish, penance, penitent, and repentance. So the beautiful meaning of Hebrew and Greek was changed in Latin to an ugly meaning involving hurting, punishing, whipping, cutting, mutilating, disfiguring, starving, or even torturing. Small wonder then that most people have come to fear and dread the word repentance which they were taught and now understand to mean repeated or neverending punishment. People must somehow be made to realize that the true meaning of repentance is that we do not require people to be punished or to punish themselves, but to change their lives so they can escape eternal punishment. If they have this understanding, it will relieve their anxiety and fears and become a welcome and treasured word in our religious vocabulary.<br><h2><b>Three Steps of Repentance</b></h2><br>Let me read again to you from Ezekiel 33, which outlines three main steps of repentance which include (1) commitment, (2) restitution, and (3) forsaking sin.<br><br><i>If the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity: he shall surely live, he shall not die.</i>[Ezekiel 33:15]<br><h2><b>"Restore the Pledge"</b></h2><br>Let us analyze these three steps of repentance. The first thing to do is to "restore the pledge," and this is the most difficult step in the repentance process. But what does the statement "restore the pledge" mean?<br><br>To restore the pledge means to renew one's covenant with the Lord. Forget all excuses and finally recognize fully, exactly, what you have done. Don't say, "If I hadn't been so angry," "If my parents had only been more strict," "If my bishop had only been more understanding," "If my teachers had only taught me better," "If it hadn't been so dark," "If I hadn't been so hungry," "If the stake president had only helped me to understand," etc., etc., etc. There are hundreds of such excuses, none of which matter much in the final analysis.<br><br>Forget all such self-justification and rationalization. Just kneel down before God and openly and honestly admit that what you did was wrong. Open your heart to your Father and commit yourself completely to him: "Dear Father, what I did was wrong and I recognize that I<i>have</i>sinned. I make no excuses, but<i>with thy help</i>I promise that I'll never do that thing again. I<i>will</i>straighten out my life, and, if necessary, go to my bishop and seek his help! From now on I pledge that I<i>will</i>be obedient! Please help me now to earn thy forgiveness!"<br><br>To really commit oneself and<i>mean</i>it is the beginning of repentance. Our Savior's great commitment came in the Garden of Gethsemane as he suffered in agony of spirit and shed great drops of blood in that garden. It was a time of terrible trial for him! You will remember that Jesus asked that the cup might pass from him and that some other way might be found for him. Prior to this experience he had always had ready communication with his Heavenly Father, but now he not only felt, but indeed really was, left all alone. It was as if the heavens over his head were made of brass. He couldn't get through! So he continued to struggle in prayer and suffered horribly under the strain. It is true that he added these words, "Nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done" (Luke 22:42). In spite of this pledge to his Heavenly Father, again and yet again he pled with his Father that the cup might pass and that some other path might be found. There was no answer to his request and his soul filled with anguish. But the third time when he said, "Thy will be done," it was said in a different tone. This time he really<i>meant</i>it.<br><br>He realized there<i>was</i>no other way and he fully committed himself to<i>do</i>whatever he had been appointed to do. He was now<i>willing!</i>Though it cost him tremendous suffering, he made up his mind and committed himself to<i>be</i>obedient in every particular, regardless of cost and suffering. It was<i>then</i>that the angels came to minister to him and strengthen him for his coming ordeal. That commitment made his sacrifice on the cross bearable. Such a similar struggle may cost you agony of mind and soul as well, but it will also make the repentance possible and bearable for you.<br><br>One thing we should remember is that the Lord does not punish us for our sins. He simply withholds his blessings and we punish ourselves. The scriptures tell us again and again that the wicked are punished by the wicked. A simple illustration can show how easily that is done. If Mother tells me not to touch a hot stove because it will burn and hurt me, she is only stating the law. If I should forget or deliberately touch that hot stove, I would be burned. I could cry and complain of my hurts, but who would be punishing me? Would it be Mother--or the hot stove? I would be punishing myself. Even after my finger healed, I would have to remember the law, for every time I would touch that hot stove I would be burned, again and again, until I could learn to obey the law. It was and is the law, and justice would have to be done. This illustration, however, disregards the important element of mercy.<br><h2><b>Repay Your Debt</b></h2><br>The second step in the process of repentance is to "give again that which you have robbed." In other words, you must restore or pay back that which you have taken. If you have stolen money or goods, it is relatively easy for you to repay--even to repay sizable amounts with time. But what if you have robbed a person of virtue? Is there<i>anything</i>you can do, of yourself, to restore virtue? Even if you gave your very life, could that restore virtue? No, but--perish the thought--does that then mean it is useless to attempt restitution by significant good works or that your sin is unforgivable? No! Jesus Christ<i>can</i>restore that virtue and he can thus show you mercy. His repayment will satisfy justice and he will make that payment for you<i>if</i>you will only repent. True repentance on your part, including a change in your lifestyle, will enable Jesus, in mercy, to transfer your debt to him. But, as Elder Boyd K. Packer explained in his conference address of 3 April 1977, justice now requires that you repay him. Jesus has power to restore virtue and make your victim absolutely clean and holy. But, as I said, that bargain only transforms the indebtedness you have to your victim into a new indebtedness to Jesus Christ, who paid your ransom. How can you ever repay your Savior such a great price?<br><br>This may appear to you to be a new doctrine, but it is reasonable and consistent with the following scripture from Mosiah. I am grateful for the Book of Mormon, which explains how we<i>can</i>repay Jesus Christ for his great mercy to us. His sacrifice atoned even for our personal sins and makes mercy available to you and to me. King Benjamin may have explained how repayment is possible.<br><br><i>And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.</i>[Mosiah 2: 17]<br><br>This service to others can include significant good works that could compensate Jesus for his restitution made for us. God's work and glory is to redeem his children. If we participate in this redemptive service, he pays us in blessings for which we qualify by that service. What this scripture then means is that you can repay Jesus for his mercy to you by being kind, thoughtful, considerate, and helpful to those around you. By such service to others, you can gradually pay back your indebtedness to your Savior. You can put the evil you have done out of your mind by charitable service to others.<br><br>As you begin to repay your debt through service to your family, neighbors, and friends, the painful elements of your sin will gradually fade from your mind. They will no longer fill your soul with anxiety and concern, nor will you be plagued by worries over previous transgressions. Instead of being filled with vain regrets over past deeds which are already done, events you are powerless to change, you will now be so busy doing good deeds for others that you will not have a desire to sin or disobey, nor to recall past sin or disobedience. You will be helpful and considerate of everyone you meet. You will develop a loving personality and be accepted and appreciated by your associates. But as long as you dwell on sin or evil and refuse to forgive yourself, you will be subject to return again to that sin. If you turn from your problems and sins and put them behind you in both thought and action, you can concentrate on good and positive things. You will thus become fully engaged in good causes. Sin will no longer be such a temptation for you.<br><br>Jesus himself said of those who attain his presence in the celestial kingdom that he would put his sheep on his right hand, but place the goats to his left.<br><br><i>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</i><br><br><i>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</i><br><br><i>Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</i><br><br><i>Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</i><br><br><i>When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?</i><br><br><i>Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</i><br><br><i>And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the</i>least<i>of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</i><br><br><i>Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</i><br><br><i>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:</i><br><br><i>I was a stranger; and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.</i><br><br><i>Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?</i><br><br><i>Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.</i><br><br><i>And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.</i>[Matthew 25:34–46; emphasis added]<br><br>In service to others you can repay your Savior for his mercies and blessings unto you and repay him at least in part for his atonement for you. Jesus can and will lift all burdens from your soul if you will only "shube," or turn from sin back to God.<br><br>It stands to reason that the more serious the sin, the longer it takes to complete the repayment. If you work at repayment daily over the years, even very great sins you may have committed can eventually be repaid and you can then stand blameless before your Savior. Remember that Church leaders can forgive you for your sins against the Church, but final forgiveness for sin has to come from the Great Judge on the day of reckoning when each of us must give an account of our lives.<br><br>It takes time for repentance to be final. An injury to the soul is similar to an injury to the body. Just as it takes time for a wound in the body to heal, so it also takes time for a wound of the soul to heal. The deeper the cut in the body, the longer it takes to heal, and if broken bones are involved, that healing process is extended. If I cut myself, for example, the wound will gradually heal and scab over. But as it heals, it begins to itch, and if I scratch at the itching scab it will take longer to heal, for the wound will open up again. But there is a greater danger. Because of the bacteria on my fingers as I scratch the scab, the wound may become infected and I can poison the wound and can lose that part of my body and eventually even my life!<br><br>Allow injuries to follow their prescribed healing course or, if serious, see a doctor for skilled help. So it is with injuries to the soul. Allow the injury to follow its prescribed healing course without scratching it through vain regrets. If it is serious, go to your bishop and get skilled help. It may hurt as he disinfects the wound and sews the flesh together, but it will heal properly that way. Don't hurry or force it, but be patient with yourself and with your thoughts. Be active with positive and righteous thoughts and deeds. Then the wound will heal properly and you will become happy and productive again.<br><h2><b>Forsake Your Sins</b></h2><br>Now we come to the third step of repentance which is to "walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity." In other words, we must forsake our sins, one by one, and<i>never</i>repeat them. When we do this in sincerity and with honesty of heart, the Lord has said through his prophets:<br><br>To Ezekiel:<br><br><i>None [not even one] of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.</i>[Ezekiel 33: 16]<br><br>To Isaiah:<br><br><i>I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.</i>[Isaiah 43:25]<br><br>To Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 58:42]<br><br>But how do we know if a man or a woman has repented of his or sins? The Lord has even answered that question:<br><br><i>By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins--behold, he will confess them and forsake them.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 58:43]<br><br>Naturally, that confession which precedes repentance should be to a bishop or stake president who has authority to forgive sins. Confessions to others, particularly confessions repeated again and again in open meetings, as is sometimes done, only demean both the confessor and the hearer. But the final step of repentance in forsaking sin means that you do not repeat that transgression again.<br><br>How grateful we should be for a kind, wise, loving Savior who will help us overcome our faults, our mistakes, our sins. He understands us and is sympathetic to the fact that we must face temptations. He is also merciful and has provided a way so that we<i>can</i>apply these principles of repentance in our lives and thus escape the bondage of pain, sorrow, suffering, and despair that comes from disobedience, either conscious or unconscious. After all is said and done, we<i>are</i>his sons and his daughters and he loves each of us dearly. For those who understand its true meaning, repentance becomes a beautiful word and a marvelous refuge. I testify that our Savior lives and loves us. This is my personal witness, in the holy name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Theodore M.

We cannot succumb to the devaluation of the family and the emerging idea that there are no differences between men and women. Even more destructive, however, is the view that women are somehow intellectually or spiritually inferior. Men and women must support one another in the educational and eternal pursuit of their divine potential.

BYU. What does that mean to you? Hold in your hearts all the feelings and impressions that occur to you as you hear the letters<i>B Y U.</i>Perhaps tonight we can consider another dimension: B–Y–U--<i>B</i>uild<i>Y</i>our<i>U</i>nderstanding.<br><br>Build means to frame, construct, erect. It is a cumulative increase in power and effectiveness--<i>B</i>uild<i>Y</i>our<i>U</i>nderstanding.<br><h2><b>Starting with a Blueprint</b></h2><br>The Apostle Paul said to the Corinthians, "Ye are God's building. ... But let every man take heed how he buildeth" (1 Corinthians 3:9–10). Paul goes on to tell us that we are more than just a building: "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?" (1 Corinthians 3:16).<br><br>If we are to become builders, we must have a plan. The greatest desire of our Father in Heaven is to bring to pass our immortality and eternal life (Moses 1:39). He is the master builder. Because of his love for each soul he has provided a blueprint. Here is<i>our</i>blueprint: the holy scriptures, the<i>plan of salvation,</i>the gospel of Jesus Christ restored in its fulness, as explained in the scriptures--a<i>plan</i>of salvation with all the specifications and configurations of eternal truths necessary to build our temple, brick upon brick, culminating in lofty spires beckoning the Spirit of the Lord to come and dwell within. Our do-it-yourself project must begin with a detailed study and pondering of this blueprint.<br><br>Building cannot proceed without tools--precision tools, each to perform an essential task. A carpenter is only as good as his tools. For our tools we are given a body with a reasoning mind and the agency to act for ourselves. We can't blame Adam if we nail the shingles on our roof beginning at the top of the roof instead of the bottom, causing the overlapping shingles to be going in the wrong direction, which, of course, would not allow the rain to roll off. We are given the tool of repentance, a very special implement, provided at great personal expense to the giver, our Savior. In order to erect the supporting beams of our temple we are offered another significant tool, the power to act in God's name, the holy priesthood with all its privileges and ordinances.<br><br>We now have a fail-proof blueprint and sufficient tools imbued with the power of God. Now comes the acquisition of the building materials. Building materials are also provided by the master builder, but they do not come free; there aren't even any discounts, no credit buying--full price must be paid with the requirements and covenants involved.<br><br>Opportunities and challenges will provide the building materials, opportunities for hands-on, line-upon-line experience so necessary in this educational process we are undergoing here on the earth. Opportunities provide the building blocks molded as the direct result of temptations, adversity, callings, and many other circumstances that are part of this mortal life.<br><br>As with any do-it-yourself project, there is considerable need for technical advice and moral support. At critical moments when our logic fails to provide a solution, the master builder is the only one who can give us direction. Each one of you, as builders, is entitled to divine assistance, personal revelation through the Holy Ghost. We have the responsibility and the opportunity to petition the assistance of one who can reveal the wisdom necessary to raise a building fitting not only for time, but for all eternity. Wisdom can also be derived from listening to direction from prophets of God. Much trial and error will be eliminated if our ears are diligently attuned to absorb these voices of experience. Putting our trust in the success of others, we proceed in strict obedience to those success patterns, often not sure of the need for such precision. Loving parents, still in the process of construction themselves, dedicate their lives to our meticulous instruction and help us begin a firm foundation. Experienced builders, our ward and stake leaders are given the stewardship of watching over our construction.<br><br>As our temple rises, we must be aware of our motives for its construction. How do these motives change our perception of the finished building? So far our start has been good. We have a foundation built upon the rock of Jesus Christ and the gospel. We are collecting excellent building materials, materials molded by our challenges. The construction of its walls is now beginning. We have rejected counterfeit blocks--although hollow and much quicker to assemble, they have been proven to crumble under the stress of their own weight, and their supplier is nowhere to be found.<br><br>Hopefully, as we stand back and look at the beautiful harmony and balance of the structure taking shape before us, we will not mistakenly take credit. Nor should we allow ourselves to be overcome by its beauty to the point that we are prompted to fashion gaudy embellishments to impress those looking on. If our vision is clear, the plaque hanging over the entrance to our edifice will dedicate its activities to the Lord, rather than providing aggrandizement to the builder's accomplishments.<br><br>Your building process must be selective; you will find a need to set priorities. Many of you have never owned a home of your own. Tucked away in your mind at this moment is a vision of your dream house. Each time you tour a home show, or view the latest in design, you update these plans in your mind; perhaps this time it is a swimming pool surrounded with rich redwood decking and luscious foliage. You have not yet come to the point of doing much about limiting those dreams, but there will come a day when fact comes face-to-face with fancy. As is true in the temple we are building, the fact is we can have almost anything we want, but we cannot have everything we want--choices must be made. Judgments are not always between good and bad but sometimes between good and better. Goals must be determined. Time and energy must be reserved consistently in the development of talents toward those goals, giving up or sacrificing some things to gain others, delaying minor pleasures today in favor of major satisfactions tomorrow. The act of today is the parent of tomorrow.<br><br>We plant wheat to harvest wheat. We plant tomatoes to grow tomatoes. If we plant wheat in a field, that field will not produce tomatoes. If we plant obedience to gospel laws, we will reap spirituality and a refinement in our lives. If we allow drugs to dominate our lives, we will become addicts and potentially reap all the side effects: loss of job, financial difficulty, divorce, sadness, and depression. "Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap" (Galatians 6:7).<br><br><i>For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.</i><br><br><i>A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an</i><br><br><i>evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.</i>[Luke 6:44–45]<br><br>You have determined that the temple is patterned after a master blueprint, you have the tools, you have begun a foundation attached firmly to the rock of the gospel. Materials are stacking up awaiting appropriate application. Now the building begins in earnest, a building which cannot rise without the builder--each one of<i>you. You</i>are now ready for the challenges of applying these building materials--at the same time developing new skills and refining others.<br><h2><b>Our Role in the Construction</b></h2><br>We are talking about the most important component necessary to<i>b</i>uild<i>y</i>our<i>u</i>nderstanding--it is the "you" in "your." Through tremendous exertion of every fiber of<i>your</i>being, every thought of<i>your</i>mind, and feeling of<i>your</i>heart,<i>your</i>temple will rise in splendid glory. The all-encompassing dedication required to reach such a goal will require<i>your</i>singleminded obedience and much sacrifice,<i>your</i>complete faith in the master builder,<i>your</i>concentrated study of the scriptures,<i>your</i>charity and willingness to serve,<i>your</i>dedicated determination, and, very important,<i>your</i>solicitations of a willing Father in Heaven, waiting to respond to your petitions.<br><br>In the Garden of Eden, after Adam and Eve had partaken of the forbidden fruit and were expelled from the presence of the Lord, the Father asked, "Where art thou?" not because the Father needed to know--he already knew--but because Adam needed to face the question. And so<i>,</i>as builders of a precise structure, we must realize that it is our individual task to build our own temple, a task which will wait until we address the task--making evaluations and setting goals, making time to assess our efforts, being certain to return often to the blueprints our Father has given us, setting new priorities if necessary. We must know where we are.<br><br>If this is to be<i>your</i>building, then what are to be<i>your</i>payments? As part of our tools and building materials, we have available baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost, priesthood ordinances, and much, much more. How many dollars would each of these items be worth to you, payment to be made in advance, of course? The world's way is to ask for money; the Lord's way asks for a different kind of payment. Alma said, "Whosoever will come may come and partake of the waters of life freely" (Alma 42:27). Then what is it the Lord requires? In D&amp;amp;C 64:34 we are instructed: "Behold, the Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind."<br><br>The success of any person on this earth is largely determined by the attitude of the mind and heart. Studies have shown that successful individuals are not necessarily endowed with superior amounts of intellect or education, but they<i>are</i>persistent, and they<i>continue</i>in their persistence day by day.<br><br><i>Your</i>attitude is of extreme importance. Let's listen in on a conversation and the thoughts of a traveler.<br><br><i>While driving through California, I decided to take a detour across Death Valley. I had been warned not to risk getting stranded. So before tackling the valley itself, I pulled into the last lonely filling station to stock up with gas.</i><br><br><i>The solitary proprietor of the gas station was long, lean, rangy and laconic. His face had been tanned to saddle leather.</i><br><br><i>I reached my hand out of the window to feel the side of the car and withdrew it sharply with smarting fingertips.</i><br><br><i>"If it's like this in April," I said, "how high does the mercury go in summer?"</i><br><br><i>"Hundred-forty, hundred-fifty, mebbe."</i><br><br><i>"Do you mean in the shade?"</i><br><br><i>He grinned, his eyes screwed up in a sardonic twinkle, "Ain't no shade," he said.</i><br><br><i>Looking around, I had to admit he was right. "Don't suppose many cars come through here in the summer?"</i><br><br><i>"Nope. That'll be three forty-five."</i><br><br><i>"What do you do, then, in the summer?" I asked, fishing a five-dollar bill out of my wallet.</i><br><br><i>"Prospectin'," he answered. "Gold, silver, pumice, anything I can find. Reckon I put in around fourteen, sixteen hours a day at it, all summer long.</i>"<br><br><i>"My," I said, "that sounds like pretty hard work. "</i><br><br><i>"Tain't," he replied. He hesitated as though to add something but then went to get my change. By the time he came back he had evidently corralled his thoughts in words.</i><br><br><i>"Guess nothin's really hard work," he said, "unless you'd sooner be doin' somethin' else.</i>"<br><br><i>He counted out into my hand a silver dollar, a quarter, two dimes and two nickels. I must have been too hot to take in what he said. It wasn't until I'd driven as far as Badwater and got out for a few moments to peer into the small stagnant pool which must have dashed the hopes of so many thirsty pioneers, that I realized that he had handed me, along with those fugitive coins, a lasting piece of wisdom--a nugget of purer gold than any he had ever dug out of the hills.</i><br><br><i>"Guess nothin's really hard work," he said, "unless you'd sooner be doin' somethin' else."</i>[Jan Struther,<i>This Week</i>]<br><h2><b>Man Must Hope</b></h2><br>The challenges of life here on earth are perhaps even at this moment weighing down upon many of you. Often these obstacles to our building process seem overwhelming, especially if we must struggle with them daily.<br><br>May I share with you a story about some yellow chrysanthemums. One morning my wife and I were glancing out onto our patio. Sister Fyans and I live in a high-rise condominium, so our patio is ten stories off the ground. A southern exposure filled the room with the beautiful blue of the sky and the warmth of the morning sun. We were noticing the beauty of a brilliant yellow chrysanthemum plant in full bloom. Admiring its beauty, Helen reminded me I had given her this plant earlier that spring. It had bloomed and shared with us the radiance of its beauty. As the blooms fell, the leaves, too, shriveled and dried. What was left of these beautiful flowers was placed in the corner of the patio where they remained unattended. The forgotten plant remained there for several months with no life discernible at all.<br><br>Late that summer, as we were cleaning the patio, we noticed this pot. Helen had cut back the now brown stems and placed it in a spot where it would be convenient to water. She had heard that chrysanthemums could bloom a second time in the fall if they were properly nurtured. As the care and watering continued over a period of time, we noticed a few very small green sprouts coming out through the soil. This excited us to see life once again return. The response to our care encouraged us to the point that from then on the plant received regular watering and plant food. Each day we anxiously watched this beautiful plant return to its full glory. Several more weeks went by, and this particular day, as we gazed at this beautiful plant which was again sharing its splendor with us, Helen informed me she had counted fifty-three blossoms.<br><br>At some point in time that chrysanthemum plant, stuck in a corner and forgotten, may be an exact analogy of your heavy heart as it struggles with a problem or experience. Don't ever give up--no matter how brown the leaves and brittle the stems. There is an abundant life that needs nutrients from the soil of the gospel and the moisture from heaven--life is eternal. The thirteenth article of faith tells us that<i>"we</i>[must]<i>hope</i>all things." Ether 12:32 says "man must hope." Moroni asked, "How ... can [ye] attain unto faith, save ye shall have hope?" (Moroni 7:40). Hope and faith are attitudes of the mind and the heart upon which are based all our actions.<i>Building your understanding</i>is a process, not an event. With diligent, consistent effort, precept upon precept will allow that<i>hope</i>to swell.<br><h2><b>Developing Greater Understanding</b></h2><br>In Proverbs 2:2 and 4:7 we are told, "Apply thine heart to<i>understanding"</i>and "With all thy getting get understanding." So far we have been diligent builders, following the blueprint, relying upon the Spirit for direction. But when does the<i>understanding</i>come?<br><br>About a year ago a new word processor was delivered to my office. The libraries in that word processor were blank, it was up to us to fill them with whatever we saw fit. Document after document was inputted into the computer. Most of my talks and reference material for future talks are slowly building. This base will continue to broaden, week after week, year after year. Tremendous amounts of information are just waiting--waiting for what? This word processor has the capability to search through its memory banks for every reference it has ever been fed on a given word. In seconds I can have a list of documents to illustrate an important point. Information recorded line upon line, precept upon precept, all comes together at the precise moment that is most meaningful in my life.<br><br>We can compare ourselves to a computer consuming vast amounts of information in one day, or even in an hour, not all of it by choice. Living at this point in time on the earth, men and women today know more about the world and what goes on around it than even the most informed citizens of the past. For example, in a recent hour of television news, viewers saw reports about terrible earthquakes in Chile, accounts from the war zones of Nicaragua and from Iran, reports of comments made by the president as seen in the Oval Office, scenes of a fire in Provo, and views of an ancient Indian ruin in southern Utah. This passive input of thoughts and facts could be compared with an experience you may have had as you relaxed on a chair somewhere in the Wilkinson Center just watching all the people going by. Our lives can just go by also and we will have absorbed only that which passed as we sat. But we have been given our agency to determine for ourselves what we desire to incorporate into our understanding, thus implementing it into our thinking and action patterns. Our minds are only actively thinking a very small percentage of the time--most often we allow our thinking process to remain neutral, taking in only what passes by. At the end of seventy years or so upon this earth, we<i>all</i>will have a greater understanding than when we entered. But I would like you to comprehend what it will take to<i>build your understanding</i>to its full potential, looking forward to some circumstance in your future life when information recorded line upon line, precept upon precept, will all come together at the precise moment that is most meaningful.<i>Your</i>mind must envision<i>your</i>temple and the process of building, complete in detail. Aspirations are forces that drive us toward understanding.<br><br><i>What we aspire to be, that in some measure we already are; what we deeply desire to possess, we have in some degree already acquired. If we are possessed of an ideal, it must be because we have in us the possibility of it. God does not put into wild geese the instinct to go south for the winter without a south to go to. We may see our ideas as surely as the sculptor sees the finished face in the rough marble even before he has taken up the chisel.</i><br><br>Someone has said: It is not so much how much you see as what you learn from what you see. It is not so much how much you learn as what you do with what you learn from what you see as you go--wherever you plan to go!<br><h2><b>Enlarge Your Soul</b></h2><br>Alma compares understanding to a seed:<br><br><i>Now, if ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves--It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me.</i>[Alma 32:28]<br><br>With an eternal plan, and with day-by-day determination, at the end of your life here on this earth you will be able not only to<i>understand</i>that plan, but you will be able to<i>feel</i>that plan with every fiber of your being. You will have become one with the plan, just as the Father and the Son have become one with the plan and with each other. Any action in which you now engage will be in complete harmony with the plan--your temple is as complete as is possible upon this earth, the doors are open and, as the Lord approaches and enters your temple, you are invited to walk with him. "Come and dwell with me forever," he will say. Will it be worth the waiting, the sacrificing, the tedious day-by-day building? "Well done, thou good and faithful servant. Come and dwell with me" (see Matthew 25:21).<br><br>The Apostle Paul said to the Corinthians, "Ye are God's building. ... But let every man take heed how he buildeth" (1 Corinthians 3:9–10).<br><br>You and I are more than just a building. Paul explains: "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?" (1 Corinthians 3 :16).<br><br>As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, restored in our day, we are fortunate that our years as young adults need not be spent in drafting our own blueprint from the philosophies of men. We are so fortunate to have such tools of perfection as a reasoning mind and the agency to use it, plus all the expertise provided by the principles and ordinances of the gospel, plus the priesthood of God, the power to act in his name. A lifetime of opportunities and challenges will provide the building blocks for your understanding, one block at a time. Assistance is offered in the form of personal revelation from the master builder. The voice of the prophet, as well as the voices of other experienced builders, provides tried and true methods of temple building. The councils in heaven terminated with a resolution that each soul would have his agency.<br><br>The application of the plan, the procedure used to collect tools and building materials, is left up to the individual builder. In no other way can we build our understanding, or be able to determine the good from the evil. In no other way can we know joy. While the Father's plan is specific, as is any blueprint for any building, much of the application of its design is left up to his individual children--there are no tract temples. Obedience to his plan requires sacrifice, hope, faith, and determination with specific goals.<br><br>Enjoy building your temple. Remember the wisdom of the prospector, "Guess nothing's really hard work, unless you'd sooner be doin' somethin' else." When your building becomes especially laborious, bring to your mind the hope of my yellow chrysanthemums. Hope is the perfect place to begin to B–Y–U,<i>build your understanding.</i><br><br><i>And the light which shineth, which giveth you light, is through him who</i>enlighteneth<i>your eyes, which is the same light that quickeneth your</i>understandings. [D&amp;amp;C 88:11; emphasis added]<br><br>Jesus is the Christ--he is the beacon to light our way back to the Father. Use the fuel of<i>building your understanding</i>to propel yourself into the presence of the creator of the universe, the source of all light and truth. May you arrive in peace, I pray humbly in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>J.

<h1>ament of Bruce R. McConkie - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<i>For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.</i><br><br><i>For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.</i>[Hebrews 9:16, 17]<br><br>Elder Bruce R. McConkie's life was a testament, which is to say his life was an expression of his conviction of Christ as well as a tangible proof of the reality of Christ. Rarely has a man's life been so completely intertwined with his powerful message that his death, though natural, almost seemed to seal that testimony with his blood. The testator is dead. His testament will become even more powerful in the years to come.<br><br>Elder McConkie's life seemed so welded to Christ that one would expect that He was there to welcome him with the words, "Bruce, Bruce, not once were you ashamed of me, not once! Enter thou into my rest."<br><br><i>Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;</i><br><br><i>Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.</i><br><br><i>For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.</i><br><br><i>For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.</i><br><br><i>And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;</i><br><br><i>But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.</i>[Hebrews 3:1–6]<br><br>As Moses was faithful in his house, and his life of faithfulness became a testimony to Christ, so has Elder McConkie been faithful in his house and has held fast the confidence and rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.<br><br>I believe with all my heart that Elder McConkie stepped from his own bed at home with his family, who at his request on his deathbed prayed for his release the very moment he passed to the other world, into the mansion of Jesus Christ in a glory and peace which passeth all understanding.<br><br>But he left with us his ringing testimony and his firm example which we should never forget. May I tonight capsulize and recall to our minds the keys of that testimony. Our loss is the gain of another and holier sphere.<br><br><i>Oh strong soul, by what shore</i><br><i>Tarriest thou now? For that force,</i><br><i>Surely, has not been left vain!</i><br><i>Somewhere, surely, afar,</i><br><i>In the sounding labor-house vast</i><br><i>Of being, is practised that strength.</i><br>[Parley A. Christensen,<i>All in a Teacher's Day</i>(Salt Lake City: Stevens and Wallis, Inc., 1948), p. 251]<br><br>Our loss will be the less if we remember and do as he taught by precept and practice. These remarks are dedicated to the proposition that a grateful church will not forget.<br><br><b>"I Want to Be Worthy of Rest"</b><br><br>I remember this conversation between a fictitious father and son from Potok's<i>The Chosen.</i><br><br><i>"Reuven, do you know what the rabbis tell us God said to Moses when he was about to die?"</i><br><br><i>I stared at him. "No," I heard myself say.</i><br><br><i>"He said to Moses, 'You have toiled and labored, now you are worthy of rest.'"</i><br><br><i>I stared at him and didn't say anything.</i><br><br><i>"You are no longer a child, Reuven," my father went on. "It is almost possible to see the way your mind is growing. And your heart, too. Inductive logic, Freud, experimental psychology, mathematizing hypotheses, scientific study of the Talmud. Three years ago, you were still a child. You have become a small giant since the day Danny's ball struck your eye. You do not see it. But I see it. And it is a beautiful thing to see. So listen to what I am going to tell you.</i>"<i>He paused for a moment, as if considering his next words carefully, then continued. "Human beings do not live forever, Reuven. We live less than the time it takes to blink an eye, if we measure our lives against eternity. So it may be asked what value is there to a human life. There is so much pain in the world. What does it mean to have to suffer so much if our lives are nothing more than the blink of an eye?" He paused again, his eyes misty now, then went on. "I learned a long time ago, Reuven, that a blink of an eye in itself is nothing. But the eye that blinks,</i>that<i>is something. A span of life is nothing. But the man who lives that span,</i>he<i>is something. He can fill that time span with meaning, so its quality is immeasurable though its quantity may be insignificant. Do you understand what I am saying? A man must fill his life with meaning, meaning is not automatically given to life. It is hard work to fill one's life with meaning.</i>That<i>I do not think you understand yet. A life filled with meaning is worthy of rest. I want to be worthy of rest when I am no longer here. Do you understand what I am saying?"</i>[Chaim Potok,<i>The Chosen</i>(New York: Simon and Schuster, 1967), pp. 216–17]<br><br>Elder McConkie's life was filled with meaning. Years of toil late into the night and in the early morning hours filled it with meaning.<br><br>What was that meaning? It will be a personal or individual meaning for all who knew him either in person or through the written or spoken word. But for me, that meaning will now be summarized. If you will make a note of my major points, I will teach you an interesting point by my method of presentation.<br><h2><b>Bruce R. McConkie, The Testator</b></h2><br><b>First,</b>he traveled the full length of the path of his mortal life giving his all to the Lord, and thus he taught us what it means to truly endure to the end.<br><br>Once he wrote,<br><br><i>To gain the promised inheritance in the celestial world it is necessary to travel the length of the path, a course of travel which consists in obedience to the laws and principles of the gospel. This process is called</i>enduring to the end,<i>meaning the end of mortal life.</i>[<i>MD,</i>p. 228]<br><br>Elder McConkie and Elder Haight were assigned to the twelve-stake conference in Santa Barbara, California. We met to plan the conference in Elder Haight's office. I was the junior member of the team. Elder McConkie's only request was that we do what would be most convenient for the people of the twelve stakes. So we planned two four-hour leadership meetings on Saturday, one in Chatsworth and one in Santa Barbara, one hundred miles away. Sunday would find us doing two two-hour meetings on the University of California, Santa Barbara, campus. We would return the one hundred miles to Los Angeles and arrive home about midnight. Elder Haight, ever solicitous of Elder McConkie, protested, but bowed to the senior apostle.<br><br>I saw him that week in the General Authority dining room. "John, let's go preach the gospel," he said with obvious enthusiasm. He anticipated the chance to once more teach and exhort the Saints.<br><br>On the Friday night before the conference, Shirley and I met Bruce and Amelia McConkie and David Haight at the Burbank airport. Elder McConkie was completely exhausted. He had just had his chemotherapy shot. (Incidentally, Sister McConkie says that his doctor, who was not a member of the Church, did not quite know how to take Bruce. She said he would walk in on Friday for his shot, roll up his sleeve, and say, "Seven more days of life, Doc!")<br><br>After we met at the airport that night, Elder McConkie went straight to bed without dinner. Over dinner, Amelia shared with us his cooperative disdain for the illness which was obviously consuming him. I think it was she that bore the brunt of his pending date with the Savior. For him, this is the way he would describe it, "It makes not a particle of difference whether I preach the gospel here or in the world to come. I will preach the gospel."<br><br>Many felt he was never more powerful than he was at that conference, nor was there a finer regional conference than that on Saturday and Sunday in Chatsworth and Santa Barbara. He was back where his father Oscar McConkie had presided in such power, which I remember well because I was one of the young people who was greatly influenced by his father. The stake president in Santa Barbara, Gerald Haws, was one he had installed, and Jerry's father had been a district president in the same area serving with Oscar McConkie.<br><br>Experiencing some difficulty with the sound on Sunday, he grasped the microphone on the podium and pulled it close to his mouth. "I didn't come all this way not to be heard," he announced. Everyone heard and everyone understood his message of salvation.<br><br>We drove back to Los Angeles and awaited the late arrival of our flight to Salt Lake City. In the airport many recognized him and Elder Haight and spoke to both of them. He could travel to no location in the world without being recognized. He and all of the rest of us were tired as we arrived in Salt Lake City at midnight.<br><br>On Tuesday following that exhausting weekend, I saw him at the office. "How are you feeling?" I asked. He jumped instantly into the air, clicked his heels, and exclaimed, "Great!"<br><br>You saw and heard him at general conference. You saw a man as close to having one foot on the earth and another in paradise as you are likely to see. Once more he raised his voice to proclaim his testimony of and allegiance to Jesus the Christ. Soon he would join his Savior, but he must endure to the end. This he did with courage and power beyond anything I have witnessed. He never returned to his ministry after that talk.<br><br>A man who endures to the end is worthy of rest. Elder McConkie has earned a great respite from the battles of mortality. But he loved every minute of his term here. What lessons he taught us by both precept and example!<br><br><b>Second,</b>as a latter-day apostle with authority and power from on high, he spoke as one having authority and not as the scribes.<br><br>Matthew told us that the people who heard Jesus were astonished, "For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes" (Matthew 7:29).<br><br>The scribes or lawyers of Jesus' day never taught on their own authority, but on the authority of ancient wise men.<br><br>Using the power of the holy priesthood and the office of apostleship, Elder McConkie raised a powerful authoritative voice from countless pulpits wherever his worldwide travels took him.<br><br>While Elder McConkie was on assignment to change the stake presidency during Christmas of 1983, I was the mission president visiting that stake conference. I introduced him to my traveling companion, Pastor Wally Cooper, an ordained Baptist minister in Ammon, Idaho. On Sunday after conference, Elder McConkie greeted Pastor Cooper and me with these words: "Pastor Cooper, why don't you be baptized by a legal administrator?" Pastor Cooper replied, "That is a good idea." Elder McConkie continued. Sticking his finger in my chest, he said, "Why don't you let President Carmack, who is a legal administrator, baptize you?" Then, turning to me, he said, "Can't you find a font open somewhere today, John?"<br><br>I think some of our missionaries here today could quote verbatim his talk to new mission presidents. "The Lord wants convert baptisms. The Lord wants people to join his Church."<br><br>His voice was one of authority, knowledge, and power, a powerful special witness of Christ. "For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?" (1 Corinthians 14:8). The trumpet of Elder McConkie had a certain sound.<br><br>As a young missionary in Montana in 1952, I remember his word's spoken as a touring General Authority as clearly as though it was yesterday. "A missionary day starts at 6:00 a.m. And if you don't get up by training and habit and practice, you get an alarm clock and set it at six o'clock, and when it goes off you turn it off and get up." One could not misunderstand this man.<br><br>During a meeting of the Butte District priesthood leaders, which he held as part of that mission tour, he opened the meeting for questions. Young Russell Taylor, now a General Authority, was the resident gospel expert and scripturalist in Butte. He asked Elder McConkie how Joseph and Oliver could be elders<i>in the Church</i>since they were ordained by Peter, James, and John<i>before</i>the Church was organized in 1829, the Church not being organized until April 6, 1830. Elder McConkie answered, "Well, they presented them to the Saints after the Church was organized and ordained them again as elders in the Church. Next question?"<br><br>Elder Taylor persisted, "That sounds logical, Elder McConkie, but what is your authority?" "Well, you can quote me. Next question?"<br><br>Yes, firm and unshakable as the mountains around us, stalwart and brave he stood. He spoke as one with authority, certain of the ground he stood on.<br><br>Yet, on one occasion, he stated an opinion which was found not to be true concerning the time the priesthood would be extended to all men. His answer was simply, "I was wrong." A prophet may have a wrong opinion and a man of God with great confidence in his place in life simply admits it, quickly and firmly, and moves on unruffled and secure.<br><br>He spoke as one having authority.<br><br><b>Third,</b>and of highest importance, his central message was of Christ, His center-stage place in the universe and His atoning sacrifice.<br><br>He summarized:<br><br><i>Nothing in the entire plan of salvation compares in any way in importance with that most transcendent of all events, the atoning sacrifice of our Lord. It is the most important single thing that has ever occurred in the entire history of created things; it is the rock foundation upon which the gospel and all other things rest. Indeed, all "things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it."</i>[<i>MD,</i>p. 60]<br><br>He staked out his position on Christ and his mission. He made it central and returned to this theme over and over. When I was a missionary, he spent two weeks with Sister McConkie touring our mission. He gave over twenty major sermons, each over an hour in length and none on the same subject. Not a note was in sight. Over and over he turned to Christ and aspects of His ministry.<br><br>Truly, the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy (see Revelation 19:10). If John was correct in his declaration of the spirit of prophecy, the theme of Christ in Elder McConkie's ministry was evidence that he was one of the Lord's prophets.<br><br>After years of service as a General Authority, he became an apostle. In his own words he declared: "Since the Lord laid his hands upon me, on October 12, 1972, by the hands of his servant, President Harold B. Lee, and ordained me to the holy apostleship, I have had but one desire--to testify of our Lord's divine Sonship and to teach, in purity and perfection, the truths of his everlasting gospel"<i>(The Promised Messiah,</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1978], Preface).<br><br>How did he ever find time to be a busy member of the Council of the Twelve and also write those six large volumes on the life and ministry of Christ! Undoubtedly, early morning and late night lamps burned brightly in his study. The Spirit rested upon him as he wrote and testified of Christ.<br><br>Who in Idaho Falls could ever forget his hour sermon on the doctrine of Christmas delivered in December of 1983. His emotions were tied to Christ. On this subject he, a man of great control, was tender. To his last breath he testified of Him.<br><br><b>Fourth,</b>the power and authority of the latter-day gospel restoration was closely tied to the Book of Mormon as a second witness of Christ and the keystone of religion in the dispensation of the fulness of times.<br><br>How often he returned to Joseph Smith's diary statement that the Book of Mormon was the "keystone of our religion" and that we would "get nearer to God by abiding its precepts, than by any other book" (<i>HC,</i>vol. 4, p. 461).<br><br>He loved to cite the Lord's revelation to Joseph Smith in which the Lord told Joseph that "this generation shall have my word through you" (D&amp;amp;C 5:10). The Book of Mormon, then, would be our great source of knowledge and power during this great gospel dispensation.<br><br>Another favorite citation of Elder McConkie's was the advice of the Lord that "the elders, priests and teachers of this church shall teach the principles of my gospel, which are in the Bible and the Book of Mormon, in the which is the fulness of the gospel" (D&amp;amp;C 42:12).<br><br>Elder McConkie was a master of the scriptures--all of them. But he saw the Book of Mormon as our keystone scripture because it was held back and sent to us to restore the fulness of gospel truths lost in the Bible through a history of centuries and centuries of carelessness. He loved the Bible, but the Book of Mormon was crucial to religious understanding in our day.<br><br>He explained:<br><br><i>Almost all of the doctrines of the gospel are taught in the Book of Mormon with much greater clarity and perfection than those same doctrines are revealed in the Bible. Anyone who will place in parallel columns the teachings of these two great books on such subjects as the atonement, plan of salvation, gathering of Israel, baptism, gifts of the Spirit, miracles, revelation, faith, charity, (or any of a hundred other subjects), will find conclusive proof of the superiority of the Book of Mormon teachings.</i>[<i>MD,</i>p. 99]<br><br><b>Fifth,</b>as an expression of his confidence in the Church, and as a seer whose words light the pathway we must travel as we endure to the end of that path, Elder McConkie saw the road ahead and the kingdom as a moving caravan triumphantly moving to its destiny.<br><br>In October conference of 1984, Elder McConkie spoke in an eloquence worthy of a great latter-day seer:<br><br><i>The Church is like a great caravan--organized, prepared, following an appointed course, with its captains of tens and captains of hundreds all in place.</i><br><br><i>What does it matter if a few barking dogs snap at the heels of the weary travellers? Or that predators claim those few who fall by the way? The caravan moves on.</i><br><br><i>Is there a ravine to cross, a miry mud hole to pull through, a steep grade to climb? So be it. The oxen are strong and the teamsters wise. The caravan moves on.</i><br><br><i>Are there storms that rage along the way, floods that wash away the bridges, deserts to cross, and rivers to ford? Such is life in this fallen sphere. The caravan moves on.</i><br><br><i>Ahead is the celestial city, the eternal Zion of our God, where all who maintain their position in the caravan shall find food and drink and rest. Thank God that the caravan moves on!</i>[Bruce R. McConkie, "The Caravan Moves On,"<i>Ensign,</i>Nov. 1984, p. 85]<br><br>Here is a torch to light the way of the weary traveler who must endure to the end.<br><h2><b>Summary</b></h2><br>Now, I promised to teach the diligent among you an interesting point by the order and substance of my presentation on the testament of Bruce R. McConkie.<br><br>My summary in brief was:<br><br>1. We must follow the path to the very end and thus endure to the end.<br><br>2. As a latter-day apostle with power and authority from on high, Elder McConkie spoke as one having authority.<br><br>3. His central message was of Christ and His atoning sacrifice, which belonged in center stage.<br><br>4. The latter-day restoration of the gospel rests on the special and unique authority and power of the Book of Mormon, the keystone of religion in this great gospel dispensation.<br><br>5. The pathway we must travel to endure to the end was lighted by his seership as he likened our journey and the special role of the Church to a caravan which will reach its glorious destination despite trials on the way.<br><br>If you will think about it you will see that I have roughly used the ancient form of literary structure known as<i>chiasmus</i>or an "inverted type of parallelism" (John W. Welch, "Chiasmus in the Book of Mormon," in<i>Book of Mormon Authorship: New Light on Ancient Origins,</i>ed. Noel B. Reynolds, vol. 7,<i>Religious Studies Monograph Series</i>[Provo, UT: Religious Studies Center, BYU, 1982], p, 35).<br><br>There are five parts to the organization.<br><br>First and fifth are repeats of the theme of enduring to the end.<br><br>Second and fourth are repeats of the theme of authority and power in the latter-day dispensation of the gospel.<br><br>In the center is Elder McConkie's central theme of Christ.<br><br>So, I have emphasized the central theme by placing it in the center. I have emphasized other major points by repeating them in inverse order. This enables me to dramatize my points and also share with you the provocative and stunning findings of John Welch, Noel Reynolds, and others that this ancient literary form, used so extensively in the Bible (for example, Isaiah 55:8) is found by recent studies to be used abundantly in the Book of Mormon, This book is becoming more powerful as the years of study bear fruit. Elder McConkie loved the book and read it over and over during his life.<br><br>Finally, there is the rest of the story. Here was a man who was serious, even sometimes stern, and always a commanding person in public, but the easiest of humans to work with privately. When a knotty problem arose in a difficult committee assignment at Church headquarters, it was often said, "Let's take it to Bruce. We can find out if we're on the right track without any risk of criticism."<br><br>He was the possessor, as humble men often are, of immense goodwill and a marvelous sense of humor.<br><br>I remember well in American Falls, Idaho, in stake conference just as the general session was beginning, he spotted me way up in the back on the stand with my elders. He walked over to me and said, "John, it's good to see you in church."<br><br>In Los Angeles many years ago, while speaking to the single adults, he put his size fifteen shoes on the railing of the Hollywood Ward and said, "I used to be the tallest General Authority, but now the only thing I have to commend me is that I have the largest feet of all the Brethren."<br><br>The stories got around our mission of his distracting the attention of Sister McConkie during meals while he stole a bit of her dessert. She told the missionaries, "I think sometimes the only reason Bruce married me was so he could talk to Dad." (Her father was Joseph Fielding Smith.) "When we went to see Dad, he and Bruce were soon in the study deep in discussion about the gospel."<br><br>After his last speech to the fifteen-stake fireside at BYU, which was as always profound and great, he said to Elder Haight and me, "That was the worst talk I ever gave. I talked about things which the students were not interested in."<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>Well, such is my personal glimpse of the man, Bruce R. McConkie. I haven't seen his equal, except perhaps in his children and in his father and father-in-law.<br><br>I propose that we assembled here tonight resolve that:<br><br>1. We will endure well in our mortal probation and serve our fellowmen faithfully and in humility and good cheer to the very end of our lives.<br><br>2. We will seek to know and magnify our callings so we may speak as one having authority and not as the scribes.<br><br>3. At the very center of our lives will be the testimony of Christ. When our burdens become<br><br>unbearable, let us go to Him for succor.<br><br>4. We will rely on the authority, knowledge, and testimony of the great keystone scripture, the Book of Mormon, to gain the plain and simple truths of the fulness of the gospel.<br><br>5. We will see the caravan of the kingdom moving forward and lighting the pathway we must take as we endure to the end.<br><br>And, finally, that we will keep our personal lives full of simplicity, love, and good humor.<br><br>The testator is dead and the testament of Bruce R. McConkie is in force.<br><br>On my flight from the Bay Area to San Bernardino the day after his death, I wrote these words:<br><br><i>Elder Bruce R. McConkie is gone.</i><br><i>The loftiest tree in the forest has fallen, leaving us bereft of its shade.</i><br><i>A powerful voice, undiminished by the ravages of pernicious disease, has spoken its last great sermon, testifying one final unforgettable time of Jesus the Christ.</i><br><i>An era of leadership under Spencer W. Kimball, N. Eldon Tanner, Marion G. Romney, and Bruce R. McConkie is fast drawing to a conclusion.</i><br><i>We are bereft of our great ones.</i><br><i>But hearken, and see--mighty leaders are among us and will arise; and lo</i><br><i>Elder McConkie's measured cadence is heard, even now, with our spiritual ears, among the departed spirits.</i><br><i>There remain thousands of his pages to read, ponder, and understand,</i><br><i>As we read, we hear his voice of authority and power testifying of what he knows,</i><br><i>He counsels us that we should know, worship, and obey.</i><br><i>His example of courage, scholarship, and simplicity yet lights our path.</i><br><i>Unpublished manuscripts await us, testifying of God's mercy in sparing him for a season.</i><br><i>The limitless good of his ministry rolls onward, washing distant shores as the waves of a deep eternal sea.</i><br><i>Father, God, we thank thee that we shared mortality with such as he.</i><br><i>Through him we learned to distinguish truth and error.</i><br><i>By him we were raised in mind and spirit to reverence thy Son.</i><br><i>In his humble example, we have been encouraged to establish homes and raise families where love and gospel truths rule in natural simplicity.</i><br><i>The picture is incomplete without his Amelia, "an help meet for him" (Genesis 2:18, Moses 3:18).</i><br><i>We are indeed bereft,</i><br><i>But we are ennobled, exalted, and edified by our friend, brother, and leader.</i><br><i>"Oh give thanks unto the God of Heaven: for his mercy endureth forever!"</i>(Psalms 136:26).<br><br>I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>John K.

<br>
<h2><b>God-Given Gifts</b></h2><br>The subject I would like to address this morning is entitled "My Book of Life." Basic to my book of life and to your book of life is the fact that each one of us has been endowed with a God-given ability to think and to make decisions. Our creative capacity and intelligence distinguishes us from all other forms of life on this earth. We are truly the sons and daughters of our Father in Heaven who is the Master Creator. As we know, "the glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36).<br><br>With our inherited gift of intelligence, our Heavenly Father has also given us a gift of choice known as "free agency." We are free to act for ourselves but must take the responsibility for those decisions (see 2 Nephi 10:23). This capacity to knowingly choose for ourselves is according to the Lord's great master plan for all of his children.<br><br>By using your gift of intelligence and your gift of choice, you become responsible for your life. Each day decisions must be made. These decisions are recorded either in memory or in your personal book of remembrance, or possibly in a heavenly book. Day by day, page by page, your book continues to grow. These pages are assembled into chapters, and the summation of these chapters becomes your book of life.<br><br>As you finish your book of life here on this earth, you move on to another life. Just as one chapter in this life fades into another, so your mortal life, as it ends, fades into another. Each ending is but a new beginning.<br><br>You should remember that your book of life largely forms the basic material the Lord will use in his final judgment as he considers your life in relationship to the many variables that affected your life. It will be your basic record.<br><br>Some of the pages in your book of life may not speak well for you and might adversely affect the Lord's final judgment. We should be eternally grateful for another heavenly gift called "repentance," and especially to the Lord Jesus Christ for his atoning sacrifice which makes "repentance" possible. With that gift you can erase part or all of the undesirable pages in your book of life or remove them completely. This gift can make of your book of life a positive, wholesome, and complete record forming a witness of a happy, well-lived life. Repentance should not be delayed or procrastinated.<br><h2><b>A Wonderful Chapter in My Book of Life</b></h2><br>As I have studied my personal book of life, I have found that it divides approximately into five-year chapters. This very month of May is bringing to an end my present chapter and marks the beginning of a new chapter. It is an appropriate time for this change since tomorrow is my birthday. I appreciate this well-attended celebration of my birthday very much. It will be long remembered.<br><br>This new chapter coming up will actually begin as we move to Tokyo, Japan, to begin serving in the Asian presidency with responsibilities in Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Malaysia, India, and many other areas in the Pacific. We learned of this new calling directly following general conference. We are preparing to leave the first of August. My wife will serve as an Area General Board representative of the Relief Society, the Primary, and the Young Women. This will truly bring about a significant change and a new and exciting chapter in my life.<br><br>The present chapter in my book of life, which also began in the month of May five years ago, brought a significant change in my life. It happened on May 21, 1980--almost five years ago to the day. It started with a telephone call to my architect office. A lady's voice asked for me and then referred me to Arthur Haycock, President Kimball's executive secretary. We exchanged pleasant greetings, and then Brother Haycock indicated someone else wanted to talk with me.<br><br>Can you imagine how I felt when President Spencer W. Kimball came on the line and said: "Brother Wilcox, you haven't been in to see me recently." I responded that I would like to drop in but didn't think I ought to take his time. He thought it would be well if I did come in, so we arranged for a meeting on Friday at 2:00 p.m.<br><br>When I walked into the Church Administration Building, I really received red carpet treatment as soon as it was learned that I had a date with President Kimball. After entering his office, he came around the desk and embraced me. He kissed me on both cheeks and asked me to sit in a comfortable chair next to his desk. He expressed his interest in my practice as an architect and wanted to learn more concerning the design of the Washington Temple and the Missionary Training Center. President Kimball had dedicated these buildings and had a great interest in both projects. This led to a very interesting conversation. He then asked me whether I had wondered for what purpose I was visiting with him. I let him know that this had occurred to me. He replied, "We would like you to serve as president of the Ogden Temple and your wife to be the matron. Can you both accept?" I did as you would have done. I let out a little gasp, thought for a moment, and then replied, "Yes, we are prepared. We can accept. When do you wish us to begin?"<br><br>The reason that I could be so prompt in responding to this call is that my wife and I had each received a witness a few months before that this would happen.<br><br>My wife and I love to go to the temple. We usually attend at least once a week. One afternoon we were sitting in an endowment session, enjoying it fully, when it was as if a voice spoke to me to let me know that I was to be the next president of that temple. I was startled. I couldn't concentrate on anything after that. On the way out of the temple I asked how long the current president had served and was told that it had been four years. This relieved me somewhat. I thought that temple presidents served for five years. Later, I found out these calls were from three to five years. I did not sleep well that night. The impression would not leave my mind.<br><br>The next day my wife, Viva May, and I went for a drive up to our Ogden Valley cabin. On the return trip I had an impulse and pulled over to the side of the road. I told Viva May that I had something to share with her and said: "I believe that we are going to be called into the temple as president and matron."<br><br>Her response was different. In fact, she laughed. Then I found out why. At the same time I had received my impression of serving there, she also had been given a gift in her mind's eye of traveling all through the temple. She saw places she had never seen before, even though we had worked together very closely some years before when I served as general chairman of the public showing and dedication services for that temple. Because we had both received these experiences, it helped us to prepare to serve.<br><br>We had recently returned from presiding in the Indiana Indianapolis Mission. Instead of searching for new work in my newly re-opened practice of architecture and committing myself to projects I wouldn't be able to complete, we had taken steps to close the practice even before President Kimball's call because of the witness we each had experienced.<br><br>One question I asked President Kimball before leaving his office concerned my continuing to serve as a legislator in the Utah House of Representatives. I had filed for re-election and was unopposed. I told President Kimball I knew I could win. Did he have any suggestions for me? With a twinkle in his eyes, he said, "Yes, I would suggest you give your full time to this new calling." And that we did for nearly five years. It became another wonderful and spiritual chapter in my book of life.<br><h2><b>Lessons Through the Years</b></h2><br>As I look back at each of the five-year intervals that form the many chapters of my life, there were lessons learned within each chapter. Perhaps sharing a few of these lessons would be helpful to you as you create your own book of life.<br><br>At the end of my first five-year chapter, I came to realize what a blessing it was to have a loving father and mother. It was a great source of strength to have my mother at home with my brothers and me. As a little tyke I would often run into our home, walk up to my mother, and ask her if there was anything she needed. She would assure me that she was all right and that I could go back out to play some more. Actually, I just wanted to be real sure my mother was there. How grateful I am that she was always there. Her presence was basic to a happy and reassured childhood.<br><br>Our home on Lincoln Street in Salt Lake City was a place in which mother took great pride. When I drew a picture on her wallpaper, though, Mother didn't scold me. She didn't even erase it, but showed it with pride to everyone who came to our home. It was the artwork of her son.<br><br>My second and third five-year chapters were lived in Holladay, Utah, on a two-acre site situated on Wander Lane. How grateful I will always be to my folks for rearing us in a place where we could run, hunt, ski, and hike. My most vivid memories of those two chapters of my life are of Primary, Church, Scouting, and good friends. Mother was Primary president and Dad was one of our Scout leaders. What a blessing that was. As you rear your children, be an example to them so they will become strong leaders for tomorrow. Rear them in a loving atmosphere where they feel loved and secure to bring about a happy chapter in your book of life and also in theirs.<br><br>My third chapter was coming to an end when I was fourteen. I have memories of many friends, but some of those friends made my life difficult. They were my peer group. Some of those friends wanted me to do things that were contrary to what I had been taught in Sunday School and Mutual and at home. What a difficult summer I had resisting the pressures of those friends to try tobacco, beer, and other unwholesome things.<br><br>My heart goes out to young people of our day who have even greater peer pressures now with the insidious evils of our world aimed at them--evils including hard drugs, pornography, and immorality.<br><br>Two developments came to my rescue during my trial. The first was my patriarchal blessing. I remember the day I received it vividly. It took place in Hyrum, Utah. My grandfather's brother gave three blessings that day to my two brothers and to me. In my blessing I learned that I had lived before this life, and that there was a great mission and a life of usefulness lying before me. I also learned that I had, in spirit form, chosen the right and stood valiant for the mission of my Redeemer and the free agency of man. I was told that my spirit had been held in reserve to come forth in this day. I had been born of goodly parents under gospel rights. My patriarchal blessing became a guide to me then and for the rest of my life. It was revealed that the Lord expected me to be a standard-bearer among the people. My life was important to the Lord and I knew it.<br><br>The second factor that came to my rescue was a decision that took the entire summer to make. Should I take art, which I dearly loved, or seminary (whatever that was) as an elective at Granite High School? I finally selected seminary. Reluctantly, I went to my first class and sat slouching on the back row, almost defying the teacher to teach me anything. Before the class was over, I was sitting up and listening intently. The teacher was a master teacher. The next day I couldn't wait to get there. In fact, I sat on the front row. He began teaching the Old Testament. He made it come alive for me. As I listened, I began to illustrate all the great scenes that I could imagine as he taught of Moses leading the children of Israel out of Egypt. I created my own art course.<br><br>That master teacher was William E. Berrett, who later became one of the great leaders of the seminary-institute programs throughout the Church, with headquarters here at BYU.<br><br>I will always remember and be grateful that Brother Barrett, in teaching the Ten Commandments, made them a part of my life. They were more than ancient commandments. Honesty, integrity, honoring father and mother, morality, and the other commandments were meant for all people in all ages. These values became part and parcel of my life.<br><br>I could only attend that class for six months because my family moved to Ogden before the year was over, and seminary was no longer available. But that one class I did attend gave my life eternal direction and became basic to my book of life. I pray that these values can be found in your book of life.<br><br>My fourth and fifth five-year chapters involved my education. I had to choose between art, which I loved, and a more difficult subject called engineering. After much discussion with my professors, I decided to major in engineering. How thankful I am that I did so because it made a student of me. The subjects of mathematics, calculus, and the technical phases of engineering and related laboratory work caused me to study and to learn to think. Later, when I changed my profession to architecture, these subjects were extremely helpful. In these chapters of my book of life I learned the great value of education: both formal and personal study. I hope your book of life will always reflect your willingness to study and to learn.<br><h2><b>Vital Parts of My Life</b></h2><br>The sixth chapter of my book of life took place right here in Provo. I had married my college sweetheart in the Logan Temple and finished my assignment as an ensign in the navy at age twenty-five. I was offered an engineering job at Geneva Steel. This was a good experience where I gained professional perspective. It proved to be a good beginning point.<br><br>We found an apartment in Provo and enjoyed five delightful years in this beautiful city. During this time I was deciding what I wanted out of engineering and what I wanted out of art. I was offered an engineering job with a Provo architect, the late Fred L. Markham, who designed several of the BYU buildings. One of the projects of the firm was the Eyring Science Center, where I spent much of each day supervising the construction of that great building. I also became good friends with Dr. Carl Eyring, who taught me much of acoustics and physical science.<br><br>On the side I did some engineering work for those who were filing for patents on inventions. I also taught a class at Utah Technical School. With my art I started a cartoon strip called "Slim Pickens," a cowboy strip. The Provo<i>Daily Herald</i>liked it and so did the<i>Deseret News.</i>Both papers published my daily cartoons for over a year. They were really fun to write and draw.<br><br>Life was busy with a full-time job, two part-time jobs, a cartoon strip, and several Church jobs. But this chapter formed a foundation for my future as an architect in the art and profession that I really loved, but had not studied yet.<br><br>With the permission of my employer, Fred Markham, I decided to go back to school and study architecture. I took afternoon classes two days a week at the University of Utah while still holding down a full-time job. In three quarters I moved up to a fourth year level. With that much schooling behind me, I decided to "go for it." With two children by now and one on the way, we left for the University of Oregon to pursue my fifth year of architectural studies. As a full-time student, my progress came faster than expected. At the end of the first quarter I was moved into the graduate school and succeeded in earning a master of architecture degree by the end of the school year. Now I was ready to set up my own practice. I had the two degrees and finally was into the art that I loved.<br><br>Education has been an important and vital part of my book of life. I'm sure it is in yours, or you would not be here today. My experience taught me that education is the best investment possible in this life and a mission for the Church is the best part of that education.<br><br>The next four chapters of my book are filled with service in the Church, my family, and my twenty-year practice as a professional architect. I was called to serve as a bishop and later as a stake president. These were wonderful, busy, productive, and happy years.<br><br>As a stake president I sent out into the world 337 missionaries. I hadn't served a mission myself because of my service during the war. When I would interview a missionary from my stake, I would often say, "I wish I could go with you." Well, one day the Lord heard me. I received a call to serve as president of the Indiana Indianapolis Mission, just after President Kimball became president of the Church.<br><br>Since beginning my service as a mission president in July of 1974, my life has largely been given to Church service--the latest calling being that of a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy.<br><h2><b>Keeping My Priorities in Order</b></h2><br>One lesson has repeated itself in each chapter of my book of life. It is a very important lesson concerning priorities. I was fortunate to learn this lesson early. Yet it had to be relearned. Following my graduation from engineering school, while I awaited my naval commission, I worked a few months for Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Co. in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania. It was here that the truth of this lesson came through to me in such a way that I have never changed in giving my first priority to my family and my church.<br><br>Perhaps it was living in the world away from home that caused the Church to become very important to me. I had been concentrating on my schooling and graduation. Fraternity life hadn't helped. Now I was alone in the world. How welcome were those few members of the Church I met in a small branch in downtown Pittsburgh. Those members became immediate friends. And as I later traveled in the navy, I found such friends wherever I was stationed. How wonderful to have friends. Latter-day Saints everywhere are friends.<br><br>In the navy I was tested, as are all servicemen. But my fellow officers soon learned that I was completely serious about my church and the keeping of the Lord's commandments. My skipper practically ordered me to have lunch with him and found it humorous to order me a soft drink while he ordered his drink of liquor while standing at the bar. We were roommates during that time when we commissioned the ship. I discovered how much he admired my way of life when he asked me to serve on the ship as ship's chaplain as well as the engineering officer. This opened up opportunities for missionary work because the entire crew admired my way of life. It was a great opportunity.<br><br>I have found that I have never lost anything by living the commandments. A person can be friendly and yet resist evil among those with whom he associates. Example is the best teacher.<br><br>Shortly after my release from naval service, I accepted an engineering position at Geneva Steel. There were few Church members in that department. The plant had been built just prior to the war, and technical people generally had to be imported. After a few weeks I learned that there was to be a drinking party. All members of the department were expected to attend. When approached, I indicated that I did not plan to attend. This shocked the person approaching me.<br><br>Soon the manager of the engineering department came to see me personally. I wondered if this would terminate my employment. He walked up to my desk and told me that he had heard that I wasn't planning on attending his party. I told him that was right. He asked me why. I told him I was a Latter-day Saint and didn't drink and would just be in the way. He thought a few moments and observed that I would probably be the only sober one there. Then he told me I could be very helpful to him. He asked me to serve as the chairman of the party, since I would be sober. He asked me to arrange for the dinner and the entertainment and other details. They would take care of the liquor. He told me that when the party started getting rough, my wife and I could slip out and go home. He didn't want to embarrass us. He asked me if I could help in this way.<br><br>I decided to accept this request. The other engineers and draftsmen soon began to notice that I had become the favorite of the boss. He knew I had principles and had the courage to live them. Instead of losing my job, I made very rapid headway.<br><br>I have found in each chapter of my life that keeping my priorities and not giving into the world has been a great asset. Another way of expressing this way of life is to determine to always say "yes" to the Lord and "no" to the world.<br><br>The Lord has expressed this great truth in scripture. In Matthew 6:33 he said, "But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you." And in the Doctrine and Covenants he said, "Seek the kingdom of God, and all things shall be added according to that which is just" (D&amp;amp;C 11:23).<br><br>My life has been blessed beyond my power to describe because of my willingness to live by my simple priorities. It became the basis by which I was lifted and made equal to the design of the last two major projects of my architectural career. These were the Washington Temple and the Missionary Training Center here at Brigham Young University.<br><br>Let me tell you briefly about the Missionary Training Center, which was then known as the Language Training Mission. I received a telephone call on August 30 of 1973 and was asked to design this great missionary center. Two other firms would assist in the preparation of documents once the design was finalized, but I was to design the center. As the work of design developed, I had to make a decision whether to postpone previously committed meetings in Florida, Alabama, Georgia, and the Caribbean, where I had been called to serve as Regional Representative, or to keep them regardless of the great need to design and construct this center as soon as possible.<br><br>I made my decision on the basis of my priorities. It was a hard decision. My relationship to the project was as a professional architect. My priority was to my church and my family ahead of my professional responsibilities. My work as a Regional Representative had to come first. There was much concern over this decision from those involved, since design was the first step and I had been entrusted with the design.<br><br>Then a marvelous thing happened. As I returned each week from my commitments there, even though quite exhausted, I received great surges of inspiration as I had in the design of the Washington Temple. Each week a major portion of the design developed, following my trips to the Florida area. By the end of October we were ready for the first presentation. It was well received by the directors and by BYU administration. After two additional weeks of refinement, the design drawings and a model were ready to present to the Church Education Department and to the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve, where it received complete approval. We were told to immediately begin working on drawings and specifications and did so by November 15. This creative period had required but two and one-half months. It was a miracle.<br><br>By the spring of 1974 this project, the largest in BYU history, was ready for bidding. My call as a mission president was received in April. On the very day I reported to my mission the ground was being broken for the construction of the Missionary Training Center. My partners carried on the supervision of construction. I had felt the Lord's blessings in this project and have a deep testimony that the surges of inspiration that I had experienced were a result of keeping my priorities.<br><br>My most important priority in my book of life has been my family. Our home has been graced by six beautiful daughters. There have been challenges, sickness, and struggles. We enjoyed the warmth of a wonderful family. Each daughter is now married to a returned missionary and each has the blessings of a temple marriage. When we go to the temple together we witness a little bit of celestial life here on this earth. That is what life is all about. Take time in your book of life to love and enjoy your family. Teach them correct principles. My counsel to you as a former temple president is to make the temple a continuing part of your life. Begin your married life with marriage in the house of the Lord.<br><br>It has been delightful to share some of the lessons I have learned over the years as recorded in my book of life. Use your God-given talents and creative gifts of intelligence and freedom of choice to write your book of life. Through proper repentance, erase or remove those pages which should not be kept.<br><br>I can promise you that living by simple priorities will bring joy and happiness now and in the eternities. Keep your church and family first in your life. Keep saying "yes" to the Lord and "no" to the world. Strive to live a Christ-like life of service.<br><br>I share with you my testimony that Jesus is the Christ and that his Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, was restored in our day through the Prophet Joseph Smith. President Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet. Your book of life will be an everlasting credit to you, if, day by day, week by week, and year after year, you will love the Lord, love your neighbor as yourself, and keep God's commandments.<br><br>I leave my love, my testimony, and my blessings with you, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Keith W.

<h1> in Christ Jesus, and Have No Confidence in the Flesh” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, I am coming to you today in a very contrite, humble spirit as I am feeling I should address you with some matters of a more delicate nature but which, in my estimation, are of basic importance. I hope that I will be capable of expressing my feelings without being misunderstood--knowing that this can easily happen as I am not expressing myself in my native language.<br><h2><b>Something of More Importance</b></h2><br>Some time ago, when I was living in the mission field, the missionaries invited me to come see a couple they had been teaching for some time. The missionaries reported to me what a choice couple they were. However, they were very much afraid to make the change and the commitment of baptism. As we entered the home of this wonderful family and found ourselves in their living room, I recognized their fear and anxiety over this visit. I understood that they had been taught the gospel, that they had received all of the discussions, and that they already had a testimony that the gospel is true. I felt prompted to ask them, "What do you think the Lord expects you to do when you enter into the bond of the covenant of baptism for the forgiveness of sins?"<br><br>I remember that the woman looked at him and the man looked at her with the sweetness of two wonderful persons in their first years of marriage, and finally he said, "I think we will have to pay our tithing." I remember that I answered, "Yes, that is true, but there is something of more importance. What do you think the Lord will expect you to do when you enter into this covenant?"<br><br>After some inquiring glances from her to him and from him to her, he said quite hesitantly, "We must give up our drinking, our coffee, and our smoking." Again I told him, "Yes, that is true, but there is something of more importance."<br><br>After we had discussed all the necessary requirements for baptism and I was still insisting that there was something of more importance, they became even more uneasy about what else there still was to do. I felt inspired to say to them, "I can see that you have learned to love the Lord and understand the basic principles of the covenant which you are about to make with him. Now the Lord wants you to take the Spirit, which will be given to you as his gift after baptism, and make it the greatest objective of your life--to let this Spirit be unfolded within you to its fullness of power. Thus, the Lord wants you both to love one another with an even deeper, more sensitive, caring love--a love of a new dimension that is different from the way the world knows--even to such a dimension that you will be overwhelmed by your insight, your patience, your caring, and sensitivity so that you will both be filled with a new dimension of joy and peace."<br><br>The expressions on their faces changed from fear, anxiety, and despair to relaxed smiles of rejoicing. He reached for her hand, looked dearly into her eyes, pressed her hand to his lips, and said with conviction, "I think we are ready."<br><br>My dear brothers and sisters, since the days of the earthly mission of our Lord and Master, Christians have known about the great commandments and the law that we must love the Lord our God with all our heart, with all our soul, and with all our mind, and love our neighbor as ourselves--but mankind is still awaiting its fulfillment! With the restoration of the gospel and the true Church, the Lord expects that the fulfillment of this commandment become the center of our lives. As we receive an understanding that it is not only the greatest commandment but that we need to be filled with this love to fulfill the many opportunities and challenges that life brings to us, and as we are filled with this love, we will stand without fear until the last day.<br><br>To love one another may not be everything, but everything will be nothing without this love. The love we are talking about is different from that which the world knows. So many of the people of the world will say, "I love you," but what they really mean is, "I want you, I lust after you." The love the Lord is speaking about is different. It is the love that always places the other person--the object of love--higher than one's self. As the Lord says in John 15:12–13:<br><br><i>This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.</i><br><br><i>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</i><br><br>As Nephi was inquiring to understand the dream of his father Lehi and was speaking with an angel as to the meaning of the tree of life which his father had beheld, he said: "It is the love of God, which sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men; wherefore, it is the most desirable above all things" (1 Nephi 11:22).<br><br>The "natural man," or the natural side of us, will never comprehend this, will never be able to understand it, because this love is a gift from above. It is a gift from our Heavenly Father--a gift of the Spirit that needs to be acquired and achieved on the condition of chastity, purity of thought, desire, and obedience to the covenants we have made with God. As we learn to fulfill these prerequisites, this love will be our constant companion and will be the only power to change the realities of this cruel world in preparation for the Second Coming of the Lord.<br><h2><b>A Wonderful Design from Heaven</b></h2><br>An essential part of the restoration of the gospel was to give an understanding that there is a purpose in why we were created separate, male and female--with each part to fulfill a certain purpose, a certain role that we have to see, to develop, and to stay within. Created as we are, we are only half. And born as we are as individuals, we will always have the feeling of being only half--of having lost something, but of needing to seek and to work and to serve in order to be worthy to become whole again.<br><br>Such feelings will be found within a virtuous young lady as she experiences the years of puberty with accompanying yearnings and desires. When a young woman is blessed with wise and worthy parents, she will be taught by them that she is unique, a choice daughter of our Heavenly Father, a woman who has been designed and prepared with the capability of giving life. This is the most important assignment and calling a woman can ever have, not only to give life but to preserve it, to train it, to comfort it, to nurture and strengthen it--all this that her children might stand in virtue, might stand in self-esteem, might stand in unity with divine sources. She will want these children to be filled with joy, satisfaction, fulfillment, and able to overcome all fear. She will want them to trust and know and be nurtured by the source of life itself--even the divine source--prepared for the creation of peace, unity, and fulfillment. She will be told by her wise parents that she is designed to be the crown of manhood (Proverbs 12:4).<br><br>Wise and worthy parents will teach their sons that<i>their</i>role is to respect, provide for, protect, care for, and give shelter and security to womanhood.<br><br>What a wonderful, masterful design! As we are separated in our own ways, virtues, talents, and gifts, we are harboring a longing for one another with tender feelings of admiration for someone who is mysteriously different, for someone who is mysteriously wonderful. What a wonderful, masterful design, because the Lord has given us in the times of our tender youth, as we remain clean in the virtues of chastity, a powerful demonstration of the sweetness of feelings of caring, of self-denying love.<br><br>Perhaps you will recognize yourself and recall your memories of youth as I share with you, with the permission of my wife, an experience I had when I was a young man in school and there was this young lady who caused a strange feeling within me. I cannot recall exactly how she looked or what kind of character she really had, but there she was. Just being in the same room with her made me so nervous and so helpless that I could hardly speak and hardly breathe for fear of making a fool of myself. My feelings for her were so tender that I could hardly avoid thinking of her. It seemed that in everything that I was doing, she was in my thoughts. What could I do to please her? Or even to save her life in giving my blood? What a wonderful way from our Heavenly Father--to be allowed to experience in the age of our tender youth the purity and strength of what divine love is made of!<br><br>After a year of experiencing these feelings and not being able to endure her presence and not even being able to speak to her out of nervousness, I was finally courageous enough at Christmastime to write her a very brief letter. As these were times of starvation in Germany and goodies were hard to come by, I saved the special treats I received for Christmas, overcoming my own craving for them in order to keep them as a present or a gift to her if she would answer my letter. But she never did! After three weeks of waiting in vain, I found myself back with my feet on the ground, and I devoured all the goodies in one quick action and brushed off the feelings for her that I had. It is interesting to note that as I found myself with my feet on the ground without this tender feeling, the desire and willingness to sacrifice or to go the extra mile for her sake also vanished. I often think that it was good that she did not write back so the way could be preserved for me to find my faithful, wonderful companion who is with me today.<br><h2><b>The Church as a Vital Instrument Providing the Light of Christ</b></h2><br>When a young person's maturity is reached, there is the likelihood of being confronted with the prospect of marriage. As we are converted to the gospel and endowed with the Spirit of the Lord, what are the thoughts that will go through our minds in preparation for this-- the most frightening, awesome, and beautiful experience of our mortal life? As both male and female are children of a loving Heavenly Father, both have the same destiny of being embodied in the matter of the flesh, which is "the natural man." As both embrace the gospel and keep the commandments and communicate with Heavenly Father, looking for his constant guidance and having him and his glory as their first thought, he will give them the strength to not follow the foolishness of "the natural man"--the carnal mind that is in us all. The Lord will give each of us the power to see and overcome temptations, false goals, and ambitions.<br><br>At this time we gain an understanding of the purpose of not only the restoration of the gospel with its principles and ordinances, but also the establishment of an institution--a Church where we can learn from one another through participation in various organizations, programs, and activities; where our learning grows as we serve and as we give and involve our lives. Through the teachings we receive in the Church, we will grow in our understanding. We will learn how the plan of salvation must have an impact upon our daily actions, how we can distinguish between what is true and false, the good and the bad, righteousness and selfishness, modesty and vanity.<br><br>To condense it into simplified terms, one might say that the Church in its organizations can be considered as the vital instrument to help the individual--not only to help him stay true to his covenants but, most of all, to provide an opportunity for him to learn to love, that his life will be filled with the Light of Christ, and that this Light will become the generating power for all the actions of his life.<br><br>Thus the Church is fulfilling the dream, the vision, and the hope of righteous people in the history of mankind so beautifully expressed by Meister Johannes Eckehart, a German monk who lived in the early fourteenth century:<br><br><i>That is the purpose of our creation--that we might, through our creative, reason-directed endeavors in our mortality, learn to approach God and to become more and more like him.</i>[K. O. Schmidt,<i>Meister Eckeharts Weg zum kosmischen Bewusstsein,</i>1969 ed. (Muenchen, Germany: Drei Eichen Verlag), p. 112]<br><br>We seem to have a tendency to see in the Church the things that we have to do--our duties and our responsibilities--and sometimes we miss seeing how the Lord expects that our first and foremost responsibility is to be filled with his light and his power, that we might receive strength and the capability to overcome "the natural man" within us. Then it will be a privilege, an opportunity, to do all our necessary work and assignments--giving of our time and talents without feeling burdened but with rejoicing, giving unconditional love in our relationships with our fellow men. So it was with the young couple who were so afraid of the many things expected of them that they felt baptism to be a threat. But, as we learn to strive to achieve the constant guidance of the Spirit as our first priority, everything becomes easy!<br><h2><b>Being Filled with the Light of Christ Is the Key</b></h2><br>A young woman who goes through the experience of this learning, encouraged by parents and the Church, will then understand, through the light of the Spirit of the Lord, that the beauty of<i>personality</i>and<i>character</i>is the beauty to be sought after. She will question the wisdom of the women of the world as they invest time and money to gild their faces with the colors of vanity and to dress their bodies with the fashion of lust. She will be proud to be a woman and never feel inferior or try to disguise her being a woman by competing with masculinity. She will love to be feminine and to develop her personality. As she is able to develop the radiating light of the spirit within herself, she will know that she need not be too concerned about her outward appearance, for she will always be admirable and will blossom and glow. She will understand the meaning of the warnings that the prophets have given the daughters of Zion:<br><br><i>And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty.</i>[Isaiah 3:24]<br><br>A young man, going through the same experience of this learning to strive first to be filled with the Spirit, encouraged by parents and the Church, will then understand what a privilege it is to remain chaste, preserved, and clean so that he is worthy when the time comes to be called to testify to the world of the Restoration--in so doing and in so giving, he receives. He receives maturity, insight, understanding, and depth and perfection of preparation--the preparation for life and for marriage. A young man, being filled with the light and power of Christ, will find it easy to obey all the covenants he makes with the Lord, and he will have the strength, the comfort, insight, and direction not to pursue the vain things of this world or to indulge in the falsely understood manhood of unrighteous dominion. He will see reason to constantly find new motivation to admire the true character of womanhood and to stand in awe and admiration of its uniqueness. He will be womanhood's protector, its provider, its benefactor, a learner, and will be blessed with the capability to understand and to forgive.<br><br>As they are united in marriage,<i>her</i>well-being will be the center of his concerns, as well as the world of<i>her</i>development and<i>her</i>fulfillment; in so doing it will be<i>her</i>natural inclination to take a deep interest and concern in the development of<i>his</i>individual life. She will enjoy creating an atmosphere of home and sacrificing her time to care about him. She will not have the feeling of having lost something, because his gain will also be her gain. Both can then become<i>one</i>in sharing, in communication, in admiring, and achieving. Thus, they will be interwoven together in times of joy, in times of pain, in times of achievement, and in times of failure. They will both know that marriage does not mean there will always be contentment and fulfillment but that it may sometimes be a thorn-strewn road of learning, growing, forgiving, understanding, of maintaining persistence, and, finally, of achieving and perceiving on the horizon of the other world the sweet fragrance of fulfillment.<br><h2><b>The Fruits of Selfishness</b></h2><br>As we learn to be always filled with the Light and Spirit of Christ, we will always be able to see the foolishness and the disaster of the self-centeredness of men. We can then see that selfishness, if not overcome, becomes the root of all diseases of our own lives, and it is the cause for the curse of destruction that is threatening the very existence of all mankind. Selfishness inflicts the bleeding wounds in our homes, as it does in the nations of the world. Selfishness and its false ambitions are a threat to our own security and are the cause of the abuses and the destruction of a livable life. We are being surrounded by the fruits of selfishness in our own environment. For example, in a recent<i>Deseret News</i>article (Mary Finch, "Sexual Abuses of Children Is Widespread, Expert Warns,"<i>Deseret News,</i>March 11, 1984, p. B1), a former Minneapolis, Minnesota, policeman is quoted as saying that in our hospitals more children are being treated for sexual abuse than for broken bones. The<i>Freemen Digest</i>reports that in America since 1960 there have been:<br><br><i>47 million divorces</i><br><i>550,000 deaths from drunk driving</i><br><i>18 million babies killed by abortion</i><br><i>366,000 murders</i><br><i>9.5 million illegitimate births</i><br>[Richard R. Viguerie, "Whatever Happened to America's 'Good' People?"<i>Freemen Digest,</i>December 1983, p. 10]<br><br>The Apostle Paul in the New Testament pronounced a warning about what would happen in the latter days, that there would be perilous times:<br><br><i>For men will be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</i><br><br><i>Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</i><br><br><i>Traitors, beady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</i><br><br><i>Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.</i>[2 Timothy 3:2–5]<br><br>My dear brothers and sisters, we are living in these times!<br><br>In the history of mankind the normal environmental circumstances were always favoring and protecting the family as a unit with a purpose. Just to provide the necessities of life required a man and woman to work long hours in close harmony together. There was the indisputable evidence of need--of sharing the burdens. Woman's role was concentrated on the home with its many challenging demands requiring much ingenuity. Inescapable circumstances forced a man to be the provider and to protect and care for the family as a whole. As there was no electricity, there was no detracting influence through media. As there were no cars and no motorcycles, there was no quick transportation to alien environments away from the home. There was the constant need for overcoming and enduring for just the purpose of survival. Circumstances allowed little room for idleness, vanity, or indulging in matters of the flesh. The absence of modern medicines and hospitals created a sensitivity to man's fragile nature and his being subject to pain and his dependency upon matters of a spiritual nature. But just in a few generations all of these circumstances have changed! As the opportunities for development of the individual have grown in unlimited dimensions, so have the opportunities of destruction, deceit, and errors grown in the same dimension.<br><h2><b>Our First Priority</b></h2><br>My dear brothers and sisters, let us become aware that we are living in very perilous times, that we are personal witnesses of how men's philosophies and religions have brought this world to the brink of literal destruction. The Lord has restored in a powerful manner through living prophets the knowledge of truth and the power of its fulfillment. As the Church is growing in strength and in wisdom and is reaching out to the hearts of truth-seeking, righteous people all over the world, we must never forget that our first priority and our constant endeavor must be to be filled in abundance with the Spirit of the Lord. Only when we are filled with the Spirit can we receive the direction, encouragement, strength, and motivation necessary to establish righteousness, not only in our own lives but in our communities and the nations throughout the world. As partakers of the Restoration, we are still small in numbers, but we are encouraged to show by the fruits of our lives that the truth is with us, that we have learned in our individual lives to overcome selfishness, that we do not seek for so-called self-fulfillment in our own lives based upon the sacrifices of others, but that we find our only self-fulfillment being filled with the Light of Christ. Filled with this Light of Christ will make it easy for us to lose ourselves in the service of others and to overcome selfishness. This will be the evidence of the strength and the fruits of the kingdom.<br><br>The Lord gave some counsel with respect to the latter days as to how his disciples can be identified through their fruits:<br><br><i>Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?</i><br><br><i>Even</i>so<i>every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.</i><br><br><i>A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</i><br><br><i>Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, by their fruits ye shall know them.</i>[Matthew 7:16–20]<br><br>All of our efforts in proclaiming the gospel depend upon the fruits that we present to the world through the actions of our lives. It is true that we might not be able to become perfect so long as we are mortal beings, but as we are filling our lives with the Spirit, we will have few, if any, divorces to end our marriages. We will be filled with hope and joy independent of material possessions, wealth, and outward circumstances. We will love to sacrifice and go the extra mile and accept everything in our lives as from the Lord's hand and from his will. As we learn to stay in constant communication with our Heavenly Father, we will see ourselves in our weaknesses, in our wrongdoings, in our faults, and we will appreciate the help we can receive from his power to overcome, to cast aside bad habits, and to feel the joy that comes with growth in spiritual matters. With all the priorities that we may have established for ourselves, this will be the breaking point or the making point in our lives!<br><br>It might be of interest to know that when Brigham Young was the prophet and president of the Church, he had a dream where Joseph Smith appeared to him. In the course of their visit together, Brigham Young requested counsel from Joseph Smith on a specific question. He reported that Joseph came toward him and, speaking in earnest, said:<br><br><i>Tell the people to be humble and faithful, and be sure to keep the spirit of the Lord and it will lead them right. Be careful and not turn away the small still voice; it will teach you what to do and where to go; it will yield the fruits of the kingdom. Tell the brethren to keep their hearts open to conviction,</i>so<i>that when the Holy Ghost comes to them, their hearts will be ready to receive it. They can tell the Spirit of the Lord from all other spirits; it will whisper peace and joy to their souls; it will take malice, hatred, strife and all evil from their hearts; and their whole desire will be to do good, bring forth righteousness, and build up the kingdom of God. Tell the brethren if they will follow the spirit of the Lord they will go right. Be sure to tell the people to keep the Spirit of the Lord.</i>[Elden J. Watson,<i>Manuscript History of Brigham Young</i>(Salt Lake City, 1971), pp. 529–31]<br><br>Today I want to invite you, my dear brothers and sisters, to see yourselves as instruments in the hand of the Lord, that through the example of your lives you may give to the world in the environment in which you are living a light of hope. With all that you are and all that you do, you become either a blessing or a threat to the world. You are not standing alone. The eyes of the world and our pioneer ancestors are resting upon us. This is the time for us to make decisions and to establish priorities. This is the time to gain a full understanding of the message of the Restoration and then to be able to reach out, as we are filled with the Spirit, to the hungry, truth-seeking, lost and wandering children of our Heavenly Father in all the nations of the world.<br><br>As we are learning to be always under the influence of the Light of Christ, we will be able to show the world alternatives to their social, political, and economic calamities. The Spirit will teach us to be thrifty and to see in vision the end from the beginning so that we can become true, humble teachers by the actions of our daily lives, and we will be able to fill this world with renewed hope and renewed vision. Always keep in mind that you cannot permit yourself to become a failure because you may be a reason for the failure of the world!<br><br>I give you my blessing and my testimony as your brother and as your servant, in the name of the Lord, Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>F.

<h1> - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
May I introduce my remarks today with two questions: (1) what is your relationship with your parents, and (2), for those of you who are married, what is your relationship with your companion and your children? Now, think seriously about these questions for a moment. Are you comfortable with your thoughts and feelings? Does pride and joy start to swell within your heart? Or is there a tinge of resentment or guilt or even fear?<br><br>I remember one of our missionaries who had just arrived in the mission field. We were having a testimony meeting in the living room of the mission home in Fresno, California. He stood to bear his testimony and, oh, how pathetic it was. No testimony was expressed. He only dwelled on how much he hated his father and how he disliked being in his home and said the only reason he came on a mission was to get away from his parents. My heart almost broke I felt so sorry for this young elder. I wondered what had caused such feelings and what had gone wrong in his home. It just didn't seem fair, no matter where the fault might lie. It made me reflect back to my home, my parents, and what my feelings were at that age. Oh, how blessed I was to have parents that loved me--yes, that even loved me enough to guide me, direct me, and even discipline me when necessary. My feelings of love and security were so strong for my parents and home that when it came time to choose which basketball scholarship I should take (and I had been offered full-ride scholarships to several colleges and universities), I picked the one that was closest to home. I just wanted to be at home!<br><h2><b>The Real Treasures in Life</b></h2><br>The scriptures reveal some beautiful family<br><br>relationships that help to guide and strengthen all of us. In the book of Ruth we read of the great love and devotion a daughter-in-law had for her husband's mother. The husbands of Naomi and her daughters-in-law had died, leaving them alone. Naomi decided to return to her home in Bethlehem and suggested that the two daughters return to their own people. After some discussion, one of the daughters, Orpah, went her way, but Ruth clave unto her mother-in-law. Quoting from chapter 1:15–17, Naomi said:<br><br><i>Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.</i><br><br><i>And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:</i><br><br><i>Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the Lord do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me.</i><br><br>What a choice relationship. How special they must have treated one another. Naomi even helped Ruth to capture the heart of Boaz, a mighty man of wealth. Through their marriage Ruth bore Obed, and Obed begat Jesse, who was the father of King David.<br><br>There must have been great love and trust in the family of Abraham, Sarah, and Isaac. I have tried to relate to the awful task the Lord gave to Abraham when he said, "Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of" (Genesis 22:2). I'm afraid I find it impossible to relate to. My love and respect and admiration for Abraham is overwhelming. His testimony of the gospel and love for our Heavenly Father must have been pure and without blemish. Even the Lord said, "For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him" (Genesis 18:19).<br><br>I have tried to picture Abraham and his son as they made their trek to the mountain with their arms over each other's shoulders as I have done with my sons on many occasions. What emotion must have filled Abraham's being as he followed God's command. What love, faith, and trust Isaac must have had in his father as he said:<br><br><i>My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?</i><br><br><i>And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them, together.</i><br><br>Even at this point Abraham could not bring himself to tell his son what was to happen.<br><br><i>And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.</i><br><br><i>And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.</i>[Genesis 22:7–10]<br><br>The test had been met; God's will meant more to both than mortal fears and desires. What love and understanding Abraham and Sarah had taught their mighty son Isaac. Of course, Isaac was spared and became a mighty man unto God.<br><br>What a thrill it must have been for Shiblon to hear the words of his father, Alma, to know of the faith and trust he had in him, and the love and pride his father felt for him as he said,<br><br><i>And now, my son, I trust that I shall have great joy in you, because of your steadiness and faithfulness unto God; for as you have commenced in your youth to look to the Lord your God, even so I hope that you will continue in keeping his commandments; for blessed is he that endureth to the end.</i><br><br><i>I say unto you, my son, that I have had great joy in thee already, because of thy faithfulness and thy diligence, and thy patience and thy long-suffering among the people of the Zoramites.</i><br><br><i>For I know that thou wast in bonds; yea, and I also know that thou wast stoned for the word's sake; and thou didst bear all these things with patience because the Lord was with thee; and now thou knowest that the Lord did deliver thee.</i>[Alma 38:2–4]<br><br>I'm sure a great father-son relationship existed between them.<br><br>I have often thought how pleased and proud our Father in Heaven must have been as he introduced his son, Jesus Christ, to the Nephites. What a noble and valiant son. Such a caring and loving Father. What great meaning in his words, "Behold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name--hear ye him" (3 Nephi 11:7).<br><br>Are we creating these kinds of relationships with our parents and children? Are our priorities in order? Is there anything in the world more precious or eternal than families? Can greater joy or security be felt and experienced than that felt within a family? I fear in some cases we allow the natural man or woman to overshadow the real treasures in life.<br><h2><b>"I've Never Told Anyone I Loved Them"</b></h2><br>I was amazed as a mission president to find out how few of our missionaries had truly experienced love, warmth, and understanding in their homes. It seemed to be the exception rather than the rule that a missionary could give and accept love freely. It had not been taught or experienced in their homes. I had grown up in a home where I loved, hugged, and kissed my dad freely. It had meant so much to me that I decided when I had my first interview with each of our elders I would give them a hug and after every interview we would end with a hug and expression of love. I couldn't believe the reactions I got. Some just melted in my arms while others didn't know how to react or what to do. Some stood as rigid as boards. They had never had their dad's arms around them in their whole life.<br><br>I remember one elder that came to us with the sourest look on his face that I had ever seen. He would come in for each interview and sit down with this same unhappy expression. I would say, "What's the matter, Elder? Why don't you ever smile?" About all I would ever get out of him was a grunt or two and never an answer. We would have a poor interview, and at the end we would stand and I would put my arms around him. I could almost feel him shudder with disgust. This went on for several months with no change. He was a most unhappy young man. He had no success in his areas. He had companionship problems. Nothing went well.<br><br>Finally he came in for another interview and I said, "What's the matter, Elder? Can't you tell me?"<br><br>He looked at me for a moment and then he said, "You want to know what's the matter? I'll tell you." I thought, great, we're finally going to get to the bottom of this thing.<br><br>He said, "I can't stand you."<br><br>Well, I could have wished for a lot of other answers besides that one. He said, "I can't stand to have you put your arms around me. I've never had a man's arm around me, not even my dad's. And besides that, I can't stand to have you tell me you love me. No one has ever told me that, not even my mother and dad, and I have never told anyone I loved them." He was really rolling now. The floodgate was wide open. I was wondering why I had ever asked him the question.<br><br>He said, "I had a seminary teacher that was just like you. All the kids just loved him and I hated him."<br><br>Well, I didn't know what to say. I was dumb-founded. To be told you're hated isn't necessarily the greatest thing to hear. Finally I said, "Well, Elder, I'm really sorry I offend you, and I'm sorry it bothers you so to have me put my arms around you. I promise I will never put my arms around you again. And I won't tell you I love you, but I want you to know that I truly do." Well, we got up, shook hands, and out the door he went. No more hugs, no more I love yous.<br><br>Finally it came time for Sister Harbertson and me to return home. I felt I had totally failed this elder. He came in for his final interview with about the same response. We got up, shook hands, and he walked to the door and then turned around and said, "President Harbertson, will you do something for me?"<br><br>I said, "Certainly, what is it?"<br><br>He said, "Will you give me a hug?" I grabbed that elder and almost squeezed him to death.<br><br>He said, "President, I want you to know that I love you!" He even got up in our zone conference and for the first time in his whole life verbally expressed love for his companion and then turned around and expressed his love for Sister Harbertson and me.<br><br>We went home; he still had some months to serve. When he got home he came to the first mission reunion he could. There he sat in the middle of that large group of missionaries with the biggest smile you have ever seen. After the meeting he came up to me and gave me a big hug and told me he loved me. I asked him how the rest of his mission went, and he said, "After you went home it went great!" Well, I think I know what he meant.<br><br>Now, why did that young man have to go through twenty years of not being loved or giving love? It isn't fair or right. Good homes are so important.<br><h2><b>These Precious Moments</b></h2><br>Sons and daughters, are you really putting forth the effort to be close to your parents? Do you really know them and understand them? Parents, do you know your children? Are you enjoying each phase of their lives and being a strong influence for good? The greatest influence in a child's life is his parents. Attitudes and personalities are greatly affected by this relationship. In the Doctrine and Covenants we read, "And that wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth, through disobedience, from the children of men, and because of the tradition of their fathers" (D&amp;amp;C 93:39). As this verse points out, the traditions of our fathers, the way we act, the things we do and say seem to significantly influence our children. Will you be happy if your children follow in your footsteps? Are you as children being obedient to God's way of life in order that you may enjoy the strength and direction of the Holy Ghost? I am reminded of a song that was popular a couple of years ago called "Cat's in the Cradle," by Harry and Sandy Chapin.<br><br><i>My child arrived just the other day,</i><br><i>He came to the world in the usual way,</i><br><i>But there were planes to catch and bills to pay,</i><br><i>He learned to walk while I was away;</i><br><i>And he was talkin' 'fore I knew it,</i><br><i>And as he grew he'd say,</i><br><i>"I'm gonna be like you, Dad,</i><br><i>You know I'm gonna be like you."</i><br><br><i>Chorus:</i><br><br><i>And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon</i><br><i>Little boy blue and the man in the moon.</i><br><i>"When ya comin' home, Dad?" "I don't know when,</i><br><i>But we'll get together then, You know we'll have a good time then."</i><br><br><i>My son turned ten just the other day,</i><br><i>He said, "Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on let's play,</i><br><i>Can you teach me to throw?" I said, "Not today,</i><br><i>I got a lot to do." He said, "That's okay."</i><br><i>And he walked away, but his smile never dimmed,</i><br><i>It said, "I'm gonna be like him, yeah,</i><br><i>You know I'm gonna be like him."</i><br><br><i>Well, he came from college just the other day,</i><br><i>So much like a man, I just had to say,</i><br><i>"Son, I'm proud of you, can you sit for awhile?"</i><br><i>He shook his head and he said with a smile,</i><br><i>"What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys,</i><br><i>See you later, can I have them please?"</i><br><br><i>I've long since retired, my son's moved away.</i><br><i>I called him up just the other day.</i><br><i>I said, "I'd like to see you if you don't mind."</i><br><i>He said, "I'd love to, Dad, if I can find the time.</i><br><i>You see, my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu,</i><br><i>But it's sure nice talkin' to you, Dad,</i><br><i>It's been sure nice talkin' to you."</i><br><br><i>And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me,</i><br><i>He'd grown up just like me, my boy was just like me.</i><br><br><i>Chorus:</i><br><br><i>And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,</i><br><i>Little boy blue and the man in the moon.</i><br><i>"When you comin' home, Son?" "I don't know when,</i><br><i>But we'll get together then, Dad,</i><br><i>We're gonna have a good time then."</i><br><br>Don't allow this to happen in your lives. These precious moments--each experience and stage of life--can only be lived once. Richard L. Evans had some special feelings in this regard, and in part said this:<br><br><i>Those who are overly impatient for the future may let the happiness and opportunities, and also the obligations of the present pass them by.</i><br><br><i>... Happiness [is a matter] of learning to "respect ... the present hour" ... learning to live each day. ... This is our time, our day, ... and we had better learn to live and "labor while it is called today" being mindful of each day's opportunities and obligations.</i>[<i>Thoughts for One Hundred Days</i>(Salt Lake City: Publishers Press, 1966), p. 129]<br><br>President Kimball once said this,<br><br><i>Fathers, what is your report concerning your family? Will you be able to report that you created an environment in your home to build faith in a living God, to encourage learning, to teach order, obedience, and sacrifice? That you often shared your testimony of the reality of your Father in heaven, of the truthfulness of the restored gospel with your wife and children? Will you be able to report that you followed the living prophets? That your home was where your tender children could feel protected and safe, and where they felt the love and acceptance and warmth of you and their mother?</i>["The Example of Abraham,"<i>Ensign,</i>June 1975, p. 7]<br><br>First, it appears that an accounting must take place--a report regarding our stewardship as a father, mother, husband, wife, son, or daughter. With a listening ear our Lord will judge our lives. Obviously, teaching faith in God and obedience to his commandments is of prime importance. I'm particularly interested in his question regarding the children and if home is a place where they feel protection, safety, love, and warmth.<br><h2><b>Feeling Safe and Secure</b></h2><br>I remember, as a small boy, sitting on my dad's lap and hearing him tell me about when he was a boy and how afraid he was of the dark, and how he would wake up in the night and be so frightened that he would jump out of bed and run to his parents' room. There Grandma would always let him get in bed with her and then everything was alright. I don't know if it was because of Dad telling me about this or not, but I grew up a total coward. I had, and still do have, a great fear of the dark. I understand why the scriptures relate darkness to that which is not good. My biggest challenge day after day as a boy was going to bed each night because I would have to turn out the light and then get clear across the room and into bed before a booger could get me. I knew they were in the closet and under the bed and behind the curtains. I got so I would start to run, hit the light, take one step inside the room, and then take a huge leap and hit the bed--most of the time! Mother never did know why the springs were broken on that side of the bed. Once in bed, up would go the covers over my head, and there I would lay paralyzed until I went to sleep.<br><br>Invariably I would wake up in the middle of the night and figure for sure I was a goner. Finally, when I just couldn't stand it any longer, I would throw back the covers and leap out of bed so the boogers under the bed couldn't grab me, race past the closet that must have always had a couple in there, and then run down the hall to Dad and Mother's bedroom. That hall seemed like it was as long as a football field. Now that I think about it, it was only about ten feet long. But I had to go past the bathroom, the door to the kitchen, and the door to the living room, and you know who was lurking at each of them! Once in the bedroom I could see my dad's big arm raise in the air with the bed covers in his hand and I would jump in beside him. Down would come the covers and his arm over me. Then I knew there wasn't a booger in the world big enough to get me. I have often wondered what would have happened if one night my dad would have said, "Bobby, you big boob, get back in your own bed!" I'm afraid it would have caused permanent damage, But he loved me, he understood, and I knew I was safe and secure in the arms of my dad and that he would never turn me away.<br><br>Are you enjoying the warmth and security and love of your parents? Do you counsel with them? Are you sharing precious experiences with them? Do you listen to them? When you return home can they see and feel and hear of your love for them? Are you too big to hug and kiss them now? Remember, one day they will be gone.<br><h2><b>Live Each Day</b></h2><br>I would like to quote the words of another song that was popular a few years ago called "Everything I Own," by David Gates of the group Bread. You may wonder where I hear these songs--on our boat at Lake Powell. We are a boating family. We kept a boat at Lake Powell and in the boat was a tape deck. The agreement with the children was, "You play one of your tapes, then we get to play one of ours." We played Tabernacle Choir music and the kids played the rest! You know what--some of the words and music to some of those songs were pretty good. Anyway, listen to these words.<br><br><i>You sheltered me from harm</i><br><i>Kept me warm, kept me warm.</i><br><i>You gave my life to me</i><br><i>Set me free, set me free.</i><br><i>The finest years I ever knew</i><br><i>Were all the years I had with you.</i><br><br><i>Chorus</i><br><br><i>And I would give anything I own,</i><br><i>Give up my life, my heart, my home.</i><br><i>I would give everything I own</i><br><i>Just to have you back again.</i><br><br><i>You taught me how to love</i><br><i>What it's of, what it's of.</i><br><i>You never said too much;</i><br><i>But still you showed the way,</i><br><i>And I knew from watching you:</i><br><i>Nobody else could ever know</i><br><i>The part of me that can't let go.</i><br><br><i>Chorus</i><br><br><i>And I would give anything I own,</i><br><i>Give up my life, my heart, my home.</i><br><i>I would give everything I own</i><br><i>Just to have you back again.</i><br><br><i>Is there someone you know,</i><br><i>You're loving them so,</i><br><i>But taking them all for granted?</i><br><i>You may lose them one day,</i><br><i>Someone takes them away,</i><br><i>And they don't hear the words</i><br><i>You long to say.</i><br><br><i>Chorus</i><br><br><i>And I would give anything I own,</i><br><i>Give up my life, my heart, my home.</i><br><i>I would give everything I own</i><br><i>Just to have you back again,</i><br><i>Just to touch you once again.</i><br><br>I understand the young man who wrote this song had lost his father not long before and was expressing his deep feelings. They are most meaningful to me because I lost my dad, very unexpectedly, when I was only thirty-one. I thought my dad would live forever. He was too big, too strong, he was my hero, and yet without warning he was gone. Though I was married with children of my own, I missed him so much. I just craved to have him hold me once again. Please live each day so that you will not have regrets, no matter what may happen.<br><h2><b>Loving Is Living</b></h2><br>Love is such a special feeling. It brings so much joy and meaning to life. Those who radiate love truly enjoy the spirit of God. One of my favorite verses in the scriptures is this:<br><br><i>A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</i><br><br><i>By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</i>[John 13:34–35]<br><br>Is not the home where we learn to love, where we are first loved and made to feel secure and important? I would like to tell you a story entitled "Love is a Shining Thing," by Arthur Gordon.<br><br><i>They sat together on the porch steps, so close that their moonshadow was a single wedge of blackness against the weathered wood. Tomorrow was the wedding, with all the excitement and confusion, tears and laughter. There would be no privacy then. But this quiet hour was their own.</i><br><br><i>She said, "Its peaceful, isn't it?" She was watching the great stately clouds march over their heads and drop from sight into the quick-silver sea. He was watching her, and thought that he had never seen her so beautiful.</i><br><br><i>The wind blew; the waves made little hush, hush sounds, sighing against the sand. "You know," she said, "I always wondered how I'd feel the night before my wedding. Scared or thrilled, or uncertain, or what."</i><br><br><i>"You're not scared, are you?"</i><br><br><i>"Oh no," she said quickly. She hugged his arm and put her face against his shoulder in the impulsive way she had. "Just a little solemn, maybe. Solemn and gay, and young and old, and happy and sad. Do you know what I mean?"</i><br><br><i>"Yes," he said, "I know."</i><br><br><i>"It's love that does it, I suppose," she said.</i><br><br><i>"That old thing; we've never talked about it much, have we? About love itself, I mean?"</i><br><br><i>He smiled a little, "We never had to."</i><br><br><i>"I'd sort of like to--now," she said. "Do you mind? I'd like to try to tell you how I feel before tomorrow happens.</i>"<br><br><i>"Will it be any different after tomorrow?"</i><br><br><i>"No, but I may not be able to talk about it then. It may go down somewhere deep inside, below the talking level."</i><br><br><i>"All right," he said. "Tell me about love. "</i><br><br><i>... She leaned back clasping her hands around her knees, the moonlight bright and ecstatic on her face.</i><br><br><i>"Oh, it's so many things. Waltzing in the dark; waiting for the phone to ring, opening the box of flowers. It's holding hands in a movie; it's humming a sad little tune; it's walking in the rain; it's riding in a convertible with the wind in your hair. It's the quarreling and making up again. It's the first warm drowsy thought in the morning and the last kiss at night.</i>"<br><br><i>She broke off suddenly and gave him a desolate look. "But it's all been said before, hasn't it?"</i><br><br><i>"Even if it has," he told her gently, "that doesn't make it any less true."</i><br><br><i>"Maybe I'm just being silly," she said doubtfully. "Is that the way love seems to you?"</i><br><br><i>He did not answer for awhile. At last he said, "I might add a little to your definition."</i><br><br><i>"You mean you wouldn't change it?"</i><br><br><i>"No, just add to it."</i><br><br><i>She put her chin in her hands. "Go ahead, I'm listening."</i><br><br><i>He took out the pen she had given him and looked at it for a moment. "You said it was a lot of little things. You're right. I could mention a few that don't have much glitter. But they have an importance that grows.</i>"<br><br><i>She watched his lean fingers begin to move. "Tell me," she said.</i><br><br><i>"Oh, coming home to somebody when the day is ended--or waiting for somebody to come home to you. Giving, or getting, a word of praise when none is really deserved. Sharing a joke that nobody else understands. Planting a tree together and watching it grow. Sitting up with a sick child. Remembering anniversaries. Do I make it sound terribly dull?"</i><br><br><i>She did not say anything; she shook her head.</i><br><br><i>"Everything you mentioned is part of it," he went on. "But it's not all triumphant, you know. It's also sharing disappointment, and sorrow. It's going out to slay the dragon, and finding the dragon too much for you, and running away--but going out again the next day. It's the little chips of tolerance that you finally knock off the granite of your ego, not saying, 'I told you so,' not noticing the dented fender on the family car. It's the gradual acceptance of limitations--your own as well as others. It's discarding some of the ambitions you had for yourself and planting them in your children." His voice trailed off into the glistening night.</i><br><br><i>"Are you talking" she asked finally, "about living or loving?"</i><br><br><i>"You'll find," he said, "there's not much of one without the other."</i><br><br><i>"When--when did you learn that?"</i><br><br><i>"Quite a while ago, before your mother died." His hand touched her shining hair.</i><br><br><i>"Better get to bed now, baby. Tomorrow's your big day.</i>"<br><br><i>She clung to him suddenly. "Oh, Daddy, I'm going to miss you so."</i><br><br><i>"Nonsense," he said gruffly, "I'll be seeing you all the time. Run along now." But after she had gone he sat there for a long time, alone in the moonlight.</i><br><br>On the wall in our family room is a plaque which has these words written on it: "The greatest gift a father can give his children is to love their mother." I really like that. Nothing is more beautiful or reassuring than the eternal love between a husband and wife. That kind of love involves so many things that bring joy, security, strength, respect, and a desire to do the same in our own children. One of my favorite love stories brings out this kind of love, and it's a true one.<br><br><i>Soon after he was married, Thomas Moore, the famous 19th-century Irish poet, was called away on a business trip. Upon his return he was met at the door not by his beautiful bride, but by the family doctor.</i><br><br><i>"Your wife is upstairs," said the doctor. "But she has asked that you do not come up." And then Moore learned the terrible truth: his wife had contracted smallpox. The disease had left her once flawless skin pocked and scarred. She had taken one look at her reflection in the mirror and commanded that the shutters be drawn and that her husband never see her again.</i><br><br><i>Moore would not listen. He ran upstairs and threw open the door of his wife's room. It was black as night inside. Not a sound came from the darkness. Groping along the wall, Moore felt for the gas jets.</i><br><br><i>A startled cry came from a black corner of the room. "No! Don't light the lamps."</i><br><br><i>Moore hesitated, swayed by the pleading in the voice.</i><br><br><i>"Go!" she begged. "Please go! This is the greatest gift I can give you, now."</i><br><br><i>Moore did go. He went down to his study where he sat up most of the night, prayerfully writing. Not a poem this time, but a song. He had never written a song before, but now he found it more natural to his mood than simple poetry. He not only wrote the words, he wrote the music, too. And the next morning as soon as the sun was up he returned to his wife's room.</i><br><br><i>He felt his way to a chair and sat down. "Are you awake?" he asked.</i><br><br><i>"I am," came a voice from the far side of the room, "But you must not ask to see me. You must not press me, Thomas."</i><br><br><i>"I will sing to you, then," he answered. And so, for the first time, Thomas Moore sang to his wife the song that still lives today:</i><br><br><i>Believe me, if all those endearing young charms,</i><br><i>Which I gaze on so fondly to-day,</i><br><i>Were to change by to-morrow, and fleet in my arms,</i><br><i>Like fairy-gifts fading away,</i><br><i>Thou wouldst still be adored, as this moment thou art,</i><br><i>Let thy loveliness fade as it will.</i><br><br><i>Moore heard a movement from the dark corner where his wife lay in her loneliness, waiting. He continued:</i><br><br><i>Let thy loveliness fade as it will,</i><br><i>And around the dear ruin each wish of my heart</i><br><i>Would entwine itself verdantly still....</i><br><br><i>The song ended. As his voice trailed off on the last note, Moore heard his bride rise. She crossed the room to the window, reached up and slowly threw open the shutters.</i>[Galen Drake,<i>Guideposts,</i>Sept. 1957]<br><br>I have yet to see a relationship that is not greatly enhanced when this kind of sensitive love and understanding is expressed by a husband to his wife. To a great extent the attitude and feelings one experiences through the day are generated by the atmosphere and environment felt in the home, Happiness, with all that is attached to it, is what we all desire and hope for. And yet, quite often, we seem to do and say those things that are contrary and in exact opposition to happiness.<br><br>There is a simple but very important law taught time after time in the scriptures called the law of the harvest. Simply stated, it is this: "As ye sow, so shall ye reap." I don't believe it is ever more true than in a family relationship. The more one does for his mate, children, parents or brothers and sisters, the more he will receive in return. Good stimulates and nourishes good. The Lord expressed this truth most beautifully when he said,<br><br><i>Fear not to do good, my sons, for whatsoever ye sow, that shall ye also reap; therefore, if ye sow good ye shall also reap good for your reward.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, fear not, little flock; do good; let earth and hell combine against you, for if ye are built upon my rock, they cannot prevail.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 6:33–34]<br><br>May God bless each one of us to do all in our power to make our homes and relationships as parents, companions, and children special, and to invite the Spirit of the Lord to help and direct us as we prepare for eternal life together as families, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Robert B.

<h2><b>"You, My Children of Zion"</b></h2><br>I pray that the Spirit of the Lord will be with us today so we may be able to communicate by the Spirit. I want to share in the beginning a beautiful letter, a very special letter:<br><br><i>My Dear Children:</i><br><br><i>How well I remember the day you left my side and ventured forth on your mission to earth. That day I clothed your spirit with love and tenderly sent you off to school. My thoughts are with you now and always.</i><br><br><i>Oh, how I love you! I know the grief and pain as well as the joy and happiness you experience. I know your school is full of ugliness and temptations as well as beauty, but remember,</i>all that I have is yours,<i>if you come back to see me.</i><br><br><i>Each of you went into your new adventure with talent buried inside you. Bring forth these talents. Develop them and share them. Give what is yours to give with all your hearts. Covet not one another's gifts.</i><br><br><i>You, my children of Zion, have many blessings that my other children do not have. You share my Holy Priesthood. You may go to the temple to learn eternal truths.</i><br><br><i>You bear your children with the knowledge that they shall be yours forever--if you live worthy to come back to me. But remember,</i>"Where much is given, much is expected!"<br><br><i>There are many among you who hunger for food and need care. Give of yourselves until you are drained of strength and give more.</i><br><br><i>There are many among you who hunger for food and thirst for my word.</i><br><br><i>Go forth with your humble spirits. Give my message in their homes. Pour out my good tidings. Restore faith where it has been lost. Give them my spoken words.</i><br><br><i>And also, my beloved children in Zion, let charity and love be your constant companions. Come to me often in prayer. Be humble and faithful. Be diligent in my work, and my kingdom shall be yours forever. I love you and miss you so very much, and, oh, how I am looking forward to your return again to me and your mother.</i><br><br><i>With all my love, Your Father in Heaven</i>[Author unknown]<br><h2><b>The Lord Preserved the Noble Spirits</b></h2><br>In the prophecy made by President John Taylor regarding the great future of the Latter- day Saints and their destiny, he said:<br><br><i>We believe that we shall rear splendid edifices, magnificent temples and beautiful cities that shall become the pride, praise and glory of the whole earth. We believe that this people will excel in literature, in science and the arts and in manufactures. In fact, there will be a concentration of wisdom, not only of the combined wisdom of the world as it now exists, but men will be inspired in regard to all these matters in a manner and to an extent that they never have been before.</i>[<i>JD,</i>vol. 10, p. 147]<br><br>As I see a vast congregation of the youth of Zion today, you young people full of talent and potential for every walk of life, ready to take the strong leadership position of excellence that will draw the eyes of the people of the world upon us, I can see in you the greatest potential the Church has ever had<i>--</i>in mathematics, music, all sciences and arts, sports, politics, farms and agriculture, medical fields, oceanics, business, and every technological field. President Kimball once expressed his vision for the youth of the Church as follows:<br><br><i>Members of the Church should be peers or superiors to any others in natural ability, extended training, plus the Holy Spirit which should bring them light and truth. With hundreds of "men of God"</i>[and ladies of God]<i>and their associates</i>so<i>blessed, we have the base for an increasingly efficient and worthy corps of talent.</i>["The Gospel Vision of the Arts,"<i>Ensign,</i>July 1977, p. 3]<br><br>I also remember the wonderful pronouncement of President Wilford Woodruff when he said:<br><br><i>I am especially anxious that our young people should sense the great responsibility that must sooner or later rest upon them; and that</i>they should bear in mind the fact that they were kept in the spirit world thousands of years to come through the loins of the ancient patriarchs and prophets in our own age and generation for the very purpose of carrying on this great latter-day work.<i>God called upon us and He will call upon you and our posterity after us, to rise and warn the generations in which they live; to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the nations of the earth.</i>[Address to the Y.M.M.I.A. Annual Conference,<i>Contributor,</i>16 August 1895, p. 635; emphasis added]<br><h2><b>The Lord God Preserved for a Righteous People</b></h2><br>As I see you beautiful people here today and stand before you, my mind traces back to when the prophet Moroni took the record of the Jaredites which consisted of twenty-four plates found by the people of Limhi in the days of King Mosiah. As Moroni was abridging the writings of Ether, he wrote how the people of the Jaredites were guided by the Lord to come to this promised land. And he wrote the following:<br><br><i>And the Lord would not suffer that they should stop beyond the sea in the wilderness, but he would that they should come forth even unto the land of promise, which was choice above all other lands, which the Lord God had preserved for a righteous people.</i>[Ether 2:7]<br><br>I want to note two phrases: "the land of promise which was choice above all other lands" and "the Lord God had preserved for a righteous people." What a blessing, my brothers and sisters, that you can live in the land of promise which was and which is choice above all other lands! And this land was preserved by the Lord our God for the righteous people. How blessed you are that you were born in this land! You are among this righteous people.<br><h2><b>They Shall Serve God</b></h2><br>And then Moroni said in verse 9:<br><br><i>And now, we can behold the decrees of God concerning this land, that it is a land of promise; and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall serve God, or they shall be swept off when the fulness of his wrath shall come upon them. And the fulness of his wrath cometh upon them when they are ripened in iniquity.</i><br><br>Therefore, Moroni is expressing his concern that whoever possesses or lives in this land "should serve him, the true and only God" (verse 8). And then he repeatedly emphasized, in verse 10, "For behold, this is a land which is choice above all other lands; wherefore he that doth possess it shall serve God." And he then also emphasized, in verse 12, "Behold, this is a choice land, and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall be free from bondage, and from captivity, and from all other nations under heaven, if they will but serve the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ." The Lord Jesus himself, after his resurrection, when he appeared to the Nephites, made the most profound statement: "which blessing upon the Gentiles shall make them mighty above all" (3 Nephi 20:27). And he also repeated, "For it is wisdom in the Father that they should be established in this land, and be set up as a free people by the power of the Father" (3 Nephi 21:4).<br><br>What glorious promises! This is truly the land of promise, and you are the greatest chosen generation. It has been said that the greatest artist was once asked by his audience which of all his productions was the greatest. He said, "The next is going to be the best." To me, the next is you, the wonderful young generation of this great Church.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, the best and the greatest and most powerful and most beautiful has not yet been composed or produced or come about. Who will be like Richard Wagner, the German composer? Who will be the Wordsworth for the next generation? Or who will be like George Bernard Shaw, the Irish dramatist and critic? Who can exceed Shakespeare? Who will take the position of President Reagan for the tomorrow of this great nation? Who will be a great historian and archaeologist like Hugh Nibley, or a scientist like Dr. Henry Eyring, or a successful businessman like J. Willard Marriott, a successful cabinet member like Ezra Taft Benson or David Kennedy or Dr. T. H. Bell?<br><h2><b>What Faith Their Mothers Taught Them</b></h2><br>I firmly believe that equal to becoming the greatest artist or statesman would be to become mothers and fathers like those of Helaman's two thousand stripling soldiers. You young ladies, you can be mothers like the mothers of these two thousand striplings. What faith these mothers taught to these young men and, I believe, to young ladies too! The scriptures record the tremendous teachings taught to them by their parents, especially by their mothers:<br><br><i>And now I say unto you, my beloved brother Moroni, that never had I seen</i>so<i>great courage, nay, not amongst all the Nephites.</i><br><br><i>For as I had ever called them my sons (for they were all of them very young) even</i>so<i>they said unto me: Father, behold our God is with us, and he will not suffer that we should fall; then let us go forth. . . .</i><br><br><i>Now they never had fought, yet they did not fear death; and they did think more upon the liberty of their fathers than they did upon their lives; yea, they had been taught by their mothers, that if they did not doubt, God would deliver them.</i>[Alma 56:45–47]<br><br>What faith their mothers had taught them, because they did not doubt God. I hope we can learn that. "And they rehearsed unto me the words of their mothers, saying: We do not doubt our mothers knew it" (Alma 56:8).<br><br>There is such miraculous strength and power, such mighty power and faith that we can cultivate and then pass on to the next generation. These young men were blessed to be preserved and they were valiant men of God. We need good statesmen like these stripling young men who have a firm faith and can raise this young generation for the future of this great Church and for this beautiful land of America and for the people of the world. We need young men and women with firm faith and testimonies who will write and compose and produce good motion pictures and novels because the world is moving in the wrong direction.<br><h2><b>Cultivating Our Inner Power and Faith</b></h2><br>My brothers and sisters, how can we accomplish these great, heavy, and awesome tasks, to please the Lord and glorify his holy name? In what way can we be the mediators to share this everlasting truth and knowledge so that people will believe as the Savior foretold: "They shall believe in me, that I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and shall pray unto the Father in my name" (3 Nephi 20:31)? In what way, brothers and sisters, should we cultivate our inner power and faith? Here are a few suggestions I want to present to you today.<br><br><b>First,</b>be ye clean. The Savior, when he was visiting the Nephites, expressed his great concern and pleaded with us the following:<br><br><i>And then shall a cry go forth: Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch not that which is unclean; go ye out of the midst of her;</i>be ye clean<i>that bear the vessels of the Lord.</i>[3 Nephi 20:41; emphasis added]<br><br>This is what I see. The greatest challenge to all of us is what the Savior said, "Depart ye, depart ye and<i>touch not that which is unclean"</i>because we are the vessels of the Lord. If we can do that we shall be exalted in every walk of life. When you pursue academic excellence and intellectual excellence, I see the same thing, the voice of the Lord saying, "Do not touch the worldly teachings."<br><br><b>Second,</b>be sanctified. In another place the Savior expressed the following:<i>"Be sanctified</i>by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day" (3 Nephi 27:20). In the Doctrine and Covenants the Savior said:<br><br><i>But no man is possessor of all things except he be purified and cleansed from all sin.</i><br><br><i>And if ye are purified and cleansed from all sin, ye shall ask whatsoever you will in the name of Jesus and it shall be done.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 50:28–29; emphasis added]<br><br>What a promise we have here! As we cleanse and purify our lives, the Savior said, "Ask whatsoever you will in the name of Jesus and it shall be done." Why do we have to sanctify our lives, brothers and sisters? As we sanctify our lives, I firmly believe<i>our minds become single to the glory of God</i>(see D&amp;amp;C 88:68). And then, in section 88, verse 74, the Savior said, "and<i>sanctify</i>yourselves; yea,<i>purify</i>your hearts, and<i>cleanse</i>your hands and your feet before me" (emphasis added). As we cleanse our lives, our thoughts, our minds, our actions, the Savior promised that "<i>Whatsoever</i>ye ask the Father in my name it shall be given unto you, that is expedient for you" (D&amp;amp;C 88:64; emphasis added).<br><br>The Savior promised a long time ago:<br><br><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and</i>greater works<i>than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.</i><br><br><i>And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</i><br><br>If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it. [John 14:12–14; emphasis added]<br><br><i>And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name,</i>he will give it you.<br><br><i>Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your</i>joy may be full. [John 16:23–24; emphasis added; see also 3 Nephi 27:28]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, these are the great promises from the Lord as we sanctify and purify our thoughts, our actions, our bodies and minds. That is the promise.<br><br><b>Third,</b>we must be taught from on high though we pursue academic excellence. May I share another powerful promise from the Lord in Doctrine and Covenants 43:16: "And ye are to be<i>taught</i>from on high.<i>Sanctify yourselves</i>and ye shall be<i>endowed with power,</i>that ye may give even as I have spoken" (emphasis added). What a mighty promise! In order to behave and to think and to meditate and to ponder and to invent and to find, to plan, to study and to cultivate, the Savior warns that we must be "taught from on high." And then he said we must<i>sanctify ourselves.</i>Then we shall be<i>endowed with power.</i>And the promise of the Lord is that we may give, even as I have spoken. In other words, we may plan, we may study, we may act, we may behave, and then we may ponder, think, cultivate, move forward, and may pray. As we become cleansed and sanctified before the Lord, when we are "anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of [our] own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness" (D&amp;amp;C 58:27<i>)</i>for God's glory, then, the Lord said, "the power is within us." I do believe you wonderful people do have that power. As we become cleansed and purified before the Lord, the Savior's promise is that power will come upon us. What a magnitude of endowment you can receive from the Lord!<br><br><b>Fourth,</b>we must know our Savior. Brothers and sisters, how, then, can we become cleansed before the Lord? How can we cleanse our lives in order to sanctify our lives?<i>We must know Jesus Christ.</i>"And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent" (John 17:3). Brothers and sisters, in order to come close to him we must cultivate and feel his love, his feeling, his comforting voice, his peace and joy, his spirit, his glory, his order, and his great atoning power, mercy, and justice.<br><br>The Savior said, "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15). Keeping the will of the Father, and of the Son, Jesus Christ, we will continue to cleanse, and we can cultivate continually, pondering, learning, and studying, and, especially, listening to his voice each day. And I suggest every morning hour we write in our journals, and always put ourselves in a reverent attitude in our prayers, seeking for the revelation of the Lord and seeking for the spirit of prophecy as did the sons of Mosiah (see Alma 17:2–4). I believe that prayer is a divine fellowship with the Father. If we miss that communication every morning we are missing the greatest priority. We must maintain our trust in the Lord through prayer and fasting and by giving our commitment. Then, as we keep the covenants and doctrines and teachings, we must, with reverence before the Lord, take the sacred ordinances of the gospel and learn the doctrines each day, especially in the morning, and cultivate spiritual inner power and sensitivity to the promptings of the Holy Spirit. Then we will continue to cleanse our lives.<br><br><b>Fifth,</b>we must cultivate our innermost sensitivities. We can walk toward the Savior each day and feel his spirit, feel his joy, feel his love and sensitivities toward us, his peace and comfort and sweet joy, his spirit and power and glory. The Savior promised us, "And now I go unto the Father. And verily I say unto you, whatsoever things ye shall ask the Father in my name shall be given unto you" (3 Nephi 27:28). Therefore, brothers and sisters, we should ask and seek and feel and cultivate each day, each moment.<br><br>"Wherefore, he is possessor of all things; for all things are subject unto him, both in heaven and on the earth" (D&amp;amp;C 50:27). When we become clean, with pure hearts and holy minds, all things are subject unto us, both in heaven and on earth. Ordained of God, we can be "the life and the light, the Spirit and the power, sent forth by the will of the Father through Jesus Christ, his Son" (D&amp;amp;C 50:27). What a blessing. As we cultivate these things we will become more like the Savior, and we can truly walk toward him and feel his great atoning power. And as we do so, the Spirit will prevail and permeate, and we can receive the light of the Savior. The Spirit and power will be sent by the will of the Father through Jesus Christ to each of us.<br><br><b>Sixth,</b>"it shall be done" through faith and commitment. I humbly believe that as we do these things Heavenly Father will bless us like he blessed Nephi, the son of Helaman.<br><br><i>Behold, I give unto you power that whatsoever ye shall seal on earth shall be sealed in heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven; and thus shall ye have power among this people.</i><br><br><i>And thus, if ye shall say unto this temple it shall be rent in twain, it shall be done.</i><br><br><i>And if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou cast down and become smooth, it shall be done.</i><br><br><i>And behold, if ye shall say that God shall smite this people, it shall come to pass.</i>[Helaman 10:7–10]<br><br>That power is faith. We can truly have faith like that of Nephi, son of Helaman, and really exercise it as we go forth into the world.<br><br><b>Seventh,</b>we must search the scriptures. I pray that while you are studying on this great campus you study also the words of the Lord. While you are pursuing academic excellence I pray that you will also obtain a knowledge and "a sound understanding" of the truth of the gospel by diligent study and the searching of the scriptures (Alma 17:2). I challenge you again to read one chapter a day.<i>Because you know the words of the Lord</i>you can be effective servants of the Lord.<br><br>I pray that, because of the cultivated power within you, you may be able to bring many to the knowledge of Heavenly Father's truth. As you face the people of the world, you can teach by the power and authority of God and serve them with love and understanding.<br><br><b>Eighth,</b>the secret of life is service. May you learn the secret of service and the secret of love, which will mean that you will have learned the secret of life. Let's go from glory to glory, our journey ever onward and upward, until, brothers and sisters, we fill this earth with the joy of our tears and happiness because we have purified and sanctified our lives and our service for someone else's happiness. Let us come out from the depths of grief, pain, sorrow, loneliness, selfishness, sickness, and discouragement by living the qualities of pure love of Christ. Love the Lord and give service to other people, to the other children of our Heavenly Father.<br><br>Brothers and sisters,<i>heighten your capacity</i>to give of yourself to the most worthwhile causes. The celestial criteria measures service, not status. Clothe yourselves with the most warm and spiritual and most delightful clothes--the love of the Savior.<br><br>I stand before you and bear my testimony that this is the work of the Lord. And I stand before you and say that I know Jesus is the Christ, the son of the living God. I stood where Jesus walked and I felt his spirit when I stood in the upper room where the Last Supper was held. As we went to the Garden of Gethsemane I felt his spirit. As I stood in the garden tomb I cried with the joy of his love. I know that he lives and that this is his work. I know that Jesus is our master. I testify to you that I know that he lives, in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Yoshihiko Kikuchi was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 11 June 1985.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>emplation of Beauty: An Avenue to Communication with the Lord - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
One of the prevailing and enduring challenges that man faces during his sojourn on this earth is how he can learn to effectively communicate with God. How can man open the channels of communication? How does God reveal Himself to man? What can man do to receive assurance that God is aware of man's existence and his problems? Questions such as these have been asked by men throughout the ages, sometimes very poignantly and eloquently by philosophers, poets, and prophets.<br><br>Prophets, of course, viewed from the average man's frame of reference, seem to enjoy a very special relationship with our Heavenly Father and appear to communicate with ease. After all, they have direct access to the Lord and can speak with Him face-to-face, and sometimes they do so in a most remarkable and human manner.<br><h2><b>Speaking with God Face-to-Face</b></h2><br>To me, Moses is the finest example in biblical history of a prophet speaking with God face-to-face in a manner that reveals a unique and intimate relationship between God and man. Let me recall the famous dialogue as it is recorded in the book of Exodus. Moses had fled from the Egyptian court and was tending the sheep of his father-in-law, Jethro, when one day he approached Mount Horeb, a mountain which was sacred to the Lord Jehovah. Attracted by a burning bush that was not, however, consumed by the flames, Moses hears the voice of Jehovah calling him, "Moses, Moses!" and he answers, "Here am I."<br><br>The Lord then warns him not to come any closer and to remove his shoes from his feet for he is standing on holy ground. Next, He identifies Himself as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the distinguished ancestors of Moses.<br><br><i>. . . I am the God of thy father; the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;</i><br><br><i>And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land . . . flowing with milk and honey. . . .</i><br><br><i>Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.</i><br><br><i>Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.</i>[Exodus 3:6–10]<br><br>Now let us assume for a moment that we were in Moses' place and had just been given these instructions. Besides being frightened and barely able to mumble our consent, we would probably attempt to hurry as fast as we could out of the Lord's presence and carry out His command as expeditiously as possible. But not Moses. Not only does he keep his composure, which is extraordinary enough, but he communicates in an utterly uncomplicated and human way his profound reservations. In short, he says he cannot do it.<br><br><i>And Moses said unto God, who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?</i>[Exodus 3:11]<br><br>Why should he question the Lord's choice? Had he not been carefully trained at the Pharaoh's court in the art of statecraft, administration, and leading people? And did he not know how to deal with kings and court officials? Who was better prepared than Moses? Nevertheless, the Lord understands and empathizes and assures His servant that He will be with him. But Moses thinks of new objections: "The Israelites will put me to the test and ask about thy name." Patiently the Lord tells Moses how to reply and then charges him to gather together the elders, go with them before Pharaoh, and request permission to perform sacrifices. Again He assures Moses that He will be with him and manifest His power unto Pharaoh. Now, after this long and patient discourse, does Moses go? Listen!<br><br><i>And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The Lord hath not appeared unto thee.</i>[Exodus 4:1]<br><br>So the Lord performs several miracles to demonstrate His power and to convince Moses He indeed will be able to protect him and be at his side. Does Moses go now? Slowly we are getting the impression that Moses is not really too anxious to do what Jehovah wants him to do.<br><br><i>And Moses said unto the Lord, O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.</i>[Exodus 4:10]<br><br>I really find no evidence in the text or in the dialogue that Moses is either slow of wit or slow of tongue, and he certainly does not seem to lack courage. I find him rather quick of wit and quick of tongue. But still the Lord is long-suffering, although I now detect a touch of impatience in His answer, which is much shorter than previous replies and has a distinct curtness to it.<br><br><i>And the Lord said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf,</i>or<i>the seeing, or the blind? have not I the Lord?</i><br><br><i>Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, hand teach thee what thou shalt say.</i>[Exodus 4:11, 12]<br><br>Now, certainly Moses will finally go. He is running out of excuses. But no, he simply informs the Lord that He has chosen the wrong man for this assignment:<br><br><i>. . . O my Lord, send, I pray thee . . . him whom thou wilt send</i>[but not me!]. [Exodus 4:13]<br><br>At this time we expect lightning to strike, but although the Lord becomes angry, He controls His wrath and still accommodates Moses by telling him that He will permit his brother Aaron to accompany him and be the spokesman.<br><br><i>And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. . . .</i><br><br><i>And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do. And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be . . . to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God.</i><br><br><i>And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.</i>[Exodus 4:14–17]<br><br>With that the conversation abruptly ends. It seems that the Lord quickly disappears and leaves Moses to ponder the momentous events that have transpired. The rest is history.<br><br>I cannot help but admire and envy the marvelous relationship that prophets have with God. To speak with Him in such an honest and forthright manner, to tell Him of reservations and anxieties, and to have Him respond in a patient and understanding way must appear to most of us to be an impossible dream. Why can't we speak with the Lord like Moses? Or like Abraham, who bargained for the lives of the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah and wrestled from God a promise that He would spare the cities if ten righteous people could be found inside them? Or Jonah, who, much like Moses, tried to avoid carrying out a difficult mission so that God had to prepare a huge fish to transport him back to the shores of Nineveh? Then, when he had preached, and the inhabitants of the city had repented and turned to the Lord, he became angry with God for sparing the city. Can you imagine being angry with the Lord, or, even more so, the Lord understanding and forgiving such behavior?<br><h2><b>Communicating Through the Spirit</b></h2><br>I have made the point that prophets are privileged to communicate with God in a marvelously direct and wondrous manner. Such direct, face-to-face communication will forever remain an impossibility for the vast majority of mankind; nevertheless, communication with God is possible for us also. Although it is not likely that Jehovah will summon us from a burning bush, we can approach Him in the privacy of our room or some secluded spot in nature and tell Him our frustrations, our reservations, our failures, our inadequacies, and our faults. It may seem to us that such a conversation is rather one-sided, that we hear but one voice--our own. However, we can learn to hear the Lord's voice also, but we must be patient and we must be prepared to wait--sometimes for a long, long time--and we must listen carefully. Perhaps we have to struggle at first, like Enos did.<br><br><i>And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul; and all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the night came I did still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens.</i>[Enos 4]<br><br>To Enos the voice of the Lord Jehovah came through the spirit:<br><br><i>And while I was thus struggling in the spirit, behold, the voice of the Lord came into my mind again, saying . . .</i>[Enos 10]<br><br>In section 8 of the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord tells us how He communicates His will to most of us:<br><br><i>Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 8:2]<br><br>These remarkable scriptures tell us that we can also communicate with the Father--even, perhaps, as honestly as Moses and Abraham and Jonah, except not face-to-face like Moses did, but through the Spirit like Enos. Sometimes, after we may have tried for a very long time unsuccessfully to open the windows of heaven, we might despair--but so did the prophets, even the Savior. Remember the agonizing cry when Christ was hanging on the cross and the Father had withdrawn:<br><br><i>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</i>[Matthew 27:46]<br><br>Many of us here can identify with that soul-wrenching question. Certainly the great German reformer Martin Luther could, who, after years of painful and desperate struggle to understand God's will, was finally able to love and trust God again, when he learned to understand that Christ's terrifying forsaken state was but temporary, that Elohim had left Him only for a while to receive Him to His bosom after He had accomplished His great atoning sacrifice. When Luther finally comprehended this truth, he began to understand that the Lord had not abandoned him permanently either, but was preparing him for the work of the Reformation. We recall also the terrifying months during which the Prophet Joseph and the Saints in Missouri had to endure all manner of humiliation, degradation, and terrible persecution while he was helplessly imprisoned in that abominable jail in Liberty, Missouri.<br><br>O<i>God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place?</i><br><br><i>How long shall thy hand he stayed, and thine eye . . . behold from the eternal heavens the wrongs of thy people and of thy servants, and thine ear be penetrated with their cries? . . .</i><br><br><i>O Lord God Almighty, . . . stretch forth thy hand; let thine eye pierce; let thy pavilion be taken up; let thy hiding place no longer be covered; let thine ear be inclined; let thine heart be softened, and thy bowels moved with compassion toward us. . . .</i><br><br><i>Remember thy suffering saints, O our God; and thy servants will rejoice in thy name forever.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:1–6]<br><br>Some of us, especially the older ones among us, understand this kind of communication all too well. Have we not wondered and cried: "Why hast thou forsaken me?" or "Where art thou Lord?" However, if we are humble and patient enough, we will learn that God has not forsaken us, as He did not forsake His son or His prophet Joseph.<br><br>While the avenues of prophetic communication are not open to us in the same way as they were open to Moses or Joseph, and while communication through the Spirit may be difficult and sometimes frustrating, there is another avenue that is readily available to all of us--an avenue which we might try, if we have not yet done so, an avenue which will certainly lead us to experience God's beauty and love in a most remarkable way. For the rest of my time today, I wish to suggest such a way which has been a source of much inspiration and joy to me in my life and has revealed God to me. This is the way of beauty--the aesthetic experience.<br><h2><b>The Contemplation of Beauty</b></h2><br>For Latter-day Saints, the aesthetic experience (that is the experience with beauty), should have special significance, since beauty is an important avenue to the enjoyment of reality, toward learning about our own sensitivities and the deeper levels of our soul, and it is--at the same time--an avenue to encountering God and communicating with Him. Greek and medieval philosophers believed that man could get closer to the absolute ideal--we would call it God today--through contemplation of beauty. Absolute beauty, according to Plato, is not encountered on earth. However, various reflections of it can be encountered by mortal man in what Plato calls "an ascending order" (<i>Symposium,</i>211). This order begins with the physical beauty of nature and art and then ascends upward through various fair forms and ideas to fair practices and, finally, to what Plato calls "beauty absolute" and which the church fathers call God. "He who has learned to see beauty in due order and succession, when he comes towards the end, will perceive a nature of wondrous beauty . . . beauty absolute" (<i>Symposium,</i>211). Allow me to paraphrase what the philosopher is saying here so that we can understand it from our frame of reference. As we learn to see beauty in nature and in art we will progress in our thinking toward the author and creator of such beauty, who is God. Thus the contemplation of beauty will lead us into communion with God, which should be one of man's greatest quests. "This is the life above all others which man should live, in the contemplation of beauty absolute," says Socrates in the<i>Symposium,</i>or, in other words, "This is the life above all others which man should live, in the contemplation of God." He continues and says that once we have learned to behold the beauty of God we will no longer seek after mundane things like "gold" or beautiful "garments." Then he makes a profound observation on which I will elaborate:<br><br><i>Remember how in that communion only, beholding beauty with the eye of the mind, he</i>[the observer of beauty absolute]<i>will be enabled to bring forth . . . true virtue to become the friend of God and be immortal, if mortal man may.</i>[<i>Symposium,</i>212]<br><br>We are surrounded by the beauty of nature, even on this university campus. How I appreciate the efforts of those men and women who labor to plant the flowers, prune the trees, and groom the lawns, and yet how many there are of us who pass by heedlessly or who mar the beauty by thoughtless action. In his prayer "For This World," Walter Rauschenbusch expresses my feelings rather eloquently:<br><br><i>We thank thee [O Lord] for our senses by which we can see the splendor of the morning and hear the jubilant songs of love, and smell the breath of the springtime. Grant us, we pray thee, a heart wide open to all this joy and beauty, and save our souls from being so steeped in care or so darkened by passion that we pass heedless and unseeing when even the thornbush by the wayside is aflame with the glory of God.</i>[<i>A Rauschenbusch Reader; the Kingdom of God and the Social Gospel,</i>compo Benson Y. Landis (New York: Harper and Brothers, 1957), p. 151]<br><br>This ability to see, this vision--the contemplation of beauty absolute--has been the pursuit of the poet, the painter, the musician, the prophet--in short, of the sensitive man. Yet it is very difficult for most artists to successfully translate the vision into reality, and only some have been blessed with that ability. One of these is Michelangelo, who beheld the glory and beauty of God and revealed it to us in the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel and in the statues of<i>David, Moses,</i>and the<i>Pieta.</i>Here the vision has been painted in brilliant color and chiseled in glorious white Carrara marble. The ideals of youth and wisdom and courage and beauty and godliness have been cast into perfect form, the harmonious fusion of idea and form perfectly achieved. Such a miracle stirs our soul to the very depths because here we encounter beauty in its sublimest revelation, in the realization that God has revealed Himself in the form of this magnificent art. And as we thus confront<i>David</i>or<i>Moses</i>or the<i>Pieta</i>--or<i>,</i>rather, as they confront us--we communicate with God. We are made aware of our own capacity to feel and to love, to feel the majesty and grandeur of God and His magnificence--feelings that are difficult to describe. Perhaps you have not yet experienced such feelings as you were confronted with great art or great music or great literature, but perhaps you have as you contemplated the "driving clouds, the constellations in the sky, or the everlasting hills." Again, it is the poet who verbalizes this experience in language that uplifts us. As he views the stars and the galaxies moving in their appointed ways, his soul begins to expand and yearn for union with the Creator:<br><br><i>Und meine Seele spannte</i><br><i>Weit ihre Flügel aus,</i><br><i>Flog durch die stillen Lande,</i><br><i>Als flüge sie nach Haus.</i><br><i>(My soul spread out its wings widely and was lifted up as if it were to meet God in our heavenly home.)</i>[Joseph von Eichendorff, "Mondnacht," in<i>Gedichte</i>(Stuttgart: J. G. Cotta, 1957), p. 306]<br><br>As we are humbled by the grandeur and magnificence of beauty in art or in nature, we are at the same time also elevated and lifted up--brought home, as the poet says, brought into communication with the Lord, who is beauty and truth.<br><br><i>It is only through the morning gate of the beautiful that you can penetrate into the realm of knowledge. That which we feel here as beauty we shall one day know as truth.</i>[Johann Christoph Friedrich von Schiller, quoted by Charles N. Douglas,<i>Forty Thousand Sublime and Beautiful Thoughts,</i>vol. 1 (New York: The Christian Herald, 1904), p. 152]<br><br>Out of this dual mood--humility and exaltation--arises man's awareness of his own inner depth and of his internal resources and the realization that the author of the sublime beauty and of the feelings of exaltation is God, the creator of heaven and earth.<br><br><i>And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very</i>[beautiful]. [Genesis 1:31]<br><br>Actually, as you know, the scripture does not read "beautiful" but "good," but the beautiful and the good are really one and the same, and the philosophers, of course, have made us aware of the intimate relationship between the aesthetic experience and morality. Let me recall Plato's profound statement in the<i>Symposium</i>which I quoted above: The observer of beauty absolute, the person who beholds eternal and divine beauty "will be enabled to bring forth . . . true virtue" so that he becomes "the friend of God" and, in a sense, "immortal." Only through the contemplation of beauty--divine beauty, not the beauty of the world and of fashion, which is so prominently displayed around us today--does man become good. In one of his sonnets, Michelangelo, the painter of the Sistine Chapel ceiling, expresses this idea: Any beauteous thing raises the pure and just desire of man from earth to God, the eternal font of all (see<i>The Sonnets of Michael Angelo Buonarroti,</i>trans. John A. Symonds [London: Smith, Elder and Co., 1878], nos. LIV and LVI). This was also the credo of the German idealists, Goethe and Schiller, who believed that there is no more powerful antidote to sensuality, wickedness, and selfishness than the adoration of beauty, and they considered beauty at once as the ultimate and the highest aim of art and literature.<br><br>You may have noticed in your own experience with divine art or music that a calmness descended upon your soul which gradually stilled all passion and selfish desire. The next time you view a magnificent work of art, or the expanse of the universe at night, or as you listen to the words of an inspired poet or prophet or the sublime chords of a musical composition, take inventory and watch if that calmness does not descend upon your soul again. Do we not resolve in those moments to become a better person? Does not the Spirit of Christ--or the Holy Ghost, if you wish--draw us toward the bosom of the Father and purify our soul?<br><br>I would like to emphasize that I am not speaking of fads or fashions, the type of art and music and poetry and dress and grooming and behavior which is frequently identified with a particularly popular group or pseudophilosophical movement. Some call this beautiful, but I do not. Here, I believe, beauty and grace are sacrificed all too often to vulgarity and temporary fixation, and we would seek in vain for inspiration or a lifting up of our soul. That beauty which uplifts and ennobles is godlike and unchanging and transports us into His eternal divine presence. It makes us aware of His glory and majesty, it makes us feel the warmth of His love, which manifests itself in Christ, who atoned for us on the cross and opened wide the doors leading into the realms of everlasting beauty.<br><br><i>It was on the morning of a beautiful, clear day . . . when . . . I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description.</i><br><br><i>He had on a loose robe of most exquisite whiteness . . . beyond anything earthly I had ever seen; nor do I believe that any earthly thing could be made to appear so exceedingly white and brilliant. . . . His whole person was, glorious beyond description, and his countenance truly like lightning.</i>[Joseph Smith--History 1:14, 17; 31, 32]<br><br><i>These are they whose bodies are celestial, whose glory is that of the sun, even the glory of God, the highest of all, whose glory the sun of the firmament is written of as being typical.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 76:70]<br><br><i>And if your eye be single to my glory</i>[my beauty],<i>your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, sanctify yourselves that your minds become single to God, and the days will come that you shall see him; for he will unveil his face unto you, and it shall be in his own time, and his own way, and according to his own will.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:67–68]<br><br>May we draw near to the Lord and feel communication with Him as we learn to reach Him on His level and in His sphere.<br><br>I pray that the Lord will unveil His face and His glory unto us when we contemplate His beauty as it is revealed in the art of the masters and the splendor of nature that surrounds us, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Hans-Wilhelm Kelling was a professor of Germanic and Slavic languages at Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 9 July 1985.</i></i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>l Experience - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My brothers and sisters, I want to begin by telling you that I feel and know the responsibility that is mine in talking to you this day. It is always an immense responsibility to talk of the ways of the Lord, and so I pray that I may be blessed to say the things of my heart, and that you will be able to receive them as they are meant, and that the whole experience may be profitable and good and sanctified by the Holy Spirit. I pray for the Holy Spirit to be with me and with you during these few minutes that we will spend together.<br><br>Not long ago I was conversing with one of my married daughters. We were talking about a spiritual experience given to one of our forebears and she said to me, "How is it that the pioneers seemed to have so many spiritual experiences and we have so few? Shouldn't we have the same kind of experiences they had?"<br><br>Perhaps you've puzzled over the same kind of question. Most of us do at some time or another in our lives. This morning I want to bear witness to the reality, the availability, and the purpose and place of spiritual experience in our lives. I do this with the aim of strengthening others and myself, and for no other purpose.<br><br>Over the centuries, philosophers have argued how we can know things, and, indeed, whether we can know anything at all. I can't worry with that this morning. I know that eventually I cannot go beyond my own experience. I can only tell you how it has been and is with me. I can relate to you the experiences of others, but even as I do that, I am really only telling you how it is with me as I contemplate others' experiences. I really understand Henry David Thoreau, who said that he would not talk so much about himself if there were anyone else that he knew as well. And though my experience, like Thoreau's, may be narrow, I do know that it is real. At least it is real to me. This morning I would bear testimony of that, in the belief that lives are very much alike, and that my life is like all of yours, and that the great experience of being is far deeper than we most often perceive and far beyond outward appearances. I want to bear testimony that spiritual experience is real, that it is available to us, and that it provides truth and power to affect and change our lives if we put ourselves in a position to receive it.<br><br>Spiritual experience is real. There is a spiritual dimension. In fact, our mortal dimension, bounded by space and time, is but a small fragment of a much larger reality which surrounds us and contains us far beyond our knowledge. Within our bodies dwell our spirits, heavenly beings which are programmed to respond to the spiritual dimension.<br><br>Good and evil are spiritual. Perhaps because evil is more shocking to our spiritual perceptors, we notice its presence easily. I doubt there is a person in this room who has not had an experience wherein he has sensed the presence of evil, sometime, somewhere. It is given to us to be aware of evil. We can sense evil thought or evil intention in those around us. Many of you, I'm sure, have had the experience of knowing in your heart that there was evil close by you, that you should not be with someone any longer, or that you should not stay where you are. I remember when I was young and leaving home for service in the U.S. Navy. My grandmother cautioned me that the Spirit of the Lord would not go with me into places where evil was. That fact was verified for me many, many times as my duties required that I be in places where evil ruled in the hearts of men. We, that is, our spirits, recoil from evil--at least we do until we become so used to its presence that we lose our ability to be shocked by it, and, in fact, become insensitive to its presence. This is the danger which faces all of us in our present-day world so filled with selfishness, bloodshed, carnage, and terror.<br><br>Goodness is just as easy for us to sense as evil, but, because it is not shocking or traumatic, it is easier for us not to notice it. Yet goodness is powerful, much more powerful than evil. Goodness is holy. Inevitably, it eventually witnesses of Jesus Christ. Our spirits respond to the guileless love of little children and to the unstinting service of mothers. It is always comfortable to be accepted and loved. It feels so good to be honest. And do we not all know the sweet relief which comes from being forgiven? Forgiveness is godly. When we forgive others their trespasses against us, we partake of the work of the Atonement. We assume a responsibility and release a responsibility in a relationship with others. This is what Jesus does in our relationship with him. How sweet and lovely is the release which comes with his assumption of that responsibility when he forgives us our trespasses against him. I'm sure there are those in this room who, with me, have felt that sweet release. It is spiritual and real. Thus it is that repentance is the basic primary principle of the gospel of Jesus Christ, for it cleanses and retunes our spirits to things as they really are.<br><br>The verification we receive when we pray for testimony is part of this kind of experience. Testimony is not an isolated spiritual experience; it is simply more specialized and more intensive than those other verifications of goodness and right which are going on around us all the time.<br><br>The witness of the truth of the Book of Mormon which came to me as a young man was that kind of experience. It was during World War II. I was a young sailor assigned to the Anacostia Naval Air Station in Washington, D.C. I was just a small insignificant cog in a vast system of cogs and wheels that turned for much larger purposes. One of my jobs was to help make training films, identifying shapes and outlines of enemy ships and airplanes. These films were made in a large, barnlike structure containing a big flat stage approximating the horizon or the sea or whatever was demanded. The building itself was filled with models and outlines and forms and staging devices to make possible the fulfillment of our assignment. Most of the time we were very busy, but there came a time toward the end of the war when we went for weeks without assignment. Eventually, all the other personnel on this job were assigned to other duties, but for some reason I was left alone in the building, I guess to guard the equipment. At first I enjoyed my freedom. It was great to have nothing to do. All the electricity in the building was turned off with the exception of one outlet, into which was plugged a small crook-necked lamp which sat on the corner of a flat drafting table. There was a hard wooden chair where I could sit if I cared to. All the rest of the great building was in darkness. So for a few days I opened the door to the outside light and sat in the doorway on the old chair and thoroughly enjoyed myself, but before long I became immensely bored.<br><br>I had been raised in the Church by careful parents who had taught me the gospel, but I had never read the Book of Mormon completely through for myself. One day, as I sat idle, I decided this was an opportune time for me to do this. And so, that afternoon, I brought my small serviceman's Book of Mormon from my quarters and, desiring privacy, went inside the building and turned on the little light by the table and began to read, hunched over there in that great dark building. I remember how I was struck by those first words, "I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents. ..." And as the days went by I read every word, and my soul, programmed as it was to goodness and truth, began to respond to the testimonies of the prophets. I had never had such an experience! I read slowly, prayerfully, savoring every word, looking forward to what was to come, even wishing that it would never end. I had feelings in my heart that I had never been conscious of before. And when at last I read the admonition of Moroni at the end of the book, I felt a great desire in my heart to try his words, to ask for spiritual verification even greater than what I was then feeling. I remember shutting the doors of that vast building and locking myself in, then kneeling in the darkness on the cold cement floor, my forehead resting against the hard wooden seat of the old chair, and telling the Lord that I believed the words of Moroni, and asking him to strengthen my belief into knowledge.<br><br>I shall never forget what happened; I have felt it many times since. I became aware that I was surrounded by a power beyond myself, which came over me and through me. It was all around me, calm, clear, indescribably powerful. It seemed white and delicious to me, like the fruit of the tree of life which Nephi told of. It filled me completely to the brim and over the brim, and did not leave me for days afterward. It was not shocking or disturbing in any way, as is the power of evil, but was sweet and assuring to my soul. I knew that the book was true.<br><br>Such a witness, an actual spiritual verification, is available to all of us always, no matter when or where we live. We do not need to have been a pioneer to know the Book of Mormon is true, or that the gospel is true, but we<i>do</i>need to be spiritually available, and spiritually aware. I'm sure that the Lord works through us whether we are spiritually aware or not, but what a shame it is, I think, to not hear the music, and not enjoy the orchestration. And we should not fear these things or turn from them, but should, indeed, desire to know them. They are ours by right of inheritance and performance. As Latter-day Saints, we have performed the ordinances, or at least some of them, and have received the gift of the Holy Ghost, which is the right to spiritual experience. But we must live for these things. The kind of richly textured spiritual experience we are speaking of now is not to be gotten without striving. There must be purpose and need and a great determination toward righteousness. There must be example to follow, and humility, and great desire.<br><br>Oh, how I have longed for the spirit of pure intelligence which so often filled my great father as he taught the gospel of Jesus Christ. How I have prayed for and desired the spiritual sensitivity of my great-grandfather, who saw angels and talked with God. And when I have lived best, I have felt these things, even as they did. We are given the promise and the power to part the veil, even as the brother of Jared, or Moroni, or Nephi, or Paul, or Joseph Smith, or my father, or grandfather, or great-grandfather; and when this happens, it is a sweet and rich and unforgettable experience.<br><br>One evening, years ago, my wife and I sat alone together in the playroom of our house. The children were all asleep in their beds, and we were awaiting the birth of a new little baby. My wife, big with child, was sitting in the rocking chair a few feet from me, and I was sitting by the table. We were talking softly together, knowing that the baby would arrive that night. The lights were low and there was a feeling of spiritual presence in the room, soft and comfortable. We were filled with love for each other and for the baby that was to come. I remember looking at her--she was rocking quietly, her eyes closed, her pale white hands spread across her full waist. The sweet feeling in the room grew and persisted. It was very powerful.<br><br>I said to her, "Do you feel this all around us?" and she replied, "Yes." It was lovely being with her there then. It was a sweet closeness, a unity I can hardly describe.<br><br>"Can you tell?" I said. "We shall have a son."<br><br>"I know," she replied. "It will be a boy."<br><br>And then for me the veil parted, and I saw our son--standing, waiting, a few feet from the chair my wife was rocking in. He was tall and well-formed--taller and larger, it seemed to me, than the room allowed. There was power about his person, great power and goodness and patience and love. I said, "Do you see him standing there beside you?" Again there swelled that sweet feeling of closeness and unity. She looked at me, confident, a small smile playing about her lips. "I don't need to," she said, "I know he is there."<br><br>Joseph Smith said that our loved ones are around us all the time. I believe that. I believe it with all my heart. And I'm sure that our loved ones loved us even before we or they were born. One day I helped one of my little grandsons in the bathroom with his needs. Perhaps feeling a bit embarrassed at my invasion of his three-and-a-half-year-old privacy, I hugged him up to me and said, "You know, it is good for me to help you because I'm big and you are little." He looked up at me with his big brown eyes and said, very seriously, "I helped you when you were little." I remembered my training in childhood education and I replied with confidence, "Yes, I know. You were big when I was little, and I am big when you are little." But he shook his little head and looked up at me again; there was seriousness and wisdom in his eyes. He paused a moment, and then said sweetly and clearly, "No, Grandpa. I mean before I was born, when you were little, I helped you." And he added, "I liked to help you." Then he turned and ran off to his playthings and I remembered how Jesus opened the mouths of the little Nephite children and they told their parents things of the spiritual dimension which were unspeakably beautiful and impossible to write.<br><br>I remember, as a young elders president, being baffled by serious problems and, feeling lonely and unable, praying for assurance and for help. One evening, as I walked home from the university along the darkening, empty, evening streets, praying in my heart in my loneliness, I became aware of the presence of my grandfather walking close beside me. I could not see him, but I knew he was there and I knew who he was and I felt the warmth of his love and his strength. In his life he had sat in the councils of the Church, and had known these problems and known this loneliness. He stayed with me for days. He was close beside me while I settled into the harness of my new presidency and learned how to do the job I'd been called to do.<br><br>My brothers and sisters, spiritual experience is real--it is available to us to provide knowledge and power to affect, to control, and to change our situations. For instance, prayer is, or ought to be, a spiritual experience. We are promised revelation through prayer, and, oh, how we need help from beyond the veil in our everyday lives, in our comings and goings, in our decisions and associations, in our courtships, our marriages, our fatherhood and motherhood. These are eternal things and have bearing upon our eternal achievement and our eternal exaltation.<br><br>How often my wife and I have knelt in prayer seeking information and confirmation in the needs and decisions of our parenthood. And how often the answers have come, sometimes as changes in our feelings, sometimes as gentle suggestions and insights, and sometimes as vision--showing us the very lives of our children, even the very events and circumstances which faced them and which needed to be dealt with. We have known the need for comfort and assurance, and we have received it, not once, but time and time again.<br><br>I bear witness that the Lord seeks to be in our lives. He has so arranged our mortal situation that we can have and know truth beyond the limits of our mortality. We are<i>not</i>left alone. How thankful we should be for covenants and ordinances, and priesthood power. Ordinances and covenants are means whereby we link ourselves beyond the veil and lay hold upon blessings in this life and beyond this life. When we keep our covenants and obey the ordinances, eternal consequences inevitably follow. The Lord says he is bound when we do what he says, and the Lord does not lie (see D&amp;amp;C 82:10). As the great example, and as a loving father, he trusts us with spiritual power far beyond our comprehension. Priesthood is the authority to use the power of God in all things for the welfare of mankind. Priesthood is judgment. Correctly used, it is always decisive and conclusive. It contains great redemptive power. To<i>redeem</i>is to rejudge, to reassess. The redemptive power of the priesthood is that power which allows a reassessment, a rejudgment of a situation, and a consequent change in accordance with that judgment.<br><br>When the Prophet Joseph Smith healed Sister Johnson's arm back in Ohio, there were those who questioned how long her arm would remain well. They felt that somehow the healing was a deceptive facade and could not last because the arm was really sick underneath. Joseph Smith told them that the healed arm was as well now as the other one and equally subject again to all the trials and vicissitudes of life. What he was saying was that through the redemptive power of the priesthood, a reassessment had been made, and the arm which had begun to stiffen and shrivel and become useless had been returned to its former health and strength. (See Hyrum and Helen May Andrus,<i>They Knew the Prophet</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1974], pp. 60–61.) This, after all, is what happens, or ought to happen, with every priesthood blessing. But we need to have the courage to use that priesthood power; we ought not step aside and merely pray over the person seeking the blessing. Priesthood power is real; it is meant to redeem, restore, and strengthen. The process is the same, the power, always available and there. Often I have felt that power--power outside myself--moving through me to the person being blessed.<br><br>I remember blessing a young mother who came seeking renewed strength to endure a difficult pregnancy with her third or fourth child. She had great faith, and as I blessed her, as her bishop, I felt power streaming down my arms and through my fingers into the crown of her head. I felt it course through her body, even to the tips of her toes. It was a powerful, cleansing, rejuvenating force, almost electric in its energy, yet calm and soft and assuring. After the blessing she arose and, with tears in her eyes, said, "I felt that all the way to the tips of my toes." Priesthood power is power from Jesus Christ, the Redeemer, and is a great trust and a great responsibility.<br><br>But we must understand that in order to be alive to these things, to know them and experience them and use them in our lives, we must put ourselves in position to receive them. And indeed, we do position ourselves, every day, in every moment, for good or for evil. There is no neutral moment or neutral ground. The depths and the intensities of the spiritual dimension are all around us. Within them, we live and move and have our being. Each day we choose again and again between good and evil. We place ourselves where we want to be, whether we mean to do it or not. Spiritual progress is a negative option. If we do not choose to grow toward the good, we have chosen to grow toward the bad. We do not and cannot stand still. That is why the Lord said that those who are not for him are against him.<br><br>And so, when my daughter questioned whether we, in our time, should not have the same kind of spiritual experiences as the pioneers, she really was making an observation about our spiritual position. The gospel is the road map. It contains all the information and all the instruction. It tells us how to put ourselves in a proper position to have the awareness and the experience, the knowledge and the redemptive power which we have a right to have in this life. "In other words," the Lord says, "I give unto you directions how you may act before me, that it may turn to you for your salvation" (D&amp;amp;C 82:9).<br><br>All commandments of the Lord are directions for achieving spiritual progress. All require obedience, and to the extent that we obey is the consequent blessing. Giving, serving, loving, understanding, being unselfish, charitable, being honest and chaste--all have spiritual consequence. Keeping the word of wisdom, paying tithing, keeping the law of the fast, praying always--these actions ease us into a position where the things of the spirit flow unto us and nourish us without compulsory means. When we attend our meetings with a right heart, we give strength and receive strength from others. When we prayerfully study the scriptures, we reach beyond time and space and learn from the testimonies and experiences of those who have gone before. And when we qualify and receive our ordinances and make our covenants in the holy temples of the Lord, we place ourselves in a direct line of spiritual assurance, power, and strength. But we must will to do these things; they cannot be done for us. Our pioneer forefathers lived in the spirit and recorded their experiences. We, too, may do the same.<br><br>I bear testimony to the reality of the things of the spirit and to their constant availability to us to provide us with truth and power to affect and change our lives as we put ourselves in position to do so, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Richard G. Ellsworth was an English professor at Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 23 July 1985.</i></i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<br>
I think the setting and the atmosphere here this evening has been ideal. To enjoy the sweet strains of the music that put us in the mood of meditation is appropriate for a Sunday evening fireside. To come here and greet you, the majority assembled as students of Brigham Young University and members of the various stakes that have been organized here, makes us feel the richness of our privilege. It is a real honor to be in your presence. We see great things in you reflecting out of various experiences in our own lives and we recognize the unspent strength, the vision, the power, and the great capacity that resides in you that is now budding and blossoming and will have its fulfillment in years to come.<br><br>My remarks this evening are put together on an informal basis, and I hope that they will be blessed and touched in such a way that they can be appreciated by all. Since those who leave this university will be spreading abroad among the nations and peoples of the earth, perhaps much more so than would be expected of graduates from other institutions, there will come a need to know how to relate to those who have differences in beliefs. A principle in all human relations is to know how to interpret ourselves to other people and to help them understand and appreciate us. This is both possible and necessary, even when we do not have complete agreement in beliefs and philosophies.<br><h2><b>Be Prepared for Reality</b></h2><br>It will soon become apparent, if you have not discovered it already, that everyone in the world does not look with favor upon the LDS Church. Thinking realistically, this Church and its people are still thought of as among the least desirable of religions. In fact, among certain groups, we are considered a representation of the powers of evil; there are those in the world who consider that it would be a service to God if we could be eliminated as a religion.<br><br>Quoting from the scriptures:<br><br><i>They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.</i>[John 16:2]<br><br>There are, of course, many people of sound understanding who do recognize that true Latter-day Saints are choice people of worth and substance, having characteristics that are worthy of emulation and who represent a powerful force for good in the social order of the world. We usually seem to have an expectation that those in the world around us will look up to us in appreciation of our unity and organization, our high moral and ethical standards, our achievements in solving the social problems, and our vision of the worth of humanity.<br><br>To be realistic, however, we need to be prepared for reality and learn how to deal with it. Our people have always been subject to intense criticism, to ridicule, and to overt persecution. It was emphatically true in the days of Joseph Smith. It was true during my childhood. It is true today and we may anticipate that direct opposition will continue in the future.<br><br>How, then, do we deal with this condition?<br><br>How can we explain ourselves? How can we respond effectively to the voices of opposition, ridicule, and even hatred? What answers do we have? I want you to know that there are sound and appropriate responses. They can be both effective and powerful in gaining better understanding and, ultimately, in converting others to the truth we represent. We are not interested only in having others like us--our great purpose is to help them understand God's revealed plan and then to embrace it.<br><h2><b>Respecting Those of Other Religions</b></h2><br>I had a few reflections as President Hinckley was greeting a group of ministers during the open house in the Jordan River Temple several years ago. After he had welcomed them as our guests and expressed the appreciation we have for their service in bringing their people to righteousness, he invited their questions. Two or three in the group, forgetting their manners as guests in a warm and friendly situation, asked some cutting and antagonistic questions. Central to their criticism was a demand for President Hinckley to justify the declaration mentioned in Joseph Smith's testimony, as he beheld the Father and the Son, that those professors of religion were all corrupt. President Hinckley responded that he did not say that.<br><br>As I have pondered the same question, I wonder: Do we believe that all ministers of other churches are corrupt? Of course not. Joseph Smith certainly did not intend that. By reading the passage carefully, we find that the Lord Jesus Christ was referring to those ministers who were quarreling and arguing about which church was true--that is, the particular group with which Joseph Smith was involved. They were drawing (the Savior said it, not Joseph Smith) "near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me, they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof" (JS–H 1:19).<br><br>It is clearly apparent that there have been and now are many choice, honorable, and devoted men and women going in the direction of their eternal salvation who give righteous and conscientious leadership to their congregations in other churches. Joseph Smith evidently had many warm and friendly contacts with ministers of other religions. Quite a few of them joined the Church: Sidney Rigdon, John Taylor, Parley P. Pratt, and others in America and England. Some of them who carried the Christian attitude of tolerance did not join the Church. There are many others like them today.<br><br>It is a fact, however, that Joseph Smith was roughly handled by the members and ministers of various prominent religions, who tarred and feathered him, took up arms against him and his people, imprisoned him, and finally instigated his murder and martyrdom. Some of them still follow a similar course of ridicule and active antagonism. This condition must not warp our own understanding and conduct.<br><br>Are ministers of other churches inspired of God? Of course they are if they are righteous and sincere. Do they accomplish good? Certainly. In his journal, Wilford Woodruff records this incident before he ever heard about the Church.<br><br><i>The people of Connecticut in those days thought it wicked to believe in any religion, or belong to any church, except the Presbyterian. They did not believe in having any prophets, apostles, or revelations, as they had in the days of Jesus, and as we now have in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</i><br><br><i>There was an aged man in Connecticut, however, by the name of Robert Mason, who did not believe like the rest of the people. He believed it was necessary to have prophets, apostles, dreams, visions and revelations in the church of Christ, the same as they had who lived in ancient days; and he believed the Lord would raise up a people and a church, in the last days, with prophets, apostles, and all the gifts, powers and blessings, which it ever contained in any age of the world.</i><br><br><i>The people called this man, the old prophet Mason. . . .</i><br><br><i>This prophet prayed a great deal, and he had dreams and visions, and the Lord showed him many things, by visions, which were to come to pass in the last days.</i>[Wilford Woodruff,<i>Leaves from My Journal</i>(Salt Lake City: Juvenile Instructor Office, 1882), pp. 1–2]<br><br>Can ministers of other churches call forth blessings from God upon their people? Most assuredly they can and do. We revere the effort and service of such great men as John and Charles Wesley in the forefront of the Methodist movement, Martin Luther, John Huss, John Wycliffe, Ulrich Zwingli, John Calvin, and many others who were moved upon by the Spirit of God to bring light and truth to a world in spiritual darkness.<br><br>We know from chapter 13 in 1 Nephi that Columbus was touched by God's power to accomplish a work of discovery to which he was foreordained and prepared. A fundamental point in our doctrine is that "for this purpose," said the Lord, "have I established the Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose" (D&amp;amp;C 101:80). And the Lord did all this before the days of Joseph Smith.<br><br>Does the Spirit of God bless people who are not members of the Church? Of course, when they seek him in faith and righteousness. "For," as our doctrine states, "the word of the Lord is truth, and whatsoever is truth is light, and whatsoever is light is Spirit, even the Spirit of Jesus Christ. And the Spirit giveth light to<i>every man</i>that cometh into the world; and the Spirit enlighteneth every man through the world, that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit" (D&amp;amp;C 84:45–46; emphasis added). Does the Lord answer prayers of nonmembers? Millions have given testimony that he does.<br><br>It is instructive for us to remember, however, that the history of religion has been controversy. Differences in religion have brought forth as many evils as have differences in politics. Acting, as they have often declared, in the name of God, religious proponents have killed the Savior and many of his prophets and apostles, tortured and martyred the Christians, conquered and destroyed nations in the name of Mohammed by the sword, fought the bloody wars of the Reformation.<br><br>It is said that by 1648 at the Peace of Westphalia, which ended the Thirty Years War between the Catholics and Protestants, Germany was a wasteland and that no more than half of her people survived. In the name of religion, and invoking the name of God, priests and ministers launched the Catholic Inquisition against heretics--meaning those who did not accept the leadership of the church in Rome.<br><br>The story of religion, which should be the good news, the glad tidings of great joy and peace, has often been a horror story of hatred, torture, persecution, war, and holocaust. From the pages of the Old Testament, the Book of Mormon, as well as from secular history, we find that mankind has not changed very much in the way he justifies his ungodly actions in the name of religion.<br><br>From his second inaugural address we have these wise observations of Abraham Lincoln on the attitudes of people during the American Civil War.<br><br><i>Both</i>[the peoples of the North and South]<i>read the same Bible, and pray to the same God; and each invokes his aid against the other. . . . The prayers of both could not be answered--that of neither has been answered fully.</i><br><br><i>The Almighty has his own purposes.</i>[Carl Sandburg,<i>Abraham Lincoln: The War Years--IV,</i>vol. 6 (New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company, 1939), p. 92]<br><br>An acceptable standard of conduct in our social order is typified in the description of General Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson, an upright and very religious man. "Jackson's reverence for the Sabbath went so far," it is said, "that he would not mail his wife a letter to be carried in the mails on a Sunday. Nor would he open a letter received from her on a Sunday. But, with the blessing of an ever kind Providence, as he put it, he would fight, slay, and deliver doom to the enemy if on a Sabbath the enemy looked ready for punishment." Thus we justify what we do in our religion.<br><h2><b>"It's a Two-Way Street"</b></h2><br>So how, finally, can we relate to people who are filled with bitterness and antagonism or who consider Mormons to be a weird sect, who call us a cult, who claim we are not Christian, who point to tragic episodes such as the Mountain Meadows Massacre or to apostate offshoots such as polygamist fundamentalists which have given rise to horror incidents in our own time?<br><br>I had an interesting experience many years ago as we returned from our mission in Brazil. We traveled on a ship with nine children, and the ship carried about forty passengers, so we almost formed a majority. It turned out that there were three other ministers on board, and within a few days each of those three approached me and inquired how we could get together and visit about what the Mormons believe. They didn't seem to be unusually interested in what each other believed, but they all wanted to know what we believe.<br><br>With a little hesitation, because my experience had not been that of having contact with ministers of other faiths, we arranged an interview where all four of us sat down together. It turned out to be very congenial and consisted primarily of them asking questions and me giving the answers. I had supposed that they would come out with strong arguments supported by scriptures that would make it difficult for me to hold my own. But in their friendly, congenial way they just asked questions and it turned out that I knew the answer to each question. I didn't realize beforehand that I was that well informed.<br><br>Within a few minutes, as we visited, they began to turn to each other and make comments like this: "Isn't it interesting? He has an answer for any question you can ask." They repeated that comment over and over again, and we ended our discussion on a very friendly basis. One of these men, however, two or three days later, engaged me in conversation and said, "I have been thinking of what you told us the other day and I wonder if it is right to know everything. I think maybe you know too much. I don't believe the Lord wants us to know it all." I could tell that he was offended. A day or two later he spoke to me again. He said, "I've been considering what you told me, and I have come to the conclusion that what you teach is a very dangerous heresy."<br><br>I wasn't prepared, as I ought to have been, for that kind of a comment, and with something of a hurt feeling I asked him why it was that other religions didn't seem willing to place the Latter-day Saints in the same fellowship with themselves. He turned on me almost in anger and said, "Because I want you to know it is a two-way street." Then I caught the point. We do not fellowship them. We do not recognize them as the true church of Jesus Christ, and therefore there is offense to them in some things we teach. I don't think it should be otherwise, but he had reason for the feelings that he carried. I wasn't in a position, being unprepared, to conciliate his feelings.<br><h2><b>What Can We Do?</b></h2><br>What can we do in the various circumstances that bring us in contact with other people to build friendship and understanding, even appreciation and eventual acceptance of the principles that we teach?<br><br><b>First</b>of all, don't act like they do. Do you get what I mean? If they are critical and antagonistic toward us, we must not respond in the same way. Over the years, in association with many missionaries, I've learned that missionaries often build up a jargon. Some are worse than others, but they have phrases that have deep meaning. In our case, being in a Latin country, whenever one of our missionaries would pass a Catholic church he would call it a "G.A. church," which some of you would understand means "great and abominable." The priests of that church were called padres. So the missionaries would call them the "PDs,"<br><br>To me that became offensive. I'm sure it would have been offensive to the members of that church. It wasn't Christian to make that kind of derogatory comment, regardless of what we might believe. Those people have very sincere and deep-founded beliefs and traditions.<br><br>I remember forty-six or so years ago when I was entering my first city of labor in southern Brazil, and our companions were showing us the way to our residence. We were riding the streetcar from the center of town, and they said, "We'll show you when to get off the streetcar." In those days all of the men in Brazil wore hats. So we were told, "When you see the men take their hats off the second time, you are to get off at the next stop." What that meant was that the streetcar passed two churches. As it passed the churches, the men, out of respect, would lift their hats.<br><br>President Kimball told a story that is appropriate for this subject. He commented on a member of the Church, a woman who had been to the temple, who went to the hospital for some special treatment. She wasn't really ill, but he said when she got there she could hardly wait to remove her garments and put on her fancy negligee a:nd lie there in what she felt was solid comfort, it being a hot day. It was a Catholic hospital, and soon one of the sisters of the Catholic church came into her room. This member of our Church said to her unthinkingly, "I don't see how you stand to wear that closed, tight, heavy clothing that you are wearing." You can all imagine how this Catholic sister might have been dressed. The Catholic lady turned to our sister and said, "Woman, I want you to know it is an honor to wear these clothes for Jesus Christ." What a lesson she taught! It ought to be a lesson to all of us to appreciate and understand other people.<br><br>Where are our manners when we think of other people who do not use good manners? The direction for Latter-day Saints is clearly spoken of in this scripture:<br><br><i>But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.</i><br><br><i>Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.</i><br><br><i>But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless</i><br><br><i>them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;</i><br><br><i>That ye may be the children of your Father</i><br><br><i>which is in heaven.</i>[Matthew 5:39, 43–45]<br><br>So don't act like they do.<br><br><b>Second,</b>don't get mad. Uncontrolled anger distorts reason and cancels out wisdom. All of us are susceptible to rising anger, but before we act we can put ourselves under control. I have often thought how low the boiling point is in a young missionary's blood when he sees something that doesn't seem to be complimentary to him or his religion. I remember serving as a young missionary when we first heard of Fawn Brodie's book<i>No Man Knows My History</i>about the Prophet Joseph Smith. As we read that book, I could feel the surge of anger and the hot blood rising in my body. We would comment to each other as we read it, "Just wait; she'll get her reward."<br><br>Remember, we can also give offense to others. Our doctrine is offensive to some people, as I remarked about the minister I met on the ship. There have been heated arguments about religion between all churches. There are ways to overcome it. Back again to the years in Brazil. Our elders in one city found that a Protestant minister had begun publishing and distributing derogatory pamphlets against the Church. It was information that would not have been accepted in the United States, because generally we have been too well known for people to believe those ridiculous stories. But the people in Brazil who read that began to get an adverse opinion about the Church, and the elders wanted to go out and do something about it.<br><br>I suggested they take a copy of the pamphlet with them and go call on the minister if they could find him. They did find him, and they said to him, after some preparation, "Are you responsible for the publication of this material?" He responded rather evasively and embarrassed. They said, "We would just like you to know that we are the representatives of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and that this material is not true. This is not what we believe. We thought we should tell you that we don't appreciate having this kind of falsehood distributed about us, but we also wish to tell you that when we find people who have read it, it is easy for us to tell them the true state of affairs, and then, of course, they get an adverse opinion about you. If you feel, therefore, that you must publish this sort of thing, go right ahead; it really doesn't hurt us that much. In many ways it helps us. But we, of course, would prefer that you don't do it." That would usually stop the process.<br><br>On another occasion two of our elders, rather young and inexperienced, had gone to a new city to open up the work. The city was almost totally Catholic and was reportedly under the domination of the Catholic bishop who resided there. As these elders went about their work, making contacts and becoming acquainted, people frequently said to them, "Does the bishop know you are here?"<br><br>They would answer, "We don't know."<br><br>"Well, it will be interesting to see what happens when he finds out you are here."<br><br>So they were "walking on eggs," so to speak, as they went about their work, wondering when the ax would fall, supposing that a powerful influence might be brought against them. One day the blow fell. A priest came to their lodging and delivered a letter. It said in substance, "We would like to know by what authority you come into this community and teach your doctrine without having first cleared it with the bishop of this area. Therefore, we ask you, to appear at a special meeting that will be held at a certain place and time in the central Catholic church."<br><br>The elders called mission headquarters.<br><br>"President, what will we do? Can you come up and help us?"<br><br>I answered, "No, I can't come, but they have offered you an invitation to explain what we believe. That is what you are looking for, isn't it?"<br><br>"Well, yes, but how do we handle this situation?"<br><br>I said, "I'll have my assistant come and join you. Accept the invitation, but do it on two conditions. You may say, 'We'll be glad to come if we are treated with courtesy and if you will assure us the opportunity to explain what we believe.'"<br><br>Then my assistant and I worked out a procedure concerning what they might talk about.<br><br>In the meeting, the priest in charge, without any formality, stood up and said, "These two young men are here teaching their religion and we have called you together to hear an explanation of their doctrine." There were two or three hundred people present representing the influential people of the city. The elders were given a wide-open opportunity.<br><br>They stood up and spoke of the Apostasy, the Restoration, the need for the gospel to be restored, and then told of the Book of Mormon. Then, as they said, "Now if you people will read this Book of Mormon and pray about it, the Lord will give you a testimony," a priest in the rear of the hall jumped up and said, "Oh, no, no, no. None of you can read that book." Everyone laughed when he said that. So the opposition was overcome. There was no problem except that after the meeting a Seventh-day Adventist present got into an argument with one of the priests while our elders had several very pleasant conversations. From then on they had no ripples in their proselyting in that city. So don't get mad.<br><br><b>Third,</b>don't argue. Argument is a dumb way to arrive at an understanding. It never works. I listened to President Harold Wright, recently released as president of the Mesa Temple in Arizona. He served over the years as stake president and Regional Representative, and has had many contacts with nonmembers and their religious associations in his city. He said that for years he would go to general conference and notice those people outside Temple Square passing out anti-Mormon literature. What do you do when you see that literature? Do you shut your eyes and wave them by and make sure they know you are not going to take it? Or do you accept it? President Wright noticed one man in particular who seemed to be there every time. He began to visit with him and found that he was a minister from Los Angeles. They began to be friends and President Wright talked to him every time he came to conference. One day he said to this man, "Have you ever attended a session of general conference here?"<br><br>The man said, "No, I haven't."<br><br>President Wright asked, "Would you like to go in?"<br><br>The man answered, "I would very much like to go in."<br><br>So he took the minister in and they sat through the session. President Wright said his friend felt an influence that he had never felt before in his life, and he commented on it repeatedly. As far as I know, he didn't join the Church, but what a beautiful approach to talk to someone with a difference of opinion.<br><br><b>Fourth,</b>recognize your opportunity. When you meet people who have adverse feelings<br><br>about the Church, it can be a great moment. We taught our missionaries how to handle rejection. One particular circumstance would be that after they had had two or three friendly visits with a family, the father would meet them at the door and say, "We've decided not to discuss religion with you anymore." Now most of you who have been on missions know that is a great disappointment.<br><br>We taught our elders to think of it as a moment of great opportunity where they could say certain things that would help them maintain their contact. They might say, "Oh, we are sorry that you have decided not to study with us anymore because we have enjoyed visiting with you and you have been very warm and friendly to us. We want you to know that we appreciate it." The father then has to say something nice in return.<br><br>Then the elders would say, "Well, we certainly won't force our religion on you, but could we have just a moment to step in and leave a greeting with your family? We won't impose on you." The man has to invite them in then.<br><br>Now the elders don't try to force another discussion, but they might say: "You have been very kind to us and we appreciate it. Before we leave, however, we need to tell you, because of our calling, what the gospel means to us." Then they explain why they believe the way they do.<br><br>"Do you remember when Joseph Smith knelt by his bedside and asked the Lord to tell him if he loved him or not and the angel appeared? The angel said, 'Joseph, I have come to you from the presence of God and he has a mission for you to perform by which your name will be known for good or evil among all men.' What did Joseph say to the angel?" (See JS–H 1:33.)<br><br>They would answer, "I guess he said 'all right.'"<br><br>"Yes, he did. He didn't say, 'Wait a minute, Mr. Angel. I didn't want to go on a mission. I just wanted to know if the Lord loved me.' You can't do that to an angel, can you? So we have to tell you that someday we will stand before God and he will ask you why you didn't listen to his message. We don't know what you will say, but we think you should not refuse the gospel until after you have knelt down and asked the Lord what he wants you to do? Will you do that?"<br><br>Many people join the Church who have decided not to hear anymore about it. It is an opportunity if you are prepared and know how to handle it. One of our elders said that he was not a member of the Church when he began dating an LDS girl. One of his first comments was "What's a nice girl like you doing by being a member of the Mormon church?" She asked him what he knew about the Church. He answered, "Well, not much."<br><br>She said, "That's kind of a stupid thing for you to say, then, if you don't know anything about it." So, because he liked the girl, he had to study it out. Partly because of her and partly because of what he learned, he joined the Church. Recognize your opportunity.<br><br><b>Fifth,</b>be prepared. Plan ahead in knowing what to say. I think often of Brother Herschel Pedersen, who was a basketball star here many years ago. He works at Geneva Steel. He said he was eating his lunch and reading his scriptures one day while he was on the job and a very rough individual looked in the door and said, "Oh, you're reading that stuff, are you?"<br><br>Brother Pedersen said, "Yes. What do you know about these books, anyway."<br><br>The man said, "I know all about them."<br><br>"Oh, do you?" asked Brother Pedersen. "Tell me, then, when the Savior comes again what color will his clothes be?"<br><br>The man said, "That's easy, They'll be white."<br><br>Brother Pedersen said, "That's not what it says in here."<br><br>"Oh, what color will they be?"<br><br>"Why don't you try to find out?"<br><br>Brother Pedersen wouldn't tell him. A week or two later he came back ready for further discussion. After some time, he said one day, "Tell me, do you think there is ever any hope for a guy like me?"<br><br>You might think of asking questions you have worked out ahead of time. What would a person who doesn't belong to the Church make of the scripture in Isaiah 2?<br><br><i>It shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.</i>[Isaiah 2:2]<br><br>Now all of you know what that means. It focuses your mind on the picture of the Salt Lake Temple. But if you weren't a member of the Church, what would you make of it? You wouldn't know. You can ask that question. You might ask them to explain to you what the Savior meant in the tenth chapter of the book of John:<br><br><i>And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.</i>[John 10:16]<br><br>If you weren't a member of this Church, that would be a mystery, wouldn't it? You could ask somebody to explain that. Remember, you have the answers. You were not sent forth to be taught, but to teach.<br><br><b>Sixth,</b>don't spare your testimony. If you don't know the answers, bear your testimony anyway. Maybe they won't believe it, but they will know that you are sincere.<br><br><b>Seventh,</b>live your religion. How valuable that is in the life of every Latter-day Saint. That is true here at Brigham Young University in particular. Get into the pattern of living your religion so that other people will recognize you for what we stand for. If you don't live your religion, they will quickly recognize you for what you are, a vivid example of that "despised" LDS Church. It is always required of Latter-day Saints to be faithful. It says in the thirteenth article of faith, "We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men" and so forth. Don't ever fail and that influence will be felt by countless thousands over the face of the earth.<br><br>Many years ago now, when I served in the armed forces, I think I never had a close nonMormon companion who didn't know that I was a member of the Church and who didn't know I had been a missionary. They saw that I wore the garments. Once in a while they would ask where I got the fancy underwear. I would say it was my religion. They would say, "Oh, oh, pardon me. Sorry I asked," They treated me with the utmost respect and admired my standards. I don't believe that I ever gave offense to the Church with any of those numerous companions in those years that I served.<br><br>One of those companions joined the Church. I didn't preach a word to him about the gospel. Somebody else found him and taught him, but I suppose he remembered a young fellow named Bangerter who was a Mormon and could remember the way I lived. I hope so.<br><h2><b>We Do Not Apologize</b></h2><br>Now, our true position--realizing that other churches don't always appreciate what we believe. Even though we do not believe the way they do, we stand firmly on the things that have been revealed to us. We do not apologize that we do not have the same doctrines and principles that other churches have. We can talk about it in a warm and friendly way but we do not apologize. We didn't initiate this restoration. God did. If others do not appreciate it, we nevertheless know it is the truth.<br><br>Some people don't want the gospel to be restored. Some people are offended that there might be prophets and apostles. Some people hate the thought that God would actually speak out of heaven again. I don't know why, but I suppose from the traditions of their fathers they have built up those attitudes to the point where it is offensive.<br><br>Nevertheless, we know what God has revealed to us--that in the last days he has brought forth the fullness of his everlasting gospel that will prepare mankind to return into the presence of God and to be exalted in his celestial kingdom. Latter-day Saints understand that. They must be true to that vision. Our testimony says that God lives, that Jesus is in reality the Savior and the Redeemer, that Joseph Smith was called as the instrument of God to bring forth the Restoration in the last days. Among the most marvelous accomplishments that he brought forth was the Book of Mormon. Something else that cannot be understood or explained other than on the basis of spiritual testimony is that the apostles and prophets exist in the Church today and that President Kimball is the Lord's representative and holds the keys of his authority to teach us the way we should go. All of this I know to be true as the Lord has revealed it to me through his Spirit. To that I testify in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Wm.

<h1>Our Colors to the Mast: A Ship and a Dream - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2><b>Man-made Magic</b></h2><br>We live in a most remarkable age. The scope and magnificence of the daily events that swirl around us are now so commonplace that we scarcely note their presence or their passing.<br><br>Consider for example two events of this past week. One week ago this morning, on Tuesday, September 3, the space shuttle Discovery came riding out of a desert sky barely tinted with the light of sunrise and landed smoothly, silently on the sands of Edwards Air Force Base, concluding a week-long experience that now seems almost routine in space travel.<br><br>Does it impress anyone (besides me) that this ninety-nine-ton spaceship has orbited the earth before, that it repeatedly comes back to land safely, picks up yet another payload, and will again be launched beyond the earth's gravity in the days that lie just ahead? Ho hum.<br><br>Does it matter to anyone that this piece of man-made magic--after traveling three million miles in space--can touch down on a postage stamp sketched in the dry lake bed of a California desert, a landing strip totally invisible from the Santa Monica freeway<i>and</i>the Carson City, Nevada, frozen yogurt station? May I remind you that there are 197,000,000 square miles of surface on the face of this planet onto which you can mistakenly land--or sink, as the case may be. What kind of a world is it--or should I say what kind of worlds are we about to find--in which that kind of technology, that kind of human genius, that kind of masterful, modern miracle can send up such a piece of equipment, fly it around, and bring it home with more accuracy than you and I find our automobile with after a BYU football game?<br><br>Is anyone impressed that on this particular flight James Van Hofton and William Fisher spent a casual weekend dangling in space and repairing with their screwdrivers, pliers, baling wire, and rubber bands an $85 million Syncom 3 satellite that had moved lifelessly in orbit since its abortive launch four months ago? "Never mind that there is an errant satellite up there, Chief. E.T. and I will just Buck Rogers it up into orbit, find that twenty-foot canister somewhere in all the grand immensity of space, sidle up alongside with the old jet pack, and have her beeping and flashing again in no time." Easier than a trip to the corner gas station. Columbus I know and Balboa I know, but who are James Van Hofton and William Fisher?<br><br>Perhaps the amazement in all of this is greater for me than it is for you--and maybe is for most--because I am so mystified and unhandy at technical things. The only project I ever fully completed in my high school shop class was a one-quart tin cup, which, by the time I was through making it, unfortunately had a large slash running down the full length of it. It's very awkward to hold a quart of anything in a tin cup if it is running out onto your pant leg more rapidly than you are able to pour the new contents in. I did not get a good grade on that cup, and I did not get a good grade in the class. Very early on I left all technically related matters to other folks.<br><br>So I invite your sense of awe and wonder and appreciation for such a time in which we live, and, as we start a new school year at Brigham Young University, I also invite you to give thanks for the God-given blessings and benefits we enjoy routinely, day after day, week after week, in a way that has never been known by anyone, anywhere, in any other era of the history of all mankind.<br><h2><b>Who Would Have Dreamed?</b></h2><br>It is in that spirit and with that sense of privilege and advantage that I comment on the rather remarkable circumstances we presently enjoy right here in good old Provo, Utah--Happy Valley, U.S.A. Who would have dreamed in a thousand years of dreaming--that takes us back squarely into the shadow of the Dark Ages--that Brigham Young University would ever have a national championship football team and an overall athletic program ranked every year among the top ten in the nation? Where else does a university routinely enter its undergraduate coeds--year after year--in the Miss America contest and, this past year, claim the reigning queen? Where else--and the answer is, of course, nowhere else--has the Egyptian government chosen to work with an American university to exhibit the legendary Ramses II materials? What will it mean for you to be the students to see what your parents never saw and your grandparents never dreamed of seeing--artifacts from one of the richest and most regal political and cultural dynasties in all of ancient history, a dynasty linked with the wrenching exodus of the children of Israel from the grasp of just such a pharaoh as this? What does it mean for you to have the world's attention focused on your university as we strive to build world peace and enhance international understanding in Jerusalem--perhaps the most war-torn and brutalized piece of geography per square inch on the face of the globe? And, of course, all of this says nothing of the less publicized but often far more important progress being made by the university in every aspect and area of our academic life here.<br><br>Who would have dreamed this? Not I as a student even twenty years ago, to say nothing of our academic forefathers who struggled just to keep the university alive one hundred years ago.<br><br>But<i>some</i>dreamed the dreams, and a few saw the visions.<br><h2><b>"I Have Seen It All"</b></h2><br>On Founders Day, five weeks from now, we will have a commemorative reopening of the Karl G. Maeser Building on this campus. If you have not had a chance to walk to that lovely corner of our hilltop acreage and see the spectacular job our own physical plant and the construction companies have done with this grand old building, please do so. It was the first building built on what an earlier generation called Temple Hill, built when the dreams of a real university and all that it might become were<i>only</i>dreams and indeed seemed to some only fantasies those many, many years ago. Where once only that building alone stood on this hill, now think of nearly 500 buildings and the absolute splendor of every one of them. Think of the beauty and capacity and availability and cleanliness of any one of the buildings in which we meet, including this one, and then remember this from our struggling first president.<br><br>With nothing but makeshift facilities and depleted supplies, President Maeser wrote,<br><br><i>I am</i>worn out and sick in spirit, ...<i>and with all my love for this Academy, I feel that I owe it to my very life, which is needlessly wearing itself out here in an apparently hopeless task, to accept any change that will promise me opportunities for permanent usefulness.</i><br><br>[With that]<i>he told his wife and daughter that because there seemed to be no real support for a school here and because he couldn't earn enough ... to provide food and raiment for them and pay his debts he was going to accept a position at the University of Deseret, where he could get a regular salary and adequately provide for his family. Accordingly his wife and daughter got things packed--and then sat on their trunks for</i>[several]<i>days, until his daughter finally mustered enough courage to ask her father when they were moving. His response ... was, "I have changed my mind.</i>[We are not moving.]<i>I have had a dream--I have seen Temple Hill filled with buildings--great temples of learning, and I have decided to remain and do my part.</i>[Ernest L. Wilkinson and W. Cleon Skousen,<i>Brigham Young University: A School of Destiny</i>(Provo, UT: Brigham Young University Press, 1976), pp. 84–85]<br><br>Through the generosity of friends like Abraham O. Smoot, work eventually began for a building on University Avenue and Fifth North. Of this period Karl G. Maeser's son wrote:<br><br><i>While the foundation of the new building had been in course of construction, it had been a custom of</i>[my father],<i>when at home on a Sabbath morning, to walk up to the grounds and stand and gaze upon the work so far done.</i><br><br><i>Once when he took</i>[my sister]<i>Eva with him they stood upon the unfinished foundation, and the child noticing some portions of the wall crumbling, remarked, "papa, do you think they will ever finish this building?"</i><br><br><i>"My child,</i>"<i>answered the father, "not only this building but others will stand upon this ground and not only here but also upon that hill yonder," pointing to Temple Hill. "Yes, my child, I have seen it all.</i>" [Wilkinson and Skousen, p. 118]<br><br>The new academy building was dedicated on the day on which Karl G. Maeser was to sever his connection with the school to become the commissioner of education in Salt Lake City. There was probably never a more impressive sight in the history of the school than the triumphal march of the students up to the new building from the temporary quarters of the old ZCMI warehouse downtown. Before leaving that warehouse, Professor Maeser had called the students around him, prayed with them, and told them that if they would carry the spirit of their alma mater not only into their new school but into all their walks of life as well, the Lord would greatly multiply their joys.<br><br>Following the dedicatory prayer that day, Brother Maeser gave a short farewell address which included this simple statement of the educational philosophy at Brigham Young Academy.<br><br><i>When to the students, at the beginning of the experimental term, April</i>24, 1876,<i>the words of the prophet Joseph Smith, that he taught his people correct principles and they governed themselves accordingly, were given as the leading principles of discipline; and the words of President Brigham Young, that neither the alphabet nor the multiplication tables were to be taught without the Spirit of God,</i>[were given]<i>as the main-spring of all teaching--the orientation for the course of the educational system inaugurated by the foundation of the academy was made,</i>and any deviation from it would have led to disastrous results,<i>and therefore, the Brigham Young Academy has nailed her colors to the mast.</i>[Alma P. Burton,<i>Karl G. Maeser: Mormon Educator</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1953), pp. 54–55, emphasis added]<br><br>In a month when we pay tribute to Karl G. Maeser, and in a year when we take on even greater visibility as a university, I say again that "we have nailed our colors to the mast." We have stated our principles of education based on the gospel of Jesus Christ, "and any deviation from it would [lead] to disastrous results." As we take our increasingly significant and important place<i>in</i>the world, it is absolutely imperative that we not be<i>of</i>it. We have begun a space-age conversation with a national and international audience that earlier generations of students and faculty would not have believed possible. In telling that story we must not and will not forget those principles and traditions and truths that have made Brigham Young University what it is and that have brought us to this moment.<br><h2><b>Be Your Very Best</b></h2><br>In my occasional locker-room contact with Coach Edwards I have heard him say something time and time again to his players. He said it last Saturday, and he will say it this Saturday. What he says in effect is this: "Do not forget what got you here. Don't abandon the fundamentals we've practiced for so long. Don't let success<i>or</i>adversity overwhelm you. Remain steady, play it our way. That's how we got where we are." In that same spirit we have to be Brigham Young University and not any other. "Any deviation from that would lead to disastrous results." Our majesty and our mission is in our unique and special heritage. Please stand with me, as I stand with you, in again nailing those colors to the mast--for another magnificent year.<br><br>Work hard. With the background of our religious convictions there is no encouragement I could give you at the start of a school year that would matter more than for you to take your academic work seriously and to study hard. It is a more competitive time at BYU than it was twenty years ago and certainly more than it was a century ago. There is so much to learn and so much to be done. There are worlds out there waiting to be explored. You must not come here to play. Too much tithing is spent, too much sacrifice has been given, and too many people are watching. "Eat the bread and wear the garments of the laborer" (see D&amp;amp;C 42:42).<br><br>Please learn to write well and to speak the language with some precision. If it is not too startling to you may I announce, for example, that at BYU the verb "go" is not synonymous with the verb "say" as in the conversation "I go, 'Watcha doin'?' and she goes, 'Nothin,' and I go, 'Let's do somethin,' and she goes, 'Sure.' "That's too much goin' and not enough saying. And the writing from some of us is too often worse than the speaking. If I have one overwhelming disappointment in my professional life as an educator it is the general inability I find in college-educated people to write well. Edward R. Murrow once said that Winston Churchill won the Second World War by "mobiliz[ing] the English language and send[ing] it into battle" (Edward R. Murrow,<i>I Can Hear It Now</i>[1933–1945], Columbia Records). Perhaps it will help you win your battles, or get a job, or change a nation. The prophets of God have known that the impact of the inspired, compelling word, spoken or written, is among the most powerful forces on earth. You should discover that too. It has moved their mountains. It will move some of yours. It will illuminate your path. "In the beginning was the Word," and "God said, Let there be light: and there was light" (see John 1:1 and Genesis 1:3).<br><br>Be well groomed and dress appropriately. Our dress and grooming standards are legendary at BYU. In the six years I have been giving this speech, I have tried not to harp on that or to make it seem this was the only thing that mattered here. It is, after all, only a small part of our very important Code of Honor that you have all signed. But your appearance is for us as some explain baptism--"it is an outward sign of an inward grace." I always notice carefully the comings and goings on campus during these first few days of each year, and I think almost all of you look absolutely beautiful. But a very few need an early reminder. Now all of you know that shorts, or skimpy skirts, or grubby jeans, or extreme hairstyles, or sweat suits, or tank tops, or whatever, are simply not acceptable apparel on this campus. Be modest, be dignified, and be your very best. More and more, what it means to be at BYU is to be your very best.<br><br>And now may I say that far more important than looking clean is being clean. Perhaps no challenge is greater for your generation. As someone recently wrote, "It is as if America is down on all fours sniffing, and what she smells is a glandular stench." There is too much sexual transgression in our society. There are too many exploitive movies seen and prurient videos watched and smutty magazines read. There is too much obscene language used, by men and women. It should not surprise you that a university that sweeps its walks and scrubs its floors and paints its buildings and shines its glass expects its students to be clean--inside as well as out. I want to think we are better in these matters than any other university in the world, but sometimes we are not; we frequently fall too short. Any compromise tears a piece of our flag from that mast. Any blemish on one student's behavior is a stain on us all. For your sake and for Karl G. Maeser's and for BYU's, I ask you to be clean.<br><h2><b>The World's Safest Ship</b></h2><br>Now as I began I spoke of<i>two</i>events during the past week, and I mentioned one--the Discovery's successful flight. May I close with the second reference, to another journey not so successful. A week ago last Sunday, on September 1, 1985, Robert Ballard, chief scientist for a joint U.S./French venture, became the first person in seventy-three years to view the grave site of more than 1,500 people whose final resting place lay on the cavernous floor two and a half miles below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean. The Titanic was the biggest, most luxurious, and supposedly the safest ocean liner of all time--unsinkable, they advertised, because of its double steel hull and waterproof compartments.<br><br>The first-class register on that maiden voyage read like a Who's Who of American and European society. The net worth of those passengers was estimated (in 1912) to be $250 million. And on the night of April 14, 1912, nearly three-fourths of the trip from Southampton was completed. New York was, figuratively speaking, just a hop, skip, and a jump away. It had been a great party on the high seas.<br><br>Now an iceberg is relatively small and occupies so little space in comparison with the broad ocean on which it floats. The chances of another small object like a ship colliding with it and being sunk are minute. Chances are, as a matter of fact, one in a million. That's not just a figure of speech. That was the actual risk for total loss by collision with an iceberg as accepted by insurance companies in 1912. That one-in-a-million accident was what sunk the Titanic. On the night of the collision she was undoubtedly the safest ship afloat on any of the world's oceans. But her captain and her crew were careless, perhaps simply too confident. And so were her designers and her owners. The result was that when the unbelievable had to be believed, only 700 were saved. One thousand five hundred thirteen of the others rode the world's safest ship two and a half miles straight down--and then waited seventy-three years to have Robert Ballard finally identify their burial site for posterity.<br><br>Institutionally--and I suppose individually--we have at our disposal the superb skills that in its day fashioned the Titanic and in our own day has fashioned the space shuttle Discovery. We have before us a year in which each of us gets to captain not only our own individual craft but we also get to help steer the Good Ship BYU. I don't know about you, but in light of these two reminders from the week's news, I vote clearly for the option of navigating all the dimensions of our dreams and all the outer reaches of our capability with the care and caution and loyalty to basic principles that will, when our exploration is complete, land us dead center, right on time, exactly where we ought to be, I prefer that greatly to the equal magnificence, splendor, and technical ability of that other vessel now resting 13,000 feet below the surface of the sea 500 miles south of Newfoundland, filled with people who were led to believe it couldn't happen to them.<br><br>This year and every year we intend to have the best of all possible worlds at BYU. We intend to exercise every privilege and pursue every opportunity, but we will do it with discipline and with care, with attention to detail, with everyone helping, with no one compromising. We will "nail our colors to the mast" and make gospel-centered education work because it has to work; any deviation from our prophetic heritage "would lead to disastrous results." We will, in this and every year ahead, reach out and reach up, explore all we can of the truth, and still safely land filled with greater learning and faith on this narrow strip of BYU soil under Y Mountain in Provo, Utah. We will do our work successfully--and some of it we will have to do with the whole world watching. Know that I love you with all of my heart, and God bless you to have a superb school year, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Jeffrey R.

<h1>ingle: Glorify Only God - Patricia T. Holland - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Every year now for six years I have worried and worked, studied and stewed, pondered and prayed--for a darn good way to get out of speaking to you. But Jeff has no sympathy for my anguish. He thinks he has such success making a silk purse out of a sow's ear that he insists on using me as his visual aid.<br><br>This morning I would like to share with you a personal experience that comes from anguish over an earlier speaking assignment, an experience that revealed to me a principle I believe to be among the most important in the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is the one principle I prayed my son Matt would understand when he enrolled as a freshman at BYU last year. I believe it will be especially helpful to you if you ever feel inadequate or insecure or less confident than your neighbors. The principle is for me a key--perhaps the greatest key to truly confident living. To explain that, I need to share with you how<i>unconfidently</i>I began what is now a rather regular life of public speaking.<br><h2><b>Total Disaster</b></h2><br>I am proud of my heritage--which happens to be that of a genuine farm girl from Enterprise, Utah. Now, if you haven't heard of Enterprise, it's a suburb of Beryl, Modena, Panaca, and Pioche. Bryant Gumble would have as much fun with that as some of the city slickers from the big metropolis of St. George did. We weren't a very confident bunch, and those smart-aleck kids (who included my own husband) had plenty to make fun of.<br><br>I grew up helping my five brothers milk the family cows. I drove a pickup truck while my father fed cattle, and I missed two weeks of school every October to gather potatoes into dusty gunnysacks and to ship them off to market.<br><br>Because of those humble beginnings I was always rather shy and absolutely terrified to speak before the public. While growing up I somehow managed to struggle through a few speaking assignments (and dodged all the rest) until I was married and living on this campus. During the first year here our stake president asked Jeff and me if we would speak in stake conference, and, as usual, Jeff accepted. I was mortified! When we returned home I cried, I stamped my feet, I threw a royal tantrum, but Jeff insisted. Finally I consented to do it if he would write my talk. He said, "Absolutely not!" I said, "Write the talk or get a new roommate." As you can see he wrote the talk. I gave it--and it was a total disaster. He received a lot of compliments for his, and I received gratuitous smiles for mine.<br><br>When we returned home I was more discouraged than ever. Through tears I asked, "What went wrong? The talk you wrote for me was better than the one you wrote for yourself, but from what I saw, your talk was the one that touched people's hearts. Mine hit them like a fast-acting sedative." But my wise and gentle tutor put his arms around me and said, "Pat, heart speaks to heart. If you want to touch someone's heart you have to speak from your own."<br><h2><b>To Glorify Only God</b></h2><br>The next time I was asked to speak I trembled and I worried, but I sat at my desk and prayed that I could do my own work. I labored over that talk for hours, but with little success. In total frustration I opened my scriptures and read this in D&amp;amp;C 88:67: "If your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things."<br><br>The words of that scripture sank deep into my soul, echoing as though they were spoken from the hilltops. It was the first time I ever remember reading that particular verse, but it has become--over these twenty years of time--one of the most important in my life. It is for me the key I mentioned to you earlier. You see, my eye had been single all right, but it was focused on the glories from men. I was terrified of public speaking primarily because I was too concerned about what other people would think of me. It was a matter of vanity and pride and ego. But in that scripture for a brief moment I could see that inhibitions and fears and self-consciousness could be conquered if I stopped performing for the admiration of mortals and sought honestly and faithfully to glorify only God.<br><br>As the Spirit of the Lord spoke to my spirit through that scripture, I decided to give it a try. That talk didn't come instantly, as most blessings don't. I labored over every word, stopping frequently to remind the Lord and myself that I wanted this to really glorify him, to be his message as nearly as I could make it so.<br><br>I finished the talk and gave it. It wasn't the best talk ever given, and it wasn't the best talk I've ever given, but I felt fantastic about myself. I learned that day that appreciation for our own worth has nothing to do with the applause of one's neighbor and everything to do with having integrity before the Lord.<br><br>We all need a higher image of ourselves, but Satan would have us believe it comes totally from the praise of others when in fact it comes from our relationship with God.<br><br>A Church leader whom I highly regard told me recently that in his earlier days he was preoccupied with trying to please the people of this Church until in utter fatigue and confusion he decided instead to focus on pleasing God, letting God then worry about pleasing the people. This decision freed him to be who he really was and to find powers he didn't know he had. He said, "For the first time in my life I saw clearly my own divine potential."<br><br>It strikes me that as we start a new school year some of you may, from time to time, struggle right along with all those who have just arrived from the dusty farms of Enterprise, Utah. As I was getting out of my car yesterday, a freshman coed stopped to say hi. In our conversation she expressed her fears about her classes, roommates, dating, and academic success. The anxiety on her face has only quickened my desire to reach out to all of you with the promise of this principle today. When Jeff was called to serve you in this position, President Kimball was kind enough to give me a blessing as well. In that blessing he said, "Sister Holland, I charge you to reach out to our young people on that campus as far as your time and energies will allow." I am trying to "reach out" the best way I know how. This morning begins my sixth year of cheering with you, singing the school song with you, worrying about you, praying over you, and loving you.<br><br>You are our family. But you also have heavenly parents far better than we, who know and believe in you perfectly. I promise you that if this year your eye is fixed, centered, riveted, and so cemented that it cannot be distracted by the allure of the crowds or the vanities of this world--then you will hear your calling from God. Your destiny rests in that call. Keep your eye single to God's glory, and in doing so fill your bodies with such brightness of light that you will fulfill your destiny as one created in his image. Have a bright new year, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Patricia T. Holland, wife of Jeffrey R.

<h1>w&#039;s Mite: Sacred Tithing Funds - Gordon B. Hinckley - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a great opportunity and a great privilege to be with you this beautiful morning. I appreciate the effort you have made to gather here. It has been the custom, reaching back many years, for a member of the First Presidency to speak to you at the beginning of a new school year. I would very much like to say something that will be helpful to all, and to this end I have prayed for the direction of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>I bring you the love and greetings of President Kimball and President Romney. President Kimball serves not only as president of the Church but also as chairman of the board of trustees of this university, and President Romney serves as a vice chairman. I am confident they would have enjoyed being with you this morning, had circumstances permitted. As you are aware, President Kimball is now in his ninetieth year and, because of the infirmities of age, he is unable to get out and speak as he once did with such vigor. President Romney is similarly handicapped.<br><br>I wish to share with you some of my concerns in the responsibility that has been thrust upon me. I want you to bear some of that responsibility. If you are a member of the Church, you too have a challenge to be concerned with its strength and growth.<br><br>I remember many years ago when a man, both prominent and well-to-do, came to see Stephen L Richards, who was then a member of the First Presidency. The man had a son who was denied a missionary call because of his moral misbehavior. The man was very forceful, almost demanding, in his request that the son be permitted to go. At the time I had responsibility for the missionary program of the Church and was in the room when the conversation took place. After the man had finished his lengthy and demanding argument, President Richards said, "Brother, I have some responsibility for the affairs of this Church. You do also. If you were seated where I sit, knowing the circumstances that I know, you would feel exactly as I do. Now, in your position as a member of this Church, as one who holds the priesthood, you too have responsibility for its growth and program, and for its discipline. My heart goes out to you, for I know that what you say comes of love for your son. However, I am asking you, as a man with a responsibility for the progress of the Church, to look at the larger affairs of the kingdom. Then you make the decision in that light." After a thoughtful silence, it was the father who made the decision that his son should not go.<br><h2><b>The Lord's Law of Finance</b></h2><br>It has now been more than four years since I was called into the Presidency. For two and a half of those four years, not of my own wish, I have had thrust upon me the burden of the day-to-day work of the office of the Presidency. Please do not misunderstand me. I am not complaining. I have been blessed by the Lord in a marvelous and wonderful way. I have been blessed with the confidence of his chosen servants, Presidents Kimball and Romney. I have been blessed with the loyalty, the unflagging devotion, and the help of the Council of the Twelve, of each member of the First Quorum of the Seventy, of the Presiding Bishopric, and of the membership of the Church across the world. I have been remembered in many prayers, and I am grateful beyond power of expression.<br><br>Incident to the responsibility that I have, I have chaired the meetings of the board of trustees of this university. For many years I have served as chairman of the executive committee of the board.<br><br>I also chair the meetings of the Budget and Appropriations Committee of the Church. This is a very serious responsibility.<br><br>As you are aware, on July 8, 1838, the Lord revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith the law of tithing as it applies to the members of the Church in this dispensation.<br><br>On that same day, he gave a revelation in which he said that the tithing funds of the Church should be "disposed of by a council, composed of the First Presidency of my Church, and of the bishop and his council, and by my high council" (D&amp;amp;C 120).<br><br>Based on that revelation, we have in the Church what we call the Council on the Disposition of the Tithes. This council is composed of the First Presidency, the Council of the Twelve, and the Presiding Bishopric. Theirs is the ultimate responsibility for all Church expenditures.<br><br>Serving, in effect, as an executive committee of that council, we have what we designate the Budget and Appropriations Committee. This committee meets weekly to consider for approval all items of Church expenditure. These might include a score or more of new chapels in various places throughout the world, or a building or renovation project on the BYU campus, a new temple somewhere, or any number of things. I need not tell you that with hundreds of buildings under construction (more than 900 at this time), the number of dollars involved is enormous. Again, it is my responsibility to chair these meetings and to sign the approvals for the expenditures. It is a worrisome responsibility.<br><br>Where does the money come from? There are many who look upon the Church as an organization of great wealth. We have been classified as being equal to many institutions of the Fortune 500. Our assets are spoken of glibly by those who either do not know the facts, or with gross distortion for purposes of sensationalism.<br><br>The fact, of course, is that we do have tremendous assets when the value of all Church buildings and facilities is included. But these assets are not income producing. They are consumers. They consist of thousands of meetinghouses across the world, many temples, seminaries and institutes, and, of course, Brigham Young University. They have cost millions in investments, and they produce scarcely anything in the way of a direct dollar return on those investments. There is only one reason for their existence, and that is to serve the needs of<i>people</i>as sons and daughters of God who have a peculiar and important relationship with him.<br><br>I repeat that the Church is frequently spoken of as an institution of great wealth. When all is said and done, the Church is wealthy only in the faith of its people. One of the expressions of that faith is the payment of tithing. The Church is spoken of as an institution with great business interests. The income from those business properties would keep the Church going for only a very short time. The fact is that tithing is the Lord's law of finance. It came of revelation from him. It is a divine law with a great and beautiful promise. It is applicable to every member of the Church who has income. It is applicable to the widow in her poverty as well as to the wealthy man in his riches. It is simple of understanding. One need only compare it with the income tax to recognize the simplicity that comes of the wisdom of God in contrast with the complexity that comes of the wisdom of men.<br><h2><b>The Widow's Mite</b></h2><br>I hold in my hand a widow's mite. It was given me in Jerusalem many years ago, and I was told that it is genuine. I have it framed, and I keep it in my office as a constant reminder of the fearsome responsibility of spending that which comes of the consecrations of the members of the Church. Most of the wonderful, faithful Latter-day Saints who pay their tithing are men and women of modest means. They not only pay their tithing, but they also make many other contributions for the strengthening of this work.<br><br>Some time back a small, bent, elderly woman came to my office. For the purpose of this talk I shall call her Mary Olsen, although that is not her name and she would not wish her identity disclosed. She said she had just come over from the temple. She took from her purse her checkbook. She said that she had been a widow for many years, that life had not been easy for her. She had a great love for the Lord and his Church. She had faithfully paid her tithing all her life. She felt she would not live much longer. Now, she said, she felt she ought to be doing more to help than she had done. In a hand shaky with age, she wrote a check for $5,000. She handed it to me. I noted the address where she lived. It was in a poor neighborhood. I confess that as I looked at that check tears came into my eyes. I have held many larger checks than that in my hands. But as I held the check of this widow woman, I was almost overcome by her faith and the seriousness of the trust that was mine in the expenditure of her consecrated contribution.<br><br>My dear young friends, we--you and I--are trustees of that which has been given to the Lord by Mary Olsen and thousands like her whose devotion is as great and whose sacrifice is as certain. This beautiful campus, with its many programs, is a consumer of a very substantial portion of the widow's contribution. She gives her offering to the Lord, and she is then released from responsibility. The responsibility then becomes mine--<i>and yours!</i><br><br>What might she expect of you? I am going to talk quickly of four or five things that I think she might appropriately expect.<br><br><b>First,</b>I think she might expect on your part a deep sense of gratitude and appreciation. I recognize that the fees you spend to attend BYU are high and sometimes difficult to pay. But you should know that several times the amount you pay comes from the sacred funds of the Church to cover the actual cost of your presence on this campus. That applies to every one of you who is here. You are truly privileged. There are approximately 26,000 of you. There are literally legions of other worthy young men and women who are members of the Church who would do almost anything to be here. Why should you be so treated when a beautiful and brilliant girl in the British Isles, or that qualified young man in Argentina, or that able and faithful girl in Japan, are just as worthy and just as eligible as you?<br><br>Gratitude is among the greatest of virtues. I hope there is not a day that passes that you do not get on your knees and thank the Lord for the marvelous privileges you have in attending this university. Where in the world is there a more beautiful campus than this? Where are there better facilities? Where is there a better-qualified faculty of men and women not only of learning, but also of faith? Where will you find better associations than here? (I might add, parenthetically, where will you find a football team more worthy of cheering about?)<br><br>I know the academic grind is hard. I know you sometimes get discouraged as you face it. I know that for many of you there is acute loneliness even with so many around you. I may say, however, that you would have these problems and more at any other university. Be thankful. Be appreciative of the marvelous opportunity you have to study at this magnificent university.<br><br><b>Second,</b>the widow who brought to me her offering, which has become a portion of the funding of this university, would expect you to save, protect, and do all you can to preserve these remarkable facilities that have cost so much. We constantly receive requests from people across the world to establish another university in one place or another. It would be a wonderful thing if we could do so. However, we must face the fact that it would be too expensive, more than we could afford, to build and maintain such a plant and faculty. It is your home while you are here. Take good care of it. I am appalled when I see property defaced, or vandalized, or damaged through carelessness, or resources wasted. There must never be such on this campus. It was built to its present state in large measure by money from the tithes of the Church. It is maintained in large measure by such funds. Take care of it. A sacred trust is placed in you to do so.<br><br><b>Third,</b>the widow of whom I speak expects that while you are here you will experience an increase in faith and a strengthened knowledge of the things of God, and, more particularly, of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Each of you is expected to take courses in religion. Some may resent that. I hope not. These courses, taught by qualified instructors, represent one of the major differences between this and other universities. You have opportunities here that you would not have in any other school in quite the same measure. Do not resent these studies. Dig in and drink up that which is offered for your enlightenment and the strengthening of your testimony. Most of you will never again have such an opportunity as you will have here to learn the gospel in an environment of scholarship. Drink deeply of eternal truths.<br><br><b>Fourth,</b>another great expectation is that many of you will find your companions here. Generally speaking there is no better place to find one of your own kind, with the same standards, the same ambitions, the same desire and willingness to serve the Lord as you go forward with your lives. It is expected that a marriage arising out of associations on this campus will be a marriage based on love, appreciation, and mutual respect, with an understanding of the heavy responsibilities as well as the potential for happiness in time and throughout eternity, through the exercise of the priesthood in the house of the Lord.<br><br>In anticipation of that, you can never be immoral. You cannot be dishonest in courting or in marriage without violating the great trust that is placed in you as a student of Brigham Young University.<br><br><b>Fifth,</b>the final great expectation in terms of your presence here is that you will better qualify yourselves to fill positions of responsibility in the world of which you will become a part. All of us are tremendously proud of BYU's great football accomplishments. They redound to the honor of the school. They reflect good to the Church. We are proud of the team and wish for them continued success.<br><br>However, the primary purpose of BYU is not football. The primary purpose of BYU is to provide a first-class education in the disciplines and skills that will qualify you for productive lives while at the same time inculcating within you a solid foundation of spiritual values.<br><br>You will violate a sacred trust with the widow woman I mentioned, and with all of us, if you fail to take advantage of the great opportunity that is yours here to learn in order that you might go forth to serve.<br><br>That service must be given with integrity. There can be no cheating in the halls of learning without consequent impact on one's fitness to serve in the world of work. If we turn out lawyers with smart techniques and shallow honesty, then we have broken a trust. If we turn out teachers whose only objective is to get a job rather than to serve the needs of boys and girls, then again we have failed. If we turn out business graduates whose only objective is to grow rich regardless of principle, again the sacrifices of our people to maintain this school have been in vain.<br><h2><b>Great Expectations</b></h2><br>Yours must be a higher vision and a higher mission. Yours is the responsibility to study and learn, to qualify yourselves in an exceptional way for positions of responsibility in the professions, in the business world, and for life in general. And over and beyond this, yours is a most sacred and binding responsibility to do so while observing every element of moral behavior and while employing the principle of the Golden Rule as taught by the Son of God.<br><br>We have great expectations for you. We are entitled to those expectations. The widow of whom I spoke, and the hundreds of thousands like her who bring their tithes to the storehouse of the Lord, count on you to do something in a very exceptional and worthy way.<br><br>Let the beginning of this new school year be marked with the resolution to stand a little taller, to work a little harder, to keep your lives square with the principles of morality and integrity that are of the very essence of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Be humble. Be prayerful. Be studious. Have a wonderful time. Enjoy life. But know also that it is serious and that there will flow from your time and efforts marvelous results both temporal and eternal if you will live the gospel of Jesus Christ while here, and prepare to live it when you leave here.<br><br>If you do this, we who have a sacred trusteeship will know that that which is provided here will not have been in vain, but that the funds to build and maintain this institution will bear marvelous and rewarding dividends for the present as well as for generations yet to come. We pray for you. We hope that you will pray for yourselves. We ask the Lord to bless you and sustain you, to give you strength and the capacity to understand and assimilate that which you are taught so that, when you have completed your work here, you may go forward into the world as men and women of faith, of great learning, and of tremendous integrity.<br><br>God bless you so to do, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Gordon B.

<h1>t Kimball: “The Last Drop in the Chalice” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The concluding chapter in the book<i>Les Miserables</i>is entitled "The Last Drop in the Chalice." It refers to the final purging in the life of Jean Valjean. He is a white-haired saint whose life has been dealt harshly with by law and justice but who was inspired by a "bishop" to be better. This saintly soul realizes there is one thing left undone to make him a totally honest man. He goes through an immense personal struggle and emerges victorious. All of this he does, sacrificing on the altar of love and religion the adoring felicity that Cosette feels toward him who has been "all" in this life to her. Jean Valjean is convinced that he should unveil before this person, who represents the totality of his reason to live, the dark shadows that cling to his past. With one final resolve he makes all known, fully aware of the expected consequence of alienating the most precious and only soul he has ever loved. The full impact of what I am trying to say can only come as one labors through the 1221-page volume, which I have done five times and again just recently.<br><h2><b>This Saintly Man</b></h2><br>I have thought a great deal about President Kimball as I have considered this phrase, "the last drop in the chalice." President Spencer W. Kimball has given more energy, greater service, and has had the most profound impact, I think, of anyone in the restored Church save the Prophet Joseph only. This is partially due to the numerical size of the Church. It is also due to the shrinking of the size of the Church through modern convenience of travel, communication, and worldwide acceptance to a greater or lesser degree.<br><br>President Kimball has suffered with problems of boils, throat cancer, heart disease and surgery, Bell's palsy, and three subdural hematoma operations. For all that is publicly known about him, there are books of deeds about which only a few know. This saintly man has come as near to walking in the footsteps of Jesus as any living soul.<br><br>Only a few know of the times when he has been in the hospital recovering but has taken that time to visit others and has given blessings when possibly he had the greater need. I have known and seen brave, faithful men weep as they have talked about President Kimball's visit to their loved ones when all hope seemed lost.<br><br>Many unthinking people have gone to his home or to his office or have cornered him at conference--as if theirs was the only problem in the world that mattered. And this beloved apostle has responded in that very way, as if theirs was the only problem in the world. So many of us who are lesser than he would have resented the imposition.<br><br>Even today, in his present condition, I suppose he receives more letters from members of the Church than any other General Authority. I receive only those that are written to him from members residing in the North America Southeast Area, one of thirteen such areas in the world. The letters flow in regularly and we respond for him.<br><br>His office is like a minimuseum of gifts from people who have sent their treasured possessions to share with him. I think only a small selection of these gifts are displayed in his office.<br><br>There are many special trinkets and gifts from those of Lamanite descent. Also, one artist has portrayed the feelings the minorities especially feel toward President Kimball. There is a beautifully framed rendering of Lamanites and also one of a black family with tears on the cheeks of the father and mother as they gaze toward the Salt Lake Temple. I took a black man and his wife through President Kimball's office, and this was the one gift that impressed them--also to tears.<br><h2><b>"A Real Man"</b></h2><br>Consider the giant forward thrust the Church has made during the ministry of President Kimball as prophet. Even now, after five years of limited involvement, President Kimball's great vision reaches out before us. He has set a work in motion that no enemy or foe will frustrate. Compare the majesty of this magnificent soul to the spiritual pygmies who hurl their own faithless frustrations upon the Church or try to drag others down to their level of empty faith.<br><br>Elder Packer said, "They leave the Church but they can't leave it alone" (Utah State University baccalaureate address). They publish theological pornography that is damaging to the spirit. None of it is worth casting an eye upon. Do not read the anti-Mormon materials. That is not the way you resolve questions about the truthfulness of the restored gospel. Simply go back and read and ponder and pray about the Book of Mormon and you will know it is true. Those who try to dissuade us from the truth want to tear down what we have, but they do not have anything to replace it when it's gone. A person who has sexual hang-ups should not read pornographic material as a means of dealing with his or her problem. Likewise, a person who is weak in the faith should not read pornographic theological material. It only destroys and takes away; it never replaces that which was lost.<br><br>A poet said it in these words:<br><br><i>I watched them tearing a building down,</i><br><i>A gang of men in a busy town.</i><br><i>With a ho-heave-ho and a lusty yell,</i><br><i>They swung the beams and the side walls fell.</i><br><br><i>I asked the foreman, "Are these men skilled,</i><br><i>The kind you'd hire were you to build?"</i><br><i>He laughed and said, "Why, no indeed!</i><br><i>Just common laborers are all I need.</i><br><i>They can easily wreck in a day or two</i><br><i>What builders have taken years to do. "</i><br><br><i>And I thought to myself as I went my way:</i><br><i>"What part in the game of life do I play?</i><br><i>Am I a builder who works with care,</i><br><i>measuring life by the rule and square?</i><br><br><i>Am I shaping my deeds to a well-made plan,</i><br><i>patiently doing the best I can?</i><br><i>Or am I a wrecker who walks the town,</i><br><i>Content with the labor of tearing down?"</i><br>[Author unknown]<br><br>The names of those who have profited from the sale of anti-Mormon materials will fade and die. Their cause is nonsense. Their hope is desolate, and the eternal consequence of attempting to destroy the faith of the Saints will ring everlastingly down through the generations to their own destruction and that of their offspring. The Lord said,<br><br><i>Wherefore, let them bring forth their strong reasons against the Lord.</i><br><br><i>Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you--there is no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper;</i><br><br><i>And if any man lift his voice against you he shall be confounded in mine own due time.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 71:8–10]<br><br>Can we not judge by the Spirit the senselessness of those who splinter the doctrines, rearrange the principles, and ignite the fire of apostasy? We ought to have the wisdom and the vision to see where such nonsensical conduct and teachings lead.<br><br>Imagine comparing those shallow, empty minds against the contributions of President Kimball. I preside over the southeast area of the United States and the Caribbean, and I tell you--those Saints come near worshipping President Spencer W. Kimball, the Prophet. I think there is hardly a congregation in the South that has not sung "We Ever Pray for Thee." The words in the third verse are:<br><br><i>We ever pray for thee with fervent love;</i><br><i>And as the children's prayer is heard above,</i><br><i>Thou shalt be ever blest, and God will give</i><br><i>All that is meet and best</i>[President Kimball]<i>while thou shalt live.</i>[<i>Hymns,</i>no. 23]<br><br>We do pray for thee, President Kimball, our noble, beloved Prophet of God. It has been my intention here to share with you some of these thoughts and have you contemplate that this final era in the life of President Spencer W. Kimball may be the extracting of the "last drops of the chalice." We wonder if any man reaches perfection in this life and realize that they do not. Nonetheless, President Kimball's life comes near the mark. Edgar A. Guest wrote a poem entitled "A Real Man." I have quoted it a few times to a few men. Never was it more accurate than when describing President Spencer W. Kimball.<br><br><i>A Real Man</i><br><br><i>Men are of two kinds, and he</i><br><i>Was of the kind I'd like to be.</i><br><i>Some preach their virtues, and a few</i><br><i>Express their lives by what they do.</i><br><i>That sort was he. No flowery phrase</i><br><i>Or glibly spoken words of praise</i><br><i>Won friends for him. He wasn't cheap</i><br><i>Or shallow, but his course ran deep,</i><br><i>And it was pure. You know the kind.</i><br><i>Not many in a life you find</i><br><i>Whose deeds outrun their words so far</i><br><i>That more than what they seem they are.</i><br><br><i>There are two kinds of lies as well:</i><br><i>The kind you live, the ones you tell.</i><br><i>Back through his years from age to youth</i><br><i>He never acted one untruth.</i><br><i>Out in the open light he fought</i><br><i>And didn't care what others thought</i><br><i>Nor what they said about his fight</i><br><i>If he believed that he was right.</i><br><i>The only deeds he ever hid</i><br><i>Were acts of kindness that he did.</i><br><br><i>What speech he had was plain and blunt.</i><br><i>His was an unattractive front.</i><br><i>Yet children loved him; babe and boy</i><br><i>Played with the strength he could employ,</i><br><i>Without one fear, and they are fleet</i><br><i>To sense injustice and deceit.</i><br><i>No back door gossip linked his name</i><br><i>With any shady tale of shame.</i><br><i>He did not have to compromise</i><br><i>With evil-doers, shrewd and wise,</i><br><i>And let them ply their vicious trade</i><br><i>Because of some past escapade.</i><br><br><i>Men are of two kinds, and he</i><br><i>Was of the kind I'd like to be.</i><br><i>No door at which he ever knocked</i><br><i>Against his manly form was locked.</i><br><i>If ever man on earth was free</i><br><i>And independent, it was he.</i><br><i>No broken pledge lost him respect,</i><br><i>He met all men with head erect,</i><br><i>And when he passe</i>[s]<i>I think there</i>[will be sent]<br><i>A soul to yonder firmament</i><br><i>So white, so splendid and so fine</i><br><i>It</i>[comes]<i>almost to God's design.</i><br>[Edgar A. Guest,<i>A Heap o' Livin'</i>]<br><h2><b>Loving Counsel</b></h2><br>The purpose of giving you this background is a result of deep pondering. I have tried desperately to consider what President Kimball would teach and admonish you if he were here. I have read much of what he has written. I have studied and pondered his talks, and I think I have a limited understanding of his style.<br><br>I wonder if he wouldn't counsel you in this way: "I have a great spiritual disturbance in my soul. I feel constantly at unrest. It seems that many of our<i></i>most valiant youth and young adults are falling prey to the deadly tactical warfare of the adversary. Never has there been so much confusion and disruption in our strong LDS homes and total abandonment of the principles of truth in others. Hardly a family has not been penetrated to a greater or lesser degree."<br><h2><b>Models for Living</b></h2><br>I visited a stake in a distant city. I make it a custom to memorize their statistics, which at least gives me some slight understanding of activity levels. In this stake almost every statistic was down dramatically, including sacrament meeting, priesthood meeting, Relief Society, Primary, Sunday School, youth activity, tithing, and temple activity. I think I had a sense of righteous indignation, maybe even anger, that we had let Satan take over so much real estate.<br><br>I questioned the stake leaders, and together we prayed and pondered for an answer. It came. This stronghold community of the Church had not especially been aware of<i></i>the subtleties of Satan's strategy. Many in this farming community had purchased satellite receivers, video shops had opened, and naive parents were letting R- and X-rated movies into their homes through satellite channels, and the youth and even some parents were renting them. Imagine violating the second most sacred place on the earth, the homes of righteous Latter-day Saints.<br><br>I think President Kimball would speak boldly against this insidious evil. I think he would counsel parents to monitor what is brought in and out of the home to see that it reflects an LDS standard.<br><br>I believe that President Kimball's heart would be troubled that Satan is making a mockery of sacred things and our young people are unsuspectingly being influenced in a more terrible way that we ever would have supposed. We are a peculiar people and that is the strength of this church. We can have our families extended into eternity and become like him. I think it is the most glorious concept ever to be given to man by our God, and I love him for it.<br><br>We teach a Word of Wisdom that the modern scientists are discovering is an inspired health law. We have family home evening and family prayer. We pay tithes and offerings, and our people prosper. We go to the temple and perform vicarious work for the dead, and we send out our true ambassadors as missionaries to the world. We believe in Christ and we live his commandments, and we do so everlastingly many more things as we serve our Lord.<br><br>Why then can we not recognize the tactics of the evil one? We should walk in the sun as at noonday.<br><br>What Satan has done is perpetrated a great lie upon us. To our youth he has lied: "You can keep your standards but you do not have to be different. You do not need to violate the Word of Wisdom, but you do not have to make an issue out of the things that do not really matter." Our very dress and grooming reflects our inward values.<br><br>If you will watch and pattern your dress and conduct after the people of real substance, you will not go wrong. Men and women of substance have the inner stability and well-being to follow the conservative, inoffensive dress standards. Remember, there is a time and a season for everything under the heavens.<br><br>I had an old red sweatshirt that I used to wear when I would float the western rivers. Then my wife threw it away. There is a different standard of dress for various activities. However, when we are in public, it makes good sense to not groom or dress in a way that will attract undue attention or detract from the surrounding scenery.<br><h2><b>Be a Servant-Leader</b></h2><br>I think President Kimball might instruct us in the benefits of serving. Robert K. Greenleaf wrote a book entitled<i>Servant Leadership.</i>He states:<br><br><i>The idea of</i>The Servant as Leader<i>came out of reading Hermann Hesse's</i>Journey to the East.<i>In this story we see a band of men on a mythical journey, probably also Hesse's own journey. The central figure of the story is Leo who accompanies the party as the</i>servant<i>who does their menial chores, but who also sustains them with his spirit and his song. He is a person of extraordinary presence. All goes well until Leo disappears. Then the group falls into disarray and the journey is abandoned. They cannot make it without the servant Leo. The narrator, one of the party, after some years of wandering finds Leo and is taken into the Order that had sponsored the journey. There he discovers that Leo, whom he had known first as</i>servant,<i>was in fact the titular head of the Order, its guiding spirit, a great and noble</i>leader.<br><br><i>One can muse on what Hesse was trying to say when he wrote this story. We know that most of his fiction was autobiographical, that he led a tortured life, and that</i>Journey to the East<i>suggests a turn toward the serenity he achieved in his old age. There has been much speculation by critics on Hesse's life and work, some of it centering on this story which they find the most puzzling. But to me, this story clearly says that</i>the great leader is seen as servant first,<i>and that simple fact is the key to his greatness. Leo was actually the leader all of the time, but he was servant first because that was what he was,</i>deep down inside. [Robert K. Greenleaf,<i>Servant Leadership: A Journey into the Nature of Legitimate Power and Greatness</i>(New York: Paulist Press, 1977), p. 7]<br><br>Brother Hugh Nibley, a great soul, seems to concur with this in a marvelous discourse called "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/hugh-nibley_leaders-managers/"><span style="color: #33cccc;">Management Versus Leadership</span></a>." Greenleaf also stated:<br><br><i>Those who choose to follow this principle will not casually accept the authority of existing institutions.</i>Rather, they will freely respond only to individuals who are chosen as leaders because they are proven and trusted servants....<br><br><i>My</i><i>thesis, that more servants should emerge as leaders, or should follow only servant-leaders, is not a popular one.</i>[Greenleaf,<i>Servant Leadership,</i>p. 10]<br><br>And again:<br><br><i>The servant-leader</i>is<i>servant</i>first--<i>as Leo was portrayed. It begins with the natural feeling that one wants to serve, to serve</i>first.<i>Then conscious choice brings one to aspire to lead. That person is sharply different from one who is</i>leader<i>first.</i>[Greenleaf,<i>Servant Leadership,</i>p. 13]<br><br>And finally:<br><br><i>Not much happens without a dream. And for something great to happen, there must be a great dream. Behind every great achievement is a dreamer of great dreams. Much more than a dreamer is required to bring it to reality; but the dream must be there first.</i>[Greenleaf,<i>Servant Leadership,</i>p. 16]<br><br>President Kimball's life could be summarized in the words servant-leader with a dream. President Kimball said: "Make no small plans. They have no magic to stir men's souls" (Regional Representatives' seminar). His life has been one of service, and through his service he has served in the most important office on the face of the earth, Prophet of the Living God.<br><br><i>Behold, I say unto you that because I said unto you that I had spent my days in your service, I do not desire to boast, for I have only been in the service of God.</i><br><br><i>And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.</i>[Mosiah 2:16–17]<br><h2><b>Cultivate a Sense of Humor</b></h2><br>I believe President Kimball would encourage a sense of humor. I think you will need it in the days ahead. You may need it in some of your classes, or on some of your dates, or at work.<br><br>I understand that Robbie Bosco is a fighter, that he likes to win. They said one day a few weeks back that he was carrying a list of all the men he could whip. Leon White came up to him and said, "I understand you have a list of all the fellows you can whip." Robbie said, "That's right." Leon White said, "Is my name on that list?" Robbie responded that it was. Leon White said, "You can't whip me and I'll prove it." Robbie said: "That's OK. I'll just take your name off the list."<br><br>Two weeks ago, President Holland referred to the <a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/jeffrey-r-holland_nailing-colors-mast/"><span style="color: #33cccc;">miraculous accomplishments in space that seem almost commonplace now</span></a>. It reminded me of a cartoon of two fleas on a dog. They were leaning back-to-back against a hair and having a deep discussion. Off in the distance they saw another dog. One of them turned to his companion and said, "Do you think there is life on other dogs?"<br><br>Gene Perrett, comedy writer and humorist, said, "Humor is serious business." He is a writer for many of the top comedians. He shared an experience Bob Hope had:<br><br><i>Bob Hope was to present an award to a gentleman by the name of Charlie Boswell.</i>...<i>Charlie Boswell was this country's outstanding blind golfer. That's what the award was for. These gentlemen play a great game of golf. They have an assistant line the club up, but they swing themselves, and they hit the ball a ton. They really play a great game.</i><br><br><i>When he got to the podium, Bob Hope couldn't resist kidding him a little bit. He said, "Outstanding blind golfer, huh. I'd like to play you sometime." Charlie Boswell said, "Mr. Hope, I would love to play you a round of golf." Hope said, "I don't think you understand. I only play for money."</i><i>Charlie Boswell said, "I</i><i>like to have a little side bet going, too. It makes things more interesting.</i>"<i>And Hope said, "But what kind of a handicap would I have to give you?" Charlie said, "I'll tell you what, Mr. Hope, I'll play you even up.</i>"<i>Hope was delighted. He said, "What time?" Charlie Boswell said, "Midnight.".</i>. .<br><br><i>Abraham Lincoln was once in a debate for public office. His opponent spoke first and Lincoln sat on the platform and listened. His opponent kept pointing to Lincoln and referring to him as a liar, and a cheat, and a two-faced-politician. Lincoln never got angry and never showed any emotion. He sat there calmly and listened. When it was his turn to speak, he stepped to the front of the podium and said, "Ladies and gentlemen, if I were two faced, would I be wearing</i>this one?" [Gene Perrett, "Humor Is Serious Business: Resist That Urge to Strike Back,"<i>Vital Speeches of the Day,</i>15 August 1985, pp. 651–52]<br><br>Then Gene Perrett told about an experience to which some of you may relate:<br><br><i>When my daughter was a sophomore in high school, she'd been wanting to date this one boy. Finally the school sponsored a trip where they rode the train down towards San Diego, had dinner, and took the train back. This gentleman asked her to be his date. I waited up till she got home, and when she came in I asked her, "Honey, how did things go?" She said, "Dad, it's the worst time I ever had in my life.</i>"<i>I said, "Why? I thought you were crazy about this guy.</i>"<i>She said, "All he did was talk about himself. All the way down how he plays football, what school he's going to, what he's going to major in. He's the most egotistical person I ever met in my life.</i>... "<i>I said, "Didn't he see what he was doing? Didn't he realize that all he was doing was talking about himself?" She said, "Just for one brief moment</i>.<i></i>. .<i>around dessert time. He said to me, 'All I'm doing is talking about myself. How about you. What do you think of me?</i>'" [Perrett, "Humor Is Serious Business," p. 652]<br><h2><b>Making Use of Good Music</b></h2><br>I think President Kimball would then tell you of the value of learning to love good and great music. This one great blessing will reward you a thousandfold.<br><br>As a bishop, a stake president, or as a General Authority, you sit on the stand and observe the Saints. Music is absolutely an essential element in increasing spirituality. Every Sunday at church when sacred hymns are sung, many in the congregation will quietly weep as they sing--some from heavy hearts, some whose lives have turned back to God and who feel his refreshing forgiveness, others whose hearts are simply filled with the love of God and music has stirred those sensitivities. You will find in life that there is need for a sense of timing and a special awareness that leads one to listen to appropriate music for specific purposes and occasions.<br><br>I recently, without any warning or preparation, had a women's chorus sing "We Ever Pray for Thee." The congregation's thoughts were turned to our beloved prophet, and tears flowed freely. The choir felt what they sang, and deep emotion filled their bosoms. President Kimball would want you to make use of good music in your life.<br><h2><b>Be a Straight-Arrow</b></h2><br>How often President Kimball has reminded us to be pure. "Purity of heart" is a marvelous quest. "Unto the pure [in heart] all things [indeed] are pure" (Titus 1:15). The controversy of AIDS, homosexual conduct, and other perversions of life are so constant and common that we almost become sympathetic and understanding to the point of condoning. The gospel of Jesus Christ is for every soul that walks the earth. Its doors of love, purity, charity, and forgiveness are opened wide to all who would enter. But even the Great God of Heaven cannot save a man in his sins. We sometimes wonder if there are any in the Church who have not been singed by the flames of transgression. Let me say to you: There are hundreds of thousands of our young people who are purer and cleaner than any generation that ever walked the earth. To you who are clean, please know you are not alone. God bless you. Continue in that.<br><br>President Archie Brugger of the San Antonio East Stake in Texas shared an experience worthy of your interest. While he served in the military (in Germany, I believe), a young officer came to him one day and said, "Colonel Brugger, do you know there are only eight straight arrows in our entire company?" A straight-arrow is a soldier who does not have an illicit affair with a woman. He said, "I know you are a straight-arrow and so am I." A few weeks later this young officer returned again and said, "Colonel Brugger, now there are only four." It was only a matter of a few more weeks and he returned a third time and said, "Colonel Brugger, there are only two, you and me." President Brugger said to this young man: "I intend to remain clean. I am a Mormon and I have a wife back in the United States who is keeping herself clean also while I am away. I trust her and she trusts me, and we both honor the teachings of the Church." The young man said: "You are leaving in six weeks to go back to the United States and I will remain here. I don't know how much longer I can hold out." President Brugger said, "My young friend, if I can do it you can do it. The Lord will help you."<br><br>In the military there may not be too many straight-arrows, but I testify to you, in this church there are. I pray you may be one of them. If not, then become one.<br><br>I also believe President Kimball would want you to love integrity and to honor those who have it. He would want you to use men and women of integrity as models for living. President Nathan Eldon Tanner has been known among the Brethren and in the community as Mr. Integrity. But let me say to you that every member of the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles are the greatest men of integrity I know.<br><br>My early family life and business life brought me into association with men who lacked integrity. Sadly, we also see it in the Church and it breaks our hearts. We see some of our returned missionaries making compromises. Stories come to us about some who have pornographic materials in their apartments, who seemingly went through a two-year mission but the two-year mission did not go through them. Elder Monson was informed of a transgressing missionary in the field. We related the consequences of his conduct --a Church court, being sent home, family embarrassment, loss of membership, etc. Elder Monson listened very tenderly, and then he said, "The Brethren and the Prophet himself grieve when they learn of these incidents." I know they do. We all do.<br><br>Integrity is honesty to the very center of our souls. It is living what we profess and what we testify. I pray that sometime in the life of every person in this room it may be said, "He/she is a person of integrity."<br><h2><b>Practice the Pure Love of Christ</b></h2><br>How often President Kimball in his speaking and writing, equally as eloquent to me as Isaiah, has reminded us to practice charity--the pure love of Christ. Charity never faileth. It is the noblest of all virtues. It covereth a multitude of sins. One who has true charity will live every commandment and will love unconditionally. Before charity, all things wash away--pride, impatience, vanity, unkindness, disloyalty, envy, jealousy, uncouthness, unholiness.<br><br>Remember, "And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity" (1 Corinthians 13:13).<br><h2><b>Become a Man of Christ</b></h2><br>Finally, I think President Kimball would say to you, "Become a 'man of Christ,' a disciple of the Master"--"man of Christ" referring to mankind, men and women. Thus we read in Helaman, chapter 3, verses 29 and 30:<br><br><i>Yea, we see that whosoever will may lay hold upon the word of God, which is quick and powerful, which shall divide asunder all the cunning and the snares and the wiles of the devil, and lead the man of Christ in a strait and narrow course across that everlasting gulf of misery which is prepared to engulf the wicked--</i><br><br><i>And land their souls, yea, their immortal souls, at the right hand of God in the kingdom of heaven, to sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and with Jacob, and with all our holy fathers, to go no more out.</i><br><h2><b>"Thy Will Be Done"</b></h2><br>The gospel changes lives. Now, of course, in a few minutes we cannot say all that, in my humble opinion, President Kimball would like to say. But each one could ask himself, as I have done, "What would President Kimball's King Benjamin discourse be to us if he were here to deliver it?" President Kimball has been so pure, so sweet, so Christ-like that to suppose there might be one final test, one final drop of the chalice, might seem inappropriate. I think not. Abraham, Moses, and Jesus all went through it, as did Joseph and Brigham. With President Kimball it may be that he is unable to serve in this high and holy calling the way he would like, to accept the Father's will and submit one final time to the key of his ministry, "Thy will be done."<br><br>I know that President Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet of God. My soul is humbled to the dust for the privilege of living in his day. Whatever he is, his wife also is. She is not a whit behind him. President and Sister Kimball, if you happen to be listening, I love you. I hope I have not misrepresented anything to these students on the greatest campus in the world.<br><br>I bear my testimony to you today that I know that God lives and that this church is the only authorized agency to function in his behalf. There is no other. I know the Book of Mormon is true, and I would rather lay down my life this instant than deny that Nephi, King Benjamin, Alma, Ammon, Moroni, Mormon, and the Brother of Jared were prophets of God. I know they were. As I stated to the missionaries, the enemies of the Church could line up four abreast from San Francisco to Salt Lake City and come to me to try to convince me that the Church was not true, and when the last one had passed by I would still know that this church is the only true church on the face of the earth.<br><br>I bear that sacred testimony in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Vaughn J.

<br>
<br>
Good evening, my young brothers and sisters--and some not so young. I consider it a privilege and an honor to greet you here this night in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. I could not have thought of a more fitting song to be sung than "I Heard Him Come." If he had not come, there would be no light from the sun or the moon or the stars. I presume there would have been no creation. There would be no life. We would not exist. It is because of him that we are here. I presume that everything we do in this life that is really worthwhile comes from the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>We are Christian and would like the whole world to know that. Sometimes we are accused of not being Christian. Elder Marion D. Hanks once said in General Conference, "If you were accused of being Christian, would there be enough evidence to convict you?" Accused of being a follower of the Lord Jesus Christ, could you with good conscience feel you were guilty of that high commendation?<br><h2><b>The Gospel Embraces All Truth</b></h2><br>Christ came to serve. He asked a question one time, "Who is greatest? He that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth he that sitteth at meat?" (see Luke 22:27). In the world, we know who is the greatest. It is the one who pays the bill, right? But not so in the kingdom. He followed that with, "I am among you as he that serveth." He came not to be administered unto, but to minister and give his life as a ransom for many. We know that he did come to give his life as a ransom for all. "For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive" (1 Corinthians 15:22).<br><br>And so we who follow the Lord, who follow the Master, should be walking examples of the gospel of Jesus Christ. I've heard the gospel variously described as containing all truth. All truth whatsoever is contained in the gospel. Do you think that is true? Surely it embraces all truth, but does it really contain all truth?<br><br>Well, let us see. There is a law, which I presume was irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundation of this world, that if you drop an object, it falls down. It never falls up; it falls down. You have never stubbed your toe and fallen up. You always fall down. That law says that any falling body is being pulled toward the center of the earth at the rate of thirty-two feet per second per second. And it is true. You can prove it in a vacuum. A feather and a steel ball fall at exactly the same speed.<br><br>Now, if that be true, how do we get into orbit? Well, if you are going to get into orbit, you have to get high enough above the earth so that you don't hit any mountains. So the recommended height is at least 31,000 feet, but if you really want to get up into orbit, you ought to get up where the satellites are. The satellites, I understand, are about 22,300 miles up. That is high. After you get up there, you have to accelerate to about 15,000 miles per hour. You are still propelled back to the center of the earth, but you are going so fast that you fall over the side of the earth. And so you fall around the earth. Thus, you orbit. When you are in orbit, you freely fall. There is no force of gravity; you don't feel anything.<br><br>You know how our Japanese friends are--they are so polite. When you meet them they always bow a little bit. One of the astronauts who was orbiting some time ago wanted to greet us. Instead of bowing, he raised up his feet. He sat right there in the air. He didn't move. Then he put his feet back down. That is different, isn't it?<br><br>How do you get from orbiting the earth to the moon? Well, you have to speed up again to about 25,000 miles per hour. Then you fall over the side of the earth, but you fall<i>way over</i>the side of the earth. In fact, you fall so far over the side of the earth that you fall out to the moon. Then you slow down to where you are falling over the side of the moon. Then you are orbiting the moon.<br><br>Now, what do you suppose that has to do with the gospel of Jesus Christ? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I presume if you were a creator and you were going to organize a world, you had better use the law of gravity, or you may have chaos. So the gospel embraces all truth, but it doesn't contain all truth. If we wanted to know what the gospel of Jesus Christ really contains, we probably could not do better than to have the Master tell us himself. So I would call your attention to 3 Nephi 27:13. This is the Master himself speaking, so I presume we can believe him.<br><br><i>Behold I have given unto you my gospel, and this is the gospel which I have given unto you--that I came into the world to do the will of my Father, because my Father sent me.</i>[3 Nephi 27:13]<br><br>He did not come to do his own thing. Many of us are here and we want to do our own thing. He came to do the will of the Father, and you and I are here to do precisely the same thing. We are here to do the will of the Father. Now, it is not exactly the same acts the Master came to do, but it is just as vital and just as important that we do the will of the Father also.<br><br>He continues:<br><br><i>And my father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; and after that I had been lifted up upon the cross, that I might draw all men unto me, that as I have been lifted up by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil.</i>[3 Nephi 27:14]<br><h2><b>Learn a Great Lesson</b></h2><br>Christ said he came to be lifted up upon the cross<i>.</i>Do you suppose he wanted to be lifted up upon the cross? I cannot believe that he did, or if he did, he was acting very strangely in the Garden of Gethsemane the night before it happened. "If it be possible," he said, "let this cup pass from me." That is equivalent to saying, "I don't want to do this." "Nevertheless [said he], not as I will, but as thou wilt" (Matthew 26:39). He did want to do the will of the Father, although I don't think he was looking forward to this particular act. From that we learn a great lesson. I guess it doesn't make any difference whether you want to or not, as long as you do it.<br><br>I learned this lesson from my father. My father was smarter than I was when I was seven years old. Of course, I was smarter than he was when I was seventeen. And then he was smarter than I was when I was twenty-one. We went back and forth for years, my dad and I.<br><br>One time my father said to me, "You are not big enough to milk the cows." And I knew that I was. I was seven years old; of course I was big enough to milk. So I proved to my dad that I could milk. If you are going to milk, you have to get up early in the morning, like four o'clock. Now, that is early. You have to get your bucket, go out and clean and feed the cows, then you have to sit under them, and you have to pull and tug and squeeze. I did that until I could get the milk. I can make the foam stand up three inches in the bucket. I still have a milkin' muscle. Can you see that? There are no city boys with one of those.<br><br>My dad said, "You know, I believe you can milk. You've got the job." For the next ten years I milked from eight to twelve cows morning and night. You may rest assured that I got to the place where I did not want to milk. I said, "Dad, I don't want to milk." He said, "That's okay, you don't have to want to--as long as you do it."<br><br>I guess that is what the Lord says to us at times. I don't suppose that Abraham wanted to offer his son as a burnt offering. I know for sure that Jonah did not want to go on a mission, but he did. I was talking to a reluctant missionary one day and I said, "You know, if I had a friendly whale I could put you in for about three days, you'd probably change your mind about this."<br><br>The Lord has better methods than we do. It is vitally important that you and I learn this great lesson. If it is the will of the Lord, we do it, irrespective of whether we want to or not. It will bring tremendous blessings to us, and the Lord expects it of us. Great blessings will come, but you have to make the sacrifice before you get the blessing. I think that is plainly stated by Moroni in the book of Ether when he said, "Dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith" (Ether 12:6). You have to do it first. Nothing compares with the doing.<br><h2><b>He Had to Pay the Price</b></h2><br>And so the Master said he came that he could be lifted up upon the cross--"And after that I had been lifted up upon the cross, that I might draw all men unto me" (3 Nephi 27:14). Now, how would being lifted upon the cross draw all men unto him? We have to have some understanding of who he was and why he was here.<br><br>He came to pay the price for sin, the transgression in the Garden of Eden that brought death into the world as well as individual sins. Everyone is subject to that death. You are all going to die. No one gets out of this life alive. Some people act like they are going to, but they don't. He had to pay the price for that transgression. But he also paid the price for our individual sins because you and I are sinners. It is true, isn't it? I didn't make that up on my own. John said it.<br><br><i>If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.</i>[1 John 1:10]<br><br>I would never say anything like that about you, but John did, and I believe him.<br><br>We are sinners. We need a savior. We need desperately to have a remission of our sins. He came to pay the price for individual sins too, and he did pay that price. Because he did, he did away with the effects of spiritual death. That is how we get back into the presence of our Father in Heaven. We have to go back without our sins. He took our sins upon him. We couldn't do that ourselves. He alone can do that. We have a song that says, "There was no other good enough to pay the price of sin" ("There Is a Green Hill Far Away,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 194). He was without sin himself. As Paul said, though he "was in all points tempted like as we are, yet [he was] without sin" (Hebrews 4:15). He did not sin, and so he<i>could</i>pay that price.<br><br>When we come to understand that he did for us what we could not do for ourselves--and he did it because he loved us--you cannot keep from loving someone like that. His example, hanging on that cross, was the most vivid example of love you could ever see. "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends" (John 15:13). And so he will draw all men unto him.<br><br><i>That as I have been lifted up by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father.</i>[3 Nephi 27:14]<br><h2><b>Looking for Happiness</b></h2><br>The resurrection comes by the power of the Father. Everyone is going to be lifted up. Everyone will be resurrected. You don't have to do anything to be resurrected, except be born. Congratulations. You're going to be resurrected. But resurrection in and of itself is not exaltation. No, you have to get rid of sin. You can be resurrected in a filthy condition. That will not make you happy, and you are here to be happy. That is the object and design of our creation said the Prophet Joseph Smith. Lehi said, "Man is that he might have joy" (see 2 Nephi 2:25).<br><br>You are all looking for happiness, aren't you? If you are not careful, you will look in the wrong place for happiness. "Wickedness never was happiness," said Alma (Alma 41:10). The devil isn't happy. As a matter of fact, he is miserable. He has so much misery he would love to share it with you. But you won't enjoy it. No one enjoys hell. Not even the devil enjoys hell. He runs the place, but he doesn't enjoy it. He wants "all men [to] be miserable like unto himself" (2 Nephi 2:27).<br><br>If you are not careful, you could be taken in by "Old Scratch." He lies to you all the time. He says things like "One time won't hurt anything," "Try it, you'll like it." Have you ever heard anything like that before? It's a lie. One time could cost you your eternal exaltation. That is how dangerous one time is. All alcoholics start by taking<i>one</i>drink. All drug addicts start by taking<i>one</i>fix. Just kill somebody<i>one</i>time and there is no forgiveness in this world or in the world to come. You see, one time can be devastating. It doesn't stop with one lie either. They come in bunches like grapes.<br><br>Satan follows up with further lies like, "Besides, everybody is doing it." I want you to know that everybody isn't doing it. Only those who are going to hell are doing it. And they will not enjoy hell, remember? Then Satan winds up with another dandy lie, "Besides, no one will ever know. It is a secret. We'll do it in the dark."<br><br>Did you know that the devil works in darkness? He really does. More sins are committed in the darkness than in the light. We're trying to hide, I presume, from the Lord. Do you know what the Lord says about that? "And their iniquities shall be spoken upon the housetops" (D&amp;amp;C 1:3). Does that sound like no one will ever know? It will probably be on television. When the Lord says "It shall be spoken from the housetops," it means that it will be common knowledge.<br><h2><b>Listen to the Lord</b></h2><br>So, you can't be taken in by Old Scratch, although he lies to you all the time. You must not listen to him. Listen to the Lord. He'll never lead you astray--never, ever. How do you listen to the Lord? Maybe you should study the scriptures. Paul said, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine." The basic beliefs of the Church will be found in the scriptures. You need to know the doctrine of the kingdom. It is also profitable "for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works" (2 Timothy 3:16–17). Study the scriptures. It is vitally important that you do.<br><br>You must live by every word that proceedeth forth out of the mouth of God, but you must also follow the living prophet of God on earth. If the Lord is going to make any changes, he will do it through his living prophet. He does make changes from time to time, even though we say he is the same yesterday, today, and forever without shadow of changing. Yes, he was changeable yesterday, he is changeable today, and he will be changeable forever. That makes him the same, doesn't it?<br><br>He changed the Sabbath day from the last day of the week to the first day of the week. He did away with the eternal covenant he made with Abraham, the law of circumcision. He made a little change back in June of 1978. You better listen to the living prophet.<br><br>You also have to follow those that serve under him. That would be your stake president and your bishop. Listen to them. As a matter of fact, if you are going to live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God, you may have to obey your parents. That will test your faith, won't it? You see, they are not your parents by accident. I'm sure you were chosen before you were born. The Lord wants you to obey your parents, for it is well pleasing unto the Lord. It is even the fifth commandment. "Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee" (Exodus 20:12).<br><br>It is smart to obey the Lord and follow those he has selected to give you direction. If you don't do that, then you will have to repent somewhere down the line. You see, the Lord died so we could get rid of our sins. He said, "If you will come unto me and confess your sins, forsake them, and follow me, you will go free." Then, in the resurrection, you will come up with a glorious body. Those that are righteous will be righteous still. You will look so beautiful, no one will be able to describe you. Isn't that what they say about angels, "whose brightness and glory defy all description" (JS--H 1:17)? Nobody has been able to describe one yet. Think about that.<br><h2><b>"Do Not Procrastinate the Day of Your Repentance"</b></h2><br>And so everyone is going to be resurrected. There are going to be a lot of people resurrected that will not want to be, but they are going to get it anyway. So you are going to get it and you better get ready for it. Why are all resurrected? "To stand before me to be judged whether they be good or whether they be evil" (3 Nephi 27:14). Then we are resurrected so we can be judged, and you are going to be judged on the basis of the deeds done in the flesh--so said Alma. That means we all came in the door marked "birth" and we are all going out the door marked "death." But we are going to be judged on the basis of what we do while we are here--not by what we did before we were born and not by what we do after we die.<br><br>You are not going to be here very long. You will only be here approximately eighty years. Compared to the eternity on either side of mortality, that is a snap of the fingers. You can do it! You can stand to have your foot in a vise for a while if you know it is going to be released. It is when you don't think you are ever going to get rid of it that it becomes unbearable.<br><br>Old Scratch will try to make you think that mortality is forever. It isn't. Remember, it is just a snap of the fingers. Whatever sacrifice the Lord asks you to make, you can do it. "And then, if thou endure it well," he said to the Prophet, "God shall exalt thee on high" (D&amp;amp;C 121:8).<br><br>Yes, you will be judged on the basis of what you do while you are here. Now, don't get the idea that you are going to change when you die and it will be easier then. After all, this body causes me lots of problems--it wants to eat all the time, among other things. No, you probably won't change. Amulek didn't think so when he said:<br><br><i>As ye have had so many witnesses, therefore, I beseech of you that ye do not procrastinate the day of your repentance until the end, for after this day of life, which is given us to prepare for eternity, behold, if we do not improve our time while in this life, then cometh the night of darkness wherein there can be no labor performed.</i><br><br><i>Ye cannot say when ye are brought to that awful crisis, that I will repent, that I will return to my God. Nay, ye cannot say this; for that same spirit which doth possess your bodies at the time that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will have power to possess your body in that eternal world.</i>[Alma 34:33]<br><br>If you are addicted to drugs, bad habits, and evil desires while you're here on this earth, you will probably still be addicted after you die. I'm not really sure what is going on in the spirit world; I haven't been there, and I'm not going to rush it. (There might not be any racquetball courts over there.) But I have it on very good authority that there are no cigarettes there. If you go there wanting a cigarette, do you suppose you would be in paradise or prison? The answer is obvious, isn't it? Now is the day of our salvation. Now is the time for men to prepare to meet God.<br><br>You can do it--right now while you have a body to help you. This body is given to you to help you overcome everything. With it, you can do it. Without it, it is difficult. Do it while you can, while you are here, right now.<br><h2><b>Faith unto Repentance</b></h2><br>"For this cause have I been lifted up," said the Master, "therefore, according to the power of the Father I will draw all men unto me, that they may be judged according to their works." There, he said it again. The Lord is prone to repeat things that he really wants you to understand. "And it shall come to pass, that whoso repenteth and is baptized in my name shall be filled" (3 Nephi 27:15–16). Filled with what? The Holy Ghost, of course, by the laying on of hands by a Mormon elder. You can't get it any other way.<br><br>"And if he endureth to the end"--and here I would add, "in repenting and forgiving," because you are going to have to continue with repentance and forgiveness throughout your probation here in mortality-- "behold, him will I hold guiltless before my Father at that day when I shall stand to judge the world" (3 Nephi 27:16). The Lord will judge the world. The Holy One of Israel employs no servants there. You get there through the Lord Jesus Christ. He is the righteous judge. Now he might have some others preparing materials for him. I see the President of the Church doing that at times. But Christ is the judge, and so is the prophet of God on earth.<br><br><i>And he that endureth not unto the end, the same is he that is also hewn down and cast into the fire, from whence they can no more return, because of the justice of the Father.</i>[3 Nephi 27:17]<br><br>That brings up an interesting word--justice. We all talk about the mercy of God. It seems that justice is always relegated to the back burner. That is because most of us are trying to avoid justice. You've heard people say, "I want to get what I deserve." That is the last thing in the world we really want, isn't it? You don't want justice, you want mercy. That surely is what I want.<br><br>Now, justice will have her dues. Mercy cannot rob justice, but mercy can satisfy the demands of justice in one instance and one only. You will find that in Alma 34.<br><br><i>And behold, this is the whole meaning of the law, every whit pointing to that great and last sacrifice; and that great and last sacrifice will be the Son of God, yea, infinite and eternal.</i><br><br><i>And thus he shall bring salvation to all those who shall believe on his name; this being the intent of this last sacrifice, to bring about the bowels of mercy, which overpowereth justice, and bringeth about means unto men that they may have faith unto repentance.</i><br><br><i>And thus mercy can satisfy the demands of justice, and encircles them in the arms of safety, while he that exercises no faith unto repentance is exposed to the whole law of the demands of justice; therefore only unto him that has faith unto repentance is brought about the great eternal plan of redemption.</i>[Alma 34:14–16]<br><br>And so<i>,</i>while mercy cannot rob justice, mercy<i>can</i>satisfy the demands of justice in one instance and one only. That is when we exercise faith unto repentance. That is where the saving power really is. It is faith unto repentance. You are going to have to repent, again and again. That is what the Lord requires of us. And so then, because of the justice of God, he can't deny his words. You have to follow him.<br><br><i>And this is the word which he hath given unto the children of men. And for this cause he fulfilleth the words which he hath given, and he lieth not, but fulfilleth all his words.</i><br><br><i>And no unclean thing can enter into his kingdom; therefore nothing entereth into his rest save it be those who have washed their garments in my blood, because of their faith, and the repentance of all their sins, and their faithfulness unto the end.</i><br><br><i>Now this is the commandment; Repent, all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and be baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day.</i><br><br><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, this is my gospel.</i>[3 Nephi 27:18–21]<br><h2><b>The Truth Is Simple</b></h2><br>So, what is the gospel? It is the "good news." It is the "glad tidings" about the Lord Jesus Christ, that he lives, that he did come and pay the price for all our sins, that he made the resurrection absolute reality. He was the first fruits of them that slept. No one was resurrected before him. But because of him everyone will be resurrected.<br><br>You get rid of sin by coming unto him and making eternal covenants with him. You do that through the waters of baptism. It is for the remission of sins, and it is a witness before God that you will be obedient unto him in keeping his commandments hereafter. Then, "though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow" (Isaiah 1:18). That is the glad tidings. That is the beauty of it, and it is so true. It is simple; it is not complicated.<br><br>The gospel does not<i>contain</i>all truth, but it<i>embraces</i>it all. The central truth is simple and is outlined for you and me. It is an individual thing. The Lord looks upon the heart of every man and woman and child that reaches the age of accountability.<br><br>I promise you that if you experience this, you will never be the same again. It will change your life. We need to experience this mighty change in our hearts. That is the reason we send missionaries out to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people where we are permitted to go. We will continue to do that because it is the only way. It is truth; it is life eternal. It is the pathway to happiness.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>I bear witness to you that Jesus is the Christ--that he lives. I know he lives and that he has paid the price for our sins. I bear witness that he came because his Father sent him to do precisely that. I bear witness that you have a Heavenly Father who will hear and answer your prayers. We have the kingdom of God on earth. It was established by the Lord Jesus Christ through that great prophet, Joseph Smith.<br><br>We have a living prophet of God on earth today. He is there to give us the word of God. You know that he is old and infirm. He can't do the things that he once did. I wonder sometimes why the Lord leaves him here when I'm sure he is frustrated with his infirmities. He has the greatest zeal of any man I know, and now he can't perform as he would like to.<br><br>But I think I know why it is. As long as Spencer Kimball is alive on this earth, his stamp of approval is on everything he has said. You want to know what you are supposed to do today? Go back and see what the living prophet has said that you should do. You do that, and you will be fine. I promise that you will. As long as he is here, let us follow him.<br><br>I promise you that eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither has it entered into hearts, the joy the Lord has in store for those who love him and keep his commandments. You are here to be happy. Happiness is simple. It is obedience. That is what it is all about. Joseph Smith said that "Happiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it" (<i>Teachings</i>) p. 255). That path is holiness, virtue, uprightness, and faithfulness in keeping all the commandments of God. That is the only way to be happy. I leave you my love and blessing and my fond affection, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Hartman Rector, Jr., was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 29 September 1985.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>e Desires of Our Hearts&quot; - Dallin H. Oaks - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Each of us desires the ultimate blessing of exaltation in the celestial kingdom. Even when we fall short, we desire what is right. That is my subject--"The Desires of Our Hearts."<br><br>I am interested in this subject because it highlights a critical contrast between the laws of God, as revealed in the scriptures, and what I will call the laws of man, as set out in the national and state laws with which I was concerned in my thirty years in the legal profession.<br><h2><b>Laws--Man's and God's</b></h2><br>The laws of man are never concerned about a person's desires or thoughts in isolation. When the law inquires into a person's state of mind or intent, it only seeks to determine what consequence should be assigned to particular actions that person has taken.<br><br>In contrast, the laws of God are concerned with spiritual things. Spiritual consequences are affected by actions, but they are also affected by desires or thoughts, independent of actions. Gospel consequences flow from the desires of our hearts.<br><br>A simple example will illustrate that contrast. Suppose your neighbor has a beautiful sports car parked in his driveway. You take no action. You just look on that car longingly, and covet it. You have sinned. You have broken one of the Ten Commandments (see Exodus 20:17). Eternal consequences follow.<br><br>Up to this point you have not broken any of the laws of man. However, if you take a particular action, such as jumping the ignition wires and driving away in the car, you will have committed a wrong that could be punished or redressed under the laws of man.<br><br>To determine what consequence should be assigned to your action, the law would attempt to determine your intent in taking the car. If you simply intended to borrow the car in the mistaken belief that your neighbor would consent, you might not be guilty of a crime. However, you would surely be liable for damages for the wrongful use of the car. If you intended to use the car contrary to the wishes of the owner and yet return it in a short time, you would have committed a minor crime. If you intended to take the car permanently, you would have committed a major crime. To choose among these various alternatives, a judge or jury would attempt to determine your state of mind.<br><br>This simple example makes the point that the laws of man will sometimes inquire into a person's state of mind in order to determine the consequences of particular actions, but the law will never punish or give effect to intent or desires standing alone. It was so in Book of Mormon times. As we read in Alma, the people of Nephi could be punished for their criminal actions, but "there was no law against a man's belief" (Alma 30:11).<br><br>It is good that this is so. The law is an imperfect instrument. It has no reliable way to look into a person's heart.<br><br>In contrast, God's law can assign consequences solely on the basis of our innermost thoughts and desires. There is no uncertainty in the administration of this law. As Ammon taught King Lamoni, God "looketh down upon all the children of men; and he knows all the thoughts and intents of the heart; for by his hand were they all created from the beginning" (Alma 18:32).<br><br>Similarly, Paul warned the Hebrews that God "is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart," and "all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him" (Hebrews 4:12–13).<br><br>In other words, God judges us not only for our acts, but also for the desires of our hearts. He has said so again and again. This is a challenging reality, but it is not surprising. Agency and accountability are eternal principles. We exercise our free agency not only by what we<i>do,</i>but also by what we<i>decide,</i>or<i>will,</i>or<i>desire.</i>Restrictions on freedom can deprive us of the power<i>to do,</i>but no one can deprive us of the power to<i>will</i>or<i>desire.</i>Accountability must therefore reach and attach consequences to the desires of our hearts.<br><br>This principle applies both in a negative way--making us guilty of sin for evil thoughts and desires--and in a positive way--promising us blessings for righteous desires.<br><h2><b>Sins of Desire</b></h2><br>The best-known scriptural designation of sin on the basis of the desires of our hearts concerns sexual sin. The Savior declared:<br><br><i>Behold, it is written by them of old time, that thou shalt not commit adultery;</i><br><br><i>But I say unto you, that whosoever looketh on a woman, to lust after her, hath committed adultery already in his heart.</i>[3 Nephi 12:27–28; see also Matthew 5:27–28]<br><br>The New Testament also condemns anger and unrighteous feelings--another example of sins committed solely on the basis of thoughts (see Matthew 5:22).<br><br>The Book of Mormon illustrates this same principle in its definition of priestcraft, the sin committed by those who preach the gospel to gain personal advantage rather than to further the work of the Lord:<br><br><i>Priestcrafts are that men preach and set themselves up for a light unto the world, that they may get gain and praise of the world; but they seek not the welfare of Zion.</i>[2 Nephi 26:29; see also Alma 1:16]<br><br>Priestcraft is not a sin that is committed solely on the basis of our desires because it involves acts. Those acts becomes sinful only when they are done with the wrong desire, to get gain or praise. The sin is in the desire, not in the act.<br><br>The same is true of those who draw near to the Lord with their lips but have removed their hearts far from him. (See Isaiah 29:13; Matthew 15:8; 2 Nephi 27:25; JS--H 1:19.) Likewise, the Psalmist condemned the people of ancient Israel because "their heart was not right with [God]" (Psalms 78:37).<br><br>When is our heart right with God? Our heart is right with God when we truly desire what is righteous--when we desire what God desires.<br><h2><b>Educating Our Desires</b></h2><br>Our divinely granted willpower gives us control over our desires, but it may take many years for us to be sure that we have willed and educated them to the point that all are entirely righteous.<br><br>President Joseph F. Smith taught that the "education. . . of our desires is one of far-reaching importance to our happiness in life" (Joseph F. Smith,<i>Gospel Doctrine</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1939], p. 297).<br><br>How do we educate our desires? We begin, I suppose, with our feelings. The desires of our hearts are deep-seated and fundamental. But our feelings are closer to the surface and easier for us to identify and influence.<br><br>Have you ever found yourself doing something you thought was right, but doing it because you "had" to? Did you ever keep a commandment of God with an attitude of resentment or self-righteousness, or even because you expected some immediate personal benefit? I suppose most of us have had this experience. Do you remember your feelings on such occasions? Do you think such feelings will be ignored by a Father in Heaven who gave us the willpower we call agency? Don't such feelings tell us something about the desires of our hearts?<br><br>In order to have righteous desires, we have to control our thoughts and achieve appropriate feelings. My widowed mother understood that principle. "Pray about your feelings," she used to say. She taught her three children that we should pray to have the right kind of feelings about our experiences--positive or negative--and about the people we knew. If our feelings were right, we would be more likely to take right actions and to act for the right reasons.<br><br>Mormon teaches that if our heart is not right, even a good action is not counted for righteousness.<br><br><i>For behold, God hath said a man being evil cannot do that which is good; for if he offereth a gift,</i>. . .<i>except he shall do it with real intent it profiteth him nothing.</i><br><br><i>For behold, it is not counted unto him for righteousness.</i><br><br><i>For behold, if a man being evil giveth a gift, he doeth it grudgingly; wherefore it is counted unto him the same as if he had retained the gift; wherefore he is counted evil before God.</i>[Moroni 7:6–8]<br><br>In other words, we must not only act, we must act for the right reasons. There are no blessings for actions taken without real intent.<br><br>Mormon even applied this principle to our prayers.<br><br><i>And likewise also is it counted evil unto a man, if he shall pray and not with real intent of heart; yea, and it profiteth him nothing, for God receiveth nonesuch.</i>[Moroni 7:9]<br><br>When Joseph Smith first went to Cumorah, the angel refused to give him the plates, saying it was not yet time. During the years he had to wait before receiving the plates, the young prophet struggled with his desires. In 1832 he wrote:<br><br><i>I had been tempted of the adversary and sought the Plates to obtain riches and kept not the commandment that I should have an eye single to the glory of God therefore I was chastened and sought diligently to obtain the plates and obtained them not until I was twenty one years of age.</i>[<i>The Personal Writings of Joseph Smith,</i>comp. Dean C. Jessee (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1984), p. 7]<br><br>The Lord saw into the heart of the young prophet, chastened him for his improper desires, gave him time to repent and mature, and eventually forgave him and allowed him to continue his mission.<br><br>Many scriptures reveal how the thoughts of our hearts will be relevant on the day of judgment. Alma taught that when we are brought before the bar of God to be judged, our works, our words, and our thoughts will all condemn us (see Alma 12:12, 14).<br><br>Two of my favorite verses of scripture are in the Twenty-fourth Psalm:<br><br><i>Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place?</i><br><br><i>He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart.</i><br><br>[Psalms 24:3–4; see also Alma 5:19]<br><br>If we refrain from evil acts, we have clean hands. If we refrain from forbidden thoughts, we have pure hearts. Those who would ascend and stand in the ultimate holy place must have both.<br><br>In the second chapter of Romans, the Apostle Paul teaches to the same effect. He explains that God will "judge the secrets of men" (Romans 2:16) "according to truth" (Romans 2:2). He contrasts the position of the Gentiles who do not have the Mosaic law but by their actions "shew the work of the law written in their hearts" (Romans 2:15) with those Jews who preach the law and then do not practice it. The Apostle Paul then concludes with these profound truths:<br><br><i>For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:</i><br><br><i>But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.</i>[Romans 2:28–29]<br><br>What do these teachings about feelings and desires mean for each of us?<br><br>Are we sure to be guiltless under the law of God if we merely refrain from evil acts? What if we entertain evil thoughts and desires?<br><br>Will hateful feelings go unnoticed in the day of judgment? Will envy? Will covetousness?<br><br>Are we guiltless if we engage in business practices that are intended to deceive, even though they involve no act that is punishable by law?<br><br>Are we guiltless under the law of God just because the law of man provides no legal remedy for our victim?<br><br>Are we eligible for blessings if we seem to seek the things of God, such as by preaching or publishing the message of the gospel, but do so to obtain riches or honor rather than with an eye single to his glory?<br><br>Our answers to such questions illustrate what we might call the bad news, that we can sin without overt acts, merely by our feelings and the desires of our hearts.<br><br>There is also good news. Under the law of God, we can be rewarded for righteousness even where we are unable to perform the acts that are usually associated with such blessings.<br><h2><b>Blessings for Righteous Desires</b></h2><br>When someone genuinely wanted to do something for my father-in-law but was prevented by circumstances, he would say: "Thank you. I will take the good will for the deed." Similarly, I believe that our Father in Heaven will receive the true desires of our hearts as a substitute for actions that are genuinely impossible.<br><br>Here we see another contrast between the laws of God and the laws of men. It is entirely impractical to grant a<i>legal</i>advantage on the basis of an intent not translated into action. "I intended to sign that contract" or "We intended to get married" cannot stand as the equivalent of the act required by law. If the law were to give effect to intentions in lieu of specific acts, it would open the door for too much abuse, since the laws of man have no reliable means of determining our innermost thoughts.<br><br>In contrast, the<i>law of God</i>can reward a righteous desire because an omniscient God can discern it. As revealed through the prophet of this dispensation, God "is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart" (D&amp;amp;C 33:1). If a person refrains from a particular act because he is genuinely unable to perform it, but truly would if he could, our Heavenly Father will know this and can reward that person accordingly.<br><br>Perhaps the best scriptural illustration of this is King Benjamin's teaching about giving:<br><br><i>And again, I say unto the poor.</i>. .<i>all you who deny the beggar, because ye have not; I would that ye say in your hearts that: I give not because I have not, but if I had I would give.</i><br><br><i>And now, if ye say this in your hearts ye remain guiltless.</i>[Mosiah 4:24–25]<br><br>Paul described the same principle in his second letter to the Corinthians: "If there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not" (2 Corinthians 8:12).<br><br>President Harold B. Lee relied on these scriptures in another example:<br><br>[Women]<i>who have been denied the blessings of wifehood or motherhood in this life--who say in their heart, if I could have done, I would have done, or I would give if I had, but I cannot for I have not--the Lord will bless you as though you had done, and the world to come will compensate for those who desire in their hearts the righteous blessings that they were not able to have because of no fault of their own.</i>[Harold B. Lee,<i>Ye Are the Light of the World</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1974), p. 292]<br><br>The desires of our hearts will be an important consideration in the final judgment. Alma taught that God "granteth unto men according to their desire, whether it be unto death or unto life; . . . according to their wills, whether they be unto salvation or unto destruction. Yea, . . . he that knoweth good and evil, to him it is given according to his desires" (Alma 29:4–5).<br><br>That is a sobering teaching, but it is also a gratifying one. It means that when we have<i>done</i>all that we can, our<i>desires</i>will carry us the rest of the way. It also means that if our desires are right, we can be forgiven for the mistakes we will inevitably make as we try to carry those desires into effect. What a comfort for our feelings of inadequacy! As Alma said:<br><br><i>It is requisite with the justice of God that.</i>. .<i>if their works were good in this life, and the desires of their hearts were good, that they should also, at the last day, be restored unto that which is good.</i><br><br><i>If he hath repented of his sins, and desired righteousness until the end of his days, even so he shall be rewarded unto righteousness.</i>[Alma 41:3, 6]<br><br>Similarly, in this dispensation the Lord has revealed that he "will judge all men according to their works, according to the desire of their hearts" (D&amp;amp;C 137:9).<br><br>I caution against two possible misunderstandings: First, we must remember that desire is a substitute only when action is truly impossible. If we attempt to use impossibility of action as a cover for our lack of true desire and therefore do not do all that we can to perform the acts that have been commanded, we may deceive ourselves, but we will not deceive the Righteous Judge.<br><br>In order to serve as a substitute for action, desire cannot be superficial, impulsive, or temporary. It must be heartfelt, through and through. To be efficacious for blessings, the desires of our hearts must be so genuine that they can be called godly.<br><br>Second, we should not assume that the desires of our hearts can serve as a substitute for an ordinance of the gospel. Consider the words of the Lord in commanding two gospel ordinances: "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God" (John 3:5). And in respect to the three degrees in the celestial glory, modern revelation states, "In order to obtain the highest, a man must enter into this order of the priesthood [meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage]" (D&amp;amp;C 131:2). No exception is implied in these commands or authorized elsewhere in the scriptures.<br><br>In the justice and mercy of God, these rigid commands pertaining to essential ordinances are tempered by divine authorization to perform those ordinances by proxy for those who did not have them performed in this life. Thus, a person in the spirit world who so desires is credited with participating in the ordinance just as if he or she had done so personally. In this manner, through the loving service of living proxies, departed spirits are also rewarded for the desires of their hearts.<br><br>In summary, under the law of God we are accountable for our feelings and desires as well as our acts. Evil thoughts and desires will be punished. Acts that seem to be good bring blessings only when they are done with real and righteous intent. On the positive side, we will be blessed for the righteous desires of our hearts even though some outside circumstance has made it impossible for us to carry those desires into action.<br><br>To paraphrase Paul's teaching in Romans 2:29, he is a true Latter-day Saint who is one inwardly, whose conversion is that of the spirit, in the heart, whose praise is not of men for outward acts, but of God, for the inward desires of the heart.<br><br>May God bless us to understand this great principle and to act upon it. It challenges us. It comforts us. It is true.<br><br>God lives. Jesus Christ is his Son. He suffered and died for our sins, that through repentance, through good works, through the righteous desires of our hearts, and through compliance with all the laws and ordinances of the gospel, we may attain to the highest degree of glory in the celestial kingdom. That is the destiny of the children of God. Of that I bear testimony as I ask the blessings of our Heavenly Father upon each of us in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Dallin H.

<h1>You This Day Whom Ye Will Serve” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<i>And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.</i>[Joshua 24:15]<br><br>We've gathered tonight in a fireside. A fireside to me is a gathering around the hearth in an informal setting. Of course, that's difficult to stage with the numbers here in the Marriott Center. But still, I think a fireside should be less formal, not so preachy, and have, perhaps, more of an interchange between the one selected to speak and those in attendance.<br><br>I would like to try to make this more informal tonight, and see if I can respond to your needs. Therefore, I requested that the president of the BYU Seventh Stake, the host stake for tonight, select several students to participate with me. They held two panel discussions, one with the brethren and one with the sisters, to elicit issues that some of you may also be wrestling with. They prepared a long list of possible subjects for discussion tonight. The list was sent to me. I selected five for discussion in this setting. The persons who submitted the questions selected have been requested to participate here with me tonight. They will come forward and ask me their question, and I will attempt to answer it.<br><br>The purpose of this approach is to draw closer to you and your needs. However, I freely admit that I have had the questions beforehand, and have prepared a response. With such a distinguished and talented group as attends Brigham Young University, I would not want to be embarrassed by questions that I could not answer.<br><h2><b>What Is Most Important?</b></h2><br>Let's have question number one. What is your name, young lady?<br><br><i>"Terry Warren.</i>"<br><br>Would you like to ask me the question?<br><br><i>"What is most important for me now--school, work, dating, church callings, parents, or roommates? How can I effectively deal with the pressures of these various responsibilities?"</i><br><br>Well, Terry, let's look in the scriptures. Could you turn to Ecclesiastes and read the first part of chapter 3 for me?<br><br><i>To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:</i><br><br><i>A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted.</i>[Ecclesiastes 3:1–2]<br><br>From the scriptures it seems that in setting our priorities there must be a time to rejoice, to have the proper, positive attitude about the things we are required to do, and not get ourselves burdened down with the pressures of life.<br><br>Second, there must be a time to do good, to be of service, to not think of only ourselves, or be selfish in that which we seek to accomplish. We should be willing to share our time and our talents with others.<br><br>Now, Terry, I don't want to shock you, but this is not the most difficult time of your life for making decisions on how to use your time, although it may seem so. In fact, I predict that from here on through your schooling and throughout your life, you will always be facing the problem of how to use your time to the best advantage, while feeling pushed sometimes to the limit.<br><br>There will always be those pressures about spending more time at home and doing the things that are required there to keep it in order and a haven of peace and rest, a place of training, of understanding, and of growing.<br><br>There will always be the pressures of your profession with never enough time to do everything you would like to do. There will be church callings, community service, compassionate service, and all the rest of the responsibilities that will add burdens and great opportunities to your life.<br><br>Could I counsel you in just two areas? First, in time management. I know of no successful managers of time who do not have a specific plan of how they should use the period of life the Lord has given to them. It is essential that you periodically list the major categories involved in your good use of time--your classes, your studies, your church assignments, recreation, meditation, etc. Then carefully calendar a portion of each day or week to satisfy your needs. Attempt to keep your life in balance.<br><br>Then, after the actual performance is over, evaluate and see how successful you were in utilizing your time. Actual performance will form the base for the next planning period. You ought to learn how to use your time while you are in school. It could be one of the major contributions you can make to your life. The second is managing the financial resources our Father in Heaven has blessed you with. Schooling is becoming more expensive each year. I know many of you are laboring under great pressures in order to complete your education. There is always the temptation to borrow to relieve that burden. Sometimes that may be necessary.<br><br>I learned a great lesson early in my business career. I was called into my boss's office one day. He wanted to impress upon me, his financial manager, a good lesson in the use of money. He asked me to give him a definition of interest. Of course, I pulled one out of a textbook I had used in business training. He said, "Oh, no, no, no. This is the one I want you to remember. 'Them's that understands it, receives it; them's that don't, pays it.' "<br><br>This was one of the great lessons of my life. I have tried to stay out of debt as much as humanly possible. It is a lot more fun to earn interest than to pay it. Develop a positive attitude toward life. Do not let things get you down or become overburdened with meaningless responsibility. Learn how to manage your time and your resources to keep yourself out of trouble. Good planning is the key.<br><h2><b>"Nor Do Anything Like Unto It"</b></h2><br>All right, question number two. Who has that one?<br><br><i>"Edene Edwards."</i><br><br>It's great to have you here. Will you recite your question for me?<br><br><i>"Many young men and women want to become physically involved while dating, but then want to marry someone who has not been. What do you think of this?"</i><br><br>Well, that's a very interesting question. I'm glad you added that last part--"they want to marry someone who has not been." Isn't that the key? I'm always surprised that this question keeps coming up. Oh, how I wish a real conversion would take place in the hearts of you great young people, sufficient to know that it is impossible to beat the Lord's system. Trying to live our lives outside the system never has worked, and it never will work. Certainly nothing makes a priesthood leader feel more sorrow than hearing confessions regarding moral matters. At the same time he is elated that he can now counsel and help that person who has come to the point of confession.<br><br>The prophets of all ages have warned us against becoming too physically involved outside of marriage. Perhaps we could just read a couple of those warnings. Why don't we turn to Alma 39:5.<br><br><i>Know ye not, my son, that these things are an abomination in the sight of the Lord; yea, most abominable above all sins save it be the shedding of innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost?</i><br><br>The Lord puts these transgressions pretty high on his list of terrible sins to commit. Now let's read one from the Doctrine and Covenants.<br><br><i>Wherefore, I give unto them a commandment, saying thus: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy might, mind, and strength; and in the name of Jesus Christ thou shalt serve him.</i><br><br><i>Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. Thou shalt not steal; neither commit adultery, nor kill, nor do anything like unto it.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 59:5–6]<br><br>I like that last statement, "nor do anything like unto it." Sometimes I think we demonstrate our mortal immaturity by attempting to test God to see how close we can come to the line where "like unto it" begins. The only safe answer is to stay out of the gray area. Leave a wide, safe margin between a little good-night peck on the cheek and the violation of the Lord's law. A moment of self-gratification can lead to a lifetime of suffering with your conscience. I have always been grateful my daughters selected young men who had been taught by parents not to spend time alone with a girl in a parked car, or alone in an apartment. And I have appreciated having daughters and a son who have always exhibited high moral standards.<br><br>I was staying in the home of a stake president once when I was reorganizing a stake. His wife seemed to be distraught and upset. I could tell she had something to talk to me about, and finally I arranged to stay at the breakfast table a little longer than her husband, who left the room to prepare to leave for meetings. With tears streaming down her face, she told of an act of indiscretion that occurred before she was married that she had lived with all her married life.<br><br>She married a good husband, worthy to be a stake president, and she told how this sin had tormented her during all those years. How relieved she was to finally have the courage to confess. The more you get involved in the gospel, the more these sins of the past will torment your soul, until you absolve them with a priesthood leader.<br><br>The Savior declared:<br><br><i>That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.</i><br><br><i>For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,</i><br><br><i>Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:</i><br><br><i>All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.</i>[Mark 7:20–23]<br><br>The best protection is to keep that which is within you clean and pure. Stay away from movies, TV programs, music, books, and magazines that will only defile the minds of men and women. If you've had a problem, get it cleared up now with your priesthood leader. The faster this is accomplished, the greater will be your joy in this life, and in the life to come.<br><h2><b>Keeping the Sabbath Day Holy</b></h2><br>Question number three. How are you, young man?<br><br><i>"Fine, thank you. "</i><br><br>What is your name?<br><br><i>"Milan Detweiler."</i><br><br>What is your question?<br><br><i>"My question is: How do I keep the Sabbath day holy? Is it all right to study? What else can I do?"</i><br><br>Well, the Lord has not left us in the dark concerning the Sabbath day. In fact, the scriptures are filled with instructions on Sabbath-day observance. Let's read just a few tonight to see what the Lord has revealed through his prophets, in all ages of time, concerning this most important day in the week.<br><br>Let's first look at Genesis 2:2–3.<br><br><i>And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.</i><br><br><i>And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.</i><br><br>Six days of labor are to be followed by a day of rest. It seems to me that the judge should be how we come out of bed on Monday morning. If you just crawl out, feeling tired and weary from a heavy weekend, probably the Sabbath-day observance has not been appropriate. You see, I believe you should come up out of those covers on Monday morning more refreshed, more alive, and more enthused than on any other day of the week. If this is not the case, we had better examine what we are doing on the Sabbath day. Test yourself tomorrow morning and see how you come out of bed.<br><br>Now let's try another one, Exodus 20:8.<br><br><i>Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.</i><br><br>It appears that the Lord expects us to do more than just rest on this day. He expects us to keep it holy. "Holy," according to Webster, is "to set apart to the service of God, to be spiritually pure." This definition indicates that on this special day we are to keep our lives in harmony with the Lord--a day set apart for service, adoration, and reverence to him.<br><br>He has some specific things we should do on the Sabbath. We should attend our meetings and offer up the Lord's sacraments on his holy day. This puts us in the proper frame of mind for our activities on the Sabbath.<br><br>I think one of the best ways to control Sabbath-day activities is to dress the part. We always seem to act according to the way we are dressed. If we go around in jeans and dungarees, I think the level of our Sabbath-day observance will depreciate to the level of the way we dress. But if we dress properly--and that doesn't mean having to wear a tie or your Sunday suit all day, but be presentable--it seems to control our activities and causes us to stay in the right frame of mind.<br><br>Now let's turn to the sixth chapter of Luke. Here we have an example of the Savior teaching in the synagogues. The scribes and the Pharisees were attempting to catch him, to see if he would heal on the Sabbath day. Jesus, after healing a man, and knowing their thoughts, stood forth and said this:<br><br><i>I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it?</i>[Luke 6:9]<br><br>The Savior seems to think it is all right for us to do a good turn on the Sabbath day--to lift a heart, to help a spirit, to make life more interesting and pleasant for someone in need. You know, I really believe there are those here at Brigham Young University who could stand a little encouragement, a little support, and a little attention, to make their Sabbath day and the rest of their week more pleasant. I think it would be all right for us on the Sabbath day to visit and encourage and lift spirits that need special attention.<br><br>The Sabbath day is to be different from the other six days. If we have had a week loaded with studies, we would want a change on the Sabbath. But if it has been a week with the proper mixture of activity and study, then it could be very beneficial to spend some of this special day in study and preparation on a suitable subject--in keeping with the Sabbath day.<br><br>Let's try another one, Mark 2:27.<br><br><i>And be said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath.</i><br><br>Thank goodness the Lord recognizes the differences in each of us, and has not prescribed every jot and tittle that we are to follow in keeping his day holy. As individuals differ, so our Sabbath-day observance will differ. We should do those things that will be of benefit to us, for our rest, for our relaxation, and for our rejuvenation, after we accomplish what the Lord has prescribed for us in attending our meetings and being faithful in our Sabbath-day observance.<br><h2><b>The Role of Women in the Church</b></h2><br>Question number four. How are you, young lady?<br><br><i>"Just fine, thanks."</i><br><br>What is your name?<br><br><i>"Lisa Long."</i><br><br>Well, it's good to have you with us. What is your question?<br><br><i>"Schooling prepares one for a career. Is that an appropriate course for an LDS mother?"</i><br><br>You're concerned, of course, with the role of women in the Church. President Kimball has admonished us:<br><br><i>Much of the major growth that is coming to the Church in the last days will come because many of the good women of the world (in whom there is often such an inner sense of spirituality will be drawn to the Church in large numbers. This will happen to the degree that the women of the Church reflect righteousness and articulateness in their lives and to the degree that the women of the Church are seen as distinct and different--in happy ways from the women of the world.</i>[<i>TSWK,</i>pp. 322–23]<br><br>It is interesting to me that the prophet counseled us to be righteous and articulate. I don't know how you can be articulate without being educated and prepared for the world in which you live.<br><br>Of course the role of women is a special role--a creative role--the power to bring forth new life and to have more influence on that new life than anyone else upon the earth. A child receives most of its security, its ability to love, and much of its personality from the mother, more than from anyone else. During those short, precious, first years of a child's life, I don't think any of us would want to entrust the development of our child, if we could possibly prevent it, to anyone other than its mother. This is a task that requires education. I think we are reaping a whirlwind of problems with children being left unattended because mothers are away from home. During that period of your life, I would think you would want to be centered and directed toward the rearing of your children, enjoying every precious moment of their growth and development. Oh, how fast they grow up!<br><br>During the other periods of your life you may be much more free to use the education and development you have received from your years of training in school. I see no conflict--in fact, it is encouraged that a woman prepare for a career. My wife is a professional in her field. Even though she does not use it to earn a living at the present time, she uses her education in many different ways for compassionate service. She used her career to support herself earlier in her life, and I think she has always felt more secure because of the training she received from years of study and preparation at the college level.<br><br>I think it is a very appropriate course and a needed course for a woman to prepare herself for the world in which she lives today. Many women find themselves providing for their families because of a husband's death, or find themselves the sole provider because of divorce. How much better to try to enter the work force educated and prepared than to have to accept whatever is available at a much lower salary with much less fulfillment all around.<br><br>I admire the contribution that women are making in the world. Their sensitivity is most unique, and most needed. If you are educated and prepared, so much greater will be your contribution in a troubled world in the years ahead. May the Lord bless you good sisters, that you may go forward and seek this education--and do all that you desire to do with it.<br><h2><b>Never Compromise Your Principles</b></h2><br>All right, the fifth question. How are you, young man?<br><br><i>"Never better."</i><br><br>Good. I'm glad<i>you</i>feel that way. It seems a little hot up here to me. What is your name?<br><br><i>"Guy Anthony Hesketh."</i><br><br>All right, what's your question?<br><br><i>"My question is: How do I adjust to the world after my mission? Do I lower my standards to be accepted?"</i><br><br>Well, I know from personal experience that one of the most difficult adjustments you have to make in life is to return from a position in the mission field, where you live so close to the Lord, to a position back in the world. My own experience was extreme. I had a month between my release as a missionary and my enlistment as a member of the U.S. Marine Corps. The contrast was overwhelming. But I joined the Marine Corps at a most interesting time. Just a few months before they had recruited a Mormon Battalion of Marines. I followed them into boot camp. The reputation they had made during their period of basic training was most unique. To be a Mormon following that great group was a mark of distinction.<br><br>As the years of service progressed, I noticed how apparent those who lived their religion were among their buddies in the service. Those who stooped to the level of the world could not stop the spiral down, and I think they returned home with a heavy heart and a very concerned conscience. But those who were able to overcome, to live as they should, were unique in the service, and were noticed and used. They returned home with greater joy, satisfaction, and peace of mind.<br><br>I have found the same thing true as I have ventured out into the world. As a young businessman, it was only proper in making good contacts to attend social hours before dinners. I was required by my employment to do so. I decided that when attending these affairs, I would not have a glass in my hand that could be interpreted as being anything other than nonalcoholic. The first few times I refused to have anything. I just stood, trying to find a place to put my hands conveniently. Peanuts and pretzels seemed to help.<br><br>Then a most remarkable thing occurred. After a few of the social hours, I noticed a quart of milk being brought in and put among the other bottles of spirits. Of course no one could draw the wrong inference from a glass of milk. Then, as the months progressed, I noticed they had to bring out two quarts as more and more of the men around held a glass of milk in their hands. This uniqueness became an asset. I am a living witness to you that living your religion, and staying as close to the Lord as you possibly can through all the times of your life, even though you are kidded and laughed at once in a while, is the greatest asset you can have. There is an inner sense of respect that develops for you that will help you in anything you attempt to accomplish.<br><br>What success I had in business can be attributed more to the uniqueness that the gospel has given to me than to any of the training provided in schools, or experience in business. There seems to develop a trust in one who is willing to stand up for what he believes in that will stand him in good stead in his accomplishments in life.<br><br>Young man, never compromise your principles. Hold to your core of values--but that doesn't mean you should wear your religion around on your coat sleeves and hit everyone in the eye with it the minute you see them. You set the example by the way you live, and that light will open opportunities to you that could come in no other way.<br><br>I want to thank you, you great, young people who have assisted me tonight. We hope the questions and general answers have been of some assistance to each of you. I think each of us has found that this life is full of questions. I believe we have also found that there are no complete answers to all of them. This adds to my gratitude for the gift of the gospel of our Lord and Savior.<br><br>From the very beginning the Lord has revealed to us the purpose for which we have been sent to earth. As Alma explained:<br><br><i>Now we see that Adam did fall by the partaking of the forbidden fruit, according to the word of God;</i><br><br><i>And thus we see, that by his fall, all mankind became a lost and fallen people.</i><br><br><i>And we see that death comes upon mankind, yea, the death which bas been spoken of by Amulek, which is the temporal death; nevertheless there was a space granted unto man in which be might repent; therefore this life became a probationary state; a time to prepare to meet God; a time to prepare for that endless state which has been spoken of by us, which is after the resurrection of the dead.</i>[Alma 12:22, 24]<br><br>We are not supposed to know all things in this life. The Lord has left questions to be answered and, oh, what an abundance of truth he's given to us to lead, guide, and direct us here on this earth. Let's learn that truth. Stay close to it. Be obedient to the will of the Lord.<br><br>"Choose you this day whom ye will serve. . . ." I've made that decision, to serve the Lord with all of my might, power, and zeal. Why? Because it is the only direction that will give us true happiness, true understanding, true joy in this life, and the greatest hope in the life to come. May the Lord bless each of us that in our individual pursuits to find answers to the challenging questions of life we will receive satisfaction and direction from the word of the Lord as it has been revealed to us through his holy prophets.<br><br>This is his work in which we are engaged. It is true, it is right, it is proven. It has stood the test of time. The greatest joy that comes is through the observance and following of the way of the Lord. God lives. Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world. He has revealed his will through his prophets. His church is established here today. Let's keep our lives in harmony with its teachings and enjoy the fruits of the gospel in this life and in the world to come. This is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>L.

<br>
I am grateful, brothers and sisters, to represent the board of trustees at this devotional service and dedication, and I think it is fitting that it be a devotional service in which this building is dedicated. I have three sons and a son-in-law who have graduated in the College of Engineering and Technology, so we're very well represented. And, we have a future here, too, as I will mention in a moment or two.<br><br>I love Roland A. Crabtree. I say that and at once tell you that I never met him. If I did, I do not remember it. That in itself will support a point I wish to make later.<br><br>No building on this campus is more honored by the name it bears than the Crabtree Technology Building. I say<i>that</i>knowing full well for whom other buildings are named--among them presidents and prophets and apostles.<br><br>I have the conviction that were they here to speak for themselves, they would join me in that expression and count him a man in whose presence they would feel trusting and comfortable. Surely one of them would describe him as the salt of the earth.<br><br>Now if you suppose that his gift of several millions of dollars is the source of my admiration, you are in error. That gift, while greatly appreciated, in one way is really a trivial incident in all of this and almost gets in the way of what I hope to teach you.<br><br>I shall try to explain my feeling for Brother Crabtree by presenting three very brief insights. If you cannot understand my feelings thereafter, I doubt if a long personal interview would help.<br><h2><b>Insight Number One</b></h2><br>When he was thirty years old, Roland Crabtree was sprawled under an army truck in his little garage. A Cadillac pulled in, and the driver asked if the boss was around. "I hollered out that I'd be through in a minute," said Brother Crabtree. The customer responded politely, "Take your time, I just want to talk to you about a job."<br><br>The car had trouble with the left rear wheel. Several other garages had refused help. Brother Crabtree fixed the wheel. It took three and a half hours and nine dollars worth of parts. He charged him eighteen dollars. The man gave Brother Crabtree a thousand dollars and told him to keep the change. He refused; he said there wasn't that much to it.<br><h2><b>Insight Number Two</b></h2><br>In 1982 Brother Crabtree had a heart attack. Open-heart surgery followed--five bypasses! A week after he was out of the hospital he insisted that his wife drive him out to the project. When she wasn't looking, he climbed aboard a D-8 Caterpillar tractor and took off through the trees. He was gone for forty-five frantic minutes. He returned smiling and said everything seemed to be in place.<br><h2><b>Insight Number Three</b></h2><br>At the time of his death, Brother Crabtree was president of a special M.I.A. program for mentally handicapped people.<br><br>In order to put that third insight into proper perspective, I should tell you of a priesthood meeting that was held a hundred years ago. The meeting was held in connection with the reorganization of a ward. One Danish brother stood up in the meeting and said, "Vat vee need for da bishop is a man who doesn't vant to be bishop, and I's here to tell you that I don't vant to be bishop. "<br><h2><b>The Salt of the Earth</b></h2><br>I said I had never met Brother Crabtree. Perhaps I spoke at a conference in his stake, but he was not the stake president who met me. No doubt he was sitting with Sister Crabtree two-thirds of the way back in the middle, each with an arm around one of their handicapped children.<br><br>I love Brother Crabtree's name. It fits as perfectly as if a novelist had created a character and then afterward selected a name for him.<br><br>I love Brother Crabtree because he renews our faith in the rank and file of the Church. He generously funded a building, and that is deeply appreciated. But more than that, he is a symbol. He is the image of all of the other ordinary Latter-day Saints who love the Lord, accept his calls, pay their tithes, and live the gospel. Their tithes and offerings, too, are in the new building. Each of them is quite as worthy to have a building named after them as Brother Crabtree would be embarrassed by having one named after him.<br><br>Brother Crabtree reminds us that while there are problems in the world, and one or two may cause great distress, there is that great body of stalwarts ever with us.<br><br>In ancient Israel, Elijah the prophet, in great discouragement, cried out to the Lord,<br><br><i>The children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets;</i>. . .<i>and I, even I only, am left.</i>[1 Kings 19:10]<br><br>Elijah was commanded to "Go forth, and stand upon the mount. . . . A great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks" (1 Kings 19:11). After the wind came an earthquake and then a fire. But the Lord was not in the wind, nor in the earthquake, nor in the fire--but "after the fire a still small voice" (1 Kings 19:12). And Elijah was comforted. The Lord said, "Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal" (1 Kings 19:18).<br><br>There are ten thousand, yea, hundreds of thousands of Roland and Dora Mae Crabtrees who love the Lord.<br><br>Since I didn't really know Brother Crabtree, someone may caution that I might get carried away in my praise for him only to discover later that he had some personal imperfections. Oh, I am very positive that he did. I don't know what they were, nor do I care. We have had enough and to spare of looking for imperfections.<br><br>And then, in this day--today, this moment in Church history--I love Brother Crabtree because he stands as a counterpoint to some of the things that recently have come on stage.<br><br>In the past few days, the curtain has gone up to reveal a terrible tragedy. In this drama, someone, for some reason, has taken two lives. The victims, and perhaps the villain, are members of the Church.<br><br>The effect of all of this is a landslide of unfavorable publicity in the news across the world, and the name of the Church appears with innuendos and false assertions which challenge the very foundation of the Church.<br><br>These tragic events are cast in such a light by the media that the faith of some is being challenged, and of a few, beyond the breaking point. That is a tragedy in itself. A few are cast in starring roles in this heartbreaking tragedy. We may not know until the final scene is worked out who will be unveiled as the villain. Until then, as always, we support the forces of law and order, and due process. We lend our encouragement to them.<br><br>There is a great lesson to be drawn from this. How fitting it is, how refreshing it is in the midst of all of this, to pay honor to Roland and Dora Mae Crabtree. For in them we have our hero and our heroine. They walk on the stage to remind us of all that is right with the Church. Rather, I think this hero of ours rumbles into view at the controls of a piece of heavy construction equipment.<br><br>I remember the incident when Elisha's servant rose early and found<br><br><i>an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And</i>[he]<i>said unto</i>[Elijah],<i>Alas, my master! how shall we do?</i><br><br><i>And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.</i><br><br>. . .<i>And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire.</i>[2 Kings 6:15–17]<br><br>Well, in this case, if we can't see chariots, which are not used today, maybe front-end loaders will do where we have the "salt of the earth" represented at a time of great stress and difficulty.<br><h2><b>These Stalwart Heroes</b></h2><br>Now I want to say one or two things about training and technology and its place at the university and in the Church. You will see the building. It is regarded already as one of, if not the finest of, its type anywhere in this country, perhaps in the world.<br><br>In order to show you the importance the board of trustees places on technical skills, I will tell you this. Several years ago the administration of the university brought to the board of education a reorganization of the colleges. Some colleges were to be renamed.<br><br>One proposed name given was the College of Engineering Science. It was rejected by the board. The board insisted that the words "and Technology" be added to the name. The college therefore bears the name the College of Engineering Science and Technology. That was done to emphasize to the administration of the university that we are not to neglect the practical work-a-day subjects, nor are we to ignore those who earn their bread by the sweat of their brow and by skilled hands and trained minds.<br><br>That firm endorsement of technical education at Brigham Young University applies in full measure to young men and women attending the Utah Technical College here on the Orem campus, or in Salt Lake City, and all of the other such schools across the world.<br><br>I mentioned that we have a son-in-law and three sons who graduated from this college. And there is another coming along. Last winter, our sixteen-year-old found in the neighborhood, under a pile of snow, a 1948 Ford tractor--sort of. He asked if he could buy it. It had stood, I think, for fifteen years without being used. It was rusted almost away. But he saw something there, and I saw something in his seeing something there.<br><br>So, with another old tractor, we dragged it through the snowdrifts home to the shop and later to the high school shop. There, a shop teacher and our son worked evening after evening to restore this tractor. Every few days it came again! "Dad, I found out that we've got to buy this or that."<br><br>Strangely enough, he could find it. He got his driver's license midway, and so off to Heber City he was for this part or somewhere else for that part. I, too, went with him to more than one city looking through junkyards for old tractor parts.<br><br>Then, as the bills mounted, someone made the observation that that tractor was a very expensive investment--perhaps a mistake. But I thought he made the mistake. He thought we were putting together a tractor. I thought we were putting together a boy. Somewhere in the middle of this, it wouldn't work, and the shop teacher couldn't find the problem. So we made a call to Max Peterson, eighty-four, long since retired, who spent his life with tractors. He showed up one evening, pointed out this and that to help my son, and then we were off again.<br><br>There is something significant and powerful and safe for this Church in the hundreds of thousands of Roland and Dora Mae Crabtrees who make their living by the skill that is in their hands and by what they have in their minds. I say again that no building on this campus is more honored by the name it bears than the Roland Crabtree Technology Building.<br><br>And I count it an honor to join with you, if you will join with me, and I will offer the dedicatory prayer.<br><h2><b>Dedicatory Prayer</b></h2><br>Our Holy Father in Heaven, we have assembled here on this glorious October morning for the dedication of a building on the campus of Brigham Young University, the Crabtree Technology Building. It is a beautiful building and a new building. It has been constructed using all of the engineering knowledge and technology of the past. Into it has been built, insofar as it can be built, the prophetic pattern that will accommodate it to the use of things that are yet unknown and are as yet undiscovered.<br><br>We have walked through the halls of that building and have seen the young men and women sitting at the consoles of computers, standing before lathes, standing before other equipment, much of it remarkably expensive. Virtually all of it has come as gifts from generous individuals and generous corporations who themselves are making an investment, not in technology, not in the advancement of civilization in the sense that we can build better things, but an investment in young men and women, in boys and girls--this, that there might march through this college, as through the other colleges here, young men and women who themselves will be the salt of the earth. And then when the onslaught comes upon thy Church, as it has in recent years, there will be those stalwarts. We will know that "they that be with us are more than they that be with them." And<i>our</i>eyes will be opened, and<i>we</i>will see upon the mountain the chariots of fire.<br><br>Now we dedicate this building unto thee, our Holy Father, for that sacred purpose. We count it fitting and in our theology and doctrine not at all unusual to dedicate a building for technology in a devotional service, within the bounds of prayer. For the Lord hath told us that there is no real difference between that which is temporal and that which is spiritual if our eyes can be opened.<br><br>We ask thee, our Holy Father, to protect that building. Protect all of the elements of it so that it will not be brought into disgrace by any teaching that might be false. Let no act of nature disturb or destroy it, that thousands and tens of thousands of young people may enter there to be taught and look into the great patterns of computer technology, and see in a sense, infinity. May they look through mathematics and through the other research patterns to realms where there are no bounds, where there are no measurements, and yet know that when the limits there are reached, beyond that are the infinite doctrines and ordinances of the gospel.<br><br>We call for thy blessings upon the Crabtree family, and bless them for being them, and for being as<i>ordinary</i>as they are and as<i>extraordinary</i>as they are. Bless Sister Crabtree and the family and the memory of Roland A. Crabtree.<br><br>And now, by the authority of the Holy Priesthood in us vested, and in the name of Jesus Christ, we invoke that authority, that consummate authority, to the dedication and blessing of this building to be a signal and integral part of this campus so that young people may be taught, that they might live the gospel, and ultimately live in such a way that they might return unto thee, our Holy Father. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Boyd K. Packer was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 29 October 1985.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<br>
It is such an honor for me to be with you today--you who have come to this campus seeking a better life, a life of self-improvement. I'm sure there are many of you who have come with much sacrifice, which, in and of itself, is part of that better life.<br><h2><b>Life's Most Important Decisions</b></h2><br>At this time in your life, you enjoy a wide variety of activities--sometimes too many all at once. In addition to class attendance and study time, many of you have jobs. There are important social activities and service groups, athletic and physical fitness activities--the list goes on. At the same time you have church callings and family obligations. That weekly letter-writing time comes all too often, and there is no one to help you with the washing or ironing when you're in a bind. There are scripture study and journal writing. Most of you get very little sleep and are relatively new at juggling such varied and demanding schedules.<br><br>Yet it is interesting to me that some of life's most important decisions--Whom will I marry? What will be my life's work? What and where shall I study? and Where will I live?--are all made between the ages of seventeen and twenty-four.<br><br>That we have choices at all is a wonderful gift to us and a fundamental part of our Heavenly Father's plan enabling us to prove ourselves.<br><br>Abraham 3:25 states: "We will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them."<br><br>And in Helaman 14, verses 30 and 31, we read:<i>"</i>For behold, God hath given unto you a knowledge and he hath made you free. He hath given unto you that ye might know good from evil."<br><br>Today I would like to share a story with you. Kieth Merrill, a filmmaker and Academy Award winner, tells this story about his youth.<br><br><i>When I was a young man I lived in a small community close to the mountains. I was a lifeguard and did lots of swimming.</i>. . .<i>We went swimming at a place called East Canyon, a beautiful man-made reservoir. The dam is in a narrow neck of the canyon between sheer rock walls.</i><br><br><i>None of us had boats, so we couldn't water ski, but we would do what we called cliff diving. We'd climb up those rocks and dive into the reservoir. We'd always wear tennis shoes because the rocks were so sharp.</i>. . .<br><br><i>After we'd been there several times and pretty well knew the rocks, cliffs, and the water depth, two or three of us hard-core East Canyon divers got into the inevitable teenage contest of raw courage. One guy climbed up to where we always dove from and yelled down, "Hey! I'll bet I dare dive higher than anybody here!"</i><br><br><i>"Ah, go on!"</i><br><br><i>So he climbed up to the top of the dam. The dam was about 50 feet off the water. Diving into the air he arched into the water, and like a bunch of sheep we crawled up the rocks, out onto the dam, and all of us dove off.</i>. . .<br><br><i>Well, that didn't satisfy my friend, and so he said, "All right, I'll do one better!" He climbed 60 feet up the side of the cliff. And not wanting to be outdone, I climbed up by him. After all, everyone was looking at me. I had a great suntan, and I was sure everyone expected me to do what he was doing. He swallowed hard, buried his fear, and from trembling knees arched his back, and floated through 60 feet of air into the water.</i><br><br><i>I was grateful nobody was watching me as I prepared for my dive. When he'd cleared and seemed to be all right, I took courage, and made my dive. By now the other members of our diving contest had backed down, figuring it was a little high. But not my friend. He climbed on up to about 70 feet and once more prepared to dive. From below I could barely see him. Seventy feet is a very long way up on the rocks. I said to myself, "I hope he doesn't do it because if</i>he<i>does it, then obviously</i>I've<i>got to do it, and I really don't want to.</i>"<i>About then I saw a pink body float through the air and splash into the water not far from me. He came up laughing, rubbing his shoulders and his eyes, and said, "Well, Merrill, are you going to do it?"</i><br><br><i>"Of course, I'm going to do it!" Everybody on the shore said, "Yeah, of course he's going to do it!"</i><br><br><i>And so I swam back to the shore and climbed up the rocks. I knew I only had the courage for one more jump.</i>. . .<br><br><i>I scrambled up 80 feet to the very top of the cliff. As I turned around and looked down, I saw that the cliffs were back away from the water at that height. I had two challenges: to fall 80 feet and to get enough clearance to avoid hitting the rocks at the bottom. Everybody was egging me on in a negative way. "You're chicken, you're chicken!"</i><br><br><i>I stood there all alone, everybody waiting down below. The water was so far away it looked like crinkled tinfoil in the sun. I was just terrified, I was committed, but I had not even based my decision on what I wanted to do or what I felt was right. I had based it on about a half dozen guys whose names I don't even remember who were yelling, "Hey, chicken, are you going to do it?"</i><br><br><i>I realized that in order to make the jump I would have to run a distance to get enough momentum to carry me over the rocks below. So I backed up and ran as hard as I could toward the edge. I found the mark I had carefully laid at the edge of the rock and sprang out into space. I don't know how long it takes to fall 80 feet, but for me it took about a week. On the way down I remembered distinctly how my parents and teachers had taught me to be careful when making decisions because I could kill myself with a wrong one. I said to myself, "You have done it; you have killed yourself, because when you hit the water you'll be going so fast that it might as well be concrete.</i>"<i>And when I hit the water, I was sure it was concrete. I don't know how far down you go when you jump from 80 feet, but I'll tell you, I was a grateful lad when my head finally popped above water. I took a quick inventory to make sure that the throbbing pain in my right thigh didn't designate the loss of anything important.</i><br><br><i>Well, why did I jump? Did I prove myself to the guys? You think they cared? You think they're sitting at home tonight saying, "Remember old Merrill, brave old Merrill, jumping off the.</i>. . ."<i>They don't even remember! They don't care! But for me that moment was as important as my life. I made what could have easily been a</i>fatal<i>decision. Through the grace of a very patient Heavenly Father I wasn't killed. I didn't land on the rocks; I missed by only a few feet. I didn't drown, and I didn't have a concussion or a number of other things that could easily have happened because of such a stupid decision.</i><br><br><i>I was subjected to pressure that was hard to withstand, the pressure of friends expecting things of me that I didn't want to do because I knew better. But I yielded to the pressure. I was living in the world, and at that moment I was of the world because I was not in control of myself. I was not making decisions about my own life.</i>[Kieth Merrill, "Deciding About Decisions,"<i>New Era,</i>June 1976, pp. 12–13]<br><br>I heard Kieth Merrill's story and immediately thought of the Savior's strength and courage in decision making when he was tempted after his forty-day fast in the wilderness. It seems as if the three types of temptations thrust upon the Savior occurred in the Kieth Merrill story, as well as in Luke 4:3–4: "If thou be the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread. . . . Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God."<br><br><i>Appetite</i>--physical prowess: "Everyone's looking at me." "I had a great suntan." "If thou be the Son of God." From Luke 4:4–8:<br><br><i>And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world.</i>. . .<br><br><i>And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee</i>. . . .<br><br><i>If thou</i>. . .<i>wilt worship me.</i>. . .<br><br><i>And Jesus answered</i>. . .<i>Get thee behind me, Satan, for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</i><br><br><i>Pride--</i>adulation of peers: "Of course he's going to do it." From Luke 4:9–12:<br><br><i>And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence:</i><br><br><i>For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee:</i>. . .<br><br><i>And Jesus answering said,</i>. . .<i>Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</i><br><br><i>Power--</i>you can do anything better than your friends: "I scrambled up eighty feet to the very top of the cliff."<br><br>Appetite, pride, power--common temptations for each of us.<br><br>We have to ask, "Why did Kieth Merrill do it?" He was terrified, and "had not even based [his] decision on what [he] wanted to do or felt was right."<br><br>Elder Dean Larsen said, "When we understand what is right and what is wrong, we are in a position to exercise our freedom in making choices. In so doing, we must stand accountable for our decisions, and we cannot escape the inevitable consequences of these choices" ("Self-Accountability and Human Progress,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1980, p. 76).<br><h2><b>Our Values in Life</b></h2><br>The world today presents a different set of values from that taught by the gospel of Jesus Christ. Eternal values never change while those of the world are transitory and are usually, or often, inconsistent with gospel standards.<br><br>The right and wrong of our decisions and actions should be consistently determined in light of the plan of salvation. There should be a standard of righteousness--this standard will enlighten and aid our decision process.<br><br>To understand that plan, take every opportunity to learn, to study, and to ponder the plan of salvation. Gain knowledge through personal and family scripture study, general conference talks, Sunday gospel worship and study, and religion classes.<br><br>Our values in life influence everything we do with our time, energy, resources, and the ways in which we interact with others. In short, they give direction to our life.<br><br>When Jesus suggested to the rich young ruler "Sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor" (Luke 18:22), it placed upon him an important decision of following either the Savior or the ways of the world. Because he was wealthy and valued money more than the treasures of heaven, he turned away "sorrowful." The young ruler had all the attributes necessary for eternal life, but one misplaced value turned his decision in a wrong direction.<br><br>James Russell Lowell wrote a beautiful, heartwarming poem that has become a classic of the ages. It is entitled<i>The Vision of Sir Launfal.</i>In it he tells the story of a man's search for the Holy Grail. The Holy Grail is supposedly the cup from which Christ drank at the Last Supper. Down through the span of time it has become lost, and Sir Launfal, in his lust and desire for recognition, seeks to retrieve it.<br><br>He sets out from his homeland in search of it. As he leaves the gates of the city, he passes a young man begging for alms, but the beggar is unnoticed by Sir Launfal in his zeal for his adventure.<br><br>Launfal spends a lifetime in his quest, only to return home, broken in spirit, penniless, and unsuccessful. As he enters the gates of the city, he again passes the beggar, who also has grown old with the passing of time.<br><br>But Launfal's experience has mellowed and humbled him, and where before he had not noticed the beggar, he now stops to help the old man lift his quivering hands to his mouth for a drink of water. He then notices within his grasp the Holy Grail, the cup for which he has searched a lifetime, and recognizes it has been within his reach all along.<br><h2><b>A Fork in the Road</b></h2><br>President Kimball states, "A dozen times a day we come to a fork in the road and must decide which way we will go. . . . It is important to get our ultimate objectives clearly in mind so that we do not become distracted at each fork in the road by the irrelevant questions: Which is the easier or more pleasant way? or, Which way are others going?" (<i>TSWK</i>p. 164).<br><br>Wasn't Kieth Merrill dependent on what others were doing and saying? Was that part of the temptation of pride?<br><br>Right decisions are easiest to make when we make them well in advance, having in mind our standard of righteousness. This saves a lot of anguish at the fork in the road, when we're tired and sorely tempted.<br><br>President Kimball said:<br><br><i>When I was young, I made up my mind unalterably that I would never taste tea, coffee, tobacco, or liquor. I found that this rigid determination saved me many times throughout my varied experiences. There were many occasions when I could have sipped or touched or sampled, but the unalterable determination firmly established gave me good reason and good strength to resist.</i><br><br>He went on:<br><br><i>The time to decide on a mission is long before it becomes a matter of choosing between a mission and an athletic scholarship. The time to decide on temple marriage is before one has become attached to a boyfriend or girl friend who does not share that objective. The time to decide on a policy of strict honesty is before the store clerk gives you too much change. The time to decide against using drugs is before a friend you like teases you for being afraid or pious. The time to decide that we will settle for nothing less than an opportunity to live eternally with our Father is now, so that every choice we make will be affected by our determination to let nothing interfere with attaining that ultimate goal.</i><br><br><i>Some people feel that decisions are really out of our hands, that we merely respond to circumstances without choice, like a rudderless ship that drifts at the mercy of the wind and waves. And I agree that there can come a time when we no longer have control over our destinies, but I believe that this is only after the cumulation of our own past decisions has left us helpless.</i>[<i>TSWK,</i>pp. 164–165]<br><br>Good advice! This brings us to ask: What do I value when I make decisions, especially the important ones, such as Whom should I marry? and Where shall I work?<br><br>The world asks, Should I marry at all? If so, do I really want to have children? Is my selection of an occupation one in which I want to succeed financially because of the love of money and all it represents or because of my desire to help others? There are a multitude of ways the world works on us to keep us from achieving our eternal purposes on earth.<br><br>Elder Royden G. Derrick contrasted our viewpoint with that of the world:<br><br><i>When everyone makes his own determination of what is right and what is wrong, we have</i>so<i>many different value systems that we could not possibly be one, as Jesus Christ commissioned us to be.</i><br><br><i>If you were playing in a basketball game, you would have to play by the rules or you would be taken out of the game.</i>. . .<i>How many people do we have throughout the world who attempt to make up their own rules, set their own value systems, and determine what is right and what is wrong regarding the true philosophy and gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ?</i>. . .<br><br>[Christ]<i>sets the standards and makes the rules by which we live. He established the true value system; and if we will conform thereto and assist in building his kingdom in his way, we will receive rewards far beyond our fondest hopes and dreams.</i>["The True Value System,"<i>Speeches of the Year, 1979</i>(Provo, UT: Brigham Young University Press, 1979), pp. 111, 114]<br><br>Every day we are confronted with circumstances and choices that test our personal values and require decisions that will either strengthen or weaken these values. We must evaluate influences on our values and goals. An aid to help us is found in Moroni 7:16–17:<br><br><i>For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for everything which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God.</i><br><br><i>But whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do evil, and believe not in Christ, and deny him, and serve not God, then ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of the devil; for after this manner doth the devil work, for he persuadeth no man to do good, no, not one; neither do his angels; neither do they who subject themselves unto him.</i><br><br>The crucial test of life is not between fame and obscurity or between wealth and poverty. The greatest decisions of life are between good and evil.<br><h2><b>"The Crown of Character"</b></h2><br>As we think about eternal values and wise choices, let me share an experience of some who exemplified a righteous standard.<br><br>Our son-in-law, who is a bishop in a student ward and also a teacher of English on this campus, was assigned a six-week seminar last summer. After talking it over, he and our daughter, Susan, decided she would stay at home with their five children and see that they all had their summer lessons and also care for their yard in his absence.<br><br>One hot summer afternoon she brought the children to Salt Lake City to see us. While visiting with us she mentioned that everything that could go wrong had gone wrong. Then, having shared her problems and having touched base with home, she felt she could go on. About an hour after she left, the phone rang. Susan was calling from her home in Provo. We could barely hear her teary, squeaky voice on the other end, and we thought perhaps there had been an accident. But she simply wanted us to know that the students in their ward, in spite of their busy schedules, had come over while she was in Salt Lake City and weeded their entire yard.<br><br>Commitment to righteousness is not just saying--it is doing!<br><br>From an unknown writer we read that<br><br><i>The greatest battle of life is fought within the silent chambers of the soul. A victory on the inside of a man's heart is worth a hundred conquests on the battlefields of life. To be master of yourself is the best guarantee that you will be in charge of the situation. Know thyself. The crown of character is self-control.</i><br><br>As we know and live the commandments, we will feel the whisperings of the Spirit helping us with the important decisions that must be made. From the Doctrine and Covenants we read:<br><br><i>Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not.</i><br><br><i>Blessed art thou for what thou hast done; for thou hast inquired of me, and behold, as often as thou hast inquired thou hast received instruction of my Spirit. If it had not been so, thou wouldst not have come to the place where thou art at this time.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 6:36, 14]<br><br>And remember:<br><br><i>I did enlighten thy mind;</i>. . .<br><br>. . .<i>If you desire a further witness, cast your mind upon the night that you cried unto me in your heart, that you might know concerning the truth of these things.</i><br><br><i>Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter? What greater witness can you have than from God?</i>[D&amp;amp;C 6:15, 22–23]<br><br>All of us will swim in our own personal "East Canyon Lake" or perch precariously on the steep cliffs of our lives. We can know that we are on sure footing, however difficult the circumstances are, if we have a value system based on a foundation of gospel principles.<br><br>My challenge to each of us is to seek Christ, listen to him, and obey his commandments. Our values and standard of righteousness will become clear, and our ability to make decisions in harmony with that standard will be made possible. I bear witness to you, my brothers and sisters, that these things are true. I know that he lives and that he will be there to speak peace to our hearts. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Barbara W. Winder was general president of the Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 12 November 1985.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h2><b>Witness to Our Thankfulness</b></h2><br>In an essay called "The Art of Living," Wilfred Peterson has written:<br><br><i>The art of thanksgiving is</i>thanks-living.<i>It is gratitude in action.</i>. . .<br><br><i>It is thanking God for the gift of life by living it triumphantly.</i>. . .<br><br><i>It is thanking God for opportunities by accepting them as a challenge to achievement.</i>. . .<br><br><i>It is thanking God for inspiration by living to be an inspiration to others.</i>. . .<br><br><i>It is adding to your prayers of thanksgiving, acts of</i>thanks-living. [<i>The Art of Living</i>(New York: Simon and Schuster, 1961), pp. 44–45]<br><br>President David O. McKay counseled Church members:<br><br><i>Thankfulness is the beginning of gratitude. Gratitude is the completion of thankfulness. Thankfulness may consist merely of words. Gratitude is shown in acts.</i>[<i>Pathways to Happiness</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, Inc., 1957), p. 317]<br><br>Some of the beautiful words of Psalm 100 stress: "Know ye that the Lord he is God: . . . be thankful unto him, and bless his name."<br><br>And again, the Lord, through his great prophet King Benjamin, has taught us there is more than just thoughts and prayers to proper thanksgiving. I quote:<br><br><i>I say unto you, my brethren, that if you should render all the thanks and praise which your whole soul has power to possess, to that God who has created you, and has kept and preserved you, and has caused that ye should rejoice.</i>. . .<br><br>. . .<i>if ye should serve him with all your whole souls yet ye would be unprofitable servants.</i><br><br>. . .<i>all that he requires of you is to keep his commandments;</i>. . .<i>if ye do keep his commandments he doth bless you and prosper you.</i>[Mosiah 2:20–22]<br><br>If we are truly thankful, our<i>acts</i>will be witness to our thankfulness.<br><h2><b>Showing Our Thankfulness</b></h2><br>Thanksgiving Day has always been designed to be a religious experience, a day to know the Lord and bless his name.<br><br>Three hundred sixty-four years ago, Governor William Bradford declared a three-day fast, and a small group of pilgrims gathered to "worship and give thanks to God." Two years later, in 1623, on July 30, the first official Thanksgiving Day was set up for "the special purpose of prayer." During the revolutionary war there were some eight special days of thanks, which were observed for "special blessings that had been received." On November 26, 1789, more than 100 years after the first special day of prayer, President George Washington issued a special proclamation for a day of "giving thanks." And about 100 years later in 1863 President Abraham Lincoln designated the last Thursday in November as "a day of thanksgiving and praise to our benevolent Father." Now, after more than three and a half centuries, we still celebrate a "Thanksgiving Day."<br><br>But in our hearts, is there sufficient thankfulness to really give praise to our benevolent Father? Does this thankfulness result in showing any true gratitude? Do we do any more than say a thanksgiving prayer over the traditional Thanksgiving feast? Or are some of our prayers and our lives like those described by the poet Robert Burns-- "Three mile prayers and one-half mile graces"? Have we learned to say thank you and to show thank you?<br><br>I like these words--they seem to suggest action:<br><br><i>If you hear a kind word spoken</i><br><i>Of some worthy soul you know,</i><br><i>It may fill his heart with sunshine</i><br><i>If you'd only tell him so.</i><br><br><i>If a deed, however humble, helps you</i><br><i>On your way to go,</i><br><i>Seek the one whose hand has helped you.</i><br><i>Seek him out and tell him so.</i><br><br><i>If your heart is touched and tender</i><br><i>Toward a sinner lost and low,</i><br><i>It might help him to do better</i><br><i>If you would only tell him so.</i><br>[Anonymous]<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley has taught us:<br><br><i>Absence of gratitude is the mark of the narrow, uneducated mind. It bespeaks a lack of knowledge and the ignorance of self-sufficiency.</i>[<i>CR,</i>Oct. 1964, p. 117]<br><br>Thankfulness may indeed be measured by the number of words we use. Gratitude, however, must be measured by the nature of our actions.<br><br>And Richard L. Evans said: "Gratitude has not even been born until it has actually been converted into word and deed."<br><br>Each of us should look for ways of saying thank you to each other, and we should show our thankfulness to the Lord by keeping his commandments.<br><h2><b>Saying Thank You</b></h2><br>In the past I have not always been able to<i>say</i>or show my thanks as I have really wanted to. Some years ago, almost every morning I found myself arriving in the parking lot of a certain institution at the same time as another individual. It was early in the morning, usually very dark and very quiet. Most of the time we were alone as we walked from our vehicles into the building. This individual was one of the finest persons I have ever known. I looked up to him. I admired him, I loved him. Yet I had never told him so. Each time we entered the building and climbed onto the elevator together, I found myself tongue-tied. I could hardly stammer "Good morning," much less, "Oh, how I admire you" or "Thank you for all you have done and are doing for me." After one of these mornings, I arrived in my office, disgusted with my inability to express my appreciation. In desperation, with a great desire to just say thank you, I took a pen in hand, and in longhand wrote a short note that expressed my feelings. Hurriedly I addressed an envelope and quickly mailed the note before my courage failed me. A<i>very</i>few days later I received a very sweet, short, three-sentence note. I could tell he had personally typed it out on the old typewriter he kept by his desk. It read:<br><br><i>Dear Dee,</i><br><br><i>That was one of the sweetest notes I have ever received, and I appreciate hearing from you. I am indeed grateful to be so close to you, and I hope that we may see each other once in a while. May the Lord bless you and assist you in all your efforts. With kindest wishes.</i><br><br><i>Faithfully yours,</i><br><br>While I had known this individual and worked closely with him for a long time, this was really the beginning of a choice and wonderful friendship with this special person--President Spencer W. Kimball. Oh, how President Kimball blessed my life because I took the time and had the courage to say thank you.<br><br>Think how the Lord then desires to bless each of us as we<i>show our thankfulness</i>by keeping the commandments. For he tells us that as we "abide the law," we will receive the blessing (D&amp;amp;C 132:5).<br><br>How long has it been since any of us has really expressed a sincere and specific thank you to someone near or dear to us? To our parents? To a faculty member? To a student? To a roommate? Or to the Lord?<br><h2><b>"Thanks for the Memories"</b></h2><br>My grandson taught me a lesson about saying thanks. Jared, who is now eight years old, lives in Hong Kong. As he has grown up, he has heard his father and me talk about our fishing trips. He has even accompanied us a time or two on short trips. But, because of his age, he had never caught a fish. Two years ago as his parents prepared for home leave, they noticed that Jared prayed each evening that he could go fishing, and he continued so to pray. When the family arrived in the United States, we arranged a fishing experience. We visited Jackson Hole and found a place on the Snake River where Jared could indeed catch some fish. And he did. He caught several. I'll admit that he wasn't very interested in baiting his hook or taking the fish off the hook when they were caught. Nevertheless, he seemed to enjoy the experience. I was interested in the report Jared would make to his Father in Heaven that night. It was very short. It expressed true thankfulness. It was only four words long. He said, "Thanks for the memories."<br><br>Each of us has been given very special experiences and memories. Wouldn't it be nice if we could all say "Thanks for the memories?"<br><h2><b>The Way We Live</b></h2><br>Alice Cary, in her poem "Nobility," states:<br><br><i>True worth is in</i>being,<i>not</i>seeming,--<br><i>In doing, each day that goes by,</i><br><i>Some little good--not in dreaming</i><br><i>Of great things to do by and by.</i><br><br><i>For whatever men say in their blindness,</i><br><i>And spite of the fancies of youth,</i><br><i>There's nothing so kingly as kindness,</i><br><i>And nothing so royal as truth.</i><br><br><i>We get back our mete as we measure--</i><br><i>We cannot do wrong and feel right,</i><br><i>Nor can we give pain and gain pleasure,</i><br><i>For justice avenges each slight.</i><br><br><i>We cannot make bargains for blisses,</i><br><i>Nor catch them like fishes in nets;</i><br><i>And sometimes the thing our life misses</i><br><i>Helps more than the thing which it gets.</i><br><br><i>For good lieth not in pursuing,</i><br><i>Nor gaining of great nor of small,</i><br><i>But just in the doing, and doing</i><br><i>As we would be done by, is all.</i><br><br>In our "doing and doing," each of us can say thank you to those around us by simply living that golden rule.<br><br>I would like to conclude these remarks by stressing three sentences from the mission statement of this great university:<br><br><i>All students at BYU should be taught the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Any education is inadequate which does not emphasize that His is the only name given under heaven whereby mankind can be saved. Certainly all relationships within the BYU community should reflect devout love of God and a loving, genuine concern for the welfare of our neighbor.</i><br><br>If we do have this loving, genuine concern for others, Brigham Young University will be like no other place on earth, and so it should be.<br><br>Remember, as important as saying thank you is, it is more important to show our thankfulness in the way we live. We need to give others some reason to say thank you to us. May we show our thanksgiving this year by our thanks-living. For the Lord God has said:<br><br><i>And he who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious; and the things of this earth shall be added unto him, even an hundredfold, yea, more.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 78:19]<br><br>May we be so blessed, I pray, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Dee F. Andersen was administrative vice president at Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 26 November 1985.</i><br><br><i>©Brigham Young University.
