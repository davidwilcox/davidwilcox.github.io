<h1>to the Future - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
What a glorious experience it is for me to stand at this pulpit in the presence of so many of God's noble sons and daughters, my brothers and sisters in the gospel of Jesus Christ. I love you dearly! I sense faith and good works in you and face the future with keen anticipation as I contemplate your devotion to righteousness and your desire to serve the Lord and your fellowmen. I hope you draw strength and courage from one another in this setting and in your daily contacts with one another on this great campus. And I pray that you are looking forward to the future with the assurance and serenity that God will guide you through this life and back to his presence if you will keep his commandments.<br><br>Looking at you, I know that the future is safe.<br><br>I would like to speak to you about the future and something of your role in it.<br><br>In a recent<i>Peanuts</i>cartoon, Charlie Brown approached his psychiatrist, Lucy, for some advice about life.<br><br><i>Lucy: Life, Charlie Brown, is like a deck chair.</i><br><br><i>Charlie: Like a what?</i><br><br><i>Lucy: Have you ever been on a cruise ship? Passengers open up these canvas deck chairs so they can sit in the sun. Some people place their chairs facing the rear of the ship so they can see where they've been. . . . Other people face their chairs forward. . . . They want to see where they are going. On the cruise ship of life, Charlie Brown, which way is your deck chair facing?</i><br><br><i>Charlie: I've never been able to get one unfolded!</i><br><br>[Charles M. Schultz, "Peanuts,"<i>Salt Lake Tribune</i>]<br><h2><b>Opening and Closing Doors</b></h2><br>If you woke up early enough this morning, you saw the old Roman god Janus opening up the mighty door of the heavens to let the day come in once again. Tonight a bit after sunset you will see old Janus close the portals again as day passes through. At least this would have been your interpretation if you have lived in ancient Rome.<br><br>And probably you would have had occasion to visit the special domain of Janus quite often throughout the day. Every time you entered a gate or door or exited, you would have been within his special province among the gods. For Janus was the god of gates, doorways, entrances, and exits. As time passed, his domain extended to include symbolic openings and closings as well. Beginnings and endings were all watched over by Janus.<br><br>His symbol as depicted on the Roman coins had two faces, one looking each way--forward and back. The shrine of Janus, which was built by the Roman ruler Numa Pompilius, consisted of two great gates, one facing east and one facing west; one for beginnings and one for endings [see<i>Encyclopedia Americana,</i>International Edition, s. v. "Janus"].<br><br>Old Janus is still very much with us today in the month that bears his name. The month in which we symbolically look backward and close the door on the old year and look forward to open another one. Janus's month, of course, is January.<br><br>For all the mythology and superstition connected with this old two-faced god, there is wisdom in what he symbolized. It is good to have times in our lives when we can close one period and open another. If our past has been triumphant and successful, well and good. We should enjoy it and hark back to it occasionally for warm memories. But we cannot live in it. We cannot rest on the laurels of our past accomplishments.<br><br>When Kirk Douglas, the movie actor, was awarded an Emmy for a dramatic role he had played on television, he responded with these words: "I keep asking myself, 'What I have done lately?'"<br><br>Growth is a ruling law of life. Unless we grow, we begin to die, and one of the best ways to grow is to close the books on our past accomplishments and go forth and do something else.<br><br>Perhaps an even greater gift from old Janus, the god of the gates, is the opportunity to close the door on past failures, disappointments, pain, grief, and unhappiness. We need not dwell on past failures as Lucy likes to do.<br><br>I saw a cartoon which showed Charlie Brown approaching Lucy with a whole list of New Year's resolutions.<br><br><i>"You're going to be proud of me, Lucy. I've decided that this next year is going to be my year of decision. This is a list of things in my life I'm going to correct. I'm going to be a better person."</i><br><br>Then Lucy starts in:<i>"Not me. I'm going to spend this whole year regretting the past. It's the only way, Charlie Brown. I'm going to cry over spilt milk and sigh over lost loves. It's a lot easier. It's too hard to improve. I tried it once, and it drove me crazy. Forget the future is my motto. Regret the past. Oh, how I regret the past! Why did I do that? Why did I do that? Why? I regret it all. Oh, what regrets! Oh, what remorse! Oh, what anguish!"</i><br><br><i>Poor old Charlie throws his resolutions over his shoulder.</i>[Charles M. Schultz, "Peanuts,"<i>Salt Lake Tribune</i>]<br><br>Another bit of wisdom from this mythological door minder is the idea that we can and do live between portals. It is possible for us to open and to close the doors of our lives whenever we choose. Sometimes we procrastinate the closing and opening of our doors. Habits we would like to break, new projects we would like to embark on, great things we say we are going to do--someday. But that someday will never come unless we choose to close the door on old past patterns that are not working for us and open the door on new opportunities.<br><br>And of course we needn't wait until we finish school or until the children are grown or until we retire from our work. New doors can be opened any time we choose, and old ones can be closed--even today. What better time to open new doors than at the beginning of a new year--to begin today to be the person you want to be--to surpass yourself, to live life more abundantly as God would have you do? The future is beyond our grasp unless we take advantage of today.<br><h2><b>New Frontiers</b></h2><br>The future? There are those who claim there will be no future, that there are no new frontiers to conquer, that the world is doomed, that mankind will be annihilated.<br><br>In the words of the great industrialist, Charles Kettering, "We should all be concerned about the future because we will have to spend the rest of our lives there" (<i>Seed for Thought,</i>1949).<br><br>I have heard the voices of doomsayers and pessimists ever since I was young:<br><br>"The four-minute mile is beyond our physical capacity."<br><br>"Television in our own living rooms?"<br><br>"Man walk on the moon?"<br><br>"Split the atom?"<br><br>"Conquer small-pox?"<br><br>When he produced the Model T Ford, Henry Ford is reported to have said that we would never improve on that car.<br><br>The Boeing 247 revolutionized air transportation. That twin-engine, all-metal transport cost $68,000, about one-third of the cost for the electronic gear on a present-day jetliner. The day the new Boeing transport first flew, a proud company engineer predicted: "They'll never build them any bigger." (The Boeing 747 carries more stewardesses than the B 247 carried passengers.)<br><br>One survey indicated that the biggest challenge facing our youth in the '80s is that there are no new exciting frontiers to conquer (report of Robert Johnston Co., Inc., on the teen environment from a study undertaken for National Board of Junior Achievement).<br><br>New frontiers to conquer?<br><br>Consider the vistas opened to us by the following:<br><br>1. The artificial heart implanted in Dr. Barney Clark.<br><br>2. Space exploration.<br><br>3. The advance in communication and transportation.<br><br>4. Increased knowledge of the chemistry of our bodies.<br><br>5. The use of atomic energy.<br><br>6. The computer age.<br><br>Isn't it interesting that<i>Time</i>magazine, instead of selecting a Man of the Year, chose a Machine of the Year, The Computer? It was an indication that an "information revolution" has arrived, bringing the promise of dramatic changes in the way people live and work, perhaps even in the way they think. We will never be the same.<br><br>Did you realize that the first electronic digital computer built in the United States dates back only to the end of World War II? Created at the University of Pennsylvania, it weighed 30 tons and contained 18,000 vacuum tubes, which failed at an average of every 7 minutes. The arrival of the transistor and the miniaturized circuit made it possible to reduce that room-size computer to a silicon chip the size of a pea. That's beyond my comprehension. Today more than half of all employed Americans earn their living, not by producing things, but as "knowledge workers," exchanging various kinds of information.<br><br>Yet a well-known analyst, Ubric Weil, says "The surface is barely scratched" (<i>Time,</i>3 January 1983, p. 14).<br><br>7. And what about relations among our fellowmen and nations?<br><br>Did you know that more than half the people of the world still live in conditions approaching misery? Their food is inadequate; they are victims of disease. Their economic life is primitive and stagnant. Their abject poverty is a handicap and threat to both them and us.<br><br>Is there anything left to do? Lincoln Steffens reminded us:<br><br><i>I teach my child and I tell other children of all ages--pre-school, in school, in college, and out:</i><br><br><i>That nothing is done, finally and right.</i><br><br><i>That nothing is known, positively and completely.</i><br><br><i>That the world is theirs, all of it. It is full of all sorts of things for them to find out and do, or do over and do right. . . .</i><br><br><i>That we have not now and never have had in the history of the world a good government.</i><br><br><i>That there is not now and never has been a perfectly run railroad, school, newspaper, bank, theater, factory, grocery store; that no business is or ever has been built, managed, financed, as it should be, must be and will be, someday--possibly in their day.</i><br><br><i>That what is true of business and politics is gloriously true of the professions, the arts and crafts, the sciences, the sports. That the best picture has not yet been painted; the greatest poem is still unsung; the mightiest novel remains to be written; the divinest music has not been conceived even by Bach. In science, probably 99 percent of the knowable has to be discovered. We know only a few streaks about astronomy. Chemistry and physics are little more than a sparkling mass of questions. As for the sports, young men and women are beating our old records every year. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . [Young people] are glad, as I am, that there is something left for them to discover and say and think and do. Something? There is everything.</i>[Lincoln Steffens, "Unfinished Business,"<i>Reader's Digest,</i>January 1937, pp. 1–2]<br><br>8. And let us not forget our obligation to take the gospel of Jesus Christ to all the world--most of whom know little or nothing about our Savior.<br><br>The seventeenth-century mathematician and philosopher, Rene Descartes, expressed the excitement we should feel as we contemplate the future. He said: "There is nothing so removed from us as to be beyond our reach, or so hidden that we cannot discover it" (quoted by John Young, astronaut, after landing on the moon in 1974).<br><br>The future?<br><br>We are living in the most exciting, explosive, dynamic, dramatic dispensation in the history of the world! What a time to be preparing for life! I envy all of you the years ahead of you and pray you will be ready for these rich adventures.<br><br>Please remember, however, that the future is beyond our grasp unless we take advantage of today, opening new doors to growth and accomplishment.<br><h2><b>Gospel Brings Great Opportunities</b></h2><br>And who has a greater opportunity to do just that than you choice sons and daughters of God, blessed with the gospel of Jesus Christ, the holy priesthood, the advantage of attending this great university where all you learn is coupled with spiritual values? What a responsibility lies on your shoulders to open the door to progress and truth for yourselves and for your fellowmen!<br><br>The Lord gave all of us who are members of his Church an awesome commission as we prepare for life:<br><br><i>And I give unto you a commandment that you shall teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom.</i><br><br><i>Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand;</i><br><br><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms--</i><br><br>That ye may be prepared in all things<i>when I shall send you again to magnify the calling whereunto I have called you, and the mission with which I have commissioned you.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:77–80; emphasis added]<br><br>Note his words--"that ye may<i>be prepared</i>in all things"!<br><br>How are you doing?<br><br>Daniel Webster said, "Every man must educate himself. His books and teachers are but helps; the work is his" (quoted by Earl Nightingale, "Your Job,"<i>Success Unlimited,</i>June 1980, p. 41).<br><br>The trouble with most of us is that we so underestimate our ability and our potential that we go through life without ever sensing what we could have accomplished. We never get our deck chairs unfolded.<br><br>In an article entitled "Reflections on Human Potential," Dr. Harold R. McAlindon told of Professor Abraham Maslow, who used to try to inspire learning in his pupils by asking them, "Which of you is going to write the next great novel? Who is going to be a saint like Albert Schweitzer?" When his students were faced with these questions, they would blush, squirm, and giggle. He would then ask them, "If not you, who will?" He pointed out that there are times when each of us has flashes of inspiration to do something really worthwhile, but upon contemplating it, we just develop a "Who me? Whom am I kidding?" attitude. What we do not realize is the fact that all the people who have done something worthwhile for great numbers of people had this same kind of self-doubt and humility. However, they worked right through it.<br><br>A friend of mine served as a mission president in Europe. One day his twelve-year-old son came home with a sheaf of music under his arm. His mother asked: "Mark, what are you doing with all that music?"<br><br>Mark replied: "They just made me the branch Primary organist."<br><br>Shocked, the mother said: "But you don't play that well."<br><br>Mark responded: "I'm the best they've got!"<br><br>Henry Ford added: "One of the great discoveries a man makes, one of his great surprises, is to find he can do what he was afraid he couldn't do. Most of the bars we beat against are in ourselves--we put them there, and we can take them down" (quoted by Earl Nightingale, "Your Job,"<i>Success Unlimited,</i>June 1980, p. 41).<br><br>None of you knows what life has in store. There are few people who can predict the future. In 1938 President Franklin Roosevelt assembled the brightest scientists in America, brought them to the White House to help him envisage the things he might have to adjust to in the future. "I want you to tell me what to expect," he begged.<br><br>After three days of intense speculation, these men whose job it was to anticipate the future and who commanded more keys to that future than any other group failed to predict atomic power, radar, rockets, jet aircraft, computers, xerography, and penicillin, all of which were to burst upon the world within the next few years. They knew about the exploratory research, of course, but they could not believe it would produce functional products so soon.<br><br>I am grateful that I could always count on the Lord's guidance in what I did in my life. None of us knows life's length; none of us knows its breadth, what experiences lie ahead, even where we will live. Some of you don't yet know whom or if you will even marry. Looking back on my own life, I marvel at the rich adventures I have enjoyed, much of it unanticipated and unexpected. Believe me, if I had my choice, I would not have programmed some of those experiences. Let me give you an example:<br><br>I was drafted during the Second World War and took my basic infantry training at Camp Wolters near Mineral Wells, Texas. We believed that after training at Camp Wolters, anyplace was an improvement, even combat. Trained in heavy weapons, I was immediately sent to war in the Pacific. Can you imagine my feelings as I watched the Golden Gate disappear in the distance?<br><br>The day before we shipped out, I received a telegram announcing the birth of our baby daughter. If I had not received that telegram then, I would not have known of her birth for four months because it took that long for my mail to catch up with me overseas. I really was discouraged. Why was this happening to me? What had I done to deserve this? Would I ever be able to hold my baby in my arms? Would I ever see this land again? How would I ever survive the war?<br><br>And yet, my young brothers and sisters, looking back, I count that chapter in my lie as one of the most character building in all my years. I learned so much. I gained a real appreciation for my wife and family during that separation. I developed a deep love for my country and my home in the mountains. After a few months in the tropical heat of New Guinea, I even appreciated the blizzards of winter. I realized how adaptable I could be under any circumstance and how essential it is to be in control of my life instead of victimized by my circumstances. I learned to take advantage of every day, living it the best I could, grateful I was alive.<br><br>I came to the realization of my absolute dependence on my loving Father in Heaven and counted on his inspiration, guidance, and consolation. I recognized what a sublime gift my Savior had given me through his living ministry, his death, and his resurrection. I was grateful for the guidance that the gospel gave me and understanding of the purpose of life. I returned from that war a better man, better prepared for life.<br><br>I am grateful I could always count on the Lord's guidance and the assurance that all of those experiences, good or bad, have been to prepare me to return to his presence. I love to read the word of the Lord to Joseph Smith while he was a prisoner in Liberty Jail. After being imprisoned, persecuted, and tortured for months, the Prophet prayed: "O God, where art thou?" In response to his petition, the Lord replied:<br><br><i>My son, peace be unto they soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;</i><br><br><i>And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:7–8]<br><br>The Lord assured him that all of the torment and persecution he faced would be for his experience and for his good, then gave him this comforting assurance:<br><br><i>Therefore, hold on thy way, and the priesthood shall remain with thee; for their bounds are set, they cannot pass. Thy days are known and thy years shall not be numbered less; therefore, fear not what man can do, for God shall be with you forever and ever.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 122:9]<br><br>My challenge to you is to prepare for life by seizing the opportunities you enjoy right now, making the most of every experience that comes your way. The Lord has reminded us that if we are prepared we shall not fear.<br><br>Aren't you grateful for a gospel that encourages us to learn, study, grow, mature, magnify, increase, expand, progress--forever? Our belief in eternal progression is one of the most satisfying and motivating principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It signifies to me that, no matter how old I am, the future is still full of challenging growth experiences. It provides a magnificent obsession for all who believe.<br><br>Consider the impact these inspired statements have on us as members of Christ's church:<br><br><i>The glory of God is intelligence.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 93:36]<br><br><i>It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 131:6]<br><br><i>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i><br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:18–19]<br><br>Brigham Young told us how vast the gospel is:<br><br><i>I will tell you in a few words what I understand "Mormonism" to be. . . . It embraces every fact there is in the heavens and in the heaven of heavens--every fact there is upon the surface of the earth, in the bowels of the earth, and in the starry heavens; in fine, it embraces all truth there is in all the eternities of the Gods. . . . "Mormonism" embraces all truth that is revealed and that is unrevealed, whether religious, political, scientific, or philosophical.</i>[<i>JD</i>9:149]<br><br>Obviously God expects us to use our minds, to stretch our intellects, to think. Unfortunately, "some people would rather die than think--and some do."<br><br>Yes, my young brothers and sisters, I encourage you to seek an education, stretch your minds, and develop your skills as much as you can.<br><h2><b>Warning Must Be Sounded</b></h2><br>But I want to sound a warning to you. Hear the wisdom of the prophet Nephi:<br><br><i>O that cunning plan of the evil one! O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish.</i><br><br><i>But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God.</i>[2 Nephi 9:28-29]<br><br>I could give you no better advice than that given to Henry Eyring by his father as he left the farm to attend his freshman year at the University of Arizona:<br><br><i>So you're going to Tucson to study science, eh? Well now, that's what you want to do, isn't it? I don't know much about science, son, but I know quite a bit about some other things. I do know the Lord spoke to the Prophet and that the gospel is true. I know our gospel teaches truth regardless of its source. Now, I've tried to tell you the way things look to me, and perhaps sometimes I've told you things that don't exactly jibe with the truth. If I have, just discard those things. In this Church you don't have to believe anything that isn't true. If you want to be a scientist, son, you hit it just as hard as you can. You're going to hear some things up there that don't exactly jibe with what you've learned in Sunday School, but don't worry about it. Just keep an open mind and truth will eventually work its way to the surface. I don't worry about how much you learn. Study all the science you can, and if you remember your prayers and don't profane and live in such a way that you will feel comfortable in the company of good people, then mother and I will feel good about you going. Don't you worry about the gospel, son. It will stand the test of all truth.</i>[<i>The Search for Truth in Science and Religion</i>(Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1961), pp. 13–14]<br><br>Yes, we want you to get an education, to achieve academic excellence, to master a trade or a profession, to gain economic and social advantages--but we want you to do all that you do to prepare for life in the context of Latter-day Saint values. The Lord counseled:<br><br><i>And as all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study</i>and also by faith. [D&amp;amp;C 88:118; emphasis added]<br><h2><b>Why an Education?</b></h2><br>Most of us enter college primarily to help us in the job market or to gain social stature or to find a mate or to avoid manual labor. Sometimes we miss the real purpose of education. President Tanner told a story of a university professor addressing<br><br><i>A group of students who had just closed their college life. . . . At a final dinner before separating to go their various ways, he said, referring to the furnishings and services which graced the banquet table, "Take this tablecloth. It is of most exquisite workmanship. It involved weaving, bleaching, smoothing, designing. It is damask linen. Is there anyone here who knows from personal experience anything about the labor involved? Have any of you ever contributed any labor to the manufacturing of table linen? Let me draw your attention to the samples of pottery here. Surely the men and women who produce such beautiful things are artists. What a joy it must be for a man to hold a thing in his hand--complete--and say, 'I made it.' Many forms of labor are involved here, also--digging the clay, carting, fashioning, painting, burning, baking, and finishing."</i><br><br><i>He then called attention to the cut glass, the silver, the rugs, the carpet, the curtains and drapery, and the mural decorations. He continued, "Here we are, then, a group of men on whom a university has set its stamp. We produce nothing to eat; we could not even lend a hand in the making of anything we see around us; and truth compels me to venture the suggestion that, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, the chief motive of a college education is to escape actual participation in just such a work as gives, or ought to give, joy to the worker.</i><br><br><i>"I do not believe that a smattering of languages, of mathematics, and of history is education. I believe the system of cramming these things to pass an examination is pernicious." Then he said, "Why should men consider it degrading to handle tools and make useful and beautiful things?"</i><br><br><i>He concluded his remarks to his spellbound audience with these words: "Gentlemen, as one example, I wish it were possible for me to introduce to you a young Galilean carpenter, the master builder--Jesus of Nazareth</i>." [G. Homer Durham, ed.,<i>N. Eldon Tanner, His Life and Service</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1982), p. 341]<br><br>The highest purpose of education is to develop character.<br><br>True education trains in discipline, self-denial, and self-mastery.<br><br>True education awakens a desire to promote and conserve health of body and mind.<br><br>True education regulates the temper, subdues passion, and makes obedience to social laws and moral order a guiding principle of life.<br><br>True education encourages service to our fellowmen.<br><br>True education develops reason and inculcates faith in God.<br><br>True education motivates us to strive to live like our Savior.<br><br>There is no end to the progress of man or a woman who seeks learning, who seeks the truth, even by study and also by faith.<br><br>In fact, the Lord has told us in no uncertain words that, as we establish priorities in our lives, we should have no other gods before him. Then he promised in the beautiful Sermon on the Mount, as correctly translated by Joseph Smith: "Wherefore, seek not the things of this world but seek ye first to build up the kingdom of God, and to establish his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you" (JST Matthew 6:38)<br><br>All what things? The Lord was speaking of the treasures of the earth, the things of this world.<br><br>Blessed with testimonies of the gospel of Jesus Christ, you and I can understand the purpose of life and our eternal goals. That blessed testimony gives us the proper perspective and motivation as we seek for wisdom and understanding. We have the truth and we practice virtue. That sets us apart from the rest of the world which tries to find truth without practicing virtue, and thus is ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth (see 2 Timothy 3:7).<br><br>Armed with faith in God, his Son Jesus Christ, and the saving principle of his gospel, you will be prepared to live in the world without being part of the world.<br><br>You will then study--along with your science, politics, and business--the holy scriptures.<br><br>You will pray earnestly, sincerely, from the heart, seeking guidance for your life, building your faith in God and understanding of your relationship to him.<br><br>You will fast purposefully, thoughtfully, prayerfully, regularly.<br><br>You will live his holy principles, keep his commandments, the true test of your faith.<br><br>You will respond to calls to service in his kingdom, experiencing the joy that comes from such service.<br><br>You will sustain and follow your leaders, confident that they are inspired in their callings.<br><br>You will bear witness of the gospel through your words and actions, sharing the truth with your fellowmen.<br><br>You will seek his Holy Spirit, knowing that the things of God are understood only by the Spirit of God.<br><br>You will be honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, doing good to all men.<br><br>You will love your neighbors as yourself, even those you don't like.<br><br>You will continue to seek anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy.<br><br>You will be a devoted Latter-day Saint throughout your life.<br><br>You will then be prepared for the future, prepared in all things to magnify the calling whereunto God has called you and the mission with which he has commissioned you.<br><br>And at the end of your rich, productive life you will be greeted with the assuring words of our Lord:<br><br><i>Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</i>[Matthew 25:21]<br><h2><b>Hail and Farewell</b></h2><br>At the beginning of this new year, my beloved brothers and sisters, I pray with all my heart and soul that you will understand that, as children of God with knowledge of your identity, your relationship to him, your relationship to your Savior Jesus Christ, your understanding of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the purpose for which we are here, each one of you will take advantage of every day to prepare for life, that you can enjoy it more abundantly. God bless you with all you stand in need of as you study the principles to guide you through life. In your scholastic career, in your religious career, in your social career, God bless you to have the patience to stand by your convictions, to prepare yourself for something worthwhile in your life. God bless you with the faith to know you truly are his sons and daughters commissioned to come to this earth when you have come because you have such great talents and abilities to build his holy kingdom. God bless you to sense, in the great windup scene in which we find ourselves in this dispensation of the fullness of times, that you have an important role to play. God bless you to be where he can find you, that your lives can be rich and full and rewarding and fulfilling. The gospel is true! I bear that witness and pray that you will anchor your faith in that glorious gospel in all you undertake in your life. I love you as my brothers and sisters in Christ and pray his holy Spirit to attend you in all you do. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Robert L.

<h1> However Long and Hard the Road - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2><b>Patricia T. Holland</b></h2><br>Just before commencement exercises last spring, my husband received a letter from a student which read something like this:<br><br><i>Dear President Holland:</i><br><br><i>I am completing my undergraduate experience at BYU this month and will be graduating in our upcoming commencement service. My parents are relieved, my professors are surprised, and I am holding my breath. Things could go wrong, you know, even at this late date.</i><br><br><i>And that brings my one grievance with you. It is this late date business. My dates have been so late that most of them never showed up. I thought it was an assumed part of the BYU contract that I would be married before graduation. Well, you've got just under three weeks to come up with somebody or I want my tuition back.</i><br><br><i>Urgently yours,</i><br><br>Obviously this letter was written in fun, but I do worry that some of you--especially the women on campus--are struggling with your social life more than you would like. I expect there are many who would like to be dating and who would like to have a guaranteed offer of marriage before graduation. As the chill of winter sets in, you may be feeling about as special as frozen custard.<br><br>If you are disappointed in the romance--or lack of it--in your life, I ask you to do exactly what this student did--keep a sense of humor, retain your marriage goal for the important commandment it is, and put your energies into becoming! Don't spend your time walking on your lower lip about what is not. That just stretches the heck out of your lower jaw. Be excited about your chance to grow and develop and<i>become</i>.<br><br>You have so much personal potential, and this is the greatest place in the entire world to develop it. This<i>is</i>the time and this<i>is</i>the place!<br><br>It's interesting to me that the rest of the world does eventually discover what was given long ago in the scriptures. I recently read this: "Only a small portion of what we are [is developed] and there is enormous potential in the human being" (Leo Buscaglia,<i>Love</i>[New York: Fawcett, 1982], p. 19).<br><br>In his book,<i>The Politics of Experience</i>, R. D. Laing said, "What we think is less than what we know: What we know is less than what we love: What we love is so much less than what there is, and to this ... extent, we are much less than what we are" (R.D. Laing in<i>Love</i>, p. 19). Without being smug, we've known that since the dawn of the Restoration. Surely that ought to be our own exciting challenge toward becoming--of growing, seeing, feeling, touching, smelling, hearing, believing. No time for a Harlequin Romance or a long lower lip with that kind of view.<br><br>Marilyn Funt, who wrote the book<i>Are You Anybody?</i>did so in response to people's asking in the Hollywood swirl if she "was anybody." In answer she said:<br><br><i>I used to think being somebody meant public recognition of one's efforts. Wrong. I now know that the feeling of being somebody comes from hard work and self-growth. Being in control of my life makes me answer that question with a strong "Yes!"</i>[New York: Pinacle Books, 1981]<br><br>If it didn't seem unbecoming of the president's wife in full view of the television audience, I would like to just shout at you to see in yourself what I see in you. The only limitations you have are those you set on yourselves. All of the tools and texts are here, right at your hand. But sometimes we cannot recognize the real purpose and significance of the moment which is ours to experience. That's because too many of us learn only through our heads and not through our hearts!<br><br>A common man or woman will hear only the commonplace, but a man or a women connected to the powers of heaven will learn to be an inheritor of those powers.<br><br>As Christ was moving toward his crucifixion, he said, "Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice saying, I have both glorified it and will glorify it again" (John 12:28). Some of the people there didn't hear anything but a noise (they thought it thundered); others only heard words, and they thought an angel had spoken to him. Only a few heard the words as they were, and<i>they knew</i>God had spoken them!<br><br>"Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes" (John 12:30). He may have been saying, "I already know these things, but did you hear that you too (if you keep company with him) have the potential to glorify his name?"<br><br>Be all that you can be! If you have oil in your lamps, you will find how often you get a chance to light them. If you have cared enough to prepare, your light will attract many, both men and women who will seek and cherish your companionship.<br><br>In closing, may I share with you a direct quote from my baby sister who graduated from BYU in 1980, returned from a mission in May of 1982, and is still single:<br><br><i>It used to discourage me that girls younger than I were married, but now, having learned what I've learned from my education and especially from my mission, I am thrilled with the direction, opportunities, and privileges the Lord has given me to grow. I will have so much more to contribute to my marriage when that time comes. And now I know after getting to know the Lord better that it will come in his own due time!</i><br><br>I, too, believe that--and share with you my testimony that the Lord lives and loves you and will direct the growth of each one of you, forever. Amen.<br><h2><b>Jeffrey R. Holland</b></h2><br>Well, this certainly isn't curling up in front of the fire with a bowl of popcorn. It isn't even as cozy as the Cougareat with a plate of nachos. But it is a great privilege to visit with you in any setting, and we are honored to have the opportunity this morning. The very nature of our opening assembly in September requires that I stress university policies and the general expectations for a new school year. I have been quite forthright there, even a little stern, in hopes everyone would understand the firm academic and moral expectations we have for every BYU student. This past September I was pretty direct about some problems we had last spring, and in doing so I probably sent buckshot out into a very large audience who didn't really deserve it. I guess that is okay if by word of mouth you helped take it to that very small audience who did deserve it.<br><br>For those reasons I have wanted to make this visit--convened as you are this very morning as the fog and the rain and the midwinter doldrums bear down on you--I have wanted to make this message more personal and more hopeful. Often enough I will have to talk about the university and your obligations to it. This morning, however, I just want to talk about you. In praying and preparing for this hour, I have wanted to help you, to have you believe we understand you. I pray even now that you will feel our love and admiration and appreciation for you.<br><h2><b>Hang In and Hang On</b></h2><br>We speak about<i>excellence</i>a great deal at BYU these days, and, by definition, excellence does not come easily or quickly--an excellent education does not, a successful mission does not, a strong, loving marriage does not, rewarding personal relationships do not. It is simply a truism that nothing very valuable can come without significant sacrifice and effort and patience on our part. Perhaps you discovered that when you got your grades last month. Maybe in other ways you are finding that many of the most hoped-for rewards in life can seem an awfully long time coming.<br><br>My concern this morning is that you will face some delays and disappointments at this formative time in your life and feel that no one else in the history of mankind has ever had your problems or faced those difficulties. And when some of those challenges come, you will have the temptation common to us all to say, "This task is too hard. The burden is too heavy. The path is too long." And so you decide to quit, simply to give up. Now to terminate certain kinds of tasks is not only acceptable but often very wise. If you are, for example, a flagpole sitter then I say, "Come on down." But in life's most crucial and telling tasks, my plea is to stick with it, to persevere, to hang in and hang on, and to reap your reward. Or to be slightly more scriptural:<br><br><i>Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great.</i><br><br><i>Behold, the Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind; and the willing and obedient shall eat the good of the land of Zion in these last days.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 64:33–34]<br><br>I am asking you this morning not to give up "for ye are laying the foundation of a great work." That "great work" is you--your life, your future, the very fulfillment of your dreams. That "great work" is what, with effort and patience and God's help, you can become. When days are difficult or problems seem unending, I plead with you to stay in the harness and keep pulling. You are entitled to "eat the good of the land of Zion in these last days," but it will require your heart and a willing mind. It will require that you stay at your post and keep trying.<br><h2><b>"Victory--Victory at All Costs"</b></h2><br>On 10 May 1940, as the specter of Nazi infamy moved relentlessly toward the English Channel, Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill was summoned to the post of prime minister of England. He hastily formed a government and on May 13 went before the House of Commons with his maiden speech.<br><br><i>I would say to the House, as I said to those who have joined this Government: "I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat."</i><br><br><i>We have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind. We have before us many, many long months of struggle and of suffering. You ask what is our policy? I will say: It is to wage war, by sea, land, and air, with all our might and with all our strength that God can give us. ...That is our policy. You ask, What is our aim? I can answer in one word: Victory--victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror; victory, however long and hard the road may be.</i>[<i>Churchill: the Life Triumphant,</i>American Heritage, 1965, p. 90]<br><br>Six days later he went on radio to speak to the world at large. He said:<br><br><i>This is one of the most awe-striking periods in the long history of France and Britain. ... Behind us ... gather a group of shattered States and bludgeoned races: the Czechs, the Poles, the Norwegians, the Danes, the Dutch, the Belgians--upon all of whom the long night of barbarism will descend, unbroken even by a star of hope, unless we conquer, as conquer we must; as conquer we shall.</i>[<i>Churchill</i>, p. 91]<br><br>Then two weeks later he was back before Parliament. "We shall not flag or fail," he vowed.<br><br><i>We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.</i>[<i>Churchill</i>, p. 91]<br><br>I share these lines with you not only because they are among the most stirring calls to patriotism and courage ever uttered in the English language, but also because I relied on them personally once, when I was just your very age.<br><br>Exactly twenty years ago last fall I stood on the famous white cliffs of Dover overlooking the English Channel, the very channel which twenty years before that ran as the only barrier between Hitler and England's fall. In 1962 my mission was concluding, and I was concerned. My future seemed very dim and difficult. My parents were then serving a mission also, which meant I was going home to live I-did-not-quite-know-where and to pay my way I-did-not-quite-know-how. I had completed only one year of college, and I had no idea what to major in or where to seek my career. I knew I needed three more years for a baccalaureate degree and had the vague awareness that graduate school of some kind inevitably loomed up behind that.<br><br>I knew tuitions were high and jobs were scarce. And I knew there was an alarmingly wider war spreading in Southeast Asia, which could require my military service. I hoped to marry but wondered when--or if--that could be, at least under all these circumstances. My educational hopes seemed like a never-ending path into the unknown, and I had hardly begun.<br><br>So before heading home I stood one last time on the cliffs of the country I had come to love so much,<br><br><i>This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle...</i><br><i>This fortress built by Nature for herself</i><br><i>Against infection and the hand of war.</i>[<i>Richard II</i>, act 2, scene 1, lines 40, 43–44]<br><br>And there I read again,<br><br><i>We have before us many, many long months of struggle and suffering. What is our aim? ... Victory--victory at all costs; victory in spite of all terror; victory, however long and hard the road may be....</i><br><br><i>Conquer we must; as conquer we shall. ... We shall never surrender.</i><br><br>Blood? Toil? Tears? Sweat? Well, I figured I had as much of those as anyone, so I headed home to try. I was, in the parlance of the day, going to give it "my best shot," however feeble that might prove to be. Now at the same time in your life, I ask you to do the same.<br><h2><b>Dreams and Visions</b></h2><br>As you wage such personal wars, obviously part of the strength to "hang in there" comes from some glimpse, however faint and fleeting, of what the victory<i>can</i>be. It is as true now as when Solomon said it that "where there is no vision, the people perish" (Proverbs 29:18). If your eyes are always on your shoelaces, if all you can see is this class or that test, this date or that roommate, this disappointment or that dilemma, then it really is quite easy to throw in the towel and stop the fight. But what if it is the fight of your life? Or more precisely if it is the fight<i>for</i>your life, your<i>eternal</i>life at that? What if beyond this class or that test, this date or that roommate, this disappointment or that dilemma, you really can see and can hope for all the best and right things that God has to offer? Oh, it may be blurred a bit by the perspiration running into your eyes, and in a really difficult fight one of the eyes might even be closing a bit, but faintly, dimly, and ever so far away you can see the object of it all. And you say it is worth it, you do want it, you will fight on. Like Coriantumr, you will lean upon your sword to rest a while, then rise to fight again (see Ether 15:24–30).<br><h2><b>Joseph Smith's Perseverance</b></h2><br>But how, you ask, do you get this glimpse of the future that helps you to hang on? Well, for me that is one of the great gifts of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. It is not insignificant that early in this life Joseph Smith was taught this lesson three times in the same night and once again the next morning. Moroni said, quoting the Lord verbatim as recorded by the prophet Joel:<br><br><i>I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:</i><br><br><i>And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids of those days will I pour out my spirit.</i>[Joel 2:28–29]<br><br>Dreaming dreams and seeing visions. The Lord's spirit upon all flesh--sons and daughters, old and young, servants and handmaidens. I may be wrong, but I can't imagine an Old Testament verse of any kind that could have helped this boy prophet more. He is being called into the battle of his life, for life itself, or at least for its real meaning and purpose. He will be driven and hunted and hounded. His enemies will rail and ridicule. He will see his children die and his land lost and his marriage tremble. He will languish in prison through a Missouri winter, and he will cry out toward the vault of heaven, "O God, where art thou? ... How long. ...O Lord, how long?" (D&amp;amp;C 121:1–3). Finally he would walk the streets of his own city uncertain who, except for a precious few, were really friend or actually foe. And all that toil and trouble, pain and perspiration would end maliciously at Carthage--when there simply were finally more foes than friends. Felled by balls fired from the door of the jail inside and one coming through the window from outside, he fell dead into the hands of his murderers--thirty-eight years of age.<br><br>If all this and so much more was to face the Prophet in such a troubled lifetime, and if he finally knew what fate awaited him in Carthage, as he surely did, why didn't he just quit somewhere along the way? Who needs it? Who needs the abuse and the persecution and the despair and death? It doesn't sound fun to me, so why not just zip shut the cover of your Triple Combination, hand in your Articles of Faith cards, and go home?<br><br>Why not? For the simple reason that he had dreamed dreams and seen visions. Through the blood and the toil and the tears and the sweat, he had seen the redemption of Israel. It was out there somewhere--dimly, distantly--but it was there. So he kept his shoulder to the wheel until God said his work was finished.<br><h2><b>The Early Saints; Fulfillment Ahead</b></h2><br>And what of the other Saints? What were they to do with a martyred Prophet, a persecuted past, and now hopeless future? With Joseph and Hyrum gone, shouldn't they just quietly slip away also--somewhere, anywhere? What is the use? They have run and run and run. They have wept and buried their dead. They have started over so many times their hands are bloodied and their hearts are bruised. In the name of sanity and safety and peace, why don't they just quit?<br><br>Well, it was those recurring dreams, and compelling visions. It was spiritual strength. It was the fulfillment they knew to be ahead, no matter how faint or far away.<br><br>In their very first general conference, convened three months after the Church was organized, the Saints had recorded this:<br><br><i>Much exhortation and instruction was given, and the Holy Ghost was poured out upon us in a miraculous manner--many of our number prophesied, whilst others had the heavens opened to their view. The goodness and the condescension of a merciful God ... create</i>[d]<i>within us a sensation of rapturous gratitude, and inspire</i>[d]<i>us with fresh zeal and energy, in the cause of truth.</i>[<i>Times and Seasons</i>4:23]<br><br>There they were, approximately thirty members of the Church meeting in that tiny Peter Whitmer home in Fayette, planning to overthrow the prince of darkness and establish the kingdom of God in all the world. All the world? What presumption! Were they demented? Had they lost all power to reason? Thirty very average, garden-variety Latter-day Saints willing to work the rest of their lives? To what end? Persecution and pain and maybe thirty more members--for a grand total of sixty? Perhaps they did see how limited their immediate personal success would be, and maybe they even saw the trouble ahead, but they saw something more. It was all in that business of the influence of the Holy Ghost and heavens being opened to their view. President John Taylor said later of that experience:<br><br><i>A few men assembled in a log cabin; they saw visions of heaven, and gazed upon the eternal world; they looked through the rent vista of futurity, and beheld the glories of eternity; ... they were laying the foundation of the salvation of this world.</i>[<i>HC</i>6:295]<br><br>Now there was to be a lot of bad road between that first conference of thirty people and a Church which would one day have nations flocking to it. And, unless I miss my guess, there are several miles of bad road ahead of that Church yet. But to have seen it and felt it and believed it kept them from growing "weary in well-doing," helped them believe even in the most difficult of times that "out of small things proceedeth that which is great." In battle far more important than World War II would be, these Saints also vowed victory, however long and hard the road.<br><h2><b>Determination</b></h2><br>Though nothing in our lives seems to require the courage and patient long-suffering of those early Latter-day Saints, still almost every worthwhile endeavor I can imagine takes something of that same determination. Certainly an education does, including paying off your student loans. But it can be done. I've done it. It just takes time. Even love at first sight--if there is such a thing--is nothing like love after nineteen years, seven months, and eleven days, if my marriage to Sister Holland is any indication. Indeed "the best is [always] yet to be" (Robert Browning, "Rabbi Ben Ezra").<br><br>In that sense Troilus, whose impatient love for Cressida makes him something of a basket case, teaches us a valuable lesson. "He that will have a cake out of the wheat must tarry the grinding," Pandarus says to Troilus. "Have I not tarried?" Troilus pouts.<br><br><i>Pandarus: Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry the bolting.</i><br><br><i>Troilus: Have I not tarried?</i><br><br><i>Pandarus: Ay, the bolting; but you must tarry the leavening.</i><br><br><i>Troilus: Still have I tarried?</i><br><br><i>Pandarus: Ay, to the leavening; but here's yet ... the kneading, the making of the cake, the heating of the oven, and the baking; nay, you must stay the cooling too, or you may chance to burn your lips.</i><br><br>[<i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, act 1, scene 1, lines 14ff]<br><br>The baking of life's best cakes takes time. Don't despair of tarrying and trying. And don't "burn your lips" with impatience. Let me say just one bit more about the modern tragedy of sweethearts who will not tarry. It is of increasing alarm to me.<br><h2><b>Symbolic Problem in Our World: Divorce</b></h2><br>In even mentioning this I earnestly wish not to offend. I have seen divorce in my own family so I know something of the complexity, the pain, the accusations, and innocence that inevitably attend it. I do not speak here of specific lives or personal problems about which I know nothing and on which I would not pass judgment if I did. But the general matter of divorce, the abstract matter of divorce, is not only a major social but also a major symbolic problem in our world.<br><br>With the divorce rate hitting 50 percent and climbing, more than one million American children live through the trauma of a marital break-up every year. Andrew Cherlin of Johns Hopkins University says that "America[ns] ... of the 70's and 80's are the first generation in the country's history who think divorce and separation are a normal part of family life" ("Who's Minding the Children," Allan C. Brownfeld, from<i>Divorce and Single-Parent Family Statistics,</i>p. 24). That perception is being helped along by catchy new book titles like<i>Divorce, the New Freedom and Creative Divorce: A new Opportunity for Personal Growth</i>.<br><br>No one would wish a bad marriage on anyone. But where do we think "good marriages" come from? They don't spring full-blown from the head of Zeus any more than does a good education, or good home teaching, or a good symphony. Why should a marriage require fewer tears and less toil and shabbier commitment than your job or your clothes or your car?<br><br>Yet some of you will spend less time on the quality and substance and purpose of your marriage--the highest, holiest, culminating covenant you make in this world--than you will in maintaining your '72 Datsun. And you will break the hearts of many innocent people, including perhaps your own, if that marriage is then dissolved.<br><br>"You must [not give] half-hearted compliance [to a marriage]," said President Kimball. "[It requires] all [our] consecration" (Spencer W. Kimball, "An Apostle Speaks about Marriage to John and Mary,"<i>Improvement Era,</i>February 1949, p. 74). So every worthy task will require all that we can give to it. The Lord requires the heart and a willing mind if we are to eat the good of the land of Zion in the last days.<br><h2><b>Lesson on Perseverance</b></h2><br>Let me close with one last, lengthy lesson on perseverance.<br><br>On 28 July 1847, four days after his arrival in that valley, Brigham Young stood upon the spot where now rises the magnificent Salt Lake Temple and exclaimed to his companions: "Here [we will build] the Temple of our God!" (James H. Anderson, "The Salt Lake Temple,"<i>Contributor</i>[The Young Men's Mutual Improvement Associations of Zion], no. 6, April 1893, p. 243).<br><br>Its grounds would cover an eighth of a square mile, and it would be built to stand through eternity. Who cares about the money or stone or timber or glass or gold they don't have? So what that seeds are not even planted and the Saints are yet without homes? Why worry that crickets will soon be coming--and so will the United States Army?<br><br>They just marched forth and broke ground for the most massive, permanent, inspiring edifice they could conceive. And they would spend forty years of their lives trying to complete it.<br><br>The work seemed ill-fated from the start. The excavation for the basement required trenches twenty feet wide and sixteen feet deep, much of it through solid gravel. Just digging for the foundation alone required nine thousand man days of labor. Surely someone must have said, "A temple would be fine, but do we really need one this big?" But they kept on digging. Maybe they believed they were "laying the foundation of a great work." In any case they worked on, "not weary in well-doing."<br><br>And through it all Brigham Young had dreamed the dream and seen the vision. With the excavation complete and the cornerstone ceremony concluded, he said to the Saints assembled:<br><br><i>I do not like to prophesy much, ... But I will venture to guess that this day, and the work we have performed on it, will long be remembered by this people, and be sounded as with a trumpet's voice throughout the world. ... Five years ago last July I was here, and saw in the spirit the Temple.</i>[<i>I stood</i>]<i>not ten feet from where we have laid the chief corner stone. I have not inquired what kind of a temple we should build. Why? Because it was</i>[<i>fully</i>]<i>represented before me.</i>[Anderson,<i>Contributor,</i>p. 257–58]<br><br>But as Brigham Young also said, "We never began to build [any] temple without the bells of hell beginning to ring" (J.A. Widtsoe [ed.],<i>Discourses of Brigham Young</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1973], p. 410). No sooner was the foundation work finished than Albert Sidney Johnston and his United States troops set out for the Salt Lake Valley intent on war with "the Mormons." In response President Young made elaborate plans to evacuate and, if necessary, destroy the entire city behind them. But what to do about the temple whose massive excavation was already completed and its 8' x 16' foundational walls firmly in place? They did the only thing they could do--they filled it all back in again. Every shovelful. All that soil and gravel that had been so painstakingly removed with those nine thousand man days of labor was filled back in. When they finished, those acres looked like nothing more interesting than a field that had been plowed up and left unplanted.<br><br>When the Utah War threat had been removed, the Saints returned to their homes and painfully worked again at uncovering the foundation and removing the material from the excavated basement structure.<br><br>But then the apparent masochism of all this seemed most evident when not adobes or sandstone but massive granite boulders were selected for the basic construction material. And they were twenty miles away in Little Cottonwood Canyon. Furthermore the precise design and dimensions of every one of the thousands of stones to be used in that massive structure had to be marked out individually in the architect's office and shaped accordingly. This was a suffocatingly slow process. Just to put<i>one</i>layer of the six hundred hand-sketched, individually squared, and precisely cut stones around the building took nearly three years. That progress was so slow that virtually no one walking by the temple block could ever see any progress at all.<br><br>And, of course, getting the stone from mountain to city center was a nightmare. A canal on which to convey the stone was begun and a great deal of labor and money expended on it, but it was finally aborted. Other means were tried, but oxen proved to be the only viable means of transportation. In the 1860s and '70s always four and often six oxen in a team could be seen almost any working day of the year, toiling and tugging and struggling to pull from the quarry one monstrous block of granite, or at most two of medium size.<br><br>During that time, as if the United States Army hadn't been enough, the Saints had plenty of other interruptions. The arrival of the railroad pulled almost all of the working force off the temple for nearly three years, and twice grasshopper invasions sent the workers into full-time summer combat with the pests. By mid-1871, fully two decades and untold misery after it had begun, the walls of the temple were barely visible above ground. Far more visible was the teamster's route from Cottonwood, strewn with the wreckage of wagons--and dreams--unable to bear the load placed on them. The journals and histories of these teamsters are filled with accounts of broken axles, mud-mired animals, shattered sprockets, and shattered hopes. I do not have any evidence that these men swore, but surely they might have been seen turning a rather steely eye toward heaven. But they believed and kept pulling. And through all of this President Young seemed in no hurry. "The Temple will be built as soon as we are prepared to use it," he said (Anderson,<i>Contributor,</i>p. 266). Indeed his vision was so lofty and his hope so broad that right in the middle of this staggering effort requiring virtually all that the Saints could seem to bear, he announced the construction of the St. George, Manti, and Logan Temples.<br><br>"Can you accomplish the work, you Latter-day Saints of these several counties?" he asked. And then in his own inimitable way he answered:<br><br><i>Yes; that is a question I can answer readily. You are perfectly able to do it. The question is, have you the necessary faith? Have you sufficient of the Spirit of God in your hearts to say, yes, by the help of God our Father we will erect these buildings to his name? ... Go to now, with your might and with your means and finish this Temple.</i>[Anderson,<i>Contributor,</i>p. 267]<br><br>So they squared their shoulders and stiffened their backs and went forward with their might. But when President Brigham Young died in 1877, the temple was still scarcely twenty feet above the ground. Ten years later, his successor, President John Taylor, and the temple's original architect, Truman O. Angell, were dead as well. The side walls were just up to the square. And now the infamous Edmunds-Tucker Act had already been passed by Congress disincorporating The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. One of the effects of this law was to put the Church into receivership, whereby the U.S. marshall under a November court order seized this temple the Saints had now spent just under forty years of their lives dreaming of, working for, and praying fervently to enjoy. To all appearances, the still unfinished but increasingly magnificent structure was to be wrested at this last hour from its rightful owners and put into the hands of aliens and enemies, the very group who had often boasted that the Latter-day Saints would never be permitted to finish the building. It seemed those boasts were certain to be fulfilled. Schemes were immediately put forward to divert the intended use of the temple in ways that would desecrate its holy purpose and mock the staggering sacrifice of the Saints who had so faithfully tried to build it.<br><br>But God was with these modern children of Israel, as he always has been and always will be. They did all they could do and left the rest in his hands. And the Red Sea parted before them, and they walked through on firm, dry ground. On 6 April 1892, the Saints as a body were nearly delirious. Now, finally, here in their own valley with their own hands they had cut out of the mountains a granite monument that was to mark, after all they had gone through, the safety of the Saints and the permanence of Christ's true church on earth for this one last dispensation. The central symbol of all that was the completed House of their God. The streets were literally jammed with people. Forty thousand of them fought their way on to the temple grounds. Ten thousand more, unable to gain entrance, scrambled to the tops of nearby buildings in hopes that some glimpse of the activities might be had. Inside the Tabernacle President Wilford Woodruff, visibly moved by the significance of the moment, said:<br><br><i>If there is any scene on the face of this earth that will attract the attention of the God of heaven and the heavenly host, it is the one before us today--the assembling of this people, the shout of 'Hosanna!' the laying of the topstone of this Temple in honor to our God.</i>[Anderson,<i>Contributor,</i>p. 270]<br><br>Then, moving outside, he laid the capstone in place exactly at high noon.<br><br>In the writing of one who was there, "The scene that followed is beyond the power of language to describe." Lorenzo Snow, beloved President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, came forward leading 40,000 Latter-day Saints in the Hosanna shout. Every hand held a handkerchief every eye was filled with tears. One said the very "ground seemed to tremble with the volume of the sound" which echoed off the tops of the mountains. "A grander or more imposing spectacle than this ceremony of laying the Temple capstone is not recorded in history" (Anderson,<i>Contributor,</i>p. 273). It was finally and forever finished.<br><br>Later that year the prestigious<i>Scientific American</i>(1892), referred to this majestic new edifice as a "monument to Mormon perseverance." And so it was. Blood, toil, tears, and sweat. The best things are always worth finishing. "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God?" (1 Corinthians 3:16). Most assuredly you are. As long and laborious as the effort may seem, please keep shaping and setting the stones that will make<i>your</i>accomplishment "a grand and imposing spectacle." Take advantage of every opportunity to learn and grow. Dream dreams and see visions. Work toward their realization. Wait patiently when you have no other choice. Lean on your sword and rest a while, but get up and fight again. Perhaps you will not see the full meaning of your effort in your own lifetime. But your children will, or your children's children will, until finally you, with all of them, can give the Hosanna shout.<br><br>I testify that God loves each of us and that Jesus of Nazareth, his Only Begotten Son, came to "succor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees" (D&amp;amp;C 81:5)--bringing a divine form of worker's compensation, if you will, to you who keep tugging those granite boulders so faithfully into place. I love you and believe in you. This morning I have wanted to encourage you. You are laying the foundation of a great work--your own inestimable future. "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God?" I pray that your life may be "a monument to Mormon perseverance" "however long and hard the road," in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Jeffrey R.

<h1>t Wilford Woodruff and Thoughts for Youth - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Today is the ninety-seventh anniversary of the birth of Elder LeGrand Richards, who left us on Tuesday, 11 January of this year. His passing has reminded thoughtful people of the life of President Wilford Woodruff, fourth president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Many of us here tonight have touched the hand or heard the voice of Elder Richards. He in turn heard the voice and touched the hand of President Woodruff who was an associate of the Prophet Joseph Smith. Someday you may be able to tell your grandchildren you once heard the voice of LeGrand Richards, who knew men who had known and lived with the Prophet. Thus the generations of mankind touch each other. Accordingly, I have been impressed tonight to share with you some things which President Woodruff has left for us to contemplate. Let me review a few matters with you.<br><h2><b>The Life of Wilford Woodruff</b></h2><br>Wilford Woodruff was born in Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut, 1 March 1807. He learned the trade of a miller. He worked as a miller in a number of communities in his native state. He first learned of Joseph Smith through a newspaper article in the spring of 1832. He was twenty-five. Some nineteen or twenty months later he met Elders Zera Pulsipher and Elijah Cheney in Rushland, New York, where he had moved and was farming. On 31 December 1833 he was baptized by Zera Pulsipher. Four months later he first met Joseph Smith in the streets of Kirtland, Ohio. I would like to read to you about his first meeting with the Prophet Joseph Smith. He recorded,<br><br><i>Before I saw Joseph I said I did not care how old he was, or how young he was; I did not care how he looked--whether his hair was long or short; the man that advanced that revelation was a prophet of God. I knew it for myself. I first met Joseph Smith in the streets of Kirtland. He had on an old hat, and a pistol in his hand. Said he, "Brother Woodruff, I've been out shooting at a mark, and I wanted to see if I could hit anything." And, said he, "Have you any objection to it?"</i><br><br><i>"Not at all," said I. "There is no law against a man shooting at a mark, that I know of."</i><br><br><i>He invited me to his house. He had a wolf skin, which he wanted me to help him to tan; he wanted it to sit on while driving his wagon team. Now, many might have said, "You are a pretty prophet; shooting a pistol and tanning a wolf skin." Well, we tanned it, and used it while making a journey of a thousand miles. This was my first acquaintance with the Prophet Joseph. And from that day until the present, with all the apostasies that we have had, and with all the difficulties and afflictions we have been called to pass through, I never saw a moment when I had any doubt with regard to this work.</i>[G. Homer Durham, comp.,<i>The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1946), pp. 29–30. All subsequent quotations from Wilford Woodruff, although they appeared elsewhere originally, were taken from this book.]<br><br>Wilford made his home with the Prophet for about a week. On Sunday, Joseph called a priesthood meeting. They gathered in a little cabin: Joseph and Hyrum Smith, Oliver Cowdery, Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Parley and Orson Pratt, and William E. McLellin. Young Woodruff heard them all bear testimony. Joseph spoke last and said: "Brethren, I am very much edified and interested in listening to your testimony. But I want to tell you that you know no more concerning... this work ... than a parcel of little children." Then he told them (in the words of Wilford Woodruff) that "this work would fill the whole earth, and that all nations would have to hear the proclamation of the gospel" (p. 30).<br><br>A few days later on May 1 Wilford Woodruff left Kirtland with the vanguard of Zion's Camp, marching to Missouri. As a priest he served his first mission in Arkansas and Tennessee, being ordained an elder during that time on 4 April 1835. On 21 April 1836, while on that mission, he learned from David W. Patten of the Twelve that he had been called to membership in the Second Quorum of the Seventy. Returning to Kirtland later that year, he was called to the First Quorum of the Seventy on 20 December 1836. Then came a second mission to the eastern states and the Fox Islands in the summer of 1837. He was called to membership in the Quorum of the Twelve 8 July 1838. Learning of the call on August 9, he returned west to Illinois 19 December 1838. Proceeding on westward to Missouri, he was ordained to the apostleship by Brigham Young at the temple site in Far West, Missouri, 26 April 1839.<br><br>His next mission was to England. He went to Preston, Lancashire, in the spring of 1840. Then, inspired to go south, he went to the home of John Benbow, in Ledbury, Herefordshire. There he baptized nearly 600 people in the spring of 1840. On 8 February 1841, together with Heber C. Kimball, he secured the British copyright to the Book of Mormon at Stationer's Hall in London. Then he returned to the United States with Brigham Young and other members of the Twelve, arriving in New York, and reached Nauvoo by 5 October 1841.<br><br>His subsequent service as a builder of the American West and as president of the Church deserves study by every young man and young woman. He plowed the first acres when the pioneers arrived, where the Centre Theater in Salt Lake City now stands at First South and State Streets. Although he presided over the Church as President of the Twelve following the death of President John Taylor in July 1887, he was not sustained as President of the Church until 7 April 1889. He left instructions that, upon his death and that of his successors, the First Presidency should be reorganized without delay. Elder LeGrand Richards, as a boy of seven, saw him and attended one of the sessions of the dedication of the Salt Lake Temple in April 1893. President Woodruff died 2 September 1898 in San Francisco, California, at the age of 91, a tremendous leader and a tremendous life!<br><h2><b>Laying a Foundation</b></h2><br>From his rich experience and with that background, I would like to call to your attention some concepts that I believe will be of help to you as university students and as future leaders.<br><br>Said he in 1857, speaking to young people:<br><br><i>You are now laying a foundation in the bloom and the beauty of youth and in the morning of your days to step forth upon the stage of life to act a conspicuous part in the midst of the most important dispensation and generation in which man has ever lived. And I can say in truth and safety that the result of your future lives, the influence which you will exert among man, and finally your eternal destiny for time and eternity will in a great measure depend upon the foundation which you lay in the days of your youth, the manner in which you store your mind and cultivate it while young.</i>[pp. 265–66]<br><br>I commend to you your opportunities as university students. Store your mind with useful knowledge and cultivate it. Take advantage of the facilities afforded you by your university. During my undergraduate days and also as a graduate student, I found it very profitable, about once a month, to circulate throughout the periodical room in the university library. I would sample the journals in the various fields, from accountancy to zoology. I was curious to know what people were thinking and saying in fields other than my own. Some things were more easily understood than others, but the effort was worthwhile. Occasionally I would come across an article that I would examine more closely, sometimes reading the entire thing. Another practice I found extremely useful was to gain a stack permit as soon as I was eligible for one. It permitted me access to the inner resources of the university library. Unfortunately, it did not come until I was a graduate student. But I took advantage of it and again would spend a few minutes every so often browsing through fields not my own major. As an undergraduate, I early discovered that the main reading room was well stocked with all sorts of reference works. Furthermore, the card catalog gave me access to the entire resources of the library. I majored in history and political science, studying, among other things, a great deal of European history. Having always been a bookworm, I was interested in literature. The university requirements did not permit me to take the course in literature I would have liked. So I read by myself. During those undergraduate years, particularly the junior and senior years, I read a great many historical novels, chief among them being those of Alexandre Dumas, with their picturization of events in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century France and England.<br><h2><b>The Privilege of Reading</b></h2><br>How does one learn? Let us call upon the wisdom of President Wilford Woodruff. Said he on one occasion:<br><br><i>There is one thing I wish particularly to impress upon your minds, and that is, the importance of improving your time while young in treasuring up knowledge and learning those things which will be useful to you in after life. I know from experience, and so do most parents, that the child cannot appreciate the worth of true intelligence, the importance of improving their time in storing up useful knowledge while they are young, as they will when they come to act upon the stage of life ... and feel the full force of the responsibilities of training up children. ... Do not be discouraged because you cannot learn all at once; learn one thing at a time, learn it well, and treasure it up, then learn another truth and treasure that up, and in a few years you will have a great store of useful knowledge which will not only be a great blessing to yourselves and your children but to your fellow men.</i>[p. 269]<br><br>Today, in the age of television and video discs, it is easy to spend a great deal of time watching and listening. Carefully selected, such experiences can add much to your learning. But, please do not neglect the privilege of reading. One can absorb many more words, ideas, and pages in a half hour of reading than are available in the usual television program. I was inspired some years ago by an intimate acquaintanceship with a member of the Council of the Twelve who, as a matter of course, would read as many as two hundred books in a year: Church books, scientific books, general information, and other useful literary materials. Parenthetically I can say I know it because it was Sister Durham's father, Elder John A. Widtsoe of the Council of the Twelve. He had an enormous capacity for absorbing knowledge. He did it by using his time wisely.<br><h2><b>A Blessing to Families</b></h2><br>On one occasion President Woodruff said:<br><br><i>I have felt for a long time, and I think I have realized to some extent that the duties resting upon us are very great, and we ought to strive to improve in wisdom and knowledge and in the principles of government, in order that we may know how to be fathers</i>[and]<i>mothers ... and learn how to be counselors and how to preside, not only in our own family circles, but wherever we may be called to act.</i>[pp. 270–71]<br><br>He was vigorous in expressing his views as to how young people may bless family life. The family, of course, is the most important unit of society and of the Church. Said he:<br><br><i>Obey your parents in all things and comfort their hearts, for you have the power to do this. When they are weary and pressed with the cares of life, seek to ease their burdens and smile upon them in their hours of sorrow and you will cast a charm of joy and peace around them which they cannot obtain from any other source.</i>[p. 267]<br><br>Further:<br><br><i>Be kind to your brothers and sisters and all with whom you associate; kind words and good manners will cost you nothing and will add greatly to the happiness of those around you.</i>[p. 267]<br><br>Today in the world and in our immediate circles, we see too much of anything but kind words and good manners. Can we not promote them in our own conduct, including choice of language, tone of voice, courtesy at all times? Further, President Woodruff counseled:<br><br><i>Be happy, be contented, enjoy the days of your youth, enjoy our peaceful homes, enjoy the society of your parents, brothers and sisters, while you have an opportunity, for the days of your youth will soon be gone. Manhood</i>[and womanhood]<i>will be upon you with all of its attendant cares and responsibilities.</i>[p. 267]<br><h2><b>Revelation for Men and Women</b></h2><br>Wilford Woodruff believed sincerely in the reality of revelation; that God lived, that Jesus Christ, his Son, was the great Revelator through his prophets and by means of the Holy Spirit. As President of the Church in October 1892, he declared:<br><br><i>One subject more I want to name, and that is with regard to our future. I will tell you what the Lord has revealed to me. You talk of revelation. I have had a good many revelations. We are not particularly required to write all the revelations given to us. Joseph Smith wrote revelations in his day, and we have them to read. ... There has been a good deal said about the rising generation of the</i>[Latter-day]<i>Saints. I will tell you what will come to pass.</i><br><br><i>My sons, the sons of my counselors, the sons of these apostles, and the sons of this people will rise up by the power of God and they will take this kingdom and bear it off. You need make no mistake about this matter. They are the element that God has ordained, the same as He ordained us, to do His work. Our posterity will not forsake the Lord, nor their fathers, nor their mothers, nor the work in which they are engaged. Too many of them, it is true, have been led astray; too many of them have been found where they should not be; but the bulk of the sons of this people will remain true and faithful to this work.</i>[pp. 272–73]<br><br>In using the language he did, referring to "sons" and the future, I am certain he would not exclude the young women, the daughters. For, on another occasion he made clear his belief:<br><br><i>It is the privilege of every</i>man<i>and</i>woman<i>in this kingdom to enjoy the spirit of prophecy, which is the Spirit of God; and to the faithful it reveals such things as are necessary for their comfort and consolation, and to guide them in their daily duties.</i>[p. 61]<br><br>As president of the Church in October 1892 he said, speaking about revelation:<br><br><i>These mountains contain thousands upon thousands of devoted women, holy women, righteous women, virtuous women, who are filled with the inspiration of the Almighty God. Yes, these women have brought forth an army of sons and daughters in these mountains, by the power of God, and these sons and daughters partake of the inspiration of their mothers, as well as of their fathers. ... Yes, we have revelation. The Church of God could not live twenty-four hours without revelation.</i>[p. 61]<br><h2><b>Grow in the Gospel</b></h2><br>I commend to you the lives of our great leaders. I commend to you the lives of great men and women in all generations. From them we can learn much. We can proceed to the next phase of life if we know more of the minutes of the previous meeting, if I can use that expression. Longfellow's words in the "Psalm of Life" may have aggravated the critics for mixing his metaphors, and so forth, but the truth remains that:<br><br><i>Lives of great men all remind us</i><br><i>We can make</i>our<i>lives sublime,</i><br><i>And, departing, leave behind us</i><br><i>Footsteps on the sands of time.</i><br><br>May you take advantage of your years at this university, may you take advantage of all its opportunities of which you are capable. May you couple them with increased growth in faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world, whose splendid life must be the model for us all. As to his divine nature, character, and sacrifice for our sakes, I testify. I further testify that, as the gospel has gone now "from Greenland's icy mountains" to "India's coral strand" (no. 40,<i>Hymns</i>), as we sang tonight, you will live to see it extend even farther in your day and generation because it is the work of the Redeemer of the world, the Lord Jesus Christ, and I so testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>G.

<h1>ots Are Not Reached by the Frost” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is an honor for me to be with you today. Although I didn't attend the Y, I have great pride in this university. I am proud of what you accomplish. I am impressed by your spirit and your enthusiasm and your unity. I hope that you take advantage of every moment that you are here. Take advantage of every opportunity before it is finished because this is a great university.<br><br>I feel it is a great responsibility to offer some thoughts to keynote the women's conference that will be held this week.<br><br>The interesting theme taken from the<i>Fellowship of the Ring</i>by J. R. R. Tolkien--"Deep Roots Are Not Reached by the Frost"--suggests many things. Because I am the general president of the Primary, it is not surprising that I would first think of children. And then as I contemplated the words of the theme, I also thought about trees. As I explored the thoughts that came to my mind, I found myself wanting to say something to you of growth and potential; something about hanging on in adversity; something of the life-giving, healing balm of loving service; and something of the challenges of life and the great promises of the eternities to come.<br><h2><b>The Englemann Spruce</b></h2><br>Our family spends most of our vacation time in the Bear Lake valley, where we have a cabin. When our children were young, one of our favorite activities was to go exploring the mountains in our open Jeep. Many a day we would pile into the red Jeep, all seven of us and the dog, and off we would go. There were no restrictions in those days, and so we were able to go almost anywhere. One day, when we were about twenty-five miles up St. Charles Canyon, we came upon a Forest Service sign pointing the way to the Englemann Spruce. We decided to see what the Englemann Spruce was. So we stopped the Jeep and walked up the narrow path. Truly, we were not expecting what we found at the end of the trail.<br><br>The Englemann Spruce is magnificent. It is a beautiful, thriving tree with deep blue green needles more than an inch in length. Its trunk is straight and more than one hundred feet tall. The tree is nearly twenty feet around. We all took hands and encircled the tree. We had to stretch to reach around that mighty trunk. The Forest Service estimates this tree has been growing there for more than two thousand years. Each of us standing there holding hands and feeling a little awestruck by this magnificent tree thought different things, I'm sure. I wondered about how it grew to be so large.<br><h2><b>How Trees Grow</b></h2><br>It is fascinating to learn how trees grow. Trees are the biggest plants in the world. They never stop growing as long as they live. Every new tree begins its life in a flower. There are many kinds of trees, and within each kind there are many different sizes and shapes. Only a few ever grow to be the size of the mighty specimen we had encircled.<br><br>The<i>World Book Encyclopedia</i>says:<br><br><i>A seed starts to grow when a grain of the pollen dust of a tree flower is caught on the sticky pistil of a flower of the same kind of tree. When a tree seed begins to grow, a new tree is 'born.' This tree inside a seed is extremely small, but it has all the essential parts needed for a tree. It has a tiny white thread which will some day turn into the trunk. This thread has a root tip at one end and a bud at the other end, plus two tiny leaves. This baby tree is packed into a tiny parcel with a good supply of food. It is covered with a weatherproof coat. When the seed is ripe, it leaves the parent tree and goes traveling. . . . Tree seeds often open and grow on top of the ground or lying on leaves, if the spot is wet enough to soften their hard seed coats. Then, by a wonderful law of nature, the thread-like stem expands and grows longer and stronger. The end with the root tip turns down pointing into the ground. Even if you turn over an opening seed so that its root end points up, it will turn down in a few hours, as though pulled by gravity. At the same time, the tip with the bud and the leaves turns up, as though pulled by the light of the sun.</i><br><br>It was hard to believe that this mighty spruce could have started as one tiny seed, but of course it did.<br><br>Those of you who have studied botany know what happens in the process of growth. A tree develops a crown. The uplifted trunk and outreaching branches and network of twigs make a broad, tall frame for the leaves. The leaves soak in the sunlight. The leaves use air, water, and sunlight to make food for the plant. A tree also develops a root system. The roots are the fastest growing part of a tree. Roots are longer and usually have more branches than the crown above them. They collect water in the damp ground and send it up the trunk to the leaves. The roots also serve as a mighty anchor which holds the tree upright.<br><br>The roots can only grow as fast as they get energy from the leaves in the form of sugar, vitamins, and hormones. The food-making operation of the leaves is controlled by the amount of water sent from the roots. There is in the tree a marvelous example of the constant interdependency and a graphic example of how the continuance of small acts leads to remarkable growth and strength. Our giant tree seemed almost indestructible, but of course it wasn't and it isn't. Just let the day come when the giant reaching, searching taproot cannot find a steady source of water, and the tree will begin to wither and fade. Death would not likely come by one mighty blow, but more likely by a gradual withering away.<br><h2><b>The Root System</b></h2><br>Well, we cannot go on all morning talking about how trees grow, but there's one other fascinating fact that I learned as I prepared for this moment today. The root system provides a long, strong taproot that pushes ever downward in a search for more and more water, and to give stability to the tree. But the chief water-collecting part of the root system is made up of tiny, pearly white hairs called root-hairs. The root-hair is as fine as a spider's thread. It grows so fast, the encyclopedia says, that you can see it lengthen if you watch the plant under a microscope. Root-hairs grow just back of the tip of the root. They appear suddenly, wherever there is moisture. Root-hairs push between soil particles. When it finds a particle that is covered with a film of moisture, the root-hair flattens and wraps around the particle to suck up the water. New hairs are constantly coming out and old ones are withering. The root-hairs are constantly radiating outward to increase the absorbing surface so that the tree might enjoy enough of the life-giving water.<br><br>Knowing that the Englemann Spruce reached more than one hundred feet in the air, just think what an amazing root system it has developed in the two thousand years--a system that we could not see, but that stretched down below us and reached out on every side.<br><br>I don't know what each of my children thought about this great tree as we stood encircling it with our stretching arms, but I do know that they remember the tree.<br><br>There are many things to think about when one looks at trees. I couldn't help reflecting on all that happened during the life of this tree, stretching back to just a few years before the birth of Christ--before cars, before television, before E.T. and Mork, and before Pac-Man. Interesting, isn't it, that this tree was here on the earth when the Savior came into the world to fulfill all that had been prepared before the foundation of the world?<br><h2><b>Fascinating Parallels</b></h2><br>There are some fascinating parallels in the life of the tree and in the life of a child. It occurs to me that children too come into the world very much like a flower--fragile and beautiful. There is in the newborn baby a special quality of innocence, potential, and vulnerability which evokes a very special tenderness. I never hold a baby without an overwhelming sense of wonder. The miracle of life overpowers me, and I find the infant beautiful no matter how different and unique it may be.<br><br>Just as the fertile seed of the tree possesses all of the essential parts needed to be a full-grown tree, so the unborn child from its inception has all the essential parts needed to become a full-grown human being. Inside each baby, as inside each fertile seed of the tree, there is the potential for mighty growth. Just as the seeds of the tree bring forth after their kind, so we too come forth after our kind.<br><h2><b>We Are Children of God</b></h2><br>We should never forget that we are children of God, and that means that there is within us the necessary power to become like our Father. It is an eternal principle--God has brought forth his own kind in us, and we have the potential to become as he is. This means that there is no end to our growth and development. I think it is a concept which gives comfort and hope to our lives.<br><br>We must never forget that we have this eternal potential. Achieving potential is one of the fundamental purposes of life itself.<br><br>Knowing then that we have this potential, we should not question our fundamental worth. One of the most significant contributions that the Primary makes in the lives of our children, and I believe in the lives of our officers and teachers, is to give us all these first straightforward statements of belief.<br><br>It is not a coincidence that the Primary song "I Am a Child of God" is so greatly loved around the world. "I am a child of God" is a simple statement of a magnificent concept. You can understand it, I can understand it, and all the children of the world, no matter what their language, can understand it:<br><br><i>I am a child of God,</i><br><i>And he has sent me here,</i><br><i>Has given me an earthly home,</i><br><i>With parents kind and dear</i><br><i>Lead me, guide me, walk beside me,</i><br><i>Help me find the way.</i><br>[Naomi Randall, "I Am a Child of God,"<i>Sing with Me,</i>no. b-76]<br><br>Almost all the work of Primary is designed to help our children find the way.<br><h2><b>What We Are on Earth to Do</b></h2><br>First, all of us must understand what we have come on earth to do. We're here to gain wisdom and knowledge. We're here to learn to love and to give service one to another. Being able to repeat the simple statements which summarize these great concepts is not all there is to learning. Learning also requires an application in daily life.<br><br>Life is a wonderful adventure, and working with the Primary children has brought back into my life a renewed enthusiasm for living. Children have a simple way of dealing with life. It is an approach that should not be lost. A child learns most when he or she is taught how to apply a moral teaching. Let me share with you an experience of my childhood. It made one of the ten commandments forever a part of my life. I speak of the commandment, "Thou shalt not steal." As a little girl, I worked in a small grocery store that my father owned and operated. One day while I was stocking the shelves, I noticed some little candies called "Guess-What's" on the counter. There was penny candy on the counter every day, but on this day which I shall never forget, I found myself wanting to have one of those little "Guess-What's," but I had no penny to pay for it. Somehow the wanting got the best of me, and although I knew it was not right, I picked up one of those little tempting candies and walked away. I cannot tell you how dreadful I felt. I knew I had done something wrong. I knew that 'because I was nine years old' my baptism would not cancel out this wrong deed. I felt terrible. I made up my mind I would never, ever take anything again which did not belong to me. I had been taught about honesty, and in that moment the Spirit confirmed the truth of that teaching by the terrible, disquieting spirit which raged within me as I violated that law. Children learn very rapidly, and what they experience stays with them a very long time.<br><br>Let me tell you about an incident that happened last October in Washington, D.C. I was there for the Women's Legacy Concert. During the day, a group of us went to the National Museum of Art. We stopped for lunch at the Gallery, and as the waiter brought the bill to me he said, "Do you want me to fill in the amount, or do you want to do that?" For just a moment, I did not catch the importance of his question. Then it came to me. He was giving me a chance to pad my expense account. I was distressed by the suggestion, and the teachings of my childhood came back to me--Be Honest. My own standard of honesty was what counted. It was a matter of integrity with me.<br><br>Integrity is built by little actions. When my son, who is a counselor in the priests quorum presidency, declines to leave a meeting on Sunday in order to go to the corner ice-cream store, he is building his own character. When we get up and leave a movie that is offensive to our own standards of decency, we're developing strength of character. Like the tree, we're sending small root-hairs out, and one day that massive system will be strong enough for us to stand firm against raging torrents.<br><h2><b>Lisa, Who Dared to Do Right</b></h2><br>I think of a little girl in England who dared to do right. The little girl's name is Lisa. She is an eleven-year-old girl in Primary and has been a member of the Church for three years. Lisa came home from school feeling very excited. She had been asked if she would read in the school assembly the following morning. She said, "Mum, I've been asked to read this tomorrow, but some of the words are wrong." The mother read the paper, and one paragraph referred to God and the Holy Ghost being one and the same person. The rest of it was correct, but just this paragraph was incorrect. They talked it over and decided that they would send a letter to Lisa's teacher, explaining that this paragraph was contrary to Lisa's beliefs and that she would feel much happier leaving this part out.<br><br>They waited rather anxiously for Lisa to return home from school to see what had happened. She came home with a big smile. Yes, the teacher had let her read the part, and, yes, she had let her leave that statement out. Also the teacher had thanked them for the letter, saying that she could understand her feelings, and then she said, "Could you please send some material to me and tell me more about what Mormons believe?"<br><br>The next day Lisa took a Book of Mormon,<i>Meet The Mormons,</i>and<i>A Marvelous Work and a Wonder</i>and gave them to the teacher. She found the books so interesting that she asked Lisa and three other Mormon girls in the school to present an assembly on the Mormons.<br><br>All of this came about because Lisa dared to be different and do right. Would you have the courage Lisa had?<br><h2><b>Association With Children</b></h2><br>When Jesus said we could not enter the kingdom of God except we become as a little child, I'm sure he was urging us to keep our sense of wonder. I'm sure he was reminding us to remain teachable. I feel sure he was encouraging us to keep our sense of accepting faith and our curious search for what makes the world go around. We can learn much from children.<br><br>If you do not have the opportunity to associate with children in your family, or if you do not serve in Primary, then you must take some action yourself. One young woman I know (her name is Gerry Avant, and you have probably read her by-line in the<i>Church News</i>) found herself in a situation where there were no children close to her. She did not want to be deprived of that experience, and she decided to do something about it. She arranged a clown party for the children of her neighborhood. The party was so successful that one little girl came to Gerry and said her family was moving, but she did not want to go because she would miss the next clown party.<br><br>More importantly, two of the little girls from two different families became Gerry's friends. They would come over to her house to play. Gerry has a large unfinished basement, and she provided them with puppets and some help in writing a script. Then the girls made a puppet stage from some large, empty cardboard cartons. After awhile they decided to invite the girls' families over for a family home evening. Gerry offered to buy cookies, but the girls wanted to use her kitchen and make brownies. She agreed. I tell you about this party because I think Gerry did an innovative and fun thing which enriched not only her own life, but the lives of some children.<br><br>There need be no barriers between adults and children, and oh, how the world's children need us to be mindful of them!<br><h2><b>The Deepest Taproot: Faith</b></h2><br>The deepest taproot of any human life is the one we might call faith. Do you remember Alma likening the word to a seed? This passage tells us how important it is to prepare a place for the seed to grow. Let me tell you about a stake Primary president in Hawaii who had prepared herself. Last fall her six-year-old son was run over by a car. Though the emergency medical team arrived before he died, she told me that when she picked up his little body and held it close, she knew he would not live. Others who knew her marveled at her great strength in the face of this terrible tragedy. "How did you get prepared to meet the loss?" I asked her. This is what she told me:<br><br><i>In the summer before the accident, I began to slip into a feeling of deep depression. I tried to talk myself out of it, but I could not. I prayed and I thought, and I had the strong impression that I was not doing my scripture reading. Another strong impression came to me: I was not attending the temple regularly. I resolved to do something in response to these feelings. I began to read my scriptures regularly, and I began to go to the temple twice a month. As I began to do them consistently, a strength and a peace came to me. When the accident happened, I was fortified. I could go on because I knew that he had died a celestial being, and I could become more nearly like him if I kept closely tuned.</i><br><br>That's one person's experience, but it illustrates how she sent out her little root-hairs to find more of the life-giving water that sustains.<br><h2><b>Loving Service</b></h2><br>We have talked about growth and potential, about gaining strength from adversity. When we are converted, we can stand alone against the storms around us, secure in the knowledge of the revealed truth. Then we can reach out and serve others. Acts of service can be very small or very large, but all should be done in the spirit of increasing our awareness of another's burdens.<br><br>This building of one's ability to give loving service does not need to wait upon a master plan. It can begin today. We always start where we are and then develop a plan to direct our efforts.<br><br>One of the most rewarding experiences I have had this year came when I decorated some rooms in a rest home with gas-filled balloons. These simple, colorful ornaments brought cheerful smiles and happy eyes.<br><br>At Christmastime I accepted an invitation to participate as a sub for Santa. I went to a grateful but humble little home. They had done all they could, but needed some help. Our family provided the finishing touches. But what I want to tell you about is the gift this little family gave back to the world. They had a little home in the middle of an industrial area. I did not go inside the home, but the outside was brightly lighted with Christmas lights adding a cheery holiday glow to that dreary, dismal neighborhood.<br><br>So let me urge you to realize that your first task to prevent the frost from killing your roots is to fill up with faith and testimony, to develop deep and complex root systems which make you sensitive and thoughtful of others. These two principles will give you the kind of strength and magnificence we saw in the giant Englemann Spruce on that day so long ago.<br><h2><b>The Children of the World</b></h2><br>Now may I share with you my deep concern for the children of the world. Who is caring for them? How will they get the loving nourishment they need to grow up into strong moral citizens? We all know what the Lord's plan is. He wants all his spirit children to come into the world where they can be cared for by a loving father and mother. He wants them to have stimulation for growth and refinement. He wants them to be taught the eternal truths of the gospel so they can stand firm against the winds of circumstance. He wants them to know the principles of salvation so that they can be about the business of working out their own salvation. I firmly believe that each of us has a responsibility to take the Lord's pattern and make it operative in our lives. We all belong to family units, either as a parent or as a child, and we should soberly address our attention to making those family units the place of hope and renewal which our Heavenly Father has taught us they can become.<br><br>But there are people and children whose circumstances in life are not favorable. The growth of the number of women in the workplace has shifted the care of children to alternate arrangements. More children now have mothers working out of the home full-time than has been the case in America before. Arrangements for children are made in day-care centers, with other relatives, or some other care-taking situation. Unfortunately, millions of school-age children have become latchkey children. That means they come home to empty houses and unsupervised hours of waiting. Many others of preschool years are left locked in their apartments while mothers go out to help provide the financial support for the family.<br><br>These are not ideal conditions for children. Study after study is carefully, painstakingly documenting for us the great need for infants and children to have loving, one-to-one care during their formative years.<br><br>Dr. Benjamin S. Bluhm of the University of Chicago declares that a child has gone 50 percent of the way in organizing the thinking patterns that we call his intelligence by the time he has reached the age of four, and the next 20 percent occurs by the age of eight.<br><br>Bruner observed that the child learns from careful, constant modeling, preferably of the mother. A skill is learned, reinforced--then the child reaches further. For this to be successful the child needs time--a lot of time--with some one person who cares enough and has time enough. Children without this one-to-one care do not develop so well.<br><br>Dr. Lamb, at the University of Utah, has recently compiled some of his studies into a book concerning infant social development. He found that the kind of response given an infant sets up lifetime patterns of expectancy. When a young child grows up in a home where the adult interaction is sensitive and caring, then the child comes to expect this relationship with other adults.<br><br>I read an article last year in<i>Time</i>magazine written by Roger Rosenblatt entitled "Children of War." He interviewed children in Ireland, Lebanon, Israel, Cambodia, and Vietnam. In spite of the terrible conditions in which they live, the children have something in common--a fierce desire to survive. In all their suffering and sorrow, these children still believe in goodness and in the need for good to overcome bad. Two things we might remember from these children: (1) They want to live, and (2) they reach out instinctively for the good. That does not surprise me for I know, as you do, that children are really celestial beings who dwell among us, saved in the celestial kingdom if they die before eight years of age. These children should be an example to us as they look forward with hope to a brighter day.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>Another who experienced sorrow and suffering was the Prophet Joseph Smith. He once said that he felt like a lone tree standing on the plain. He learned early in his life to send his roots deep so that his faith would steady him. He learned to develop a widely spread system of roots which could constantly nourish him. Think of the sensitive awareness he had of people. Think of the constant development of awareness of other people which made him sensitive to their needs. The people who knew him said he was a man of love and unceasing compassion. He was a man of prayer who sought the Lord, and the results were that people reached back to him and sustained him, and the Lord heard his prayers and came unto him.<br><br>These things we too must do here and now. We must seek the Lord, and we must become sensitive to the needs of others. Then we must give service to one another. Service is the life-giving water which renews our souls and lets us continue in our growth. There are plenty who need our loving concerns: the young, whom I've mentioned specifically, and many others who are around you every day. There is the power within us to do much good, for we are the children of God.<br><br>We have come to the end of our time together this morning, and I would like to observe that the ways you will use the ideas I've expressed and the ideas which you will hear from your conference speakers during the week are many and varied. But I hope that some of the things which are said will find their way like seeds into the soil of your heart and they will grow and grow until they give sustenance to your soul.<br><br><i>All that is gold does not glitter,</i><br><i>Not all those who wander are lost,</i><br><i>The old that is strong does not wither,</i><br><i>Deep roots are not reached by the frost.</i><br><br>May we grow strong and tall in our convictions. The day may come when we will have to stand as a lone tree against the sky. Let us become as that Englemann Spruce, each a mighty witness for the truth, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Dwan J.

It's a special privilege, brothers and sisters, to be with you on this Sabbath evening. I'm grateful for the invitation to return to this campus and to share some thoughts with you this evening. It is always an awesome responsibility to confront a congregation of this magnitude in this facility. There is something intimidating about being behind this podium.<br><h2><b>Three Facets of the Plan of Salvation</b></h2><br>Tonight I would like to speak to you about a condition that is essential to the plan of salvation. I refer to the condition of personal accountability. There are three principal facets of the plan of salvation that have a direct bearing upon personal accountability. One of them has to do with the provisions made for us by the Godhead over which we do not have control or which we cannot initiate ourselves. I refer to such provisions as the infinite atonement of Christ with all of its effects; the spiritual gifts, including the ministrations of the Holy Spirit; the saving ordinances and the priesthood authority necessary to perform them; the earth itself, and the organization of the Church; and the laws and principles embodied in the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Another facet of the plan of salvation directly related to personal accountability has to do with the personal attributes, or inherent qualities, that each of us possesses as a child of God. These would include our intelligence, our will or agency--our capacity to make choices and our capacity to respond to spiritual forces that emanate from God, which some have identified with our conscience.<br><br>A third related facet of the plan of salvation is environmental in nature. It is concerned with the circumstances we encounter here in earth life where laws of cause and effect are free to operate and where many alternatives are available to us. It is an environment ideally suited for testing and proving.<br><h2><b>Accountability Defined</b></h2><br>Personal accountability is affected by all of these aspects of the plan for the eternal progress of the children of God. It is very important for us to understand that, without the condition of personal accountability, the plan of salvation could not operate successfully.<br><br>Perhaps it would be helpful to attempt a definition of<i>accountability.</i>I do not believe that the standard dictionary definition encompasses all that the Lord ascribes to this condition or quality in human beings. There is a difference between accountability and responsibility. Responsibility relates to a set of duties or expectations that may be placed upon us by others or by ourselves. Responsibility places one in a position to be accountable.<br><br>Accountability has to do with one's exercising his own will in making decisions and following a course of conduct. It implies self-initiative and a measure of self-reliance. But it requires more than the ability to act for oneself. It must be guided by a knowledge of true principles. Accountability is heightened by the confirmation of the Holy Spirit as to what is right and wrong. In fact, to act in matters of great importance without this confirmation is to act unaccountably.<br><br>The condition of personal accountability is essential to the operation of eternal justice and judgment.<br><h2><b>Accountability and Covenants</b></h2><br>The Lord has said that one should enter into the covenants associated with the saving ordinances only when he has begun to be accountable (see D&amp;amp;C 29:46–47). In fact, we are advised that if, for some reason, and individual is limited or handicapped in such a way that he cannot function as an accountable person, and if he cannot be held accountable for willful choices affecting his behavior, then he should not enter into the covenants that require such accountability. He will not be judged on the same basis as an accountable person until such time as it is possible for him to function without the limitations (see D&amp;amp;C 134:12).<br><br>To the degree to which one becomes more fully accountable, he becomes more like God. Note the expression made with regard to Adam and Eve when they had partaken of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. "And I, the Lord God, said unto mine Only Begotten: Behold, the man is become as one of us to know good and evil" (Moses 4:28). Such knowledge is essential to accountability, and with this knowledge men become "free . . . to act for themselves and not to be acted upon, save it be by the punishment of the law at the great and last day, according to the commandments which God hath given" (2 Nephi 2:26).<br><br>The condition of accountability, therefore, is not to be avoided if one is to progress. It is, indeed, essential to progress in the Lord's plan of salvation.<br><br>It could be said that to the degree to which we attempt to avoid or escape from accountability ourselves, or to act in such a way that we inhibit the accountability of others, we interfere with the Lord's plan of progress.<br><br>As knowledge and experience increase and as spiritual enlightenment is enhanced, the level of accountability is raised. The degree to which an individual is expected to assert himself in the pursuit of good works is broadened.<br><br>I would like to share with you some suggestions regarding how we might act in a more accountable way and thereby increase our opportunities for eternal progress.<br><h2><b>I. Make Your Own Difficult Decisions.</b></h2><br>All of us are at times faced with decisions that have a profound effect on the course of our lives or upon the lives of those with whom we have the greatest influence. When we face such decisions, we may feel a reluctance to commit ourselves to a course of action. Sometimes there is the temptation to transfer the decision to someone else and thereby escape the accountability ourselves.<br><br>When I was serving as a young bishop with only limited experience in Church leadership and lacking much in the way of practical experience as well, I was approached by an elderly couple in my ward. They were old enough to be my grandparents. For years they had successfully farmed a piece of ground. They had been blessed in many ways and had reared a fine family. None of the children had showed an inclination to follow in their father's footsteps as a farmer. Increasing age and declining health had brought the couple to a point of decision as to what should be done with their farm. They were reluctant to have it pass from their hands after so many years of labor and careful improvement. The children could not agree on a plan of action. Some wished to keep the farm in the family and lease it for an income to be shared among the family members; others didn't care what decision was made.<br><br>One Sunday afternoon the couple appeared at my office in the ward chapel and asked to consult with me. They explained their dilemma and their reluctance to make a decision that might divide the family and jeopardize their own welfare for the remaining years of their lives. "We have come to you, bishop," the old gentleman said, "to ask you to find out for us what the Lord wants us to do."<br><br>I was humbled by the sincere trust that the couple were willing to place with me, but I sensed that the decision they were attempting to lay upon me and upon the Lord was not ours to make. I counseled them in the best way I could, tried to help them weight the alternatives, and then recommended that they prayerfully reach a decision themselves and ask their family to sustain them. They left my office in great disappointment, making it quite clear to me that they felt I was not fulfilling my responsibility as a bishop.<br><br>Whenever we try to avoid the accountability for decisions such as this in our own lives, I believe we fail to understand one of the purposes for which we came into mortal life. It is altogether proper and wise to seek the best possible counsel before making crucial decisions. It is sometimes necessary to seek inspiration through prayer and fasting. But I am convinced that the Lord does not want us to abdicate the accountability for the final choices we make. And I believe he honors those choices when we make them in the proper way. If we refuse to accept such accountability, we jeopardize our possibilities for progress and thwart the purpose for which we were allowed to come to the earth.<br><h2><b>II. Don't Rob Others of the Opportunity to Be Accountable.</b></h2><br>In our relationships with others, we must be careful not to prevent them from acting accountably. This is especially significant when we are given positions of leadership or responsibility which place others under our charge. The Lord's concern about this sensitive area in human relations called forth the excellent counsel that we find in section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants. The Lord warns us against exercising unrighteous dominion. He cautions against compulsion and controls. The proper way to influence the behavior of others, he says, is<br><br><i>by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned;</i><br><br><i>By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guile.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:41–42]<br><br>The Lord acknowledges the need to occasionally reprove with sharpness when inspired to do so, but counsels that even this reproof should be delivered in a spirit of love.<br><br>Manipulation, programming, and regimentation are destructive to personal accountability. It does not matter how benevolent the motive of a parent or leader who compels his children or his subordinates to follow his precise prescriptions. The motive does not prevent unfortunate results from occurring and the development of a conditioned dependency.<br><br>Significant to this observation is the acknowledgement that we grow into accountability. As infants we come into mortal life in a state of innocence (see D&amp;amp;C 93:38). Parents are made responsible for teaching their children about the purpose of life. They are to teach their children to pray and to walk uprightly before the Lord. They are to be models of righteousness (see D&amp;amp;C 68:25). All of this is to be done in order that the children can be brought to a state of accountability where they can become liable to the operation of eternal law and justice in consequence of their own willful conduct.<br><br>There is a difference between<i>willing</i>obedience and<i>willful</i>obedience. One may willingly submit himself to the requirements, controls, regulations, and domination of another in the performance of good deeds, but until he does it of his own free will (D&amp;amp;C 58:27), the essential intrinsic development of personal qualities and values does not occur. The performance is sterile of any lasting benefit to the doer of the deed. The Lord has warned us against doing only those things that we are commanded to do (see D&amp;amp;C 58:29). In so doing we become puppets, acting by the will of another.<br><br>It was for this reason that President John Taylor once made the following declaration subsequent to an experience in which someone had attempted to compel him unrighteously:<br><br><i>I was not born a slave! I cannot, will not be a slave. I would not be slave to God! I'd be His servant, friend, His son. I'd go at His behest; but would not be His slave. I'd rather be extinct than be a slave. His friend I feel I am, and He is mine:--a slave! The manacles would pierce my very bones--the clanking chains would grate upon my soul--a poor, lost, servile, crawling wretch to lick the dust and fawn and smile upon the thing who gave the lash! . . . But stop! I'm God's free man: I will not, cannot be a slave! Living, I'll be free here, or free in life above--free with the Gods, for they are free.</i>[B. H. Roberts,<i>The Life of John Taylor,</i>Bookcraft, 1963, p. 424]<br><br>I remember well an incident that occurred years ago involving my son Michael. Mike is the father of three children himself now; and I must add that he is a better father in many ways than I was. I suspect he would not remember this incident--even so, I think he would not mind my sharing it with you.<br><br>He must have been seven or eight years old at the time. We lived in Orem in a house that was located at the end of a dead-end street that extended for half a block off one of the well-traveled thoroughfares. Around the corner from our house and about two blocks up the through street was a small corner grocery store. It was usually open seven days a week.<br><br>Mike and I had some conversations about the responsibility for using money wisely. I had felt that my counsel with him on this matter had been well received and to good effect. We had also had a number of discussions with our little family about the importance of the Sabbath day.<br><br>Then one Sunday afternoon when we had returned to home following church services, Mike and several of his friends paraded into our living room where I was reading. The lady who lived down the street from us had just rewarded the boys with a twenty-five-cent piece for each of them for some yard work they had helped her with the day before. They proudly showed me their quarters and announced that they were going to walk down to the corner grocery store and buy some candy.<br><br>I caught myself just in time to stifle the inclination to say abruptly, "No, not on Sunday!" Instead, I reminded Mike about our talks concerning the use of money and called his attention to our family's policy about not going to the stores on Sunday. Mike was obviously troubled and a little chagrined at my response in the presence of his friends. I could tell that he was caught in a situation that was a bit difficult for him. It was a good opportunity, I felt, to let him make his own decision. "Well, Mike," I said, "you know what we have talked about concerning the use of money, and you know how Mother and I feel about keeping the Sabbath, so you decide for yourself what you ought to do."<br><br>The boys left our home and went out to the lawn in front of the house. I stood by a window where I would not be observed and watched. For a time the boys sat on the grass in a discussion that I could not overhear. I concluded that they were not going to the store, and I was complimenting myself on the wisdom that I had used in handling the situation.<br><br>Suddenly all the boys got to their feet and started down the street. They rounded the corner and were obviously headed for the store. I was not only disappointed; I was incensed. I determined not to let Mike go through with his obvious decision, and more than that, I was going to let him know in no uncertain terms how I felt about it.<br><br>I searched for the keys to our automobile, fearful that the boys would reach the store before I could intercept them. I backed out of our driveway and drove quickly to the intersection with the through street. As I was turning the corner toward the store, I saw the boys. They were within a hundred yards of their destination. They had stopped and were apparently having another discussion. I stopped and eased back into our street far enough that I would not be obvious to them. In a moment I could tell that a decision had been made, and Mike was walking alone toward our house while the other boys went on to the store.<br><br>I backed my car to our driveway and pulled under the carport to wait for Mike. In a moment he came through the adjoining lot where there was a prune orchard. He was taking a shortcut. He kicked at the clods of dirt as he came to our fence, and, without any comment to me as he saw me in the car, he entered the house and was soon engaged in an activity with his sisters.<br><br>I realized that, in my urgency to have my will obeyed, I had almost cheated Mike of the opportunity of making an important decision for himself. I learned an important lesson that day about allowing people to be accountable.<br><h2><b>III. Demonstrate Accountability by Doing Many Good Things of Your Own Free Will.</b></h2><br>A truly accountable person will not require direction in every act of Christian service. Neither will he require acknowledgement or reward for all the good he does. In his desire to emulate the Savior, he will "do many [good] things of [his] own free will" (D&amp;amp;C 58:27).<br><br>I once drove a considerable distance to attend a testimonial for a friend who was leaving his home for a new position in another section of the country. The winter weather was threatening and roads were hazardous. It would have been easy to excuse myself from the obligation. I had been given no part to play in the proceedings, and it was unlikely that I would be recognized in the throng that would undoubtedly gather. But this man had reached out his hand to me at a critical time and had touched my life; and my life had changed. I was compelled to go and join the others in paying him this honor.<br><br>The community in which the man had lived was a small one. He had never drawn about him much of the world's goods. The little business he had operated could have been profitable enough, but he was too interested in people to be much concerned with the profit motive. He was always available but never demanding. There was nothing ostentatious about his charity. Most of us had learned to take him very much for granted, and it is unlikely that he ever would have been given any public honor until his burial day, had not his unexpected leaving brought us to remember how important his influence and friendship had been to us. The gathering on this night was the spontaneous expression of our love and sense of loss.<br><br>This same spontaneity characterized the testimonial meeting. As we entered the hall in which the gathering was to be held, we were asked to sign our names on slips of paper which were then folded and placed in a cardboard box. When the large crowd was seated and the honored guest had taken his place on the stand, after a song and a prayer, the chairman arose to announce the proceedings. He pointed to the cardboard box which was now on the rostrum. Names would be drawn from the box, he explained, and those who were chosen in this manner would be asked to represent everyone present in expressions of love and gratitude for our departing friend.<br><br>One by one the names were drawn. As the hour passed, a procession of unrehearsed speakers filed to the podium and there unfolded the legacy of selfless service that this man had given. In absorbing the drama of the occasion, each one of us must have become sensitive to the goodness which had reflected from him and had become mirrored in one way or another in our own lives.<br><br>As the meeting drew to a close, the name of a local physician was extracted from the box. For many years the good doctor had lived as a neighbor to our honored friend. He had recently returned to his home following treatment in another state for what had proved to be a near fatal illness. He earnestly addressed himself to the gathering. For many years, he explained, he had contemplated the parallels in his own life and that of his neighbor. From his point of view, each of them had been preeminently involved in service to others. He told of leaving his home to make professional calls at hours both early and late and of frequently encountering our friend departing on what seemed to be similar errands of compassion. It was at these times, the doctor said, that he felt particularly drawn to his neighbor in a fellowship of service.<br><br>At this point the speaker paused involuntarily, and his voice became touched with emotion. Making reference to his recent illness, he related how he had left this same community several months before, not knowing whether he would ever return. No farewell testimonial had been held in his honor. He confessed that he had been a little disturbed by the obvious inequity in the attentions shown to him and to his neighbor, particularly in light of the service that both had given to the people of the community. Tonight, however, it had occurred to him why this was so.<br><br>With all of the apparent parallels between his life and that of his friend, there was one profound difference that set them apart in the eyes of their fellows. For all of his services, the doctor pointed out, he had collected a fee. That was the difference. He had not realized until now how much his fees had cost him.<br><br>Those of us who knew the good doctor and had been the recipients of his kindly ministrations realized that his self-deprecation was unjustified. But he succeeded in these dramatic circumstances in imparting a lesson that most of us will not soon forget.<br><h2><b>IV. Be Willing to Accept Difficulties without Blaming God.</b></h2><br>One of the provisions made for us by our Heavenly Father in his plan for our eternal progress was the nature of the environment into which we come in mortal life. As I mentioned earlier, life on earth is ideally suited to test us and prove us. Laws of cause and effect operate freely. There is opposition in all things. Conditions are designed to bring about the maturation and development essential to the progress of man in this mortal phase of his existence. Earth life is filled with risks. It provides no guarantee for safe passage. It expands our prospects for developing personal accountability.<br><br>No one passes through mortality without occasionally experiencing disappointment, heartache, and perhaps even tragedy. Once in a while, for reasons known only to him, the Lord responds to our pleading and our prayers of faith and miraculously rescues us from these trials. Generally, however, he expects us to cope with them. He trusts that our faith in him, our understanding of life's true purpose, and the infinite promises associated with his atonement for us will sustain us and enable us to endure. We act accountably when we accept these conditions and manifest our willingness to comply with the Lord's plan.<br><br>Too frequently we hear accusations against God for bringing difficulties or calamities upon us. Or we torture ourselves with the thought that God is punishing us because of our imperfections.<br><br>Such thoughts must have crossed the mind of Joseph Smith as he sat for months in a dark prison cell in Liberty, Missouri, while his family and friends in the Church were being driven and abused. It is well for us to remember the Lord's response to the Prophet's appeal for relief and for an understanding of the purpose in all of the difficulty. "Know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good" (D&amp;amp;C 122:7).<br><br>When burdens are lifted or when apparently inevitable consequences of illness or accident miraculously pass us by, we have cause for the deepest gratitude and thanksgiving. But when we are expected to endure, it should not be with an accusing spirit. The apostle Paul once wrote to the Saints in Rome, "For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us" (Romans 8:18).<br><br>And the Lord said to the Prophet Joseph:<br><br><i>My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;</i><br><br><i>And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:7–8]<br><br>There is a most meaningful account given in the Book of Mormon of Nephi, the son of Helaman. Nephi lived in a time of great wickedness. His efforts to draw the people back to the Lord had been largely futile. Nephi fell into a state of despondency. The record tells us:<br><br><i>And it came to pass as he was thus pondering--being much cast down because of the wickedness of the people . . . a voice came unto him saying,</i><br><br><i>Blessed art thou, Nephi, for those things which thou hast done; for I have beheld how thou hast with unwearyingness declared the word, which I have given unto thee, unto this people. And thou hast not feared them, and hast not sought thine own life, but hast sought my will, and to keep my commandments.</i><br><br><i>And now, because thou hast done this with such unwearyingness, behold, I will bless thee forever; and I will make thee mighty in word and in deed, in faith and in works; yea, even that all things shall be done unto thee according to thy word, for thou shalt not ask that which is contrary to my will.</i>[Helaman 10:3–5]<br><br>Nephi had demonstrated that he could be entrusted with the powers of God. He had proved himself fully accountable to do the right things for the right reason. The Lord's pronouncement to him is impressive: "Behold, thou art Nephi, and I am God. Behold, I declare it unto thee in the presence of mine angels, that ye shall have power over this people" (Helaman 10:6).<br><br>The same promise is given to all who will prove themselves accountable as Nephi had done. In our own day the Lord has said: "Then shall they be gods, because they have no end; therefore shall they be from everlasting to everlasting, because they continue; then shall they be above all, because all things are subject unto them" (D&amp;amp;C 132:20).<br><br>May we live in such a way that we will one day be personally accountable before God in doing all that he expects of us--not because we are compelled to do so, but because it has become our own will as well as his. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Dean L.

<h1>Eternal Goals - J. Thomas Fyan - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
What you were when you went to bed last night is about what you are this morning. When you awakened, there was not much of a change during the night. You had certain talents last night; you still have those talents this morning. So, I think we can conclude that what we will be tonight, we will be tomorrow morning. In fact, the scripture tells us that same spirit that possesses your body at the time that you go out of this life will have the power to possess your body in that eternal world (<i>see</i>Alma 34:34). Where do you want to be in the eternal world? What you are today? Do you have a goal or a target in mind? Would you like to make some changes?<br><br>We are told once again in the Doctrine and Covenants (88:22) that he who is not able to abide the law of the celestial kingdom cannot abide a celestial glory. We find ourselves moving into a circumstance where we feel comfortable. You are here because this is the environment in which you want to find yourself. All our activities of life will prepare us to live in a celestial kingdom, or a terrestrial, or a telestial. It's up to us.<br><h2><b>How Do You Set a Target?</b></h2><br>Several law enforcement officers were returning home after attending a special school in marksmanship. As they drove through the countryside, they noticed a large barn covered with painted bullseye targets.<br><br>It aroused their curiosity to the point that they pulled off the freeway and found the lane that led to the farm where the barn was located. They drove over to the barn and were greatly surprised to see a bullet hole precisely in the center of each bullseye.<br><br>The farmer came out to see what the men wanted.<br><br>They told him they had never seen such excellent marksmanship. "Who is this person with such outstanding ability? Is it you?" they inquired of the farmer.<br><br>He said, "No. It's my son."<br><br>"Is he here? May we see him?"<br><br>"Well, yes, he is around somewhere."<br><br>"Could he show us how he is able to shoot in such a superior way?"<br><br>The farmer said, "Well, my son isn't quite bright. He has a learning difficulty, but if you would like to see how he has done this, let me see if I can find him."<br><br>Soon the farmer returned with his son. He said, "Son, show these men how you shoot your rifle." The young man walked some distance from the barn, turned, pointed his rifle, and shot. Then he walked over to the barn, found where the bullet passed through the siding, picked up a can of paint, and promptly painted the bullseye around the hole.<br><br>You would be wise to aim toward the eternities and know that your marksmanship would place you in the presence of your Heavenly Father.<br><br>A meaningful scripture counsels us to--<br><br>1. learn our duty,<br><br>2. act in the office in which we are appointed<br><br>3. [act] in all diligence (<i>see</i>D&amp;amp;C 107:99).<br><br>What process can we use to accomplish this?<br><br>"Commit thy works unto the Lord, and thy thoughts shall be established" (Proverbs 16:3).<br><br>* Committing requires action; action carries us toward our goal.<br><br>* Without appropriate goals, life can be very drab and commonplace.<br><br>* Write down your major aim in life. From this very act comes power.<br><br>* Using a magnifying glass to zero in on a particular spot will create tremendous energy.<br><br>* Concentrating light on a specific object will bring about an explosion of progress.<br><br>* The establishment of goals in our lives is of extreme importance; without them we are blind.<br><br>* There is a difference between a wish and a goal.<br><br>* We should make our days count, not just count days.<br><br>* Perhaps there should be more doing rather than more knowing; let's work within the framework of all we know.<br><br>A computer is a wonderful tool. It has tremendous power for solving complex problems. Even with all this latent power, if it is not properly programmed, is without direction, or remains unstimulated, it will not serve its purpose and proper progress will not be made.<br><h2><b>What Is Our Goal?</b></h2><br>We ask ourselves, "Why have goals? Why have something to shoot at?"<br><br>The answer is, "Our goal ought to be to become a worthy son or daughter of our Heavenly Father." Our Father has a plan to help us accomplish this goal.<br><br>In fact, we were present and accepted the Lord's plan. There is a heavenly goal clothed in these words:<br><br><i>For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.</i>[Moses 1:39]<br><br>Satan's objective is to destroy this plan. He does everything in his power to place obstacles in our path that we might stumble. Goals are daily, weekly, yearly--yes, they cover a lifetime. They are vital to us as youth and as adults. But they are only wishes unless we put them into action. As we fashion our lives, we should look beyond the veil.<br><h2><b>Why Have a Goal?</b></h2><br>A person with goals is the master of his life.<br><br>If the standards on the football field were taken down and the zero-yards line erased, how would you know if you had made a goal? How would you know if you were winning? Without a goal, one doesn't know if he has arrived.<br><br>Goals that are challenging and yet attainable draw performance upward.<br><br>The disciplined spirit is the master of the body.<br><br>Goals become an organizing tool to achieve. They eliminate meandering behavior.<br><br>Goal setting is an art, and pursuing goals is a skill.<br><br>Reading the scriptures is a great aid to understanding our goal. The gospel gives us direction and purpose in life.<br><br>Now, there are a number of approaches in creating goals, but may we consider at least one process today? It is composed of seven points.<br><h2><b>The Process of Creating Goals</b></h2><br>1. Select your goal prayerfully. Get a confirmation from the Lord. He asks us in the sixth section of the Doctrine and Covenants, "Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter?" (D&amp;amp;C 6:23), showing how he lets us know the rightness of our choice. Have peace in your mind as you prayerfully select your goal.<br><br>2. Lay out a plan for attaining the goal. Get a road map. Put it in writing.<br><br>3. Break the plan into logical steps. There are short-range, medium-range, and long-range goals. If you are going to carry the ball into the end zone, there must be training, exercising, body preparation--of course, you know we are talking about both the physical and the spiritual body in the eternal goals.<br><br>4. Share this goal with others. Make an open commitment. Get others involved to help you succeed.<br><br>5. Measure your progress. How far is it to the goal?<br><br>6. Evaluate your successes and your shortcomings. Ask yourself, "How did I gain the greatest yardage?" Another question would be, "Why did I fumble?"<br><br>7. Adjust plans to take advantage of the successes and overcome the shortcomings. You may think that you perhaps should make your offense more vigorous. Maybe we better pass more. At that point you can start the process over again: Get a reconfirmation. Keep it constantly before the Lord.<br><h2><b>We Must Keep at It</b></h2><br>Living the gospel is somewhat like combing your hair--no matter how well we did it yesterday--we have to repeat it today.<br><br><i>And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?</i><br><br><i>Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like:</i><br><br><i>He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.</i><br><br><i>But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.</i>[Luke 6:46–49]<br><br>Sometimes we pamper ourselves with self-indulgence. We satisfy our short-term wants in place of real heartfelt commitment to our long-term goal. Be sure, as you are climbing to the top rung in the ladder of life, that it isn't leaning against the wrong wall.<br><br>We are in this life to develop spiritual character. Character is what we are; reputation is what people think we are. Abraham Lincoln once said, "Character is like a tree and reputation like its shadow. The shadow is what we think of it; the tree is the real thing. (Burton Stevenson, comp.,<i>The Home Book of Quotations,</i>New York: Dodd, Mead &amp;amp; Company, 1956, p. 234). Sometimes a shadow is much longer or shorter than the tree, depending on the lighting or our angle of observation. In a storm when the sun is obscured by clouds, there is no shadow, but the tree still exists. The tree is real. Spiritual character is the real you. It is what is taken with you into the eternities when all else is left behind.<br><h2><b>Climbing a Mountain</b></h2><br>A vision is given us in this invitation: "Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob" (Isaiah 2:3).<br><br>Climbing mountains is an arduous challenge. As we prepare to climb a mountain, our first step is to select a mountain, and then we should ask, "What is the mountain like?" We will acquire a guide who knows the way and learn from him some of the requirements for the ascent. An important preparation will be to secure the proper equipment and clothing. We will plot the campsites on the side of the mountain. We will set intermediate goals on the way up.<br><br>We will plan how we will ascend the perilous heights where cold winds chill our bones. Where are the stepping-stones carved into the almost vertical face of the mountain where we will have to move with great care? We are told that we will have to make the final ascent alone. Communications with the guide on a two-way radio will be established.<br><br>We will through prayer attune ourselves to the heaven above the mountain that we might have the constant companionship of the Spirit. We must do more than stroll through life. We must climb.<br><br>In your trek up the mountain of life, don't carry the additional weight of unrepented foolishness. Don't be breathless in your climb burdened by this unneeded pack. Discard it; throw it down the mountainside. Forget it. The Lord says he will forgive and forget. Let us merit forgiveness; then with the help of the Lord, we can forget.<br><br>What are some of the specific pitfalls that we must watch for as we climb?<br><br>No one ever smoked his first cigarette or took his first drink or tried drugs because he needed the cigarette or the alcohol or the drugs. Everyone who tries tobacco or alcohol or drugs does so because he needs something else. He may think he needs the approval of his friends. He may think he needs to rebel against authority. He may think he needs the excitement of experimentation. Or he may think he needs to avoid being called "chicken" or "square" or "turkey" or whatever term is apropos at the moment.<br><br>What he really needs to think of is how to deal with feelings of insecurity, how to measure and appropriately respond to peer pressure, how to recognize destructive rebellion, or how to build a positive self-image. If you never take the first cigarette or the first drink or the first drugs, you'll never suffer the consequence of subsequent results.<br><br>Now, if you have stumbled, try to learn from adversity. If the only thing you have gained from this experience is the bitter taste of being broken by gospel principles, then resolve that never again will you partake so you can avoid the anguish, the desperation of noncompliance with eternal laws. You may<i>know</i>your duty but when you<i>act</i>contrary to your knowledge, you bring upon yourself the bitter fruits of broken laws. Your soul will be seared, but there is hope:<br><br>"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest" (Matthew 11:28).<br><br>Avoid the environment in which the wrong crowd places you in a circumstance where temptation abounds. Then you won't have to say: "Why did I get myself into this stupid situation?"<br><h2><b>Help Is Available</b></h2><br>When did you have your last toothache? It was probably very painful at the time. Or has time erased the distasteful feelings? To ease this discomfort, you sought help from the expert hands of one who was competent to administer relief. Perhaps the treatment to relieve the pain hurt, but you were so anxious to normalize your condition, it was worth it.<br><br>How long ago did you last have a heart pain caused by nonadherence to your knowledge of duty when you didn't act in all diligence? To ease this discomfort, did you seek the haven of expert hands of one competent to administer relief. Were you willing to accept the treatment of repentance with its making right the wrong? Did you resolve to know your duty and act in all diligence?<br><br>Thoughtful priesthood leaders are spiritually prepared to bind up the wound if it be necessary to only apply a little Mercurochrome and put on a Band-Aid while healing occurs. If the wound is deeper, perhaps iodine will have to be administered. It will sting. Maybe you will have to have stitches to close the gaping hole. Whatever the treatment, the renewed spiritual health will be worth it. Everything done will be founded on the pure love of a caring Father in Heaven.<br><br>More than a hundred years ago in a small remote place in Arizona lived a family sent there by President Brigham Young to make peace with the Indians.<br><br>The father of the family was away on Church business when an impression came to him that something was wrong at home. He responded to this feeling by heading there at once. He arrived at about four o'clock in the morning. His wife had cuddled in her arms their little baby daughter who had fallen into an open fireplace. She was severely burned. The mother, in grief, said, "Let her die. She will be so disfigured."<br><br>The father took this little infant in his arms and gave her a blessing. He promised her that she would live, that she would not be disfigured, and that she would sing before the prominent of the earth.<br><br>This baby girl did live, she matured in life, was not disfigured, raised a family, and sang in the Tabernacle Choir. The powers of heaven gave life to that tiny child. That sweet baby girl, in maturity, gave me life. She was my mother.<br><br>I owe my very existence to the power of prayer.<br><h2><b>President Reagan on Prayer</b></h2><br>At the meeting of the religious leaders of the United States in Washington, D.C., a luncheon was held in the state dining room. President Reagan had addressed us, and then we had lunch.<br><br>After lunch, the meeting was opened for questions and comments. One of the persons present said, "Mr. President, we want you to know that we pray for you."<br><br>President Reagan's response was, "Thank you. I have great faith in intercessory prayer." Then he paused and thoughtfully expressed his feeling, "Sometimes when we pray, we then wait for the Lord to do something. I suspect that when we pray the Lord is waiting for us to do something. And, by the way," the president added, "if you ever find the line busy as you wish to pray, know that I am on the line."<br><br>Sprinkle your lives generously with the uplifting experience of communion with our Heavenly Father. How great is the power of prayer!<br><br><i>If radio's slim fingers can pluck a melody</i><br><i>From night--and toss it over a continent or sea;</i><br><i>If the petalled white notes of a violin</i><br><i>Are blown across the mountains or the city's din;</i><br><i>If songs, like crimson roses, are culled from thin blue air--</i><br><i>Why should mortals wonder if God hears prayer?</i><br>[Ethel Romig Fuller, "Proof,"<i>Masterpieces of Religious Verse,</i>ed. by James Dalton Morrison (New York: Harper and Brothers, 1948), p. 407]<br><h2><b>How Long Is Eternity?</b></h2><br>As we look forward to living in the eternal world, perhaps this question comes to our mind: How long is eternity?<br><br>If you were an ant with a goal of building a nest of pine needles in the football stadium here at Brigham Young University and had the capacity to carry one pine needle on your back, and you crawled the hundreds of miles to the state of Washington, placed a pine needle on your back, and returned to the stadium to deposit the pine needle and begin the nest, then you would have a hint of the length of eternity. Next, if you were to crawl the thousands of miles to Massachusetts to get another pine needle, your return to the stadium would give you a greater inkling of eternity.<br><br>Then go down to Florida and return with a pine needle and then to southern California and back to the nest you are building. Then go to Alaska and then to Argentina, returning each time with one pine needle. A more profound understanding of eternity would come to you.<br><br>Contemplating the gathering of<i>all</i>the pine needles from all the states and all the nations in all the world would allow the length of eternity to finally dawn upon you.<br><br>Life is eternal. Today is a part of that eternity. The decisions and acts of today influence our arrival at the final goal.<br><br>I asked my wife what she would say to you if given the opportunity to speak at a BYU Devotional. I wanted her to feel some of the pain of preparation and have her sympathize with me. She was silent in thought for a moment or two.<br><br>"Would you really like to know what I would tell them?" she asked.<br><br>"Of course," I replied.<br><br>What it has taken me thirty minutes to say she could tell you in three words: "Live the commandments."<br><br>You can forget my talk, but don't forget hers.<br><br>For our journey through this life and the eternities, we have a partnership with our Father in Heaven. He has given us a key to guide us in knowing the truth of our plans and goals to be achieved. If you will ask God, the Eternal Father, recognizing the tremendous power in prayer,<br><br><i>in the name of Christ, ... with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.</i>[Moroni 10:4]<br><br>On your trek up the mountain of life stay close to the Spirit.<br><br>Your faith will be tested. You will face obstacles that will seem almost insurmountable. Others have gone that same course.<br><h2><b>Do As the Children of Israel Did</b></h2><br>When the children of Israel had wandered in the desert for forty years and now it was time for them to cross the Jordan and go into the promised land, they found a condition that was very adverse. The Jordan was swollen to overflowing, and in the book of Joshua we find this:<br><br><i>And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan</i>[and they knew from their mental processes that walking into the Jordan River would cause them to lose their lives, but here was a test of faith],<i>and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest,)</i><br><br><i>That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon an heap ... and were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.</i><br><br><i>And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan.</i>[Joshua 3:15–17]<br><br>You will have to dip your feet into the brim of the water, but move forward, having full and complete faith in you heavenly father. (1) Learn your duty. You have a marvelous opportunity here at this institution to do that. (2) Act, move, climb the mountain. (3) Do it in all diligence.<br><br>The beautiful rendition at the beginning of this program with the theme of the Savior suggests that there is the pattern of life. I witness to you with every fiber of my being that he lives, he is real, and because he lives today, we will live in the eternal world. May the Lord bless you that you will attain the goal, climb the mountain, I pray humbly in the worthy name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>J.

<br>
<h2><b>Find a Way to Enjoy It</b></h2><br>I have borrowed for my remarks this evening somewhat from one of my wife's talks given recently, and I hope that I can do justice to it. The story that I refer to begins when I was appointed to be the mission president in Brazil. As we presented this assignment to our children, our nine-year-old daughter was desolated with the thought that she would have to leave home and all her friends. We did our best to settle her down and brought out some pictures and showed examples of experiences we might have. It comforted her a little, and she then asked, "How long do you have to be a mission president?"<br><br>I said, "Well, it varies. Some presidents go for five years and some go for two years."<br><br>She said, "OK, let's go for two years." It turned out to be five.<br><br>We got our family together and suggested that most families would look forward for twenty years or more and save all their money to have that kind of an experience. So, if we were going to have that privilege, we had better enjoy it now. Out of that attitude was born one of our principal family mottoes: "Enjoy it."<br><br>We had some problems trying to enjoy it. Early in our mission, some days were dismal--especially for my wife. A little child was born to us ten days after we arrived, and that meant two little babies in diapers. The weather was rainy, the dryer didn't work, the clothesline wasn't of much use, the maid didn't speak English, and when I came into the home one day my wife was in quite a state.<br><br>I suppose I should have given her comfort, but I tried to show her some of the enjoyment we could have while we were there in Brazil. It didn't penetrate until I suggested that someday in the distant future we would return home, and that, when we did, we would remember that experience and that particular day. We would laugh heartily with our friends about the hardships we endured in Brazil. Wouldn't it be a shame, I suggested, to go through all that experience and have so much fun over it in the years ahead and not enjoy it now?" Sister Bangerter saw the point and caught the vision. Because of the motto we had developed, she immediately brightened up and began to enjoy all those otherwise difficult experiences.<br><br>That same attitude has helped us in many circumstances up to the present time. Recently we talked with a young mother who was having a problem managing her five children. She was expecting the sixth. We all know that the burdens can become difficult. Things were not smooth in her home. There was a tendency to shout and scream at the children and try to get them to follow orders. It was overwhelming. My wife and I stopped her recital of troubles and said, "Let's take a little perspective of your circumstance. Think back on what you wanted to be a few years ago. If you were thirty-five years of age right now and you weren't married, what would you rather be in all the world?" She said she would rather be married and have a family.<br><br>"So you happen to have the exact circumstances you most of all desire. Now analyze what your training and background has been. You were trained as a schoolteacher. If you were hired to take care of other people's children, you would work it out very well to manage five children. You have a knowledge of psychology and how to control difficult situations. Just put that to work. You will find that you have full capability to deal with all your problems."<br><br>So we are able in many difficult situations to find our way and overcome what would otherwise be discouragement.<br><h2><b>Our Second Estate</b></h2><br>It is vital for us to remember who we are and to keep our perspective. What I really want to talk about is the assignment we have as explained to us in the scriptures that makes us understand something of our nature and our purpose in the world.<br><br><i>And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said unto those who were with him: We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell;</i><br><br><i>And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them;</i><br><br><i>And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon; and they who keep not their first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate; and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever.</i>[Abraham 3:24–26]<br><br>We must remember that we are here to keep our second estate.<br><br>How then can we enjoy the experiences of the second estate? There is a richness in the various seasons and episodes that come to us in life. I am sure there are children who have had a miserable time getting through the period of their childhood, but not ordinarily, especially among the Latter-day Saints. We were blessed in our childhood. It says in 1 Nephi that "the time cometh speedily that the righteous must be led up as calves of the stall, and the Holy One of Israel must reign in dominion, and might, and power, and great glory" (1 Nephi 22:24). I think that--although this reference is probably more directly to the millenium--Latter-day Saints have the privilege of living under the protection that could be compared to calves growing up in a stall. There are exceptions of course, even here at Brigham Young University. Some of the calves have been way out in the sagebrush, if you understand what I mean. In the years that I attended here, I still remember my English professor as he struggled to understand papers we were submitting. He would occasionally take exception to the expressions we used and say, "That's sagebrush, brother; that's sagebrush!" If we tried to be a little too sophisticated in our writing, he would say, "That's jargon, brother; that's jargon!" So we had a refining process going on that probably still goes on for each of you.<br><h2><b>Life Experiences</b></h2><br>There is in each of the episodes of our lives a great and enjoyable experience. In looking backward I can relate to some of the tremendous blessings and opportunities that have come to me. I wonder how many of you have looked at the life of David of the Old Testament and imagined the romance that attached to his existence. He was "born into the Church" of faithful parents, brought up, no doubt, in an understanding of the gospel. In his early years he was sent out on the frontier, so to speak, to have experience with animals on the range. There he met the elemental things of nature, struggled with the lion and the bear. He had opportunity for inward reflection and developed an artistic and poetic nature. He composed great verses and became, in his own right, a musician. On an occasion he visited the army and there met one of his greatest challenges. As he faced up to Goliath, blessed by the Spirit of the Lord, he suddenly became overnight a national hero. From then on his life was marked with special achievement. I suppose if he were to live today, he would have been outstanding in almost every endeavor you could imagine. He would have been an All-American or the winner of the World Series. If he had gone to war, he would have received the Congressional Medal of Honor. He would have probably been called as one of the Twelve Apostles, and so on. What an entrancing and inspiring experience David had! He stands as one of the great figures of history. I believe that each of us can relate in some degree to the experiences that David had.<br><br>I remember listening to LeGrand Richards. I think I'm one of the few men in the Church that understands one of the things he said. He used to talk about when he worked on a header. (Is there anybody here besides me who knows what a header is?) He could talk about his enjoyment out on the dry farm with the header, and I can relate to that. I think of the experiences of my youth when one of the greatest thrills was to see the old steam-powered threshing machine come chugging up the lane, pull into our yard, and set up for business. I had the opportunity to work and live with horses and to gain a skill that has now lost its value. We remember our family and home life, going to school, going to college. These are all tremendous opportunities.<br><br>It is interesting to notice that many young people can hardly wait until they get these things over with. They want to leave home in the midst of one of the most precious experiences of life. They want to hurry up and get college over with so that they can go out and start to really live. I wonder why we don't start living now.<br><br>Think of the privilege of receiving the priesthood and giving missionary service. Some missionaries can hardly wait to get their missions over with, and then they remember it for the rest of their lives and wonder why it passed so quickly. Shouldn't they live it up?<br><br>Courtship and marriage, not the way it is often publicly portrayed, but in the sweetness and glory of refreshing and vital youth, is a time to have that special association that can be treasured forever, not to be hurried through so that we can begin to live happily ever after, but to be enjoyed now.<br><br>I remember when I was taken into the military. No one dreaded going into the army more than I did. I didn't know what was ahead of me, but fortunately I found that I was involved in one of the most choice and rewarding experiences in my life. I never dreamed before I entered the army that I would have the privilege to fly airplanes. That was something only to be dreamed about. But suddenly the opportunity came, and I was involved in a most interesting, rewarding, and trying experience that I have been able to look back on with wonder.<br><br>Each of us has to choose our life's work, to do something that will contribute to the good of the world. All people, as they select their courses, should be sure they are worthy of invoking God's blessing upon their work. It has often been said that a good business transaction must be of benefit for both parties. That truth is often lost sight of as we try to take advantage because of a few dollars.<br><br>Add to those life experiences the privilege of having children and rearing them. Some parents think it is an endless task, but suddenly it comes and is gone. At my age you realize how fleeting those moments are. If you haven't taken time to appreciate and enjoy that association while it is there, you will have lost one of the choicest experiences in life.<br><br>And add to that Church service. Let it not be wasted. Let's not be in a hurry always to get somewhere. As we have taken trips with our children, the little ones get anxious after the first fifteen minutes, and say, "When are we going to get there?"<br><br>And we say, "Oh, it will be hours from now, or maybe days."<br><br>But they say, "But we want to be there now." They can't wait. Why don't we enjoy the journey?<br><h2><b>Discouragement Should Not Dim Enjoyment</b></h2><br>You cannot possibly enjoy the harvest until after you have labored in the field. Discouragements are a part of life, and it sometimes becomes the attitude of those in tribulation to look upon the discouragement as persecution. Again, going back to the army days, it is a God-given right for soldiers to complain. They have another word for it in the army, but every soldier is entitled to do it, and they do it with great effect. As I indicated, I had the privilege of getting into flight training and being in a very select activity. Even there it wasn't all rosy. There was an awful lot of pressure, sometimes some real danger. If we weren't in danger of having an accident or losing our lives, we were in what was a worse danger, that of being chastised by our instructor. They kept pressure on us almost night and day, pressures of the classroom, of hoping that we could pass our flight checks. That sometimes felt like trouble, and many of our companions, knowing that they would rather be there than anywhere else in the world, still complained about almost everything that happened. It is a common attribute of humanity.<br><br>Instead of being discouraged under stress, why not appreciate the difficult moments and look forward to what they will lead to in the future? We then who have a knowledge of the purpose of life ought to let the gospel light up our lives. I refer to what we call the good news of the gospel, to the good tidings of great joy.<br><h2><b>Joy in Scriptural Accounts</b></h2><br>To begin, I'd like to talk a little about Adam and Eve. They certainly had a right to be discouraged. After they had transgressed, the Lord said, "Out with you. I'm through with you, you're going to die." He didn't explain anything about the hope they might have, but cursed them and told them to go out and earn their bread by the sweat of their faces. So they obeyed and struggled. As they labored through that process, it says in the scripture that they became parents and then grandparents. Quite a few years passed, and they still didn't know what hope was. They heard the voice of the Lord speaking in the direction of the Garden of Eden, and he commanded them to offer sacrifice. One day, it says, "After many days"--you can add that up to thirty or forty years--of hopelessness, Adam was offering a sacrifice, and the angel of the Lord appeared and said, "What are you doing?"<br><br>Adam answered, "I'm offering a sacrifice to the Lord."<br><br>"Why are you doing that?"<br><br>"I don't know. The Lord commanded me to."<br><br><i>Then the angel spake, saying: This thing is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father, which is full of grace and truth.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, thou shalt do all that thou doest in the name of the Son, and thou shalt repent and call upon God in the name of the Son forevermore.</i><br><br><i>And in that day the Holy Ghost fell upon Adam, which beareth record of the Father and the Son, saying: I am the Only Begotten of the Father from the beginning, henceforth and forever, that as thou hast fallen thou mayest be redeemed, and all mankind, even as many as will.</i>[Moses 5:7–9]<br><br>What great news! What he and Eve, his wife, must have felt at that time! And they blessed God and were filled; they prophesied being filled with the Holy Ghost.<br><br>There are other episodes of a similar nature. Luke wrote:<br><br><i>And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.</i><br><br><i>And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.</i><br><br><i>And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.</i><br><br><i>For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.</i>[Luke 2:8–11]<br><br>Now you may imagine what the greatest news could be that you could receive. You may be able to imagine the joy we felt when the Second World War ended. The rejoicing in the hearts of humanity was overwhelming. But the news of the birth of the Savior was so far above that event that it has no comparison.<br><br>Another:<br><br><i>And it came to pass, as</i>[the women]<i>were much perplexed thereabout</i>[coming to the tomb of the Savior on the first day of the week],<i>behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:</i><br><br><i>And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?</i><br><br><i>He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee.</i>[Luke 24:4–6]<br><br>And further, in our day, Joseph Smith was in the grove. He said,<br><br><i>I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me.</i><br><br><i>. . . When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other--</i>This is my Beloved Son. Hear Him! [JS--1:16–17]<br><br>Three and one-half years later:<br><br><i>While I was thus in the act of calling upon God, I discovered a light appearing in my room, which continued to increase until the room was lighter than at noonday, when immediately a personage appeared at my bedside, standing in the air, for his feet did not touch the floor. . . .</i><br><br><i>He called me by name, and said unto me that he was a messenger sent from the presence of God to me, and that his name was Moroni; that God had a work for me to do; and that my name should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people.</i><br><br><i>He said there was a book deposited, written upon gold plates, giving an account of the former inhabitants of this continent, and the source from whence they sprang. He also said that the fulness of the everlasting Gospel was contained in it, as delivered by the Savior to the ancient inhabitants.</i>[JS 1:30, 33–34]<br><br>What a feeling we ought to have as we take the Book of Mormon in our hands and realize that we have what was written on the gold plates and presented eventually to Joseph Smith the prophet!<br><h2><b>What We Ought Not Do</b></h2><br>There is more than enough in all these messages to fill our hearts with an overwhelming joy. So I have a few suggestions about what we ought not do. We ought not get lost if we are members of the Church of Jesus Christ. We are all, all of us, on a mission. John said, quoting the words of the Savior in his prayer to the Father:<br><br><i>I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they</i>[the Twelve Apostles]<i>are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</i><br><br><i>I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.</i><br><br><i>They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</i>[John 17:14–16]<br><br>That same concept is literally true for each one of us, that we are not taken out of the world, but that we be not of the world.<br><br>How do we avoid getting lost? Well, the commandments give us the understanding. As it is said in Doctrine and Covenants 121, "Let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God" (D&amp;amp;C 121:45).<br><br>Reflecting back again to who we are: the Lord spoke to Abraham as he called him to depart from his country and go unto a strange land and he said these great and inspiring words,<br><br><i>And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee above measure, and make thy name great among all nations, and thou shalt be a blessing unto thy seed after thee, that in their hands they shall bear this ministry and Priesthood unto all nations.</i>[Abraham 2:9]<br><br>Some members of the Church do forget who they are. The Lord isn't happy about that. In the days of Malachi the Lord corrected the Israelites:<br><br><i>Your words have been stout against me, saith the Lord. Yet ye say, What have we spoken so much against thee?</i><br><br><i>Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts?</i><br><br><i>And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.</i>[Malachi 3:13–15]<br><br>Have you ever thought about that as you go to church Sunday morning? It's a beautiful day, and your neighbor is shining up his equipment so that he and his family can have a holiday. Other people go to Hawaii or Las Vegas or some special place to "live it up." And we can't because we have duties to fulfill and commandments to keep, and we sometimes bow our heads a little and say, "Well, Heavenly Father, we keep your commandments, but we want you to know that we don't enjoy it very much, and it isn't all that much fun. We hope you appreciate the sacrifice we are making."<br><br>Isaiah recorded a similar incident:<br><br><i>Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure and exact all your labours.</i><br><br><i>Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high.</i><br><br><i>Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the Lord?</i>[Isaiah 58:3–5]<br><br>It is not pleasing to our Father in Heaven for us to complain about the commandments. When all is considered, the things that he has set forth for us in the great good news of the gospel will bring us riches. And so in order not to get lost--and it is a struggle even for members of the Church--we keep virtue in our thoughts. We avoid what Peter called "the filthy conversation of the wicked" (2 Peter 2:7). He referred there to the experience of Lot when he lived in the wicked city of Sodom. He was vexed from day to day by the filthy conversation of the wicked. We have that all around us today. We are not immune from it, and we have to put ourselves on guard.<br><br>A few things will recall to you some of these filthy conversations. Turn on the television and watch<i>Dallas.</i>It is loaded; it displays dishonesty, doing damage to other people, adultery, and all manner of wickedness. Think about it, and see if that is the uplifting vision the Lord would like you to have all the time--to have people always seeing how much they can drink and talking about how they can arrange some immorality. It is all around us--the filthy conversation of the wicked. We need to protect ourselves to avoid it.<br><h2><b>Service and Fulfillment</b></h2><br>Back again to the call that sets us in a special position as the witnesses, as those who have been called to bear this priesthood and ministry to all nations. Service is what brings fulfillment. The joy of living this life is exactly as the Savior set it forth--not for self-fulfillment, but for service. In the movement for women's lib and for so-called equality there is a constant pressure to get us to be free, and the cry often is, "Let's have self-fulfillment!" Self-fulfillment isn't a bad thing, but taken inappropriately it can mean not much else than selfishness. Service overcomes selfishness.<br><br>Calls come in the Church--to be called as a bishop, for example. You think of the honor and glory of standing up in front of all those people and having the position of command and direction. When you are called to be a bishop, you learn that the honor and glory last only about two weeks. Then you are in the harness and giving devoted service and an awful lot of sacrifice. But that is where the joy is. The glory and honor aren't important anymore, but the things are that have happened to help you to influence the lives of other people. And now you feel the swelling within you when, five, ten, or twenty years later, someone comes up to you and says, "You blessed my life." It is the same thing that happens to you missionaries as you hear those who have listened to you say, "Our lives were changed by the things you taught us." To think back over the associations I have had as a stake president and as a mission president is overwhelming. We now know that we have associated with some of the greatest people on the face of the earth. To have been given the privilege of going to distant countries, knowing other people, and finding the Spirit and power of God resting upon them as they receive the gospel is an incomparable blessing.<br><br>I was approached soon after I was called to be a bishop by a man in a stake presidency in Salt Lake City. He said, "I understand you have been called to be a bishop." As I answered that I had, he didn't say what most people saith when they come to compliment a new bishop. The usual conversation we had was, "I feel sorry for you. You now have the most thankless job you will ever have in the Church." But this great man of understanding said, "I don't feel sorry for you. I congratulate you. If you ever wanted to be in a position to be on the firing line to give service to the Lord and touch people's lives, you now have that privilege. It is one of the greatest honors that will ever come to you."<br><br>This is true of all the callings that we receive in the gospel. And another thing. Some people want to have a special dispensation. The young special interest or the young adults say, "The gospel doesn't fit us. You are always preaching families, and we don't have a family." Well, the fact that you don't have an immediate family doesn't change things very much, does it? The gospel is still the same gospel. A third of all the adults in this church are single, and all those who aren't single will one day be single if they live long enough. It isn't an unnatural state. It is only temporary. The gospel is still true. The idea is to give, not receive.<br><br>Whatever we do counts. What can I do to advance the cause of the gospel? There was great dedication in the spirit of this nation during the Second World War before most of you can remember. It was expected that every citizen would devote himself to something that would promote the war effort. I don't think this country has ever had such a unity as we enjoyed at that time. Everybody was working for the same goal.<br><br>We have that same opportunity here as members of the Church, and all that we do counts. Everything that I do in righteousness is helping to build up the Lord's kingdom.<br><h2><b>One More Don't</b></h2><br>One more don't. Don't forget to pray. I spoke with one of our returned missionaries a few years ago. After he had been home for six or eight months, he said, "Why don't I have the same spirit I had in the mission field?"<br><br>I responded, "I don't know. Let's talk about it. What are you doing now that is different from what you did in the mission field? Do you remember how you got out of bed every morning and had prayer?"<br><br>He said, "Maybe that's it. I haven't prayed since I left my mission." Of course that's it, and happily he caught on.<br><br><i>And now, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye ponder still in your hearts; and it grieveth me that I must speak concerning this thing. For if ye would hearken unto the Spirit which teacheth a man to pray ye would know that ye must pray; for the evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he must not pray.</i>[2 Nephi 32:8]<br><br>The evil spirit is real. It enters into the hearts of members of the Church, and when you are told you mustn't pray, you have to remember that the evil spirit is there. Saul, the king of Israel, was overcome by the evil spirit, and he was unable to pray. He was led down to his destruction. How vital is this principle of keeping our connection with our Father in Heaven!<br><br>Just a final reflection on prayer. When we get up in the morning and offer our prayer, sometimes in a rush, we are tempted to hurry. That is, in our haste to get on with our activities, we repeat much of the same thing we said yesterday, sometimes unthinkingly. If we pray in this manner, we may present to the Lord a "shopping list" of the things we want him to bless us with that day. Then we come home that night and, without having given much reflection to that morning prayer, we go through a similar process and present him with another "shopping list" that will carry us through the night. We need more reflection than that. We should perceive that many of the things we asked for early that morning have actually come to us during the day in a quiet, unobtrusive way. We need to have that awareness. Otherwise our prayers will not be acceptable unto the Lord.<br><br>I will give you an example. A year ago Sister Bangerter and I were out in our farmyard. The old Ford tractor was standing there, and she said, "You never taught me how to drive that tractor."<br><br>I said, "Get on."<br><br>She got on, and I showed her how to start it and showed her the clutch. She has driven everything from a Model A on up; so she knows what a clutch is. She pushed in the clutch and put it in gear and let out the clutch and started to go. It was heading for a rail fence. She pushed in the clutch to stop it, but it didn't stop. She said, "How do you stop this thing?"<br><br>I said, "Push the clutch, push it down further." Now she was confused and I was paralyzed, and here she was going right throuh the fence and couldn't stop it. It went through the rail fence and down over a bank and into a gully and came up against another bank and stopped all by itself. As I followed the trail of that tractor, I knew that I wouldn't have been able to drive it over that bank and through that gully without having it tip over on me, but she was spared. No harm had come. Then we thought of what we had asked for that morning, protection against problems, troubles, accidents, and dangers. We made sure we went to the Lord and thanked him right then for the blessing that had come.<br><br>I offer you my testimony of the knowledge that God has restored the truth to his people in the last days; that we represent those who have been called out of the world to help in bringing salvation to all mankind; and that we are on a mission of service and devotion that requires us to live differently from the way people live in the world. That ought to make us the happiest people alive. There couldn't be a more blessed situation than the one we have at the present time on the face of the earth. God bless you to appreciate and enjoy what you have, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>W.

<h1> May Be Filled with Love” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning, my brothers and sisters. I consider it a privilege and an honor to greet you there this morning in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We are met in his name. I'm not sure that there is another university on the face of the earth where that could be said. You have a devotional; you meet in the name of the Lord. The Lord Jesus Christ loves this university. I love it, too. I love the blue and the white. I love to see the name<i>Brigham Young</i>, for I know that for which it stands.<br><br>I have opportunity to interview some of the faculty that teach here from time to time. Many times they are not members of the Church, but they have to agree to observe the standards of the Church, or they can't work at Brigham Young University. I always leave them a slight challenge. After I determine they are willing to live like a Latter-day Saint, I always suggest to them, "Now, if you're going to live like a Latter-day Saint, you ought to get credit for it. You can't get credit for it without being baptized. So think about that." I hope they think about it. I wish everyone would think about it.<br><h2><b>A Chosen Generation</b></h2><br>You here today are a chosen generation. In the words of Peter, "a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light" (1 Peter 2:9). We are living today upon an earth that is dark. Perhaps just before the time of the flood was an even more difficult time to live than is today, but not much. We know that prior to the coming of the Master in his glory, the conditions will be almost exactly as they were at the time of the flood. In his own words he said, "As it was in the days of Noah, so it shall be also at the coming of the Son of Man" (JS–M 1:41). That means, I presume, they will be doing the same kind of things they were doing at that time and for the same reasons. So living here upon the earth in this day and time is a very trying, difficult experience. Obviously the Lord would see fit to reserve those who had ability to withstand such temptation for this particular time. I don't think that you are here by accident. I don't think that, because the Prophet Joseph Smith said one time:<br><br><i>Every man</i>[that is a collective term. It means woman, too. The Lord doesn't talk much about women, you notice, but that doesn't mean he doesn't think about them. Many times when he says man, he means woman too--just as the Lord said in the beginning that he created man in his own image, male and female].<i>Every man</i>[and woman]<i>who has a calling to minister to the inhabitants of the world was ordained to that very purpose in the Grand Council of heaven before this world was.</i>[<i>Teachings</i>, p. 365]<br><br>No, you aren't here by accident. There is design in your being here at this time. The prophet Alma said essentially the same thing. He was talking about the ordination of certain priests, and he said:<br><br><i>And those priests were ordained after the order of his Son, in a manner that thereby the people might know in what manner to look forward to his Son for redemption.</i><br><br><i>And this is the manner after which they were ordained--being called and prepared from the foundation of the world according to the foreknowledge of God, on account of their exceeding faith and good works.</i>[Alma 13:2–3]<br><br>Called because of "their exceeding faith and good works." Now, I am presuming that that had something to do with what you did before you were born because I've had a number of young men that were called and ordained and set apart and sent to me as a mission president, and I am quite sure it wasn't anything they had done since they were born that got them ordained. It's who they were before they were born and the "foreknowledge of God." They didn't know what they could do, but after they arrived in the mission field, they were powerful; they found they could do all things.<br><h2><b>Why Chosen?</b></h2><br><i>Called and prepared from the foundation of the world according to the foreknowledge of God, on account of their exceeding faith and good works; in the first place being left to choose good or evil; therefore they having chosen good, and exercising exceedingly great faith, are called with a holy calling. . . .</i><br><br><i>And thus they have been called to this holy calling on account of their faith, while others would reject the Spirit of God on account of the hardness of their hearts and blindness of their minds, while, if it had not been for this they might have had as great privilege as their brethren.</i><br><br><i>Or in fine, in the first place they were on the same standing with their brethren; thus this holy calling being prepared from the foundation of the world for such as would not harden their hearts, being in and through the atonement of the Only Begotten Son.</i>[Alma 13:4–5]<br><br>And then we come to a verse that tells us precisely why all this has been done:<br><br><i>And thus being called by this holy calling, and ordained unto the high priesthood of the holy order of God, to teach his commandments unto the children of men, that they also might enter his rest.</i>[Alma 13:6]<br><br>It has all been done so that we can teach the commandments of God to the children of men. That was said in ancient times. The prophet of our own day and time, Spencer W. Kimball, has said essentially the same thing. It is recorded in an<i>Ensign</i>magazine. I am sure you are all familiar with the<i>Ensign</i>magazine, aren't you? We never ask you if you read the<i>Ensign</i>, but we want to know if you "take" it. But it is vitally important that you also read it. It doesn't mean much if you don't read it. I'm convinced that you can get as quick a revelation in the<i>Ensign</i>magazine as you can through the Holy Scriptures, maybe a little more applicable revelation. In this particular edition, May 1979, was reported the activity of the 149th general conference of the Church. In his closing remarks President Kimball said a very, very important thing. It is entitled "Let Us Move Forward and Upward." I would like to read a couple of excerpts from it. I'm not going to read all of it. We never read all the scriptures, do we?--just a few excerpts. By the way, I know that's how you say the word<i>ensign</i>. I had a letter from a sister long ago, and she said, "Elder Rector, I love to hear you speak, but I do wish you'd learn how to say, '<i>Ensign</i>.'" It's not<i>en</i>sign like a Navy officer. Well, it's spelled the same, it looks the same, and I was an<i>en</i>sign a long time. I must admit I called it the<i>En</i>sign. But I don't do that any more because she had the word diagrammed for me, with the accent in the right place, and I now say, "En<i>sign</i>." You might be interested to know that that letter was addressed to "Hartford Rector." People are funny, aren't they?<br><br>This is what the Prophet said.<br><br><i>Now, my brothers and sisters, it seems clear to me, indeed, this impression weighs upon me--that the Church is at a point in its growth and development when we are at last ready to move forward in a major way.</i><br><br>Is that exciting to you? Here is the Prophet saying the Church is going to move forward in a major way. I heard him say that; I was there, and I thought to myself, "Oh, something great is going to happen in the Church. I can hardly wait to see it; I want to watch it."<br><br>Have you ever thought that? You want to watch it? The Lord through his Prophet, in talking about the Church, was talking about you and me. We are the Church. He literally is saying that we are going to do something great and tremendous. Wouldn't you like to know what you are going to do? He tells you; you don't have to wait very long. He says:<br><br><i>We have paused on some plateaus long enough. Let us resume our journey forward and upward. Let us quietly put an end to our reluctance to reach out to others.</i><br><br>Would you say that is your problem? Are you reluctant to reach out to others?<br><br><i>Whether within our own families, wards, or neighborhoods.</i>[<i>Ensign,</i>May 1979, p. 82]<br><br>I presume that is the order in which you reach out. Your prime responsibility, of course, would be to your family. You are held responsible for you family.<br><br><i>Inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, . . . that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, when eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents</i>. [D&amp;amp;C 68:25]<br><br>So we do have a responsibility for members of our own family. We have a responsibility for members of our own wards, too. There are some in every ward, I presume, that are not wildly active in the Church. We have a responsibility to reach out to them. And, of course, we have the responsibility to reach out to those in our neighborhoods as well. These are those who are not members of the Church. If we could discharge this particular responsibility and quietly put an end to our reluctance to reach out to these people, we probably would do what the Lord would have us do because that is what the Prophet says he wants us to do.<br><br>As we drove here today, we came onto the campus of BYU; I thought how apropos the motto of BYU really is: "Enter to learn, go forth to serve." Go forth to serve your fellowman, which is the prime purpose of our existence. It is obvious that we will never make it with the Lord unless we serve each other. The Prophet Joseph Smith indicated that was absolutely essential, and we have it in modern revelation.<br><h2><b>Love is Essential</b></h2><br>In order to serve your fellowmen, you have to love them. It is vitally important that you love people if you are really going to serve them. Otherwise, they will not allow you to serve them. Love is the basis of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and I submit that it is the basis of our lives--the lives of each one of us. We were conceived in love. We have heavenly parents who love each other, and we have earthly parents who are commanded to "live together in love" (D&amp;amp;C 42:45). It is a commandment. The most important thing parents could possibly do for their children is to love one another. Love each other with all their hearts. I have never been able to embrace my wife with my children around without their trying to get in the act. You feel little arms wrapped around your leg, and they try to push in between. I had one that would pull a chair up and try to hug us both together. Children love to see their parents love each other. As a matter of fact, if little children do not receive love, they die. Babies must be loved, or they cannot live. The same is true with old people. There are places in the world today where government workers are paid a salary just to visit old people because their children will not visit them. That is what happens in a socialistic society where the government takes care of you from cradle to grave. Children no longer have to take care of their parents; therefore, they don't spend any time with them. And old people die if they don't get loved. I submit that every one of us between old age and newborn babes must be loved.<br><br>So the commandment is very plain to us. Do you remember when the Master had washed his apostles' feet the night before he was nailed on the cross? He said to them,<br><br><i>A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</i><br><br><i>By this shall men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</i>[John 13:34–35]<br><br>He called that a new commandment, but there is nothing new about it. That bothered me for some time. It is the law of Moses. You will find it in Deuteronomy; you will find it in Exodus--love the Lord, love you fellowman; yet he called it new. What's new about it? I guess it is like the new and everlasting covenant of marriage. New and everlasting. It is new when you receive it, but it is everlasting in its application. It was a rather new commandment, I think, to those apostles. I could see how they would take very unkindly the crucifixion of their Master. We know how Peter felt. He took out his sword and cut off the high priest's servant's ear. Now I don't know whether he was just a poor swordsman, or whether he was trying to make a point. The Master said, "Put up again thy sword unto his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword" (Matthew 26:52). Then he restored the ear. Then in an object lesson for all, as he hung on the cross, he said, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do" (Luke 23:34).<br><br>You have to love people to do that. If the apostles had gone out the next day to get even, with revenge and vindictiveness in their hearts, I submit to you that the gospel of Jesus Christ would never have gotten off the ground. It would have died right there, that day. The same, I presume, as the Church would have died when the Saints were being driven out of the continental limits of the United States, driven from their homes many times, out to this desert valley (Salt Lake was a desert, then; I think it is becoming a rain forest this year). They could have said, "Okay, that's enough. We've done all we're going to do for you. You can go your own way now." But, you know one of the very first things they did was turn around and send missionaries right back to those who had driven them out. Because they did, the gospel of Jesus Christ is once again founded on a bedrock foundation here in the Salt Lake Valley, and from this place we have sent missionaries through all the world, in fact, to every kindred, tongue, and people where we are permitted to go. I am sure there are going to be more doors opening in the not too distant future, too.<br><br>Yes, the gospel must go forth, but it must be preached with love. Only if we can love people will they listen to us. Some people are not easy to love. The Lord didn't say to love those that are easy to love. As a matter of fact, he said, "Love your enemies. Do good to those that despitefully use you. Turn the other cheek. Go the second mile." That's not easy. In fact, it is very difficult. It is easy to love people who love you, isn't it? Right away you know they must have excellent judgment. But you don't really get credit from the Lord, I don't believe, for loving the people that love you unless you can love people who not only don't love you, but don't even like you. Then you will be like your Father in Heaven, or that much like him anyway, who lets his rain fall on the just and on the unjust.<br><h2><b>Why God Loves Us</b></h2><br>Yes, you must love them. You have to be awfully good to love people that don't love you. How do you suppose you could get that good--that you could love people whether they love you or whether they don't? I wondered about that for a long time. I wondered about that before I ever heard of the Mormons, as a matter of fact. I was talking with my aunt one time about this particular thing. Why does God love us? Knowing you as well as you do and knowing God knows you just that well, you might well ask, "Why on earth would he love me?" We always talk about getting what we deserve. That is the last thing in the world we really want, isn't it? I don't want what I deserve. I'd like to have something a little better than that, please.<br><br>But, he does love us. Why do you suppose God loves you? Maybe if we could find out, we would know how to love others. There are a lot of reasons why God could love us, I guess. We are his children. Generally speaking, you love what's yours, don't you? That's awfully selfish, don't you think? I don't think God loves us because we are his children, though we are. I think he would love us if we belonged to someone else, don't you? Sure, he'd love us, anyway.<br><br>Maybe he loves us because we are good. You sure hope not, don't you? We certainly don't want that. No, he doesn't love us because we are good, though I am sure he is more pleased with us when we are good. I believe that because I find that I am more pleased with my own children when they keep my commandments. If they don't keep my commandments, they could get spanked. It has happened before; it could happen again. If you don't keep the Lord's commandments, I promise you you'll get spanked. "Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son [and daughter (that is a collective term, too)] (Hebrews 12:6). The fact that I spanked my children doesn't mean I don't love them.<br><br>Maybe he loves us because of our potential. It is easy to love people that have a lot of potential. We all have heroes. I find I really love Abe Lincoln. I love the Prophet Joseph Smith. Maybe the Lord loves us because of our potential, and boy, do we have potential! We can become as he is, and that is horrendous potential, isn't it? But some people seem to have more than others. Does that mean he loves you more than he loves me? He said he doesn't. "And the one being is as precious in his sight as the other" (Jacob 2:21). It never ceased to amaze me that he can love Baptists and Methodists and Catholics as much as he loves Latter-day Saints, and I am sure he does. We baptized more than 70,000 Catholics last year. The Lord must love them.<br><br>He doesn't love us because of our potential. He doesn't love us because we are good. He doesn't love us because we're his. Well, why on earth does he love us then? My good aunt told me. She said, "Junior (I didn't' have a name until I was twenty years old; I was Junior), God doesn't love us because we are good; he loves us because he is good." And I knew that was true. When you hear the truth, you recognize it, don't you? Yes, he is all good, and so he loves us. He'd almost have to be all good to love us, wouldn't he?<br><h2><b>How We Learn to Love</b></h2><br>How do you get that way? How do you get so good that you can love people whether they deserve it or whether they don't? I found the answer in the Book of Mormon. It is in Mosiah, chapter 2, verse 4, where King Benjamin was talking to his people, and he said that he taught them "to keep the commandments of God, that they might rejoice and be filled with love towards God and all men."<br><br>If you keep the commandments, they are calculated to make you so good that you can love people whether they deserve it or whether they don't. So our first responsibility, then, in order to serve would be to keep the commandments of God. And keep them precisely. I promise you it will turn you into a loving, serving son or daughter of Heavenly Father. The Master said, "I am among you as he that serveth" (Luke 22:27). He said he came to give his life as a ransom for many. Then it is love plus sacrifice, which I would interpret to mean charity, that really permits us to render service. It is difficult, of course, as I said before. You will find it through obedience to the commandments. I don't think you will find it any other way.<br><br>May I close with the story of a young man who taught me this principle very forcibly. I was serving as a mission president in San Diego. I got a call from the Missionary Department one day, and they said they had a young man over in Thailand who had been there for nine months. He had learned the language fluently, but he had quit and come home because he hadn't had a baptism. See, you have to have success to be happy. You can't be happy and fail, I don't care who you are. I presume the ultimate success will be eternal life, and that's ultimate happiness, too. They had asked him to come by and talk with me on the way home. He wanted to go home so badly that he was willing to do that. So he came into my office, and there he sat, a handsome, good-looking, obviously smart young man. He had learned that language and could speak it fluently in nine months. There are people born and raised in Thailand that never speak the language fluently.<br><br>I said, "Elder, how on earth could you spend nine months in Thailand, learn the language fluently, and not baptize anybody? All you would have had to do is walk out on the streets of Bangkok and say, 'Excuse me, I'm a Mormon elder, I have authority to baptize. Would you like to be baptized?' That's really all you have to do--ask people. I'm sure you would have baptized somebody in nine months, speaking the language the way you do. I know it works that way."<br><br>I told that to a young man in Frankfurt, Germany, one time who had been there for a year and hadn't had a baptism. He was very distressed; he wanted to go home. We went over the handbook to see if there might be a few things he should be doing that he wasn't doing and a few things he wasn't doing that he should be doing, and we found a few things. He committed himself to follow the mission rules, to live the commandments.<br><br>I said, "The only other thing you have to do, Elder, is just promise me that one day a week you'll get out on the streets here in Frankfurt, and I recommend that you pick a nice shopping center where there are lots of people. Don't let anybody pass you that day without saying,' Excuse me, I am a Mormon elder. I have authority to baptize. Would you like to be baptized?' Before I see you again you'll have a baptism, I promise."<br><br>He said, "I'll do it."<br><br>I saw him six months later and he had had five baptisms. I said, "Elder, how did you get your contacts?"<br><br>"I just asked people if they wanted to be baptized."<br><br>I told that to a ward mission leader up in Carlsbad, California, one time. Two weeks later he baptized his very best friend, a lifelong childhood friend. I said, "How did you do it?"<br><br>He said, "I said to him, 'I'm a Mormon elder. I have authority to baptize. Would you like to be baptized?'"<br><br>His friend said, "Yes I really would, but is there something else I have to do first?"<br><br>He said, "Yeah, I have to teach you a little bit." Two weeks later he baptized his best friend. That's what it takes: you have to ask people.<br><br>The young man from Bangkok said, "President Rector, I don't like those people. I don't like the way they look, I don't like the way they act, I don't like the way they smell. They are arrogant." And he knew about arrogance.<br><br>I said, "Well, Elder, I understand why you haven't baptized anybody. You have to love people in order to baptize them. Why don't you let me send you up to Carlsbad, California? We're having a little success up there with the Spanish-speaking people. I'm sure that you could love them enough to bring them into the Church. I know you don't speak Spanish, and we could send you down to Provo, Utah, to the Missionary Training Center for two months. You would learn to speak the language fluently. But there's no sense in doing that. I can send you up to Carlsbad and you can get on-the-job training."<br><br>He said, no, he didn't want to go. I said, "What difference does that make? How many times on this earth do you have to do things that you don't particularly want to do? Isn't that what life is really all about, doing a bunch of things that you don't want to do? I don't suppose that Abraham wanted to offer his son as a burnt sacrifice, do you? I don't think the Master wanted to die on the cross either. If he did, he was acting very strangely in the Garden of Gethsemane the night before it happened. And I know for sure that Jonah did not want to go on a mission."<br><br>I was talking to a reluctant missionary one time. He didn't want to go either. And I told him, "You know, if I had a friendly whale, I could put you in for about three days, and you probably would change your mind about this."<br><br>The Lord has better methods than we, of course. I was taught that lesson by my father. He was a Missouri farmer. He hoodwinked me into milking the cows. He said to me one time, "You're not old enough or big enough to milk." And I knew I was. I was seven years old. Of course, I was big enough to milk. And so I proved to him that I could milk, and I really can. I still have a milking muscle. Do you see that? There are no city boys that have one of those. I can make the foam stand that high in the bucket. He said, "I believe you can milk; you've got the job." And for the next twelve years I milked from eight to twelve cows night and morning. I did not want to milk. I said that to him one time: "Dad, I don't want to milk."<br><br>He said, "That's okay; you don't have to want to, as long as you do it." That's kind of how the Lord treats us, isn't it? It's okay if you don't want to, as long as you do it. It's the doing that makes the difference.<br><br>Well, he went. I gave him a blessing, promised him he would have baptisms, at least two in two months. He almost came home after his first month. But he had committed himself to stay. Commitment is very important to you and me. If you are going to serve the Lord, you are going to have to commit yourself to do so. It's like Abigail Adams said to her husband, John, president of the United States at the time. "Do you remember what you said to me, John? You said, 'Commitment, Abby, commitment. There are only two creatures worthy to live, one who makes commitments and one who requires commitments of others.'" If you are going to serve the Lord, you are going to have to help people make commitments. There are certain things you have to do if you are going to make it with the Lord. Those commitments are vitally important.<br><br>Well, he stayed. He was twenty-eight days into the second month, and I was getting a little nervous when I got a call from him. He said, "President Rector, I just baptized two people last night."<br><br>I said, "Elder, that's tremendous. Tell me about it. How did you do it?"<br><br>He said, "Well, we were teaching about twenty-five at one time. We were in our commitment lesson where we commit them to keep the commandments, pay their tithing, live the Word of Wisdom, attend church, and so forth. There were two in the group who couldn't make those commitments. So the elders pulled them out and put them in a room by themselves. They didn't want any negative influence in their commitment session. I was walking down the hall, and I saw them in the room. The Spirit told me to go in to talk to them."<br><br>Oh, that's a good sign--when the Spirit starts telling you what to do.<br><br>"I went in," he said. "I pulled up a chair and sat down. One of them looked remarkably like my own brother. As I sat down in that chair, I don't know what happened to me, but a feeling of love came over me. I said to him, 'I really do love you.' The tears rolled down my cheeks, and his cheeks too. A short time later I baptized him; then I baptized his friend."<br><br>In the next six months that young man baptized 350 Spanish-speaking people. I transferred him down to San Diego, where we had some Spanish-speaking people as well. I made him a district leader. He and his companion were walking down the street one day and saw some Thai writing on the window of a building. He went in and spoke Thai with the proprietor. Remember, he could speak Thai fluently. The proprietor about dropped his uppers because he didn't look like a Thai. The young man called me, very excited, and said, "President Rector, did you know that there are fifty Thai families that live here in my area?"<br><br>I said, "You don't mean it."<br><br>He said, "Yes, they're here. Can I teach them?"<br><br>I said, "Now, Elder, let's think about it for a minute. If you teach them, you'll have to be their fellowshipper too. They have to go to Church. They won't understand anything in English so you will have to translate everything for them. Are you willing to be their fellowshipper as well as their proselytizer?"<br><br>"Yes, yes, I'll do it," he said.<br><br>I said, "Okay, let's see what you can do."<br><br>Three weeks later he called me and said, "President Rector, I just baptized the most beautiful family of five you have ever seen--a mother and father and three children, all Thais. They don't speak a word of English."<br><br>I said, "Elder, that's wonderful. Tell me about those people, will you? What kind of people are they, anyway?"<br><br>He said, "Oh, they are the sweetest people. They are so nice and humble." They were just like the Mexicans, or the Japanese, or the Germans, or anyone else who comes to this particular point of conversion.<br><br>I said, "Tell me, elder, how do they smell?"<br><br>He said, "Yeah, that's right; it's me. I'm the one that's changed."<br><h2><b>Go Forth to Serve</b></h2><br>When we change, everyone around us changes too. Do you remember what the Master said? In Matthew 25 he said,<br><br><i>When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:</i><br><br><i>And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:</i><br><br><i>And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</i><br><br><i>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</i><br><br><i>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</i><br><br><i>Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</i><br><br><i>Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</i><br><br><i>When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?</i><br><br><i>Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</i>[Matthew 25:31–39]<br><br>Are you sure it was me? People do look a lot alike, you know. You may have me mixed up with someone else.<br><br>Have you ever been given credit for something good that you didn't do? How does that make you feel? Not all that good. Sometimes we will let people give us credit for something good we didn't do, but we never, ever would let anybody give us credit for something bad that we didn't do. That's kind of the way we all are, isn't it?<br><br><i>And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</i><br><br><i>Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</i><br><br><i>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat. . . .</i><br><br><i>Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, . . . and did not minister unto thee?</i><br><br><i>Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.</i>[Matthew 25:40–42, 44–45]<br><br>I presume that is how the judgment will really be. It will have to do with whether or not you really serve your fellowman. For John<br><br><i>saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.</i>[Revelation 20:12]<br><br>That's what it will all come down to. If you love them, you can serve them. If you don't, you never could because they won't let you.<br><br>The secret, then--keep the commandments of God, and I promise you will rejoice and be filled with love for God and all men.<br><br>Come here (to BYU) to learn and go forth to serve and be a witness of the Lord Jesus Christ wherever you go when you wear that BYU across your chest. May the Lord bless you to live up to the high standards that the Lord has set for you who are "a chosen generation, . . . an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light" (1 Peter 2:9). I pray that you will in Jesus' name. Amen.<br><br><i>Hartman Rector, Jr., was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 3 May 1983.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>as a Little Child” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I would first like to tell you a little story about Elder LeGrand Richards. I choose him as my subject because he represents the qualities that I want to talk about tonight. Brother Richards was at a conference about a year ago, when he was in his ninety-fifth year. At the conference at which he reorganized a stake, he sat on the stand, and the choir sang a beautiful rendition, and he thought they were so outstanding that he turned around to the choir leader and said, "I'll bet you could sing 'The Battle Hymn of the Republic,' couldn't you?"<br><br>The choir leader said, "Yes, I think we could."<br><br>He said, "Good. I'd liked to hear it sung at the end of this conference today."<br><br>In and of itself, that doesn't seem like a very unusual thing, but unbeknown to Brother Richards, sitting halfway back in the audience was a man who had been inactive and who decided that he'd go to conference, and if the choir sang "The Battle Hymn of the Republic," he would know that it was a signal from heaven that he was supposed to be active again.<br><br>A most unusual series of events--except that isn't where it ends. Because he was there and made the decision to become active again, when they reorganized his ward bishopric a week later, he was called to be a counselor in that bishopric. He already had his answer, and he knew what he would need to do. Then he recounted the story--this spiritual little story out of one of the many pages of Latter-day Saint stories throughout the world in which the Spirit of our Father in Heaven guides us.<br><br>I'd like to talk tonight about the subject of "Becoming as a Little Child" because I'm concerned for a number of reasons.<i>First,</i>there is a subtle attempt in the world to no longer want children. In the world in general, the model is no longer a family, but rather two young people--both working--who by an enlarged income can afford the life-style that in the past only the rich could enjoy. Sometimes, this couple, in their finely tailored suits or on the beaches of the world with their lean, tanned bodies, never want to be encumbered by even one child. Children interfere with their carefree life-style. For many, childrearing may be one of the greatest casualties of modern times. In these cases, they place their own pursuits, their own interests, first. There is no time for children. This, of course, is not the norm for Latter-day Saints, but is rampant in the world and not only denies the bodies for the spiritual children of our Father in Heaven, but also denies these people some of the learning and inspiration of a loving Father in Heaven essential to exaltation.<br><br><i>Second,</i>the purpose of marriage is to provide bodies for the spirit children of our Father in Heaven, and also to help us learn how to love, sacrifice, obey, and serve one another. There are thousands of learning experiences in the family, each contributing to the other. It is the greatest learning factory in this world to overcome selfishness, and it is designed by our Father in Heaven to be of an eternal nature and importance. Children have not lost their place in God's society, but are essential to it, and the lessons we learn from them are absolutely imperative. Some of these lessons, gifts, and qualities I'd like to talk to you about tonight.<br><br><i>Third,</i>one of the greatest needs we have, my young friends, is to retain and develop the innate qualities of little children, for they are alive in Christ. As students at this great university, we learn many things that will bless our lives and provide us professional opportunities and many new spiritual insights. But let us not forget some innate qualities that will permit us a fullness and quality of life that will eventually lead to eternal life.<br><br>Not too long ago, I came across the following little poem that will introduce what I'd like to say about children.<br><br><i>My dad gave me a one-dollar bill</i><br><i>'Cause I'm his smartest son,</i><br><i>And I swapped it for two shiny quarters</i><br><i>'Cause two is more than one!</i><br><i>And then I took the quarters</i><br><i>And traded them to Lou</i><br><i>For three dimes--I guess he don't know</i><br><i>That three is more than two!</i><br><i>Just then, along came old blind Bates</i><br><i>And just 'cause he can't see,</i><br><i>He gave me four nickels for my three dimes</i><br><i>And four is more than three!</i><br><i>And I took the nickels to Hyrum Coombs</i><br><i>Down at the feed store,</i><br><i>And the fool gave me five pennies for them,</i><br><i>And five is more than four!</i><br><i>And then I went and showed my Dad</i><br><i>And he got red in the cheeks,</i><br><i>And closed his eyes and shook his head--</i><br><i>Too proud of me to speak!</i><br>--Author unknown<br><br>It is obvious from this little story that children don't know everything. But, my young friends, there are many things that they know instinctively that are great gifts, and if not understood and pursued energetically can limit the power, beauty, quality, and destiny of our lives.<br><br>Isn't it interesting that the Savior would make the following statement: "And again I say unto you, ye must . . . become as a little child, or ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God" (3 Nephi 11:38)? Over the years I have learned some things from children that I would like to share with you today, which to my mind help me to realize why the Savior said what he did.<br><h2><b>The Power to Believe</b></h2><br>First of all, children are endowed with a great power to believe. They believe that they can do anything. Dad can do anything; the Lord can do anything. My youngest son, a few years ago, went out each day believing he could catch a hundred--maybe even a thousand--butterflies, and was prepared with enough bottles to prove it. You suggest something, and they believe it can happen. Frankly, the thought never enters their minds that it couldn't be done. That power to believe is sorely needed in the world today by everyone--every father, mother, member, bishop, missionary--if we are to catch the vision of the Lord and the prophet as he continually encourages us to higher ground.<br><br>A few years ago, quite miraculously, I attended a stake conference in western Washington. I had secretly prayed I could be assigned there, but one of the Twelve was assigned. Then the member of the Twelve's assignment was changed a few days before the conference, and my assignment was changed from another stake to this particular one. When I arrived and had an interview with the stake president, I knew we needed to do something to carry out the mandate on missionary work given by the Prophet. We all worked diligently together throughout the two-day conference, making some suggestions to improve the involvement of the members in the work.<br><br>In the concluding session, I did something I had never done before in a conference. I blessed the people that if they would follow the suggestions given, believing without doubting, a special blessing from the Lord would come upon them as a stake, and many would join the Church. Incidentally, the stake president and I felt the members should immediately make a list from their close circle of friends, as President Spencer W. Kimball had counseled. You remember, he said that the Lord has placed some of those people in our circle because we are supposed to bring them into the Church. The thirty-four-year-old stake president, who had been in the Church eight years, led out; and because of his childlike faith in God and his servants, he commenced immediately. By the middle of the next week he telephoned to report that he and his wife and small children had prepared a list of two hundred names of people they felt would be receptive to the gospel. One week later he wrote me the following letter.<br><br><i>We are hearing stories daily of missionary experiences. I've made approximately two contacts and have my next-door neighbors playing on the ward basketball team, and we've had them over for family home evening. Also, I believe we have another lady acquaintance ready to hear the missionaries. Our children have been taking friends to Primary, and Julie is working on a widow to get her to Relief Society.</i><br><br><i>Oh, I almost forgot, we held a special meeting for the brethren and their spouses and the Relief Society presidencies and their spouses to discuss and motivate them about missionary work. We challenged them to come to the meeting as you did me, with names of nonmember families they are going to work with, and more than one thousand names were brought to that meeting. The blessing that fell upon our stake has yielded the spirit and the faith and the action that we all can feel.</i><br><br>He continues in his letter:<br><br><i>One of the elders quorum presidents went home from the meeting pondering how to approach a neighbor he didn't even know. The next day, the president was working in his yard when the neighbor came over and asked, "Brian, when is your family going to start sharing the gospel with us, start fellowshipping us?" This, of course, surprised the quorum president very much, but after a long talk with the neighbor he discovered that this man had been raised in southern Idaho around LDS people and had great respect for them. We are convinced that the blessing which was pronounced upon our stake prompted this man to come forward and express his desires. The Lord really has blessed us because we believed.</i><br><br>Another example: In a ward in Salt Lake City, where we live, a few years ago a bishop made a resolute, absolute commitment to himself that he was going to try to have every young person in his ward go on a mission, and so he began the painstaking effort that that would take. Two years of contact and interviews and special experiences, of believing they could be touched by the Lord, found over thirty missionaries serving from that ward at the same time. Many had been reactivated from total inactivity and had repented and put their lives in order. Among them was a couple that had been excommunicated a couple of years earlier. They repented, changed their lives, and went on a mission--along with a formerly inactive son.<br><br>Also, let me tell you about a young man--I apologize that I do not have his name--whom I read about several years ago in the U.S. Army<i>Stars and Stripes</i>newspaper who cleared the two-meter mark in high jump (that's about the height of Devin Durrant). He believed he could do it and set about the arduous task and practiced and worked at it until one day, after thousands of attempts, he finally made it, his goal forever, and what made it even more impressive was the fact that he had only one leg.<br><br>Yes, belief--without doubting--as the Prophet Joseph Smith learned when he was fourteen, is mandatory. See how uncomplicated it is just to believe--to believe on his words. The Savior said, "If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth" (Mark 9:23).<br><h2><b>The Power of Implicit Faith</b></h2><br>Another thing I learned from children is that they have implicit faith--in the principles of the gospel, in parents, leaders, people in general. When they are young and pure, they don't have to have all the answers. They have faith that Mom and Dad are right, and that they would never lead them astray. What a heavy burden that is on us--to build faith that will not be destroyed by bad habits and practices.<br><br>I think of a story about President David O. McKay, ninth president of the Church, when he was a young lad. He was taught by his father to pray when confronted with a problem. When he was eight years of age, he received a new pocketknife on his birthday, and he recounts the experience of that day by telling how he got on his horse and rode out into the valley, made a fire, ate his lunch, and then got ready to return home.<br><br>As he began riding home, he remembered he had forgotten his new pocketknife, and so he quickly turned around and raced back to the same spot and searched in vain for his knife. He then remembered his father's teaching, and because of the counsel of his father and his faith in him, he got on his knees and began to talk simply and earnestly to the Lord. In the midst of his prayer, he saw a vision come into his mind--a picture as clear as any TV picture--and there, as a picture in his mind, he saw his knife under a clump of weeds. He got up on his feet, looked around, walked directly to the scene he had just witnessed in his mind, and found his knife exactly as it had been revealed.<br><br>What a powerful lesson on faith in one's father and faith in the Lord this young president-to-be learned that day. This kind of faith leads to spiritual and other accomplishments. Can you see that, because of this faith, children--young people--are humble and teachable, and as such become benefactors of truth and happiness? One of the greatest armies of faith ever upon this earth is the 26,000 young missionaries who have total faith in God, his principles, and his leaders.<br><h2><b>The Power of Obedience</b></h2><br>Another lesson taught me over and over again is that children are intrinsically obedient. As children develop, they obey without a thousand reasons. For example, it is fun and right for them to pay their tithes. I noticed a little girl a while back with a tithing envelope in her hand, looking all through the chapel to find the bishop.<br><br>How powerfully this lesson was taught once in France when a family got into their car to go see the grandparents. While en route they saw the grandmother coming in another direction and pulled the car over to stop and get her attention. As soon as the car stopped, a small boy jumped out of the backseat and began to run across the busy highway to see his grandmother. The father, seeing his son in danger, just yelled, "Stop," as the boy reached the center of the road. There was no time to give instructions or reasons, just direction. The boy, hearing his father's voice, stopped and froze there until rescued. How profound it really is to be like a child and be obedient!<br><br>One of the most classic of all the stories of simple and complete obedience, without having reasons, is that of Abraham and Isaac. Listen to this great experience in obedience.<br><br><i>And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.</i><br><br><i>And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.</i><br><br><i>And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.</i><br><br><i>Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.</i><br><br><i>And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.</i><br><br><i>And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.</i><br><br><i>And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?</i><br><br><i>And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.</i><br><br><i>And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.</i><br><br><i>And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.</i><br><br><i>And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.</i><br><br><i>And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou has not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.</i>[Genesis 22:1–12]<br><br>How many times might we have had greater blessings if we had been totally and immediately obedient as was Abraham on that most difficult occasion. A child teaches us, over and over again, this principle, and only because he is led in his heart to do it--no reasons, no lengthy dialogue or explanations--just simple obedience. Oh, the blessings that await those who are obedient, now and forever! Yes, students, to become learned is good, if you do not forget wisdom and obedience to higher laws which come from heaven. As the scriptures say, "To be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God" (2 Nephi 9:29).<br><h2><b>The Power of Love</b></h2><br>Another thing I have learned is that little children love with a perfect love, which has no bounds. There is no judgment or second guessing or holding back. These qualities seem almost innate. I noticed some time ago that a young son and his friend had somehow had bad words, and were really angry, but the real lesson came just minutes later when all offenses and discord were forgotten--never, never to be remembered again. They just followed an instinctive pattern that sometimes, when we are older and wiser and more mature, we fail to remember.<br><br>The world so needs the love and concern for others that children have, whose love springs forth naturally and completely. I spent a few minutes a few weeks ago in a little French town called Pont-à-Mousson, organizing a new stake in that area, and there was a little French girl there, the small daughter of one of the leaders. She was a pure, beautiful young child who had total trust and love and confidence in everyone around her, including me. There were no inhibitions to her warmth, her faith in others, and her desire to let us feel her love for the Lord, her parents, the members, her leaders, and me, a total stranger. She was so delightful I wanted to bring her home. Children love with an almost perfect love, and if we can capture that in our lives forever, how blessed we would be, and how enriched our world would be.<br><h2><b>The Power of Service</b></h2><br>Another important point I've learned from children--they serve anxiously. Before little children get onto our ways, they serve because they are asked, because they want to. They gratefully look around them and see a little bird in distress and pick it up, bandage its wounds, overfeed it--all out of something bestowed in them by a loving Heavenly Father. This service is never prompted by gain nor personal gratification, but rather, grows out of a love not qualified by earthly experience or time, but limitless like purity and charity. Is it possible that so priceless are these qualities that our Father in Heaven has put a restraining order, if you will, upon Satan that he shall not have power to tempt or to change little children? The scriptures say:<br><br><i>But behold, I say unto you, that little children are redeemed from the foundation of the world through mine Only Begotten;</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, they cannot sin, for power is not given unto Satan to tempt little children, until they begin to become accountable before me.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 29:46–47]<br><br>Can we learn the power of this serving anxiously with a full heart and intent? What power and beauty it brings to our lives! Think of the manifold opportunities around you--in and out of the Church--to serve your fellowmen, not for reward or the accolades of people, but because needs are seen, and quietly and anxiously one seeks to fill those needs. Listen, listen to the Savior's classic story of serving others:<br><br><i>When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:</i><br><br><i>And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:</i><br><br><i>And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</i><br><br><i>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</i><br><br><i>For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</i><br><br><i>Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</i><br><br><i>Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</i><br><br><i>When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?</i><br><br><i>Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</i><br><br><i>And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</i><br><br><i>Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</i><br><br><i>For I was an hungered, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:</i><br><br><i>I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.</i><br><br><i>Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?</i><br><br><i>Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.</i><br><br><i>And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.</i>[Matthew 25:31–46]<br><br>Think about service--missionary service. On the earth today I would guess that there are over one-fourth million living returned missionaries. Think what would happen if they continued their missionary service each year. We could reach the vision that President Kimball has in mind. Think of service that so imbues your life that when you return home you wouldn't stop being a missionary. One of our missionaries, Elder Pratt, baptized only two or three people on his thirty-month mission, and he was totally dedicated, but since returning home and going to medical school, he has seen four medical students baptized.<br><h2><b>The Power of Enthusiasm</b></h2><br>Finally, may I mention another dimension which has illuminated my life many times. Little children have a zest for life, an eagerness to live it to the fullest, like Elder LeGrand Richards. You know, LeGrand Richards, just before his death, received a letter about the death of his brother. And instead of mourning, he said, "Good for him." "Good for him"--just like that. He had lived worthy, he was old, there were people on the other side waiting, and he had every right to expect the fullness of eternal life. I can tell you from the many discussions I had with Elder Richards that he looked forward to that day and felt that, each time one of the General Authorities died, he got cheated. He hung on tenaciously, as we know, and lived to be older than any other General Authority in this dispensation. But, he was ready to go, he had a zest to go, and to begin his work there as soon as the Lord decided.<br><br>Yes, children are almost perpetually in motion, but in this we learn some valuable lessons. They seek new experiences, they have no pretense or scorn or condescension or pride. They are natural and warm and outgoing. They are excited about the smallest things, and as such, captivate our attention. They experience each day with newness, not building upon the difficulties of the previous day. They don't even remember them. They teach us that spontaneity and excitement for life are essential to happiness and self-fulfillment, and really come from a loving God. Yes, they are the "stick that keeps things stirred up."<br><br>They are anxiously engaged and enthusiastic. There is a total extension of themselves into all the dimensions of their lives. Each day is a wonderful, new, expanding experience, unencumbered by the previous day's issues or troubles. Those troubles are forgotten, and new opportunities and joy and living are again theirs. The vitality of their lives in these things is a wonder to behold. If we can retain this great power, how blessed will be the days of our lives and all those who are around us!<br><br>Little children are not a trial to our faith or love. They are not instinctively grouchy or self righteous or hateful. These are acquired traits. Some of the greatest lessons we'll ever need are to hang on to and cultivate these gifts given by a loving Father in Heaven. Remember, no Latter-day Saint should ever be a trial to another Latter-day Saint, but a blessing of joy and knowledge and faith and service and great appreciation for all the blessings of life. There are so many.<br><br>My years as bishop taught me that these words of Mormon are absolutely true. I bear you my solemn testimony that they are. From the one hundred or more interviews with eight-year-olds before they were baptized into the kingdom, I know these things are true:<br><br><i>Little children are whole, for they are not capable of committing sin. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Teach parents that they must repent and be baptized, and humble themselves as their little children, and they shall all be saved with their little children. . . .</i><br><br><i>But little children are alive in Christ, even from the foundation of the world. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Wherefore, all children are alike unto me; wherefore, I</i>[the Lord]<i>love little children with a perfect love; and they are all alike and partakers of salvation.</i>[Moroni 8:8, 10, 12, 17]<br><br>Let us "become as a little child" in these important dimensions. May we, this day and always, remember these words of the Savior and retain and develop the powers given to us very early in our earthly lives: the power of believing, the power of faith, the power of obedience, the power of service, the power of near-perfect love, and the power of boundless enthusiasm for the really true things of our Father in Heaven. Add to these all the intelligence and knowledge we can gain through our personal effort, here at the university and after we leave, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and then our lives will be full and boundless and enriched and infinitely more useful. I know these sound like simple little things tonight, but they are the substance of life as we grow older. Where happiness is found in a home, in a ward, in a companionship, these things are also found. They are empowered and blessed from on high, and they are never forgotten no matter what degree or station we achieve. May God bless us to hold fast and develop them, I humbly pray and leave my personal witness that these things are true, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>James M.

<h1>l Education Is True Education - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
President Holland, faculty members and students, my dear brothers and sisters:<br><br>First of all, I would like to express my appreciation and gratitude for the privilege and invitation to come down here and talk to the greatest student body in the whole world. Secondly, I would like to express my appreciation and gratitude for the blessing of a great companion. I am grateful that Sister Lee was able to be with us today. I am also proud to have our two oldest boys, Duane and Chad, with us. They're looking forward to attending this fine university someday.<br><br>I sincerely invoke the strength of your faith and your prayers that what I say may be helpful to you and to me. I hope that whatever spiritual enlightenment we receive today will give us strength, courage, and the determination to carry on the work of the Lord, which is the greatest work in all the world.<br><br>This world is getting so competitive and technical that a high school degree is not sufficient anymore. Never in the history of mankind was it as necessary to be highly trained to achieve in a chosen field as it is at the present time. This period of time demands that you not only be technically trained, but spiritually trained as well. In fact, spiritual training should take priority at all times.<br><br>The scriptures make it very clear that you are to seek spiritual knowledge first, and then all else will be added unto you, including secular knowledge. As great and as important as secular knowledge is, as great and important as are the training of the mind and becoming specialists in our chosen occupations and vocations on this earth, this worldly knowledge and these achievements are not and should not be our greatest aims in life. You should know and realize that spiritual education is true education.<br><h2><b>Secular Knowledge and Spiritual Knowledge</b></h2><br>Up to this point in your lives, you have had to deal mainly with secular education or education about our physical selves as well as our physical world. Our fine public school systems have dealt mainly with secular education, while spiritual education is usually left for the home and the church. Because we live in this kind of a world, it is only natural that proper emphasis be placed on secular education. At the same time, you should not allow this secular education to mislead you as to the tremendous importance and value of spiritual education. Secular education is only a small part of spiritual education.<br><br>Both are important, but we ought to know and understand that spiritual education is to be supplemented with secular education. In other words, we must know and understand that the scriptures are to be supplemented with secular knowledge. Secular knowledge is not to be supplemented with the scriptures, but eternal truths must be supplemented with knowledge of languages, tongues, and peoples. You and I, in the search for secular knowledge, have built huge monuments and temples in the forms of great colleges and universities. We have built huge, expensive, elaborate facilities, laboratories, libraries, endowments, and equipment in our search for secular knowledge.<br><br>The search for spiritual knowledge, on the other hand, is quite a different matter. This search for eternal truths is for anyone and for everyone. In this search for spiritual truth, there is no need for extensive, elaborate universities, laboratories, libraries, or expensive equipment. The only things that are needed and necessary for this search are a pure heart and a contrite spirit. Even the lowliest of men can find this kind of truth. In this search for spiritual truth, there is no need for a chosen, trained profession, but only righteous living. Even the poorest and humblest may be a searcher for this spiritual knowledge.<br><h2><b>True Education</b></h2><br>The Lord Jesus Christ has told us that he has never at any time given us a law which was temporal, for to him all things are spiritual (D&amp;amp;C 29:34–35). I sincerely believe that spiritual education is true education. True education is to learn more and more about the Father of our spirits, or our Heavenly Father. He is the Father of the spirits of all men everywhere, and he is also the literal, earthly Father of Jesus Christ. True education is to know that each person is a child of God, created in his image, endowed with his attributes, and entitled to his inspiration. One of our greatest privileges in this earth life is to seek him and to become more like him.<br><br>A modern revelation says:<br><br><i>The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:22]<br><br>Our Heavenly Father who begot Jesus Christ is a person, and he has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as that possessed by Jesus Christ. It is in the same shape and form as our own bodies. God our Heavenly Father is not a shapeless mass filling the whole universe, yet so small that he dwells within a human heart. He is not without a body, parts, or passions. He is not permanently invisible; he is not joined into one with the Holy Ghost and Jesus Christ.<br><br>Can you imagine praying to a god who is an incomprehensible, shapeless, and invisible influence without body, parts, or passions? Can you imagine Jesus Christ praying to a god who is a shapeless mass? Can you imagine Jesus Christ praying to himself who is at the same time God, Jesus, and the Holy Ghost all rolled into one? The fact that God our Heavenly Father is all-knowing and all-powerful, that his influence and knowledge can reach throughout space, does not mean that he himself has been diffused throughout space. God is not a thing; he is not an invisible influence; he is not a shapeless mass; he is not incomprehensible; and he is not an "it."<br><br>God the Father is a glorified, all-knowing, all-powerful, personal Being, as he has revealed himself to be. He is our Heavenly Father in whose image we were all created.<br><br>True education then is to seek and understand who you are and not only to know that God lives, but also to know the kind of Being he is and what your relationship to him ought to be. True education is to know that Jesus Christ rose from the dead. It is to know that this same Jesus who walked upon the waters, who healed the sick, who suffered in Gethsemane, who died upon the cross, came forth from the tomb and conquered death. True education is to literally and actually know through the Spirit that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, that he is the Savior of the world.<br><br>On one occasion a very important question was asked of a group of Pharisees when Jesus said to them, "What think ye of Christ? whose son is he?" (Matthew 22:42). The Pharisees didn't have very many good answers.<br><br>I wonder how much better our own answer would be if the same question was asked of us today. After all that is a question that all of us must answer, either with our own voices or with our own lives. Sometimes our own voices indicate that we know the right answer, but the way we live indicates that we do not know the Christ.<br><br>Sometimes it is difficult for some of us to understand and believe something that we have not actually experienced. We are like Thomas. Some of us must put our fingers into the print of the nails and thrust our hand into his side before we can believe. How sad and unfortunate.<br><br>Peter had the right answer when he said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God" (Matthew 16:16). What a tremendous spiritual education we would have if we would likewise know what Peter knew and say what Peter said.<br><br>In our own day Joseph Smith verified the existence of Christ by his own personal testimony that he saw our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ with his own eyes and testified that Jesus lives. He said, "I have actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light I saw two Personages, and they did in reality speak to me" (Joseph Smith--History 1:25).<br><br>My own personal testimony is that Jesus Christ was not only a great teacher; he was not only a great educator, a great philosopher, and a great leader, but he was foreordained to be the Savior of the world. He voluntarily came down to earth to lay down his life for the salvation of men. He came to earth and taught all men, took their sins upon himself, and finally allowed his life to be taken to redeem mankind from the effects of the fall in the Garden of Eden. He is the Only Begotten Son of God in the flesh; he is the Redeemer of the world; he is the Christ.<br><br>True education is to know the true God and Jesus Christ. Only when we know these things can we ever hope to enter his presence once again. True education recognizes the priesthood of God as the only great, legal, supreme authority and power that governs all things at all times upon the earth, in the universe, and in the eternities. It is the only great, supreme authority and power that governs all the children of God upon all the worlds that have been, upon all the worlds that are in existence now, and upon all the worlds that are yet to come.<br><br>True education recognizes the ancient as well as the modern-day prophets and apostles in all dispensations as universal educators. True education recognizes that Jesus Christ, our Redeemer and Savior, stands above all as a great teacher and a great educator for all mankind, for all dispensations. True education recognizes that we are the children of God and that this world is a great school of education. The whole world is a school, and all God's children upon the earth are but students in it. This great world school has on its enrollment every human being that is alive today, every human being that has ever lived in the past, and every human being that is yet to come. In this great world school, God our Heavenly Father is our Teacher, for there is no other teacher that can compare with him.<br><br>True education is the gospel of Jesus Christ. The gospel of Jesus Christ is a panacea for all sin and evil. The gospel of Jesus Christ will do away with all evil, all selfishness, all greed, and all lawlessness. It will do away with immorality, crime, and all other wickedness. Our Heavenly Father, our great Teacher, is endeavoring to teach us in this school of life, for his Spirit is striving with all men, and through his inspiration a great flood of knowledge and understanding is coming into the world.<br><br>If you are one who is ambitious and desires a well-balanced education, be sure and be firm and anchored in the spiritual things first, in the deep things of God. Spiritual knowledge can be secured only by obedience to his gospel through which we may secure and retain the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost. Just as there are academic and athletic scholarships, there is also a life scholarship to which you are all entitled. That life scholarship is the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost. He is our tutor, our educator, and our teacher.<br><br>True education starts in the home. Our Father in Heaven has given parents the responsibility of teaching the gospel to their children. He has clearly admonished us that if we do not spiritually educate our children, the sin will be upon the parents. The search for spiritual truth or knowledge should begin in the home. The home either makes or scars the character of children. The influences of the home, whether good or evil, carve and shape the souls of the precious spirit children of God. Since home and family development are powerful forces in the development of a child, a child's destiny is largely determined by what parents do with him in the home. The early imprint of family life in the home is usually not easily erased. Parents may not be able to teach their children everything there is to know about the gospel, but it is up to them to lay the foundation and prepare them to be receptive to spiritual education throughout their lives. Parents should not look to Church auxiliary programs for the spiritual knowledge of their children.<br><h2><b>Our Primary Concern</b></h2><br>It appears in the scriptures that the Lord wants us to be primarily concerned with feeding our spiritual selves while here in mortality. It seems that he desires us to emphasize or concentrate on seeking spiritual knowledge.<br><br>Let us briefly analyze some of these scriptures. In the Doctrine and Covenants we read:<br><br><i>Therefore, care not for the body, neither the life of the body; but care for the soul, and for the life of the soul.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 101:37]<br><br>It seems from this scripture that the Lord wants us to be most interested in the life of the soul, or the life of our spirit body, which part is eternal. If we are really going to know and appreciate eternal life, or his way of life, in this life we ought to emphasize gaining spiritual knowledge, or feeding our eternal spirit selves. As we take care of the needs of our spirits, then naturally, almost automatically, the needs of our natural bodies will be met.<br><br>Again from modern revelations we read,<br><br><i>Man was also in the beginning with God. Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 93:29]<br><br>We learn from this verse that intelligences, or our spiritual bodies, were not created or made and never can be. Our spirit bodies, or intelligences, have no beginning and no end.<br><br>Again reading from the Doctrine and Covenants, we find that the Lord said,<br><br><i>All thrones and dominions, principalities and powers, shall be revealed and set forth upon all who have endured valiantly for the gospel of Jesus Christ.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:29]<br><br>Thus, it appears that we are entitled to celestial glory if we develop a valiant testimony of Jesus Christ in this life and endure to the end. All dominions, principalities, powers, and thrones will be ours if we can in this life place spiritual things first, if we can subjugate the body to the spirit, if we can cast away all evil, and if we can gain spiritual knowledge first. Then we will be entitled to all of these great powers. Spiritual power is prerequisite to creative powers. When a man receives all dominions, principalities, and powers, he is given all that God has, and thereby he is all-knowing, including all-knowing about secular things. He then becomes a god.<br><br>Again, the Lord said, "The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36). It appears from this particular scripture that our Heavenly Father glories in his spirit sons and daughters or intelligences. He does not glory in intelligence or knowledge per se. He does not glory in our gaining secular knowledge alone, but he glories in our developing and expanding our spirit selves, or our intelligences.<br><h2><b>To Become a God</b></h2><br>The way to become a god is to expand our intelligences, to add glory to our spirit selves, to have our spiritual knowledge control our secular knowledge, to subjugate secular knowledge to our spiritual knowledge.<br><br>Again we read, "It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance" (D&amp;amp;C 131:6). It appears that the ignorance that the Lord talks about in this particular scripture means ignorance of him, his programs, and his teachings. It means ignorance of spiritual knowledge. It does not necessarily mean ignorance of secular knowledge. It is impossible for any one of us to be saved with only secular knowledge. A man can become a great physicist or a great scientist, but he will not be entitled to celestial glory if he lacks spiritual knowledge. On the other hand, a man can become a great physicist or a great scientist and at the save time be well anchored in spiritual things. In this situation, he is entitled to celestial glory because he has placed spiritual knowledge over secular knowledge. He has placed God and the gospel of Jesus Christ first. Like the Lord, he has put all earthly glory behind him and lived a spiritual life.<br><br>The Lord Jesus Christ set a good example for us in this area. Certainly he was the master Teacher, the master Creator, the Master of all sciences, the Master of all secular things, but yet he always placed spiritual things first. As great as he is, he always subjugated the secular to the spiritual. He put all worldly power, fame, and glory behind him and chose spiritual life for which he came here. We must do the same.<br><br>From the Doctrine and Covenants, we read,<br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:19]<br><br>It appears from this scripture that we will be graded in the life hereafter by how much glory we have added to our spirit selves, or intelligences. We will be graded by how much we have expanded our spiritual minds in regard to spiritual things, or the things of God, how much we have fed our spirit bodies, or intelligences. Since our spirits are eternal, any eternal, spiritual truths we train them with will be to our advantage in the life hereafter. We can only add to our spirits, or intelligences, through our diligence and obedience to his commandments and laws. From these scriptures we learn that mere book learning and merely seeking secular knowledge are not what the Lord has in mind.<br><br>Why take a chance to fill your mind with secular knowledge which sometimes is of only temporal use? Secular knowledge has limitations unless it has a relationship to the spiritual truth. Why learn and know all about geology, zoology, psychology, mathematics, history, government when you have very little chance to use it, not having qualified in this life to be a god with creative powers to create worlds? We must qualify ourselves to become gods first before we have the ability to create worlds, or to be all-knowing about worlds. What good is it to know about math, forestry, civil law, or philosophies of men if you don't know the Creator himself? What will it take and how long will it take for us to know and understand and realize that the Creator himself is a master of secular knowledge? He is the Master of forestry, math, civil laws, and all the sciences. What good is it to accumulate secular knowledge if you don't live his laws that will perfect you? What good is it to know about all of these secular things when we do not obey the commandments which will help us become gods so that we in turn can become masters of all sciences and all secular knowledge?<br><br>Secular knowledge can have a permanent or important value only if we become a god first. Then we will have the creative powers to create worlds and place upon them fishes in the sea, birds in the trees, and beasts in the forests. Secular knowledge alone, as important as it may be, can never save a soul, cannot open the gates of the celestial kingdom, cannot create a beautiful world or make a man a god. Secular knowledge can only be most useful and helpful to a man who places spiritual things first, a man who has found a way to eternal life, a man who is anchored in spiritual things. When he does this, and only then, will he be in a position to bring into place all knowledge to be his tool and servant.<br><br>A mission should come first over any worldly aspiration, including college work. Temple marriage should take top priority over degrees or secular training. A Church assignment or calling should be more important than sports or any pleasure or entertainment. Church assignments or responsibilities should come first over a hobby or TV show, a movie or work. Church or spiritual activity should take priority over a secular activity. Home teaching should take precedence over a ballgame. Church attendance should have priority over a television show or a visiting of friends, relatives, or loved ones. The scriptures should take priority over secular books.<br><h2><b>Anchored in the Spiritual</b></h2><br>My brothers and sisters, can you begin to see why the Lord emphasized, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you" (Matthew 6:33). Can you begin to see why he has emphasized spiritual education over secular education? Can you begin to see why he wants us to be anchored in the spiritual before the secular?<br><br>There will come a day somewhere in your life, somewhere along the way on the straight and narrow path, when you will come face to face with so-called learned men, intellectuals or philosophers. They will cast doubt on your faith and testimony. They will cast doubt on your spiritual education. If such a time comes in your life where you begin to have some doubts, when you are faced with a challenge or problem, try to approach your problem from the point of view of seeing how much you can build up your spiritual belief and not from the point of view of trying to see how much you can build up your spiritual belief and not from the point of view of trying to see how much you can tear down your gospel belief. In all your approaches to the problems of life, try to reach after them from the point of view of the gospel, from the point of view of spiritual knowledge.<br><br>The Savior said in the Sermon on the Mount,<br><br><i>Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</i>[Matthew 7:15]<br><br>Paul, as he made his farewell address to the people at Ephesus, said,<br><br><i>For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.</i><br><br><i>Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.</i>[Acts 20:29–30]<br><br>Remember, rarely do men die to vindicate secular knowledge, but it is different with the spiritual knowledge that you have and will have and should have. Men have gone to martyrs' deaths from the beginning until now to vindicate their spiritual knowledge. Do not slip away from spiritual knowledge. Do not allow secular knowledge to occupy most of your time throughout your life.<br><h2><b>On Guard</b></h2><br>My brothers and sisters, if there ever was a time in our history when we must be on guard against these so-called learned men or philosophers, that time is today, that time is now. We must not be asleep; we have the truth. We have the spiritual knowledge; we must preserve it.<br><br>These ravening wolves are among us, sometimes from our own Church membership, and they, more than any others, are clothed in sheep's clothing. These ravening wolves will begin to make friends with you. They will cultivate your friendship. They will invite you to their homes. They will take you to their socials; they will take you to their classes of instruction. They will get you to lie and cheat a little. They will get you to break the Word of Wisdom and the law of chastity. They will tell you that your religion is too hard to live. Before you know it, you will find yourself slipping away from spiritual truths, spiritual knowledge, and activity in the Church. Before you know it, you have lost your faith and testimony.<br><br>Someone said we never lose eternal life by a blowout. It is always by a series of slow leaks, a little disobedience here, a little disobedience there, a little disbelief here and there, a little sin here, a few harmless mistakes. Before we know it, we have lost eternal life. These ravening wolves and other so-called intellectuals, learned men and philosophers, have destroyed the morality and spirituality of millions of people. They have led multitudes into disbelief. Their ideas and attitudes that are unwholesome and unholy spread quickly. These supposedly learned men will cast doubts on your faith and testimony. They will cast doubts on spiritual things. They will cast doubts on your spiritual knowledge. These men will have you be anchored in secular knowledge first. They will lead you to the paths of doubt and unto destruction. They know not the truth, but they think they know it. They will try to persuade you that you should follow them.<br><br>My friends, beware of these faith killers and testimony killers. Some of them will be found on university and college campuses throughout the nation. Because of their supposedly superior knowledge and ability and because of the students' hunger and thirst to learn, it will seem natural for students to wholeheartedly believe these faith killers.<br><br>Jesus Christ said, "A man's foes shall be they of his own household" (Matthew 10:36). Teachers, whether on the elementary, secondary, or college level, are supposed to be among our greatest benefactors, yet sometimes these same instructors may destroy the morality and spirituality of many of our young people. Beware of these testimony killers; they will teach you philosophies that are contrary to the gospel of Jesus Christ. With their fine intellects and sometimes because of their charm and their strong personalities, they will make broad the straight and narrow path.<br><br>The Jaredite nation was destroyed because people listened too much to the so-called learned men, philosophers, and ravening wolves, which were among them. The Nephite civilization was also destroyed because of the same reason. They listened more to these ravening wolves, and they were destroyed by their secret combinations. This Jaredite and Nephite disease is also among us today, and it will destroy our nation if we do not repent and return to the God of this land, even Jesus Christ. This Jaredite-Nephite disease will destroy us if we do not place spiritual knowledge above secular knowledge.<br><br>We have seen civilization after civilization destroyed because their members have been wrong in their thinking. There are many in our own day who follow this pattern. I think in education there are some who talk about academic freedom, and they feel that they have a right to teach as they choose. Then they teach anything and everything that they choose in the name of academic freedom. More often than not, they teach their own philosophies, philosophies of men, in the name of academic freedom. I feel that freedom in education or in life is good, provided that we are in harmony with the mind, the will, and the word of the Lord; otherwise, I think we will be wrong.<br><h2><b>Do Not Be Deceived</b></h2><br>The Lord said that our joy would be great if we bring but one soul unto him, but I say how great will be our regret if, through our bad influence, example, and teaching, we should lead one soul away from God.<br><br>Do not be deceived. Can you see why we should let spiritual knowledge take first place in our lives, why it should take precedence? Can you begin to see why we must pray unceasingly, why we must study the scriptures diligently, why we must perfect our lives as the Savior did? Can you begin to see why religion classes should have preferential attention over the regular secular college courses? Can you begin to see why the study of the scriptures, or seeking spiritual knowledge, should take precedence over secular knowledge and learning? Can you begin to see why the scriptures should take priority over the man-written books? Can you begin to see why association with the Church should take priority over campus clubs? Can you begin to see why the paying of tithing should take priority over the paying of tuition and fees? Can you begin to see why the ordinances of the temple should take priority over any worldly activity?<br><br>My brothers and sisters, why become obsessed with the acquisition of secular knowledge at the expense of spiritual knowledge and performance? Why become obsessed with the philosophies of men at the cost of spiritual knowledge or performance? Why become intoxicated with your own intelligence and success and become too self-sufficient and proud to feel the need for spiritual knowledge? Can you begin to understand why the Savior said what he did when he said, "For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?" (Matthew 16:26). What doth it profit a man if he gain the whole earth, whether it be in a dominion of political position or power, or whether it be in a dominion of scientific worlds, whether it be in a dominion of some abstract knowledge, or any other walk of life, if by gaining that secular knowledge and dominion, he lose his own soul?<br><br>From these instructions and others, the Lord makes it clear to us that the secular things taught in the colleges and universities are important, but the Lord places first things first. He puts everything in its proper sequence. He desires all of us to learn of his teachings and the laws of the gospel pertaining to eternal life. Then he wants us to add the knowledge of the world--chemistry, geology, geography, history, government, economics, and so on.<br><br>Jesus Christ himself gave us the proper sequence when he said,<br><br><i>Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you</i>[Matthew 6:33]<br><br>To the Prophet Joseph Smith the Lord said,<br><br><i>This is eternal lives--to know the only wise and true God, and Jesus Christ, whom he hath sent. I am he. Receive ye, therefore, my law.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 132:24]<br><br>There will come a day in the future, my brothers and sisters, when the kingdoms of man will come crashing down, but the kingdom of God will stand firm and unshaking. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>George P. Lee was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 17 May 1983.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>hbearer - Vaughn J. Featherstone - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
This opportunity to speak to you tonight reminds me, I suppose in an intimidating way, of the sixty-six-year-old golfer who would drive the ball a long, long way down the fairway. The only problem was that his eyesight wasn't very good, and he would lose golf balls right in the middle of the fairway. He was a strong golfer and could drive the ball a long way but couldn't see where they went. So he went to the pro and said, "Would you mind helping me? I don't like to lose golf balls and I love the game and don't want to stop playing. Have you got any ideas?"<br><br>The pro said, "Oh, sure, we've got this eighty-eight-year-old golfer over here who is crippled up and can't play anymore, loves the game, hangs around here all the time, and has eyes like an eagle's. Take him along, and he will spot the ball for you. You will have a great time together."<br><br>So they went out on the first tee, and the younger man, sixty-six, teed his ball up, and he drove a long ball far beyond where he could see. He turned to the older man and asked, "Did you see where that went?"<br><br>And he said, "Yep."<br><br>And he said, "Where did it go?"<br><br>And he said, "I forgot."<br><br>I think that is what you who attend this great institution have a tendency to make us do in this kind of a setting. It is easy to forget.<br><br>I happen to love the poem from which I take the title for my talk tonight; it is called "The Torch Bearer."<br><br><i>The Torch Bearer</i><br><i>The God of the High Endeavor</i><br><i>Gave me a torch to bear.</i><br><i>I lifted it high above me</i><br><i>In the dark and murky air;</i><br><br><i>And straightway with loud hosannas</i><br><i>The crowd proclaimed its light</i><br><i>And followed me as I carried my torch</i><br><i>Through the starless night,</i><br><br><i>Till drunk with people's praises</i><br><i>And mad with vanity</i><br><i>I forgot 'twas the torch they followed</i><br><i>And fancied they followed me.</i><br><br><i>Then slowly my arm grew weary</i><br><i>Upholding the shining load</i><br><i>And my tired feet went stumbling</i><br><i>Over the dusty road.</i><br><br><i>I fell with the torch beneath me.</i><br><i>In a moment the light was out.</i><br><i>When lo! from the throng a stripling</i><br><i>Sprang forth with a mighty shout,</i><br><br><i>Caught up the torch as it smoldered,</i><br><i>And lifted it high again,</i><br><i>Till fanned by the winds of heaven,</i><br><i>It fired the souls of men.</i><br><br><i>And as I lay in the darkness</i><br><i>The feet of the trampling crowd</i><br><i>Passed over and far beyond me,</i><br><i>Its paeans proclaimed around,</i><br><br><i>And I learned in the deepening twilight</i><br><i>This glorious verity,</i><br><i>'Tis the torch that the people follow,</i><br><i>Whoever the bearer may be.</i><br>--Author unknown<br>[Thomas Curtis Clark, comp.,<i>The Master of Men</i>(Freeport, NY: Books for Libraries Press, 1970, c1958), p. 205]<br><br>There is a great truth in the verse. Tonight I would like to talk to you as torchbearers. I would like to discuss what we oftentimes hear mentioned today by writers, speakers, and others as our agenda, whether a weekly agenda, an unwritten agenda, or our life's agenda. I would refer to this one as a lifetime agenda. Elder Maxwell once mentioned a quote regarding "the tyranny of the unweighted agenda." Think about that in your life's priorities: "the tyranny of the unweighted agenda." And so I'd like to talk to you about a few things that I think help us to separate illusion from reality--some may call it shadow or reality. What we have to offer is reality, and I am convinced that if we are not very careful and very selective, then maybe we do not carry the torch as well--or we may not be there to pick it up at the right time.<br><h2><b>A Lifetime Agenda</b></h2><br>A great general, Lucius Macedonicus, made a statement--at least it was attributed to him. He called it, or someone later called it, "Come with Me to Macedonia." It is a great statement and one that has impressed me greatly, with its many hidden truths. He said:<br><br><i>Commanders should be counselled chiefly by persons of known talent, by those who have made the art of war their particular study, and whose knowledge is derived from experience, by those who are present at the scene of action, who see the enemy, who see the advantages that occasions offer, and who, like people embarked in the same ship, are sharers of the danger.</i><br><br><i>If, therefore, anyone thinks himself qualified to give advice respecting the war which I am about to conduct, let him not refuse his assistance to the state, but let him come with me into Macedonia.</i><br><br><i>He shall be furnished with a ship, a tent; even his travelling charges will be defrayed, but if he thinks this too much trouble, and prefers the repose of a city life to the toils of war, let him not on land assume the office of a pilot. The city in itself furnishes abundance of topics for conversation; let it confine its passion for talking to its own precincts and rest assured that we shall pay no attention to any counsel but such as shall be framed within our camp.</i>[General Lucius Aemilius Paulus, surnamed Macedonicus, Roman general and patrician, c. 229-160 B.C.]<br><br>That is a powerful statement, "Commanders should be counselled chiefly by persons of known talent." I think in a real sense those of us who have a few more years than you do have some experience we could pass on to you that would be worth your while considering. I have seen the enemy. I know what he is like, and I can tell you just a little about him. I think tonight, as we talk about the torchbearer and the needs you have in prioritizing your personal agenda, a statement John H. Vandenberg made years back comes to mind. He said, "The fruit of wisdom ripens slowly." That is a great statement and a true one, and it will be more true as years go by.<br><h2><b>Experience</b></h2><br>Years back when we lived in Boise, Idaho, a man in our ward, Bill Bowman, who was the wrestling coach at Boise State College, did his doctorate work, his dissertation, on what makes a winner. After interviewing over a thousand athletes and feeding all the information into the computer, he got his answer. Do you know what it is that contributes more to winning than any other thing, at least in his research? Others might vary or differ, but I happen to agree with him. He said that when all the research and data came back, experience--more than desire, more than motivation, more than anything else--experience was the number one contributor to success in winning.<br><br>I think that one thing we have to put on our agenda is the right kind of experience and place it high. You don't need the wrong kind of experience. It was Walter Malone who said about opportunity,<br><br><i>They do me wrong who say I come no more</i><br><i>... When once I knock and fail to find you in,</i><br><i>For every day I stand outside your door</i><br><i>And bid you wake, and rise to fight and win.</i><br><br><i>Wail not for precious chances passed away,</i><br><i>Weep not for golden ages on the wane!</i><br><i>Each night I burn the records of the day;</i><br><i>At sunrise every soul is born again.</i><br>["Opportunity,"<i>Masterpieces of Religious Poetry,</i>James Dalton Morrison, ed. (New York: Harper and Brothers, 1948), p. 301]<br><br>I believe that with all my heart, but I know it's far, far better if we never get involved in the wrong kinds of experiences. I believe in repentance, and I believe in an opportunity to redo and go back and make things right, but I know in the long run we are safer if we stay on the straight and narrow path. Obedience is a great principle. Obedience isn't a loss of free agency. Obedience is actually gaining the highest kind of free agency. When the God of heaven, who knows all the best ways and<i>the best way,</i>tells us how to do it and what to do, wisdom (which we gain from years of experience) would dictate that we follow that.<br><h2><b>Service</b></h2><br>The next item I would have to put on my list of high priorities is service. A great Frenchman by the name of François-René de Chateaubriand said this: "In the days of service all things are founded; in the days of special privilege they deteriorate; and in the days of vanity they are destroyed."<br><br>We love President Kimball with everything in us, do we not? We literally would hold him on a feather pillow. When he goes from one area to another, they usually meet him at the airplane with a limousine and they whisk him into the limousine and drive him to the stake center or wherever he might be going, but President Kimball pushes through the bodyguards and security and is out shaking hands with people. He wants to be with the people. He is so involved in service special privilege could not detract from this great man. He will never be in a position of vanity. In the days of special privilege they deteriorate, and in the day of vanity they are destroyed, but in the days of service all things are founded.<br><br>Would you make a resolution somewhere on your agenda to take time to serve. You see, the prideful person wants other people to serve him. With the humble, sweet servant like President Kimball, his whole attitude is to serve other people, to do for them what they need done. That has been his whole mission in this life. Also understand that in service we find reality. I think it was just a year and a half ago around Christmas or the New Year holiday that I made a decision that every day I would do some Christian act of service. That is not impressive, but I decided this Christian act of service would be something I would initiate myself, not when people would come to me and say, "Will you come to the hospital, will you administer to this person, or could I counsel with you for a few minutes, or can you come here and speak?" It is something that I seek for, a Christian act of service. I think since that time there has not been a day that I haven't found an opportunity to sign a book and send it to someone or make a phone call that may have been more important than I would have ever dared to suppose or to drop by and see someone in the hospital that had not invited me to come--just drop in. I think service is a great thing. It purges, it cleanses, and it keeps your thinking straight. Keep service high on your agenda.<br><br>Last Sunday night, I walked in the door at home at 9:30; my wife and I were home alone. We talked for a while and then went to bed. The phone rang. A friend that I had known since the first grade--his name is Joe--had called the Church operator to see if I was home. She called through and said, "There is a man by the name of Joe ––– that is trying to get in touch with you. Would you mind talking with him? He has tried several times."<br><br>I said, "I'd love to."<br><br>She put him on, and he said, "Hi, Brother Vaughn," in a broken voice.<br><br>I said, "What can I do for you?"<br><br>And he said, "I know you just got in. I've been checking all day, but my daughter is in the hospital. Can you come?"<br><br>The flesh said, "When?" I knew when, but I said to him, "When?"<br><br>And he said, "Tonight? Would that be asking too much?"<br><br>I said, "No. I'll be right there."<br><br>It is a half-hour drive from our home in to the University of Utah Medical Center. I turned to my wife and said, "I need to go to the hospital." Do you know how many times she has heard that in our marriage, that I need to leave after I've come home? I asked, "Would you mind going with me?"<br><br>She said, "I'd love to go." And we got out of bed, got dressed, went to the hospital together. I thought I was exhausted and tired before, but I was not exhausted when we drove back home. My wife and I had had a great experience, but more importantly, I was able to help a man that I had known since I was in the first grade who had a daughter in serious trouble in the hospital, hanging between life and death. I gave the blessing. I was not even sure as we went into the room that she would make it through the blessing. She is alive still; it is a miracle. What a blessing that service is when the flesh says, "I've had enough," and the spirit says, "No, you haven't; you are just starting. Get going." We need to remember that.<br><br>We have some great missionaries. I was interviewing one of them sometime back, and since he has been on a mission--he and his wife together--it appears they will probably lose their business. It was a large business, and they lived in a very comfortable, large home. I was visiting with him, asking what we could do, how we could help them, and if he needed to come home from his mission and then go back out later on.<br><br>The wife replied. She said, "No. We want to stay on our mission. We can't leave the mission field. We may lose the business and we may lose our home, but since we've been on our mission, we found out the difference between illusion and reality. We have some lovely things we have collected over the years, but we really don't need them. If my husband had been home, he literally would be a dead man now. He would have put every bit of energy he had into saving the company, and he wouldn't be here. I love the Lord for calling us on a mission at the right time. We may go home and have to live in a little apartment and have to start all over again, but that doesn't really matter. I never have loved my husband more desperately in all my life than I do right now."<br><br>And her husband said, "No, we will not leave the mission. The only thing I feel bad about is three of my family members who are in the business will be out looking for work."<br><br>And I believe today they're out looking for work, but this wonderful couple stayed out in the mission field. "In the days of service all things are founded."<br><h2><b>The Intense Life</b></h2><br>I think the next thing we have to put high on our priority list is the intense life. I suppose that somewhere we have a vision that leisure, resting, and relaxing is a great thing, and that may be true. I have a verse that someday I'm going to quote to the General Authorities. It is by Edgar A. Guest, and he calls it "No Place to Go." It goes like this:<br><br><i>The happiest nights</i><br><i>I ever know</i><br><i>Are those when I've</i><br><i>No place to go,</i><br><i>When the missus says</i><br><i>When the day is through:</i><br><i>"Tonight we don't have</i><br><i>A thing to do."</i><br><i>Oh, the joy of it,</i><br><i>And the peace untold</i><br><i>Of sitting 'round</i><br><i>In my slippers old,</i><br><i>With</i>[<i>music and book</i>]<br><br><i>In my easy chair,</i><br><i>Knowing I needn't</i><br><i>Go anywhere!</i><br><i>Needn't hurry</i><br><i>My evening meal</i><br><i>Nor force the smiles</i><br><i>That I do not feel,</i><br><i>But grab a book</i><br><i>From a near-by shelf,</i><br><i>And drop all sham</i><br><i>And be myself.</i><br><i>Oh, the charm of it,</i><br><i>And the comfort rare;</i><br><i>Nothing on this earth</i><br><i>With it can compare;</i><br><i>I am sorry for him</i><br><i>Who doesn't know</i><br><i>The joy of having</i><br><i>No place to go.</i><br>[Edgar A. Guest,<i>A Heap o' Livin'</i>(Chicago: Reilly &amp;amp; Lee, 1916), pp. 110–11]<br><br>You have to earn that; it doesn't just come. I think we've all felt that way sometimes. You remember the man that got on the train in London going to Doncaster, and he went to the conductor and asked, "What time does the train stop at Doncaster?"<br><br>The conductor said, "It doesn't stop at Doncaster on Wednesdays--every other day, but not Wednesdays."<br><br>The man said, "It has to stop; I've got to get off; I'm speaking tonight at Doncaster."<br><br>The conductor said, "I'm sorry, it doesn't stop at Doncaster on Wednesdays. But, I'll tell you what. There is a little junction just outside of Doncaster that the train slows down for. I believe that, if you were standing on the platform and you were all ready, and when I gave you the signal you jumped running as fast as you could when you hit the ground, you might make it."<br><br>So just outside of Doncaster he was standing out on the platform. He had his attach case in his hand. The conductor said to jump, and he jumped running as fast as he could go. He hit the ground somehow stumbling forward in a football-stance landing and that thrust him forward. He actually gained one full car. The conductor on the car up ahead grabbed him by the hand, pulled him on board, and said, "You're lucky to make this train. It doesn't stop in Doncaster on Wednesdays."<br><br>You have to live that kind of intense life, I think, if you are going to enjoy things.<br><br>Abraham Lincoln said that when a man is over forty, he is responsible for his own face. I believe that. You even see it as a mission president. When the missionaries get off the plane, you could almost identify the mission leaders. They would never believe you could, but each of us is responsible for our own face at a certain time. Thomas Bennett, a great corporate executive, says, "In the midst of every adversity, there is an abundance of opportunity." We sometimes don't understand that every disadvantage can be changed into an advantage, and that there is no great achievement without pain. We have to think that through a little bit, but it is a true statement.<br><br>So that would have to be the next qualifier--to live the intense life. We don't need to just drift aimlessly or try to search out leisure. Make sure that they are prized moments when they do come. Someone said that you can tell what a man is really like if you see what he does in his leisure. We will not take time to discuss some of the ways that leisure would be used.<br><h2><b>Testimony</b></h2><br>I've always loved Heber C. Kimball. President Brigham Young referred to him as his prophet counselor and Daniel H. Wells as his statesman counselor. In the 1950s Harold B. Lee spoke here at BYU and quoted from Heber C. Kimball, and then in 1974 President Hinckley in his general conference talk quoted the same thing. And Heber C. Kimball said this:<br><br><i>We think we are secure here in the chambers of the everlasting hills, where we can close those few doors of the canyons against mobs and persecutors, the wicked and the vile, who have always beset us with violence and robbery, but I want to say to you, my brethren, the time is coming when we will be mixed up in these now peaceful valleys to that extent that it will be difficult to tell the face of a Saint from the face of an enemy to the people of God. Then, brethren, look out for the great sieve, for there will be a great sifting time, and many will fall; for I say unto you there is a</i>test,<i>a</i>test,<i>a</i>TEST<i>coming, and who will be able to stand? ...</i><br><br><i>... You imagine that you would have stood by him</i>[<i>Joseph Smith</i>]<i>when persecution raged and he was assailed by foes within and without. You would have defended him and been true to him in the midst of every trial. You think you would have been delighted to have shown your integrity in the days of mobs and traitors.</i><br><br><i>Let me say to you, that many of you will see the time when you will have all the trouble, trial and persecution that you can stand, and plenty of opportunities to show that you are true to God and his work. This Church has before it many close places through which it will have to pass before the work of God is crowned with victory. To meet the difficulties that are coming, it will be necessary for you to have a knowledge of the truth of this work for yourselves. The difficulties will be of such a character that the man or woman who does not possess this personal knowledge or witness will fall. If you have not got the testimony, live right and call upon the Lord and cease not till you obtain it. If you do not you will not stand.</i><br><br><i>Remember these sayings, for many of you will live to see them fulfilled. The time will come when no man nor woman will be able to endure on borrowed light. Each will have to be guided by the light within himself.</i>[Orson F. Whitney,<i>Life of Heber C. Kimball</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1967), pp. 446, 449, 450]<br><br>I think we are just now coming into that time. We live in a day of inverted values. The whole world is upside down. Transgression has never been so serious and so grievous as it is today. I've thought about all the consequences for our generation. We need to think a little about the testings.<br><h2><b>Love</b></h2><br>I've heard more and more of temple divorce. That is not right, a cancellation of sealings, a divorce after temple marriage. We do not consider some things. When a celestial marriage takes place in the temple, then we have made an eternal decision, and we ought to have the courage and the faith to live a Christian life and attend to those covenants. We oftentimes hear about incompatibility. I've never talked to any two people who, if they would both live Christian principles, could not get along and fall more deeply in love. Sometimes we take the world's way out. That is one of the great tests that will come our way: whether we will abide the standard of the Lord or whether we will search for another way out.<br><br>President McKay said about arguments between a man and his wife, "When you get into a discussion, only one get angry at a time." And then he suggested for the man, "You go outside and walk around the block, and then when you get back home, throw your hat in the door. If it comes back out again, walk around the block another time." Well, that is great counsel. We need to decide that we can solve every problem. Two intelligent Christian people can solve a problem. If you were smart and wise enough to fall in love once, you can fall back in love again. Just decide in your marriages that are in the temple that you will never consider divorce. I suppose the same ought to be said for any couple who marry, in or out of the temple. Remember that no one really does ever possess anyone else. We may in a real sense give ourselves to someone else, as my life has been given to the Savior. I love him more than all else in this world. I love my wife with all my heart, and she is here tonight, and I love my family, but Jesus has my absolute love. I am totally committed to him. He possesses me, not because he demands it, but because of my free agency. And when a woman gives herself to her husband like that and a man gives himself to his wife, do you suppose they cannot solve the problems that are there? To you women here tonight, remember that no woman ever has to follow a man in unrighteousness, only in righteousness.<br><br>I love golf stories, and especially this one. This golfer was at the eighteenth hole, he took out three of his favorite golf clubs and handed them to the caddy and he said, "Take these clubs home and give them to my wife. They are my favorites and they ought to be a remembrance of me. I'm going to walk out into the lake here and drown myself."<br><br>The caddy said, "It wouldn't work. You couldn't keep your head down."<br><br>Well, I don't know about that, but in marriage we can solve the problems. Marriage doesn't work unless you make an effort at it and make it work. Make this a high priority agenda item. Whatever comes in your marriage, simply kneel down together and put your arm around each other's waist and pray to God, "Please help us." I promise the help will come.<br><br>To conclude this particular section, I will quote another Frenchman, Ren de Chardan, who said, "Sometime, after we have mastered the winds and the waves and the tides and gravity, we will harness for God the energies of love, and then for the second time in the history of the world, man will have discovered fire."<br><br>That is why President Kimball is so great. When I went out to Oklahoma, many years back and found young chaplain John Cooper out there, I was reminded of his father who had been the stake president up in Logan. There was a time in the Church--and many of you have never heard this before or never known it--when we had quarterly stake conference, and two General Authorities visited every stake conference. Then we went to one General Authority per quarter, then one per six months, then one per year in most stakes--not all of them. But in all those years President Cooper kept a little guest book, and he had every visitor that came to his stake sign in it. The guest book had the date, the name of the person, his title or position, and his hobby. When he had me sign this book, I saw all these thick pages with line after line of the Brethren's names. I looked through and there were President Heber J. Grant and President David O. McKay and President Joseph Fielding Smith, Matthew Cowley, Adam S. Bennion--all the great apostles of the past. I came to this entry: Date: 1954; Name: Spencer W. Kimball; Position: Apostle; hobby: I love people. I kept turning the pages and came to 1964: Spencer W. Kimball, apostle; hobby: I love people. I don't think that President Kimball went back through his book and found out what he had written before to be consistent. I think if we could call him tonight on the phone at his apartment and ask, "President Kimball, what is your hobby?" he would say, "I love people." That is it. Put love high on your priority list.<br><h2><b>Gethsemane</b></h2><br>A rabbi recently wrote a book,<i>When Bad Things Happen to Good People.</i>Interesting thought, isn't it? We could write one,<i>When Good Things Happen to Bad People,</i>and that's an interesting thought. We sometimes feel as if we're being persecuted or that the Lord has withdrawn from us. I don't believe for a second that with many, many of the things that happen to us the Lord is going to interfere. I think it is just part of life. I don't think there is any punishment behind a lot of things. I think they are consequences of living. President Harold B. Lee said, "We will be tested every month of our life." And I believe that. After he quoted that great quote by Heber C. Kimball, he mentioned that. So, you will be tested. Ella Wheeler Wilcox wrote a great verse that I quoted at October conference a year ago, and it is called "Gethsemane." After the conference I wrote to the Historical Department and said, "I need a reference for that particular poem. Would you mind sending it over to me?" Tom Truitt sent over from the Historical Department this long poem, "Gethsemane." I had quoted only one stanza and a couple of lines and what I quoted I thought was good, but listen to all of it:<br><br><i>In golden youth when seems the earth</i><br><i>A Summer-land of singing mirth,</i><br><i>When souls are glad and hearts are light,</i><br><i>And not a shadow lurks in sight,</i><br><br><i>We do not know it, but there lies</i><br><i>Somewhere veiled under evening skies</i><br><i>A garden which we all must see--</i><br><i>The garden of Gethsemane.</i><br><br><i>With joyous steps we go our ways,</i><br><i>Love lends a halo to our days;</i><br><i>Light sorrows sail like clouds afar,</i><br><i>We laugh, and say how strong we are.</i><br><br><i>We hurry on; and hurrying, go</i><br><i>Close to the border-land of woe,</i><br><i>That waits for you, and waits for me--</i><br><i>Forever waits Gethsemane.</i><br><br><i>Down shadowy lanes, across strange streams,</i><br><i>Bridged over by our broken dreams;</i><br><i>Behind the misty caps of years,</i><br><i>Beyond the great salt fount of tears,</i><br><br><i>The garden lies. Strive as you may,</i><br><i>You cannot miss it in your way.</i><br><i>All paths that have been, or shall be,</i><br><i>Pass somewhere through Gethsemane.</i><br><br><i>All those who journey, soon or late,</i><br><i>Must pass within the garden's gate;</i><br><i>Must kneel alone in darkness there,</i><br><i>And battle with some fierce despair.</i><br><br><i>God pity those who can not say,</i><br><i>"Not mine but thine," who only pray,</i><br><i>"Let this cup pass," and cannot see</i><br><i>The</i>purpose<i>in Gethsemane.</i><br>[<i>Maurine and Other Poems</i>(Chicago: W. B. Conkey, 1888), p. 135]<br><br>There will always be a purpose, and I can promise you that no righteous people will ever go through suffering except that they will be compensated for that suffering. Kahlil Gibran said, "The cavity created by the suffering through which we go becomes a receptacle for compensating blessings." I happen to believe that. I would qualify that by saying "righteous suffering" because many people suffer because of the wickedness and the sinfulness and the transgression, but for righteous suffering, compensating blessings will fill the cavity created.<br><br>Max Wiley lost his wife to cancer, he lost a daughter to pneumonia, and then his other daughter was brutally raped and murdered in a Chicago apartment. All his immediate family in a short period of time were gone. And someone asked him, "Max, how do you keep going on?"<br><br>He answered, "A long time ago someone told me, 'When you have come to the end of your rope, you just tie a knot and hang on.'"<br><br>Sometimes that is all we can do. Cullum said, "Night claims from the overburdened soul the truth which daylight is denied" (Ridgwell Cullum,<i>The Men Who Wrought</i>[Philadelphia: George W. Jacobs, 1916], p. 25).<br><br>I believe it was in response to that statement that President Hugh B. Brown, in a funeral service, said, "Yes, but no matter how dark the night, the dawn is irresistible." What a marvelous thing it is to have an understanding that the Lord will never test us more than we can stand!<br><h2><b>Faith in Christ</b></h2><br>Number one on our agenda, above all else, is faith in Christ. I don't know anything that will take the place of it. Whenever we find problems in the Church, we usually find them under one of two umbrellas or canopies, either transgression or lack of faith in Christ. If members have faith in Christ, then they are active in the Church and they are absolutely committed.<br><h2><b>Purity</b></h2><br>Then I suppose the final item--not the final one, but near the final one--would have to be purity. Purity is an essential. Do you know that Victor Hugo said, "Pearls do not dissolve in mire." We live in a day of almost open mental sewage, but pearls do not dissolve in mire. We have to be aware of it and be able to look beyond it and see the Lord's design in things. It has been my experience to sit among the Brethren for some time. Long before I was a General Authority I would sit out in the congregation and look at the faces of the General Authorities. Do you know what I always saw? Besides integrity, devotion, love, and commitment--and I love them more now than I did in those days--I saw almost a translucence, that is, a whiteness, a countenance change. I don't know if any of you saw LeGrand Richards in his later life, but it is true his skin was smooth and almost translucent. I believe you could have almost looked into the soul of LeGrand Richards through this crystal clear, translucent flesh of his and seen "the foulest deed his heart doth hold." I believe in President Kimball's case his face is almost translucent. In the upper room of the temple quite often in our first Thursday meetings--and we'll have one again this Thursday--I have seen on occasion some of the Brethren stand there with an aura of light around them as they spoke. One of the men around whom I saw an aura when he spoke was the president of this great institution, Jeff Holland. It was about four inches wide. He reported to the Brethren, and I could see it. I knew that Jeff Holland was speaking in an inspired way to the Brethren at that time. So keep purity high on your list.<br><h2><b>Summary</b></h2><br>Let me conclude again by reviewing with you the things you ought to carry as a torchbearer. First, follow great men and women, those whom you can trust, those who are worthy examples. Make certain that you choose to serve. If you choose not to serve, you will never be a great leader. Sometime take the Topical Guide and look under<i>Leadership</i>--all the references you can under<i>Leadership.</i>What will you find? The qualities of leadership are not listed there. The are listed under<i>Servant, Love, Compassion.</i>You don't find them under<i>Leadership.</i><br><br>Remember to live an intense life. Stretch your mind to the very limit. Force yourself to do some things when you don't necessarily feel like doing them. Force yourself to be physically ambitious as well, not just mentally ambitious. You have to have the balance of physical and mental ambition. And then learn the value of love--"Someday after we have mastered the winds and the waves and the tides and gravity, we will harness for God the energies of love, and then for the second time in the history of the world man will have discovered fire."<br><br>Remember also that you cannot escape it; you must one day go to Gethsemane and back. I promise you will never have to go alone as He did. I promise you that every step of the way He will be with you, that His love is absolute and His charity is uttermost. There is no end to His charity, no end to His love, and He will always be with you. Then live pure; it is essential to greatness. God bless you. I have a testimony. With everything in my soul I know that this is the kingdom of God on the earth. There is none other. As humble and as bold as I can possibly be, I have to declare my witness of this Church, as this is the only true and living church on the face of the whole earth, and that is reality; it is not shadow. It is not an illusion; it is actual truth. I know it is so. I bear that humble witness to you tonight in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Vaughn J.

<br>
<h2><b>Agency in Mortality</b></h2><br>Last week a young man came into my office with a serious problem. He had been given a gift that was most precious and had misused it, as did the Prodigal Son. You and I have been given that same gift. Whether we succeed or fail in life will depend upon how we use it.<br><br>That precious gift which the Lord has given us is agency--the right to choose for oneself. Since the beginning of time, wars have raged over this issue. Agency is the most vital political issue in the world today. The Lord said to Enoch, "In the Garden of Eden, gave I man his agency" (Moses 7:32). It was also in the Garden of Eden that the Lord said to Adam and Eve, "But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it, nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee." (Moses 3:17).<br><br>What was given to them? It was that most precious gift, the right to choose for themselves--their agency.<br><br>We often refer to agency as<i>free agency.</i>Adding the word<i>free</i>is descriptive. It is also repetitive, for agency implies the capacity or freedom to act.<br><h2><b>Agency in Premortal Life</b></h2><br>In the Garden of Eden, the Lord gave man his agency. We also had our agency before we came to earth. If not so, Lucifer could not have rebelled against God, for rebellion requires the exercise of agency. Nor could one-third of the hosts of heaven have followed Lucifer. They chose to rebel against God. They supported Lucifer's attempt to destroy the agency of man. As a penalty, they were cast down (see Moses 1:3).<br><br>In section 93 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord explained,<br><br><i>Every spirit of man was innocent in the beginning; and God having redeemed man from the fall, men became</i>again<i>in their infant state, innocent before God.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 93:38; emphasis added]<br><br>So when we entered our premortal life, we were innocent, and when we were born into mortality,<i>again</i>we became innocent before God.<br><br>If I said to you today, "I'm going to Denver." Then if I said to you next week, "I'm going to Denver again," I would have had to go to Denver and return, or I could not properly use the word<i>again.</i>By that same reasoning, if we entered the spirit world innocent before God, and then we became<i>again,</i>in our infant state, innocent before God, we obviously left our state of innocence in the premortal world, else we could not have returned to a state of innocence as we entered mortality. We cannot return from a place where we have not been.<br><h2><b>The Plan of Salvation</b></h2><br>Adam and Eve were commanded by the Lord:<br><br><i>Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat,</i><br><br><i>But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it, nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee; but, remember that I forbid it, for in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</i>[Moses 3:16–17]<br><br>Adam and Eve exercised their agency. They partook of the fruit of the tree of which they were commanded not to partake. As a penalty, they were cast out of the garden and were cut off both spiritually and temporally from the presence of God. They suffered a spiritual death as the Lord had said they would. That is, they no longer had the Spirit of the Lord with them, nor could they walk in his presence. They were alone--alone in the lone and dreary world! Had they continued in that condition, they would have been lost forever and would never have had the opportunity to return to the presence of God, either spiritually or temporally. The prophet Alma explained:<br><br><i>Therefore, as the soul could never die, and the fall had brought upon all mankind a spiritual death as well as a temporal, that is, they were cut off from the presence of the Lord, it was expedient that mankind should be reclaimed from this spiritual death.</i>[Alma 42:9]<br><br>Alma also said, "And thus ... a time [was] granted unto man to repent, yea, a probationary time, a time to repent and serve God" (Alma 42:4). We refer to this probationary time as mortality. For each of us, it is our own life span.<br><br>In their new world--that is, this earth--Adam and Eve were taught by messengers of God. They were taught the principles of faith in the Lord, repentance, baptism for the remission of sins, and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost. After learning these principles, they accepted the gospel of Jesus Christ. They developed faith in the Lord, they repented, they were baptized, and they received the Holy Ghost. Thereafter, so long as they remained faithful, they had the companionship of the Holy Ghost and were spiritually reunited with the Lord.<br><br>When Adam and Eve sinned, or when any of us sin, eternal justice requires a punishment. The debt created by the transgression must be paid. Either we pay the penalty individually for our own sins, or someone else who qualifies by virtue of his perfection must pay the penalty. This is what eternal justice demands. Only the Son of God was qualified, for he was the only One free from sin.<br><br>He came to earth, served his ministry, suffered, bled, died, atoned for the sins of men, and thus satisfied the demands of eternal justice for our sake. Only on condition of repentance of men in this probationary state could this merciful act of Christ take effect in each of our lives, except it would destroy the work of justice. When a person repents, accepts the gospel of Jesus Christ, and lives in accordance with the principles and ordinances of the gospel, then Christ's atonement becomes effective for him, for Jesus Christ has already paid the penalty--that is, for those who will repent.<br><br>God has provided a way for us to accept and obey the gospel, but whether or not we obey is up to each of us.<br><br>The prophet Alma explained the plan of salvation to his son Corianton and then said,<br><br><i>Therefore, O my son, whosoever will come may come and partake of the waters of life freely; and whosoever will not come the same is not compelled to come; but in the last day it shall be restored unto him according to his deeds.</i>[Alma 42:27]<br><h2><b>Agency and Destiny</b></h2><br>And so it is. There is nothing you and I can do to change the rule. Regardless of whether we agree or disagree, the plan remains firm and steady. But we have our agency, and what we do with it determines our future. We can use it wisely and reap the rewards, or we can use it unwisely and pay the penalty.<br><br>Someone has said that, if you put a frog in a pot of boiling water, he will immediately leap out unscathed, but if you put a frog in a pot of tepid water and turn up the heat, the water will warm up gradually, and you will soon have a dead frog.<br><br>That's just the way sin is. No one intends to sin before he first commits a sin. If I were to ask you what kind of a person you want to be, it is likely every one of you would say, "I want to be obedient to the laws of God. I want to be clean and sweet and pure and free from sin."<br><br>Sometimes we fall into sin without realizing that we are sinning. As Earl J. Glade, the founder of KSL, often said, "We sometimes don't realize that we err until after we have erred." But now the water is getting warmer. The more we sin, the easier it becomes to sin. Our conscience grows dimmer. As the water gets warmer, we increasingly lose our sense of values and our sense of judgment.<br><br>When a husband and father of beautiful children permits himself to be attracted to another woman, he soon loses that precious understanding of the value of his wife and his children. His judgment becomes impaired. He permits himself to be gradually destroyed by the adversary. Likewise, when a young lady and a young man permit themselves to get involved in petting, they lose their sense of values and their sense of judgment. A young man responds to the enticing of his would-be friends and takes his first drink. It becomes easier as he takes the second and third ones. He soon loses his freedom and becomes a captive of the adversary.<br><h2><b>Lucifer Makes Sin Attractive</b></h2><br>One day Sister Derrick and I attended the London Temple. For the first time we saw the plan of salvation on film. We recognized that the man who played the role of Lucifer was a friend of ours. I don't mean Lucifer. I mean the one who played the part. He was handsome beyond description with his jet black hair, goatee, long black sideburns, and tanned complexion. But inside, according to the role he was playing, he was wicked and evil. As we left the temple that day, I said to Sister Derrick, "Isn't that just the way Lucifer is! So attractive on the outside, but filthy on the inside." The lights of Las Vegas reflecting from the gold and silver windows are so attractive outside, but inside the casinos, the water bubbles to the boiling point.<br><br>How does Lucifer affect our behavior? The Lord says, "And that wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth, through disobedience, from the children of men" (D&amp;amp;C 93:39).<br><br>But if we keep the Lord's commandments, he places wonderful promises within our reach. "For if you keep my commandments," he said, "you shall receive of his fullness, and be glorified in me as I am in the Father; therefore, I say unto you, you shall receive grace for grace" (D&amp;amp;C 93:20).<br><br>He further said, "And no man receiveth a fulness unless he keepeth his commandments. He that keepeth his commandments receiveth truth and light, until he is glorified in truth and knoweth all things." (D&amp;amp;C 93:27–28).<br><h2><b>Responsibility</b></h2><br>Yes, sin is attractive. The adversary makes it so. But men and women have their agency. They may do what is right, or they may do what is wrong. They may be obedient or disobedient, but they cannot escape the consequences.<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball said:<br><br><i>You probably think you have found a new freedom: to think wholly for yourself, to make wholly your own determinations, to criticize and decide for yourself what is right and wrong. That was decided eternities ago. Right and wrong are not to be determined by you or me. Those elements were decided for us before our birth.</i><br><br><i>We have our free agency to do the right or to do the wrong, but who are we to alter those changeless things? ... But, my beloved young brother, believe this absolute and unchangeable truth;</i>you cannot avoid the responsibility of your acts!<i>Think that through clearly! Do not fool yourself. Your own life is too precious! The lives of your posterity are too priceless! You will receive the rewards of right thinking, righteous doing, conforming attitudes; and wholly beyond your own controls, you will pay penalties--not that God will punish you, but that you, yourself, will bring down upon yourself the judgments.</i>[<i>TSWK,</i>p. 160]<br><br>While we speak of agency, we must also understand that repentance is available to every person. We have our agency to repent. The adversary would have us believe that repentance is not possible. If that were so, we would all be in serious difficulty, for there was only One who was without sin. Repentance enables us to grow spiritually. The steps of repentance are (1) recognition, (2) remorse, (3) resolve, (4) restitution, and (5) abandonment.<br><br>I believe the Lord was speaking of this same process in the Beatitudes. He said, "Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven" (Matthew 5:3). In the Book of Mormon, he clarified this with an addition, "Blessed are the poor in spirit who come unto me, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven" (3 Nephi 12:3). It is not progress to be poor in spirit unless one comes to the Lord for help through prayer. This is the first step, which involves recognition of sin and a desire to improve.<br><br>The second step: "Blessed are all they that mourn, for they shall be comforted" (3 Nephi 12:4). The apostle Paul speaks of a godly sorrow for sin. Unless we have remorse for our sins, we cannot progress toward perfection.<br><br>The third step: "Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth" (3 Nephi 12:5). The meek are the teachable. No longer do we have a defensive and critical attitude. Our unrighteous pride has been broken, through suffering for sin. We are willing to listen to the teachings of the Lord, whose sole right it is to determine the rules and regulations.<br><br>The fourth step: "Blessed are all they who do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled with the Holy Ghost" (3 Nephi 12:6). When we hunger and thirst after righteousness, we are filled with resolve, and we are anxious to learn more about the Lord and how we can improve our lives through knowledge and understanding.<br><br>The fifth step: "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy" (3 Nephi 12:7). When we are merciful, we have a desire to serve others and a sincere concern for their welfare. We want to make restitution where possible for any wrong we may have done them. When we are merciful to others through service and a forgiving attitude, then the Lord will be merciful to us.<br><br>The sixth step: "Blessed are all the pure in heart, for they shall see God" (3 Nephi 12:8). When we abandon our sins and do not permit ourselves to get involved again, we develop a pure heart which entitles us to be in God's presence.<br><br>Now we are ready for the next step which completes the process of repentance, and you will note that all the steps are in the proper sequence: "Blessed are all the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God" (3 Nephi 12:3–9). Following the process of repentance, we have that sweet peace of God in our heart and in our mind. We want peace in the home, peace in the family, peace in the nation, and peace in the world. Indeed, we then qualify to be the children of God.<br><br>We then have no fear of criticism from those who would persecute us falsely, for the sake of the Lord. We stand firm in support of those principles given to us by the Lord through his holy prophets in modern days, as well as in ancient days. We do not permit the scoffing of our would-be friends to cause us to feel embarrassed, nor do we give in to their enticing that would lead us into sin and sorrow.<br><br>And thus the Lord has given us a formula to attain perfection. The closing verse in the chapter containing the Beatitudes is, "Therefore I would that ye should be perfect as I, or your Father who is in heaven is perfect" (3 Nephi 12:48).<br><h2><b>Punishment</b></h2><br>The prophet Alma explained that the punishment of sin is remorse of conscience (see Alma 42:18). It doesn't seem that simple, for sin has many entanglements and is much more complicated. It weighs down the soul and brings misery and unhappiness to the heart and the mind. It takes away light and truth and overshadows one with feelings of guilt. When light is taken away, darkness envelopes the room. And so it is with the soul.<br><br>I have recollection of my first experience with remorse of conscience. I was four years old. As I walked up the street, I passed a small grocery store. The proprietor had built a ledge about four to five inches wide in front of the windows of the store, where at this particular time of the year he would place beautiful, red, polished apples to attract the passers-by, but not little four-year-old boys.<br><br>As I passed the store, I saw one of those delicious, juicy, rosy apples. My cheeks ached as my saliva began to run. Without realizing I was doing wrong, I reached over, picked up an apple, and continued up the street. When I got two houses beyond the store, I looked in my hand and realized I had stolen an apple. I began to run where any four-year-old boy who was in trouble would run--home! Our secret hiding place was under the front porch where we stored our gardening tools. I ran all the way home, crawled under the porch, sat there all afternoon shivering with fear, and eating the apple.<br><br>Remorse of conscience is not always that simple, but I have often reflected upon the fact that at four years of age, my conscience told me I had done wrong. I knew it was wrong, and I knew that my Heavenly Father knew that I had done wrong. I was both frightened and ashamed. Whether we are four years old or forty years old, it is all the same. Our conscience teaches us right from wrong--unless we have destroyed it through careless abandonment.<br><h2><b>Independence</b></h2><br>We become more aware of our agency as we come into our adolescent years of life. Whereas we heretofore have been obedient without questioning, now we rebel at compulsion and dislike gentle suggestions. We want our independence. We want to exercise our agency that was given to us by the Lord. This can be a very sensitive period, for ofttimes we exercise our agency without the wisdom of experience. Let me give you an example. When one of our sons was seventeen years of age, he became typically independent. We did not understand the problem and were deeply concerned. He was a good boy but seemed to have become a bit rebellious. Nevertheless, he was always willing to go home teaching with me as he was assigned by the bishop to be my companion. We had arranged an appointment to go home teaching on a particular Thursday evening. I wanted our families to implement in the home the principles of the gospel introduced in church, so I asked Sister Derrick, "What did you study in Relief Society last month?"<br><br>She responded, "We studied the principle of independence."<br><br>David and I went into the bedroom, kneeled in prayer, and then sat on the bed; we talked and read from the scriptures about independence.<br><br>The second home we visited was that of President Kimball. He answered the door. We sat down in the front room with him and Sister Kimball. Following brief words of greeting, I said to Sister Kimball, "I understand you studied the principle of independence in Relief Society last month."<br><br>"Yes," she responded.<br><br>I turned to David and said, "Would you like to tell us your thoughts on independence?" The response he gave caused my heart to leap for joy.<br><br>He said, "Every young man and every young woman wants to be independent. I want to be independent." I thought that was a great statement, for I believe it is true. He continued, "I always thought that to be independent you had to<i>not</i>do what our parents wanted you to do, but I've discovered tonight that, if you want to be independent, you have to keep the commandments of the Lord. The Lord has given us his commandments so that we can remain free. The Lord wants us to be free. But if we do not keep his commandments, we will come under the control of Lucifer. Lucifer wants to take our independence from us. Therefore, we are in jeopardy of losing the very thing we are trying to gain." You can appreciate how delighted I was to hear those words. He has been a model son since that day.<br><h2><b>Promptings of the Spirit</b></h2><br>We want to be receptive to the promptings of the Holy Spirit which come from within. What do we mean when we say, "Comes from within"? The apostle Paul, speaking to the Corinthian Saints, said: "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?" (1 Corinthians 3:16).<br><br>Later in his epistle he revealed that the Spirit of God which he spoke of is the Holy Ghost. In the Doctrine and Covenants, we receive the following confirmation of that principle: "The elements [that is, the flesh and the bones] are the tabernacle of God; yea, man is the tabernacle of God" (D&amp;amp;C 93:35).<br><br>In section 130 of the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord says, "The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit. Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us" (D&amp;amp;C 130:22).<br><br>When we are confirmed members of the Church, hands are laid upon our heads, and one having authority to do so says, "Receive the Holy Ghost." From that moment on, the Holy Ghost dwells within us so long as we keep the commandments of God. If we break his commandments, the Holy Ghost leaves our bodies, for nothing unclean can enter the presence of God, and when something unclean appears, the Holy Ghost departs. When we have properly repented, the Holy Spirit returns and continues to prompt us as we ask the Lord for forgiveness and for divine guidance. We receive such messages by feelings in our hearts and thoughts in our minds.<br><br>I would like to share with you my thoughts on this matter. They are my own. I do not teach them as doctrine. Some years ago, Dr. Asael Woodruff, who at the time was the dean of the School of Education here at BYU, made a presentation to our General Sunday School Board on concepts. He said that, when we are born into the world, we have no concepts. Johnny, who recently entered mortality, is walking along the street. It begins to rain and someone says, "Johnny, this is rain." And so Johnny is introduced to his first primary concept. The rain turns to snow, and someone says, "Johnny, this is snow." Johnny receives his second primary concept. It goes from there to hail, sleet, wind, blizzard, heat, cold, and so forth. Then someone says, "Johnny, you put all these together, and you have weather." And so Johnny receives his first secondary concept. We combine secondary concepts to attain higher concepts and then combine higher concepts to attain ever higher concepts in our various fields of endeavor.<br><br>Sometimes, in response to our prayers, the Holy Spirit puts new thoughts in our minds. In my experience, this happens very seldom. Most of the time, he takes thoughts from the storehouse of one's own brain and brings them forward for review. Thus, it is important that we study and fill our minds with knowledge and learning about things as they were, as they are, and as they are to come. The Spirit cannot bring thoughts to recall from an empty mind.<br><br>Ofttimes the Holy Ghost will bring more than one thought to the forefront of our minds where we can ponder them and, in the light of our experiences, put them together to form higher concepts. And thus he enlightens our minds, and our understandings are expanded using the resources we have attained by experience and study.<br><br>We obtain confirmation of those things which are right by peaceful feelings and good feelings. The Lord said to Oliver Cowdery through the Prophet Joseph Smith, "Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter? What greater witness can you have than from God?" (D&amp;amp;C 6:23).<br><br>So when we keep the commandments of God, he stands by to give us promptings, assistance, and direction. But we must ask. He says, "Ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you" (D&amp;amp;C 4:7). We are nearly always required to initiate the communication. But when we have committed sin and have not repented, the Spirit is silent. What a great companion we have! Let us not turn our back on him and reject his promptings by disqualifying ourselves through disobedience.<br><br>President Kimball said, "Conscience tells the individual when he is entering forbidden worlds, and it continues to prick until silenced by the will or by sin's repetition" ("President Kimball Speaks Out on Morality,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1980, p. 95).<br><br>The adversary has no control so long as we remain worthy of the companionship of the Holy Ghost. When the Holy Ghost leaves our bodies because we have sinned, the adversary can get his toe in the door, pry it open, and take control. Thus we get the promptings of the adversary instead of the promptings of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>Whether the adversary prompts us or the Holy Spirit prompts us depends upon the thoughts we think. The apostle Paul said, "If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy" (1 Corinthians 3:17). In section 93 of the Doctrine and Covenants, we read, "Whatsoever temple is defiled, God shall destroy that temple" (D&amp;amp;C 93:35), meaning that the Holy Ghost will depart when our bodies are not fit places for the Spirit to reside. When the Spirit leaves, our bodies are no longer temples, for a temple is where God resides.<br><br>How do we defile our bodies? It is all controlled by our minds. We defile our bodies when we think thoughts we shouldn't think. We defile our bodies when we say things we shouldn't say. We defile our bodies when we take into them things we should not take in. We defile our bodies when we do things with them we should not do. Did it ever occur to you that there is no other way to sin? All we need do is to control those few actions--all of which stem from the mind.<br><h2><b>How to Control Our Destiny</b></h2><br>From the foregoing, it is obvious that our future can be one of joy and happiness if we but keep the commandments of the Lord. Keeping the commandments does not relate to our economic welfare. Some of the most faithful Saints have meager incomes, and some of the most faithful Saints are well-to-do. Valiance is more closely related to self-discipline. Self-discipline implies that we as individuals know where we are going and the price we are willing to pay to get there. We anticipate what might happen and decide in advance what our position will be and how we will react. The man who returns money to the bank cashier who has given him more than she should in change did not make up his mind at the moment. His decision had been made beforehand. The man who testifies at the trial and who tells the truth to his embarrassment does not make up his mind what to say on the moment. His decision to be truthful is made beforehand. The man who takes the responsibility for his own mistakes instead of blaming a subordinate has made the decision long before.<br><br>We must decide what kind of people we want to be and then do those things that will result in our being that kind of people. When the Savior was accosted by Lucifer on the mountain and sorely tempted by the master tempter, he did not hesitate. He knew in advance what he would say. There was no discussion. There was no question. He said promptly and forcefully, "Get thee hence, Satan" (Matthew 4:10).<br><br>When we make our decisions well in advance, our judgment is best. When we make our decisions under emotional stress or under the tempter's snare, our judgment is impaired.<br><br>What kind of a person are you going to be? What will be your destiny? Are you going to be obedient to God's laws, or are you going to lose your freedom to the adversary? Are you going to be a person of integrity, or are you going to be a person of weak character? The decision is yours, today.<br><br>The time to decide you are going on a mission is when you are a very young man, or if you have not yet decided, the time is now. The time to decide on a temple marriage is in your early youth. If that decision is not made, make it now.<br><br>President Kimball counseled,<br><br><i>Your own life, our own lives, are precious ones. We can satisfy ourselves with mediocrity. We can be common, ordinary, dull, colorless, or we can so channel our lives to be clean, vibrant, progressive, colorful, and rich.</i><br><br><i>We can soil our records, defile our souls, trample underfoot virtue, honor, and goodness, or we can command the respect and admiration of our associates and the love of the Lord....</i><br><br><i>Your destiny is in your hands and your all-important decisions are before you.</i>[<i>TWSK,</i>p. 161]<br><br>To this fact I bear witness in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Royden G. Derrick was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 14 June 1983.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>Sublime - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I deliver to you a message that I know to be true. There will be no speculation in my words. It is the greatest message that can be known either in the heavens or upon the earth. It has cost the lives of millions to preserve and bring forth.<br><br>Through the ages a most formidable effort has been and continues to be expended to prevent this message from being transmitted, by either the spoken or the written word. Any and every method, regardless of how mean or cruel or destructive, is being used to seal the lips of the messenger, to plug the ears of the listener, and to blind the eyes of the reader that this, the most sublime of all messages, may not be delivered.<br><h2><b>The Message</b></h2><br>I will speak with the authority of a messenger sent by Him whose message it is. The message is, there is a God in heaven. Oh, rejoice all who inhabit the earth, for as assuredly as we live there is a God. God is a being. He is a person. He has a body of flesh and bone. It is tangible. He lives and moves and has emotions and passions. This God is infinite and eternal. He is unchangeable and is from everlasting to everlasting.<br><br>I rejoice to know and I declare to you that this God is my Father. I am His son. I was begotten after His image. By His seed was I conceived, and I am of His species. Could there be any other knowledge so blissful? Is there any truth that can be perceived by man that is of such all-encompassing magnificence?<br><br>I am His son. He is my Father. It is a Father-son, Parent-child relationship. He loves me. Oh, how He loves me! As I come to know Him, I love Him.<br><br>God, who is my Father, has a dwelling place. It is named heaven. God is my Father in Heaven. God is the framer of the heaven. He used laws to organize intelligence, light, and truth into a supernal habitat where His children may dwell with Him if they will obey the conditions of the law by which heaven is organized.<br><br>God organized heaven into an environment of light as opposed to darkness--of life as opposed to death--of joy as opposed to sorrow--of harmony and order as opposed to confusion and disorder--of grace as opposed to disgrace. All goodness and exactness, all truth and virtue, are incorporated into that environment.<br><br>God outlined the boundaries of this heaven and established it as His kingdom. He set forth its limits and conditions as decreed by law. He named it celestial, the celestial kingdom, the place where God, my Heavenly Father, dwells.<br><br>Knowing this, is it unusual or cause for wonderment that I would raise my voice toward the heaven and rejoice and say, "My Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name," or "Oh, God my Eternal Father"?<br><br>God "created man, male and female, after his own image and in his own likeness, created he them" (D&amp;amp;C 20:18).<br><br>If you have eyes to see and mind to perceive, if you have emotions and passions with which to feel, if you have hands to touch and ears to hear, if you have consciousness of man with all or any of these senses, then you know the true nature of God.<br><h2><b>We Are God's Children</b></h2><br>God created man after his own image and in His own likeness, male and female, created He them.<br><br>I repeat, it is a Father-son, Parent-child relationship. He loves us. He created a home for us, a heavenly home. He wants us to live in that celestial home. He wants us to be as He is. He wants us to live the glorious style of life He lives. In order for us to be as He is and live the style of life He lives, we must be obedient to the same conditions of law to which He is obedient.<br><br>God knows this, and He has taken upon Himself a work to provide a sequence of training and experience that will teach and perfect His children that they may, if they will, come to obedience to the conditions of the laws of God.<br><br>In order for this to happen, it was necessary for God's children to leave His presence. They would need to go to a place where they could work with the laws of God until they came into full harmony with and obedience to them.<br><br>God brought about the creation of the earth and all things that are in it. The earth is known to us. We know its environment. We can touch and smell and see and feel it. We know its systems and seasons, its givings and its exactings.<br><h2><b>The Plan Was Instituted</b></h2><br>God gave His children commandments with a promise that if they would obey the commandments, the experiences they would have on earth would perfect them and bring them into full harmony with the conditions of His law and that they would then be qualified to return to dwell with Him and live the style of life He lives.<br><br>The commandments that God gave His children are very simple: "that they should love and serve him, the only living and true God, and that he should be the only being whom they should worship" (D&amp;amp;C 20:19).<br><br>There was to be no force. All God's children were to have free agency, the authority to choose for themselves. They could obey the commandments and gain the blessed results, or they could disobey. God taught His children that if they disobeyed, they could not return. He explained to His children that while they were upon the earth, He could not leave them alone. He would send His teachings, His word, by way of messengers, and by His Spirit, and by the communication of prayer. There would be prophets to whom He would reveal His will for His children's progress. There would be examples, all of which they could take full advantage of, but nevertheless they must choose for themselves and act according to their choices. They were also taught the consequences of disobedience.<br><br>All of this was organized into a plan, a plan for the salvation and exaltation of God's children. The plan was carefully and precisely taught to us. All the consequences of the plan were considered and provisions made for them. Administrators of the plan were chosen.<br><br>Let me use God's own words as He tells us of this process. He said one of His sons, whose name was Lucifer,<br><br><i>came before me saying--Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor. ...</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, because that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him, and also, that I should give unto him mine own power; by the power of mine Only Begotten, I caused that he should be cast down;</i><br><br><i>And he became Satan, yea, even the devil, the father of all lies, to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will, even as many as would not hearken unto my voice.</i>[Moses 4:1, 3, 4]<br><h2><b>The Doctrine of Fallen Man</b></h2><br>God placed His children upon the earth, male and female, and gave them physical bodies to house their spirit bodies, but they listened to Satan and transgressed the holy laws of God. "By the transgression of these holy laws man became sensual and devilish, and became fallen man" (D&amp;amp;C 20:20).<br><br><i>Fallen man</i>simply means that death came upon us. There are two kinds of death. One kind is known about by all of us. It is that our physical bodies die. No one ever escapes this death. There is nothing that can be done to avoid it. It overcomes us in an hour that we know not.<br><br>We all love life. We cling to it. We endure pain and sorrow in the process, but we are willing to endure almost anything if it will sustain life. We fear death only because death is clouded by the unknown.<br><br>This death of the physical body separates us from those with whom we have lived in mortality. Our spirit body lives on, but the spirit body of fallen man cannot return to that glorious dwelling place of God.<br><br>Just as our physical body is separated from our home and loved ones at its death, so then must our spirit body be separated from our heavenly home and environment forever, to live the conditions of darkness and sorrow forever, and this because of disobedience to God's commandments which made us fallen man.<br><br>Oh, what agony! Oh, what unquenchable grief! Oh, what a pitiful circumstance to be doomed to an everlasting misery, separated from both physical body and the presence of God.<br><br>Oh, fallen man, from whence is thy recovery? From what source thy redemption?<br><h2><b>A Savior Was Provided</b></h2><br>"Wherefore, the Almighty God gave his Only Begotten Son" (D&amp;amp;C 20:21).<br><br>He said, "But, behold, my Beloved Son, which was my Beloved and Chosen from the beginning, said unto me--Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever" (Moses 4:2).<br><br>This Only Begotten Son's name is Jesus Christ. He came to the earth and did a work which was sufficient to overcome both physical death, which is the separation of the physical body from the spirit body, and spiritual death, which is separation of the spirit body from God.<br><br><i>He suffered temptations but gave no heed unto them.</i><br><br><i>He was crucified, died, and rose again the third day.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 20:22–23]<br><br>And since his children had fallen, the Almighty God saw their awful carnal state and enacted<br><br><i>the plan of redemption, which was prepared from the foundation of the world, through Christ, for all whosoever would believe on his name.</i><br><br><i>And since man had fallen he could not merit anything of himself; but the sufferings and death of Christ atone for their sins, through faith and repentance ... and that he breaketh the bands of death, that the grave shall have no victory, and that the sting of death should be swallowed up in the hopes of glory</i>. [Alma 22:13–14]<br><br>After Christ had completed this work, He<br><br><i>ascended into heaven, to sit down on the right hand of the Father, to reign with almighty power according to the will of the Father;</i><br><br><i>That as many as would believe and be baptized in his holy name, and endure in faith to the end, should be saved</i>. [D&amp;amp;C 20:24–25]<br><br><i>And we know that all men</i>must<i>repent and believe on the name of Jesus Christ, and worship the Father in his name, and endure in faith on his name to the end, or they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God</i>. [D&amp;amp;C 20:29; emphasis added]<br><br>This is the most transcendent and magnificent of all things that man can know.<br><br>"Death is conquered, man is free. / Christ has won the victory" (Cecil Alexander, "He Is Risen,"<i>Hymns</i>, No. 61).<br><br>I solemnly testify that I speak of what I know. That which I have said is true.<br><h2><b>The Witness of the Book of Mormon</b></h2><br>There may be those who say to themselves, "How do you know it is true?" To you I say: I hold in my hand the Book of Mormon, Another Testament of Jesus Christ. This book has cost the lives of millions to preserve and bring forth. The Almighty God has stretched forth his arm and has let fall the sword in behalf of the preservation of this book. The book contains two things that make it absolutely vital to us. The first is that it contains a record of a fallen people.<br><br>Why is it so vital that we have a record of a fallen people? Why would such a record merit the trial and suffering of those who have sacrificed to bring forth this book, even to the constant and direct intervention of God Almighty?<br><br>I submit to you that no one, regardless of race or creed, can ever understand the role of and the need for a savior and a redeemer unless he first knows from what he needs to be saved or redeemed. No person, regardless of his religion or tradition, can understand victory over death and the terms upon which his salvation depends unless he understands the doctrine of fallen man.<br><br>Satan from the beginning, when Adam and Eve were first placed upon the earth, has gone forth deceiving the children of our Heavenly Father.<br><br>They have been beguiled and, through the ages, but for a few, have had no understanding of the true doctrine of fallen man.<br><br>Therefore, behold this book which contains a record of fallen man,<br><br><i>By these things we know that there is a God in heaven, who is infinite and eternal, from everlasting to everlasting the same unchangeable God, the framer of heaven and earth, and all things which are in them;</i><br><br><i>And that he created man, male and female, after his own image and in his own likeness, created he them;</i><br><br><i>And gave unto them commandments that they should love and serve him, the only living and true God, and that he should be the only being whom they should worship.</i><br><br><i>But by the transgression of these holy laws man became sensual and devilish, and became fallen man.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 20:17–20]<br><br>Fallen man is he who must forever be separated from his physical body and from the presence of God, forever dead in that there is no return to God for fallen man.<br><br>The second thing this book contains is the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ. That marvelous plan which God has prepared for the salvation and exaltation of His children is named the gospel of Jesus Christ. It outlines in every detail what men may do,<i>if they will</i>, to return to God our Father to dwell where He dwells and live the style of life He lives. It outlines to the mind of men who Christ really is. It places Him in His supreme role as Savior and Redeemer and the Almighty who rules and reigns over this earth.<br><h2><b>The Witness of the Holy Spirit</b></h2><br>"How do you know it is true?" you may ask.<br><br>When Christ ascended to heaven to reign with almighty power according to the will of the Father, He did not leave us alone. He sent the Holy Ghost to the earth, the Holy Ghost, the third member of the holy trinity, a member of the presiding Godhead. This Holy Ghost is the Comforter. He witnesses to God's children that the message I have just presented is true.<br><br>By these things I know that it is true: By the doctrine of fallen man, by the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ as contained in the Book of Mormon, and by the witness of the Holy Ghost who has come to me and has overcome my soul so that I know it is true.<br><h2><b>The Undeniable Witness</b></h2><br>The most transcendent and magnificent message in the heavens and in the earth is that there is a God in heaven, that He is our Father, and that we are His children. Oh, that the world knew that message!<br><br>Those who know this marvelous truth have the privilege and responsibility to declare it throughout the world. Upon our ability to bring God's children to this knowledge and understanding rests the success of our labors.<br><br>I repeat, no man can know and understand the need for a savior unless he understands first what it is that he must be saved from. And no man can understand what he must be saved from unless he understands the doctrine of fallen man. And no man can understand the doctrine of fallen man unless he understands that God is our Father and that He gave us commandments and that because of transgression and disobedience to these commandments, man became sensual and devilish and<i>fallen man</i>.<br><br>This Book of Mormon is the keystone of our religion. No man can be exalted in the celestial kingdom unless he knows and lives the doctrine contained in this book. This book comes with a sacred promise. If you will read it and then lift up your voice to God in prayer, if you will ask, "God, are you there? Are you my Father? Is this true?" He will send the Holy Ghost, who will overcome your soul, and you will know that it is true. This happens in that same indescribable way by which you know that you love someone or that someone loves you.<br><br>Again I declare unto you with the undeniable witness of the Holy Ghost that this message is true and that the book is true. May God grant that you become a partaker of these glorious gifts of exaltation. God lives. He is there in His heaven. He loves us and awaits our return. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>William R.

<h1>May Become - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The trauma and devastation of the wind, mudslides, and floods of recent months have created opportunities for expressions of love, care, and concern throughout our area. It has been said, in fact, that these catastrophes were in part a blessing because of the resulting opportunities to serve. We have witnessed open expressions of brotherhood that often are not evident in the day-to-day unfolding of our lives, and these expressions have crossed boundaries of age, creed, and color. A deep sense of joy and satisfaction has been present as we have shared or observed this outpouring of love. While I was at a national professional meeting a short time ago, individuals from across the country wanted to discuss what they had seen and heard in the media. They frequently spoke of the services rendered to individuals and families as well as for the public good. They talked about the manifestations of genuine love as demonstrated through service and sharing. These experiences have stimulated me to ponder once again why the behaviors so evident in emergencies are less often present in our everyday lives. Why does it take a crisis to bring out our feelings of love and concern for a family member, a friend, a neighbor, or a stranger? Why is an abundance of love so seldom present in our lives? Why, when we have a choice between a fullness of love and something less, do we so frequently choose something less?<br><br>As a people, we have all been taught from our youth:<br><br><i>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</i><br><i>This is the first and great commandment.</i><br><br><i>And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</i><br><br><i>On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</i>[Matthew 22:37–40]<br><br>We know in theory that love is manifest through service--service to our Heavenly Father, to others, and to ourselves--and that we need a balance that helps us keep our perspective. This knowledge, however, does not automatically make love in this sense an integral part of our lives. I would like in the time that is allotted me today to explore with you some thoughts about love--learned from the scriptures and from experiences in living. After a very brief review of the importance of patterning our lives on the principles of love, I will touch on two aspects of love as it relates to our individual lives--first, some benefits of living a life permeated with love and, second, some obstacles that inhibit our capacity to love. As I discuss these two aspects--(1) the benefits that come from living a life of love and (2) the obstacles to our doing so--I would like you to keep in mind a verse I learned as a child. Itgoes like this:<br><br><i>If white is good</i><br><i>And black is bad,</i><br><i>Then all my friends</i><br><i>Are gray or plaid.</i><br>It suggests that the benefits and obstacles are not clearly separate, but are perhaps more like opposite sides of the same coin.<br><h2><b>Love--The Way to Perfection</b><b></b></h2><br>To begin--why is it important to pattern our lives on the principle of love? The answer to that question is nowhere more clearly emphasized, it seems to me, than in Matthew 5:43–48. We are all familiar with verse 48, "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect," but have we dwelt on the verses which immediately precede it?<br><br><i>Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.</i><br><i>But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;</i><br><br><i>That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.</i><br><br><i>For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?</i><br><br><i>And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?</i><br><br><i>Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.</i><br><br>Love is the basis for becoming perfect or, as the father of one of my special friends said: "The perfection connection is love." We ought therefore to be attentive to its place in our lives. We must be cognizant of the fact that though love comes from God, as Truman Madsen has stated, "Knowing 'where it comes from' is not the same as receiving and giving it. . . . All of us need constant reminders that we cannot have the fruits of love without being in touch with the roots" (Truman G. Madsen, "Joseph Smith and the Sources of Love," in<i>Four Essays on Love</i>[Provo: Communications Workshop, 1971], p. 9).<br><br>There is an integral relationship between loving our Father in Heaven, loving our neighbors, and loving ourselves. Love in these realms gives perspective to all of the laws and the commandments. Thus we cannot afford to just wait for "love" to happen in our lives. We ought to seek it, to refine it, to be sensitive to its presence or absence, to its vitality and strength, because love is essential.<br><h2><b>Benefits of Love</b><b></b></h2><br>What then are the potential consequences, the benefits, of living a life patterned on the principle of love? In what ways does it make a difference? These questions may require a lifetime, even an eternity, to answer because as our capacity to love increases, we see new horizons--new levels on which we can express love. There are, however, some important consequences that can be experienced and understood now. We do know that we are loved by our Heavenly Father and that great blessings are available if we can reciprocate that love. In 1 Corinthians 2:9 we read, "But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him." If we accept and return the love extended to us by God and recognize that it is extended to all mankind--that we are indeed his children--wethen have a perspective of who we are and who others are, and that perspective is circumscribed by love.<br><br>Knowing our Father loves us and that He created each of us and endowed us with the capacity to fulfill the purposes of life provides us the basis for understanding our worth. Self-esteem and self-confidence flourish in the bonds of love.<br><br>I had an experience some five years ago which was deeply moving for me and which in a quiet moment allowed me to see self-esteem, self-confidence, and love all at once. My sister and her family came to spend the night with me. After prayers we all retired. As Nanette, my three-and-a-half-year-old niece, climbed into bed with me, she said, "I didn't kiss my mother and father good night." So she climbed out of bed, went to their bedroom, and kissed them good night. When she returned, she cuddled up to me and said, "Aunt Ruth, Heavenly Father loves me; my mother loves me; my father loves me; you love me; Aunt Carol loves me; my Grandmother Brasher in Duncan, Oklahoma, on a mission loves me; my Grandma Mortensen loves me; my Grandpa Mortensen loves me," and she went on to name Aunt Elaine, Uncle Wallace, cousins Margaret, Jordon, and Yvonne, and then she stopped.<br><br>I asked, "But what about Aunt Pat, Uncle Jim, Todd, and Heather?"<br><br>Before I could proceed with the list, she interrupted: "Aunt Ruth, I am not telling you everybody in the world that loves me and that I love. I am only telling you the ones that live in Provo; Duncan, Oklahoma; Emery; and Huntington." The specific identification of individuals was significant to me. Love to her was not something abstract, something to generalize about--it was specific. Knowing that she was loved and that she loved others radiated in her self-esteem and her self-confidence.<br><br>This love created for Nanette an awareness that she matters and that others matter. She had then and continues to this day to have a sense of peace and a freedom to grow because she is secure. She knows she matters in important ways. When our lives are patterned on the principle of love, we too are secure--secure in an overriding sense even in the face of uncertainty, disappointment, and discouragement about specific aspects of our lives. Thus, we too are free to grow because we understand who we are, and we are in the bonds of love. We know that a loving Father gives us opportunities to struggle because struggle can produce growth and increase our understanding of what love is.<br><br>As I contemplated this shared moment with Nanette, I remembered a short incident reported many years ago in the<i>Improvement Era.</i>It related the comments of a young boy of about four as his mother tucked him into bed. He asked, "Mother, do you love everybody in the world?"<br><br>She responded, "Oh, yes, son. It is important that we love everyone. That is what Heavenly Father wants us to do."<br><br>His reply was stunning: "I don't. I only love the people in my life."<br><br>How often do we profess that we love everyone while our interaction with the important people in our lives demonstrates something far short of love? Sometimes, interaction with family and our friends may not center on love and support at all and may even be destructive. There seems to be an assumption that since our family and friends know us well, they will understand if we don't behave lovingly and will love us anyway. This is a deception. Such behavior has the power to inflict deep hurt. Willard Gaylin, author of<i>Feelings: Our Vital Signs,</i>stated it succinctly: "We can be touched--and delighted--by an unexpected kindness or courtesy from strangers. When we are 'hurt,' it is invariably by those we love" (Willard Gaylin, "Being Touched, Being Hurt,"<i>Psychology Today,</i>December 1978, p. 117).<br><br>Understanding who we are and that we are loved enhances our awareness of the opportunity to strive for perfection, not to achieve it in the foreseeable future but to experience the process--the eternal process. In this context, growth in self-control and self-mastery can become an adventure of stimulating proportions, not just an agony of restraint. Accepting others as well as ourselves as individuals who are in the process of growth permits us to see them in a different light. We can love them as we love ourselves, recognizing that we are all fallible. None of us has been translated. We all need room for error, for falling short, for weakness and inconsistency, for growth as we recognize our shortcomings. We can give ourselves as well as others a break. We can serve, with this understanding, in a spirit of helpfulness as opposed to serving as a matter of duty. There can be warmth and caring even in difficult situations.<br><br>Yes, lives patterned on the principle of eternal love establish a perspective for us, who we are and who others are and our relationship to our Heavenly Father--that perspective makes all the difference.<br><br>With little effort, some study, and a moment of contemplation, I suspect we could each identify a number of specific differences genuine love can make in our lives. Here is just one example of a specific difference to start us thinking. We read in 1 John 4:18: "There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love." Freedom from fear can be an important mobilizing factor in our lives. We note in D&amp;amp;C 60:2 that some "hide the talent . . . given unto them, because of the fear of man," and in Psalms 90:11 that "even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath," and in Proverbs 29:25 that "the fear of man bringeth a snare." Think for a moment. Do you have hidden talents? Have you hesitated to work with them, to develop them, because someone else does it better or because someone may laugh if you try or because someone will know you have a weakness? How often is your anger related to a fear that someone may obtain something you desire or that there is some uncertainty about your place in a situation? When were you last in an untenable position because you were afraid of the consequences of telling the truth and tried to cover your actions? All these responses to fear require time, energy, and emotional input which are nonproductive. Thus, since love eliminates fear, our productive potential is freed to focus on producing rather than on protecting ourselves.<br><br>This is one of the places where the gray and plaid sense of categories becomes so evident. While love casting out fear is clearly a positive consequence, we note that fear is an obstacle.<br><h2><b>Obstacles to Love</b><b></b></h2><br>Now, back to my central thesis--the perfection connection is love, and its presence in our lives is enriching. Given the importance of this concept and the potential we have to strengthen this quality in our individual lives, let's examine some of the obstacles (in addition to fear) that inhibit our achievement of the fullness of love in our lives.<br><br>I will explore these obstacles from two points of view: (1) what we do to ourselves and (2) our responses to others and the resulting consequences for us. What do we do to ourselves that limits our capacity to love? One thing we might do is to close ourselves to ourselves. This closure occurs when our lives become circumscribed by behaviors and attitudes which tend to be so narrowly focused that they never allow us to really discover ourselves. This frame of mind may produce a self-love which is destructive because it creates a smoke screen that prevents us from seeing our wholeness, our potential for growth, our vulnerability, our need for others. Included among these behaviors and attitudes are such things as pride, arrogance, vanity, boastfulness, jealousy, and envy. Each of these is an obstacle. Frequently they are spoken of together in the scriptures. For example, Proverbs 8:13 says, "Pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate." And Paul wrote to Timothy:<br><br><i>This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</i><br><br><i>For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</i><br><br><i>Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</i><br><br><i>Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</i><br><br><i>Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. . . .</i><br><br><i>Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</i>[2 Timothy 3:1–5, 7]<br><br>The truth is veiled because we see only in part.<br><br>The tenth Psalm also speaks of divers acts of the wicked. Many of the behaviors identified by Paul to Timothy are noted there too. Like the apostle, the psalmist suggests why these behaviors are so serious and why they might blind us to ourselves and to others.<br><br>They imply an absence of love. He condemns the wicked for such disregard for others as the persecution of the poor, deceit, and fraud and further states that "God is not in all his thoughts" (verse 4).<br><br>When we become so caught up in ourselves that we cannot give heed to our Creator, our fellowmen, or our<i>true selves,</i>we are not moving toward perfection.<br><br>There are many ways in which our words and deeds may project these limiting characteristics. For example, we may emphasize in the academic setting that wisdom which evolves from love and living is not enough and suggest in our arrogance that this wisdom is nothing. We may be so confident of our own capacities that we cannot learn from others, or we choose not to share with others because they have nothing to offer us. We may take advantage of others because of our cleverness--our superior capacity. President John Taylor warned against such behavior. He said,<br><br><i>Because one man is more talented than another, heshould not use that talent to take advantage of his brother, and then expect that God will approve of his actions, for he will not do it; he never did, nor ever will. We should operate for one another's interest, having sympathetic feelings for each other. We are supposed to be brethren in the Church and kingdom of God, knit together by the indissoluble ties of the everlasting Gospel, not for time only, butforeternity. Hence all our operations should befor that end, founded on the principles of righteousness and friendship.</i>[<i>JD</i>18:284]&amp;gt;<br><br>Yes, pride, arrogance, vanity, boastfulness, jealousy, and envy may be irritating to others, but they are likely to be devastating to us because they blind us.<br><br>I think of the example of a missionary whomade it very clear to everyone in the mission field that he knew more scriptures than anyone else. In fact, he had practically memorized the four standard works. He took every opportunity to be sure that everyone knew that he knew them. The tragedy of the situation was that there seemed to be a lack ofunderstanding, that knowing the words is not sufficient, that we should also understand the meaning and reflect the principles inourlives.<br><br>Another set of attitudes that may permeate our lives and inhibit our capacity to love has important impacts on others as well as ourselves. These attitudes are covetousness and greed. In our acquisitive society the desire to get and to have seems almost insatiable at times. We want and we take with no thought of others' needs. We often desire more than anyone needs or deserves. We lose an appreciation for living frugally, not because we have to but because it is a good way to live, as WilliamF. Edwards, a financier, economist, and former BYU vice-president, has so often stressed.<br><br>A marvelous ad with an important message for all of us recently appeared in the<i>Wall Street Journal,</i>placed there by a Nebraska-based energy corporation. It said,<br><br><i>Please don't eat the seed corn.</i>[Now if you were born in Emery County, as I was, or in the Midwest, you know that seed corn is essential to next year's crop. If you eat it now, next year's crop is finished.]<i>In our consumption-oriented society the temptation of success is to devour the harvest, to enjoy the fruits of the moment without planning for the future. That's asdangerous in industry as it is in agriculture.</i><br><br>I suggest that it is even more dangerous when today's consumption impacts on our potential opportunity for growth now and throughout eternity. It reminds me of the prodigal son. Time, strength, resources, and talents were lost which eternity cannot replace.<br><br>Are we part of the group that eats the seed corn? Are we sensitive to the appropriate use of resources? Do we perceive the effects of greed in our lives and its impact on the achievement or development of love in our lives? Many of us have probably never seriously considered these questions. When we read, "And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God" (Matthew 19:24), we are likely to think, "That doesn't apply to me. I am not rich." There are two assumptions embodied in these thoughts: (1)that being rich means having more than I have, and (2) that if I am not rich, I cannot be greedy. I question both the assumptions--richness and capacity for greed.<br><br>During the time my parents were serving in the Arizona Holbrook Mission, I joined them for a few days at Christmastime. Christmas morning we delivered treats and greetings to some of the families with whom they worked. As I stood in the center of one of the hogans surveying the surroundings and the people, I was overwhelmed with a sense of my richness in terms of material possessions and awed by the sense of peace, happiness, and contentment that radiated from the faces of the extended-family members who were present. "Could I be this content in these circumstances?" I asked myself. "What did I do to deserve what I have? What are my responsibilities? What are my values? What really matters?"<br><br>Am I rich? The answer depends on the comparative basis I choose to use--but in my heart I know that I have enough of this world's material blessings and that I will be accountable for my use of them. Are you rich? Do you have enough and to spare? How can that determination be made? When we use more than our share of the earth's resources, are we rich or are we greedy, or are we both rich and greedy? Are we greedy in our demands? Are we accountable?<br><br>Greed can canker our souls, and we lose perspective about who we are and our purpose in life. We may be consuming the seed corn.<br><i>Wo unto you rich men, that will not give your substance to the poor, for your riches will canker your souls; and this shall be your lamentation in the day of visitation, and of judgment, and of indignation: The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and my soul is not saved!</i>[D&amp;amp;C 56:16]&amp;gt;<br>Will we be found among those who lament? Those who have learned too late the importance of giving and of love?<br><br>There is further scriptural evidence to suggest that greed and love are not compatible and that the consequences of greed in one's life are far-reaching. For example,<br><br><i>Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter.</i><br><br><i>Come ye, say they, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and tomorrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant.</i>[Isaiah 56:11–12]<br><br>The implication that one cannot understand when one's attention is focused on "never enough" and the "anticipation of more" is frightening.<br><br>Thinking of "never enough" reminds me of the young boy who requested more dessert at the conclusion of a Sunday dinner to which his family had several guests. His mother explained that there was no more dessert. This news did not please him, and he responded, "I never get all I want to eat."<br><br>His mother in self-defense and embarrassment said, "We always have plenty to eat."<br><br>The boy still chafing retorted, "There've been lots of times I've eaten all I could, but never all I wanted."<br><br>Are some of us like him? Are we struggling for more--for no more important reason than we just want more? In this frame of mind, what is it that we do not understand? Ezekiel elaborates on this subject in chapter 34. The shepherds fed and clothed themselves; they did not feed the sheep or care for the diseased or the sick. They did not protect the sheep from becoming lost. They did not understand the need for and meaning of love--not that self should not receive attention, but that there should be balance in life, between self and others.<br><br>Lest we think that greed applies only to financial and material goods, I hasten to note, as implied in Ezekiel, that it also includes our time, our talents, and our care and concern. These are areas of our lives in which we may also demand more than we deserve and give less than we ought. N. Eldon Tanner, a man who was truly generous in all aspects of his life, said, "The most difficult thing for us seems to be to give of ourselves, to do away with selfishness. If we really love someone, nothing is a hardship" (<i>CR,</i>April 1967, p. 104). This message is echoed by the inscription on the statue of a boy carrying his brother located at Boys Town, Nebraska: "He ain't heavy, Father, he's my brother."<br><br>The challenge to give of ourselves may be further increased by a pervading theme of our time--self-fulfillment. The emphasis on self-fulfillment rests on a seldom-articulated base of greed which says that I must pay attention to "me first" and in the process hope that others may be benefited because I am doing what makes me happiest. Daniel Yankelovich, in exploring the ideas about self-fulfillment in "New Rules in American Life: Searching for Self-Fulfillment in a World Turned Upside Down," published in<i>Psychology Today</i>in April 1981, has counseled the self-fulfillment seekers: "The injunction that to find one's self one must lose oneself contains a truth any seeker of selffulfillment needs to grasp" (p. 50). This concept was grasped by both President Tanner and the anonymous boy.<br><br>There are those, however, on the other side of the coin who because of inadequate love and appreciation of themselves fail to fill their own wells. They are selfish toward themselves and are thus unable to establish an effective, loving relationship with others. Again we see the need for balance--a love of self and neighbor in a framework of loving our Creator.<br><h2><b>Love Looks Outward</b><b></b></h2><br>It becomes evident that a life patterned on the principle of love requires developing an acceptance and love of self and from this base doing a considerable amount of looking outward. On the other hand, achieving a life patterned on the principle of love is hindered by lack of self-acceptance and an undue amount of looking inward--focusing on self. We have the power to decide which way we want to look--to choose to enhance our capacity to love or to choose something less. We can take steps which will enhance the quality of love in our lives. We can refine it. We can choose to help it grow. We can start from where we are and begin an eternal quest to emulate our Father in Heaven in His capacity to love. Mastery of love--the perfection connection--demands love of self and others in the bonds of love of our Heavenly Father.<br><br>It is my prayer that, as we grow in our understanding of the centrality of love in our movement toward perfection, we may apply ourselves to incorporating it in our lives and become active participants on the path to perfection.<br><br>May we be worthy to receive the blessings Paul promised to the Thessalonians: "And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men" (1Thessalonians 3:12)--and may I add toward our Heavenly Father and toward ourselves, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Ruth E.

<h1>n Can Be Saved?” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Following a familiar New Testament passage in which the Lord had a conversation with a rich young man, who was unable to meet the standard the Lord had given him,<br><br><i>said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.</i><br><br><i>And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</i><br><br><i>When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?</i>[Matthew 19:23–25]<br><br>Their reasoning seems to have been, "If a rich man can't be saved, then who can?" After all, in this world the sentiment obtains that the rich man can do or have anything. It appears that Jesus was not necessarily condemning riches but warning his disciples that the magnitude of one's stewardship increases as do his earthly possessions. The rich man has more with which to bless the lives of others than the poor man and has the greater challenge to use those things within his jurisdiction for benevolent and righteous purposes rather than simply to use them to satisfy his own selfish desires.<br><br>I repeat, when the disciples heard the Lord's statement "they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?" Possibly the Lord's response to their question startled them more than the statement which evoked their question. Jesus said unto them, "With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible" (Matthew 19:26).<br><br>Obviously, this is a signal declaration of the Lord regarding his atoning sacrifice. If humankind--rich or poor--were left exclusively to their own resources, their own powers, there would be no salvation for them. "With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible" (Matthew 19:26).<br><h2><b>Sacrifice Taught from the Beginning</b></h2><br>Near the outset of man's sojourn upon the earth Adam and Eve were taught that Heavenly Father had made provision for the redemption of his children. Adam and Eve had been cast out of the Garden of Eden. They had sons and daughters who "began to divide two and two in the land, and to till the land, and to tend flocks, and they also begat sons and daughters" (Moses 5:3). Adam and Even sought guidance from the Lord and were commanded to worship him and to offer the firstlings of their flocks as an offering unto him (see Moses 5:4–5). Adam and Even were now at least grandparents.<br><br>The scripture says,<br><br><i>And after many days an angel of the Lord appeared unto Adam, saying: Why dost thou offer sacrifices unto the Lord? And Adam said unto him: I know not, save the Lord commanded me.</i><br><br><i>And then the angel spake, saying: This thing is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father, which is full of grace and truth.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, thou shalt do all that thou doest in the name of the Son, and thou shalt repent and call upon God in the name of the Son forevermore.</i><br><br><i>And in that day the Holy Ghost fell upon Adam, which beareth record of the Father and the Son, saying: I am the Only Begotten of the Father from the beginning, henceforth and forever, that as thou hast fallen thou</i>mayest<i>be redeemed, and all mankind, even</i>as many as will. [Moses 5:6–9; emphasis added]<br><br>Summarily, may I emphasize four points. First, they were to offer sacrifices of the firstlings of their flocks. Second, the sacrifices were symbolic of the sacrifice which was eventually to be made by the Christ, the Only Begotten of the Father. Third, they were to do all things in the name of the Son. And fourth, because of the sacrifice of the Son of God, "all mankind, even<i>as many as will</i>," will be redeemed.<br><h2><b>Symbolic Anticipation of the Savior's Sacrifice</b></h2><br>The practice of sacrifice which was established by God in the days of Adam, symbolic of and pointing to the sacrifice of the Son of God who would eventually come into the world, was perpetuated until the time of Moses. Extensive instructions regarding sacrificial rites were given to Moses by the Lord. There is one verse of particular illumination and significance regarding the doctrine of the atonement--the necessity of sacrifice and the shedding of blood. The Lord said,<br><br><i>For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.</i>[Leviticus 17:11]<br><br>Again, "For the life of the flesh is in the blood." If we substitute the word<i>mortality</i>for the word<i>flesh</i>, the passage reads, "for the life of mortality is in the blood." As I understand what the Lord was saying, it might be put like this: Inasmuch as the life of the flesh (or mortality) is in the blood, and it is the mortal (or finite) soul that sins, the blood, which contains the life of mortality, must make the atonement for the soul.<br><br>The blood sacrifices were continued as a part of the broad principle called the law of Moses. The prophet Abinadi taught his people that it was expedient that they keep the law of Moses but that salvation did not come by the law alone. He said, "Were it not for the atonement, which God himself shall make for the sins and iniquities of his people, that they must unavoidably perish, notwithstanding the law of Moses" (Mosiah 13). Thus, as the apostle Paul was later to say, the law was a "schoolmaster" to prepare them for the Christ (see Galatians 3:24).<br><br>Speaking of the Christ's atoning sacrifice, symbolically anticipated in the thousands and thousands of ritual offerings from the days of Adam, the prophet Amulek declared:<br><br><i>It is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice, and then shall there be, or it is expedient there should be, a stop to the shedding of blood; then shall the law of Moses be fulfilled; yea, it shall be all fulfilled, every jot and tittle, and none shall have passed away.</i><br><br><i>And behold, this is the whole meaning of the law, every whit pointing to that great and last sacrifice; and that great and last sacrifice will be the Son of God, yea, infinite and eternal.</i>[Alma 34:13–14]<br><br>Observe that again: "This is the whole meaning of the law, every whit pointing to that great and last sacrifice; and that great and last sacrifice will be the Son of God, yea, infinite and eternal" (Alma 34:14).<br><br>As the atoning sacrifice of the Lord was "the whole meaning of the law," so in our own dispensation the Lord gave the Prophet Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon a glorious vision in the account of which is recorded,<br><br><i>And this is the gospel, the glad tidings, which the voice out of the heavens bore record unto us--</i><br><br><i>That he came into the world, even Jesus, to be crucified for the world, and to bear the sins of the world, and to sanctify the world, and to cleanse it from all unrighteousness;</i><br><br><i>That through him all might be saved whom the Father had put into his power and made by him;</i><br><br><i>Who glorifies the Father, and saves all the works of his hands</i>[<i>in one of the three degrees of glory</i>]<i>, except those sons of perdition who deny the Son after the Father has revealed him.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 76:40–43]<br><br>Thus, as "the whole meaning of the law" of Moses pointed to the great and last sacrifice, the atonement of Jesus Christ, so modern revelation declares, in effect, that the whole meaning of the gospel is rooted in the atonement of the Christ. "He came into the world . . . to be crucified for the world, and to bear the sins of the world, and to sanctify the world, and to cleanse it from all unrighteousness; that through him all might be saved."<br><h2><b>The Savior's Unique Mission</b></h2><br>As I reflect upon the mortal life, teachings, and works of the Lord Jesus Christ in ancient Palestine, it seems appropriate and not inaccurate to describe them with two familiar terms,<i>ministry</i>and<i>mission.</i><br><br>I think of the word<i>ministry</i>as applicable to the great parables; sermons; sometimes seemingly incidental teachings that arose out of various events, situations, or circumstances; and the wonderful manifestations of his compassion when he healed the sick, caused the blind to see, the deaf to hear, the lame to walk, when he cast out evil spirits, and raised the dead, when he changed the water into wine, fed the multitudes with a few loaves and a few fish, and on and on, including his cursing of the barren fig tree, demonstrating that he had the power to destroy as well as the power to heal and bless. As marvelous as were all of those things, both the teachings and the works or miracles, through his power similar teachings and works or miracles have been performed by his prophets and apostles or others among his authorized servants, both before he was born and since his ascension into heaven.<br><br>However, I think of the word<i>mission</i>as applicable to the atoning sacrifice, described by the prophets as "infinite and eternal." His ministry was much greater, but not altogether dissimilar from those of his authorized representatives. However, his mission was altogether unique. Although prophets and/or apostles, both before and after his coming into the world anciently, suffered torturous forms of persecution and even death, they had no power through their suffering and death to redeem even one soul from sin and the grave, not even their own. "With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible" (Matthew 19:26).<br><br>The Lord Jesus Christ declared:<br><br><i>I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.</i><br><br><i>. . . I lay down my life for the sheep. . . .</i><br><br><i>No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.</i>[John 10:14–15, 18]<br><br>His unique mission from before the foundations of this earth were laid was to come into the world and freely give his life, no man having the power to take it from him; to die and be raised again, that all mankind would be raised from their graves and can be forgiven of their sins upon the merciful conditions established by Heavenly Father and his Holy Son, the Only Begotten, and our Redeemer, even Jesus Christ.<br><h2><b>The Anguish of Gethsemane</b></h2><br>On the night of the Last Supper, there having been "a strife among" his disciples earlier in the evening regarding "which of them should be accounted the greatest" (Luke 22:24–30), supper being ended, he gave them an impressive answer and unforgettable example when, as John described it,<br><br><i>He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.</i><br><br><i>After that he poureth water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.</i>[John 13:4–5]<br><br>The sacred ordinance being concluded, when he had sat down again,<br><br><i>he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?</i><br><br><i>Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.</i><br><br><i>If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet.</i><br><br><i>For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.</i><br><br><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.</i><br><br><i>If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.</i>[John 13:12–17]<br><br>Later, while still in the upper room and apparently even later while on the way to Gethsemane, he gave them the sublime teachings recorded in John, chapter 13 through 16.<br><br>He seems to have given the great intercessory prayer in behalf of his disciples, then to have crossed the Brook Cedron to the Garden of Gethsemane. There he sought the Father, saying, "If thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done" (Luke 22:42). Luke said, "There appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him" (Luke 22:43). Luke further testified, "And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground" (Luke 22:44). It is important to recognize that the Lord had not yet been nailed to the cross or suffered the humiliations of the trials before Annas, Caiaphas, the Sanhedrin, Pilate, Herod, and Pilate again; he had not yet been condemned to die or even arrested. The agony of the atonement, at least as regards his shedding of blood for mankind, commenced not on the cross but in Gethsemane. We have not only Luke's witness concerning this, but in our own time the Lord Jesus Christ himself has given his own witness about that suffering, saying,<br><br><i>Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit--and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink--</i><br><br><i>Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 19:18–19]<br><br>Subsequently, he did suffer the trials and the excruciating pain of and death by crucifixion. Doubtless the chief priests and many among the Pharisees and scribes thought they had triumphed, but in that irony of ironies, when he gave up the ghost, it was he who had triumphed. Furthermore, between his death and resurrection, he visited the spirit world and in that vast realm inaugurated his work for the unrighteous dead--another triumph over Satan and his unholy purposes.<br><h2><b>The Reality of the Resurrection</b></h2><br>Then came that glorious morning of the Resurrection. That day the Lord was seen by Mary, several of the women, two disciples on the road to Emmaus, Simon, and that evening by ten of the twelve:<br><br><i>Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.</i><br><br><i>But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.</i><br><br><i>And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in you hearts?</i><br><br><i>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have.</i><br><br><i>And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.</i><br><br><i>And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?</i><br><br><i>And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.</i><br><br><i>And he took it, and did eat before them.</i>[Luke 24:36–44]<br><br><i>But Thomas, one of the twelve . . . was not with them when Jesus came.</i><br><br><i>The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.</i><br><br><i>And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.</i><br><br><i>Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.</i><br><br><i>And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.</i><br><br><i>Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.</i>[John 20:24–29]<br><br>With three of their five senses they experienced the resurrected Christ. They saw him, they heard him, and they touched him.<br><br>They saw and conversed with him on yet other occasions, on a mountain in Galilee, on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, and on the Mount of Olives at the time of his ascension into heaven. Paul reported that on one occasion "he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once" (1 Corinthians 15:6). He was seen repeatedly for a period of some forty days, almost a month and a half (see Acts 1:3).<br><br>When he appeared to his disciples in ancient America,<br><br><i>the whole multitude fell to the earth; for they remembered that it had been prophesied among them that Christ should show himself unto them after his ascension into heaven.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto them saying:</i><br><br><i>Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that the multitude went forth, and thrust their hands into his side, and did feel the prints of the nails in his hands and in his feet; and this they did do, going forth one by one until they had all gone forth, and did see with their eyes and feel with their hands, and did know of a surety and did bear record, that it was he, of whom it was written by the prophets, that should come</i>. [3 Nephi 11:12–15]<br><br><i>And the multitude did see and hear and bear record; and they know that their record is true for they all of them did see and hear, every man for himself; and they were in number about two thousand and five hundred souls; and they did consist of men, women, and children.</i>[3 Nephi 17:25]<br><br>Our own dispensation of the gospel began when the resurrected Christ and his and our Father appeared to the young Prophet Joseph Smith in the spring of 1820 and announced the commencement of their latter-day work. The anciently written title page of the Book of Mormon declared the purpose of that record to be for "the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ." When the Lord himself began to pour forth revelation upon revelation to his chosen prophet for his latter-day kingdom, in one of them he declared, "For thus shall my church be called in the last days, even The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (D&amp;amp;C 115:4).<br><br>In one of the early revelations, he referred to his atonement as he identified himself. He said:<br><br><i>Thus saith the Lord you God, even Jesus Christ, the Great I AM, Alpha and Omega . . .</i><br><br><i>I am the same which spake, and the world was made, and all things came by me.</i><br><br><i>I am the same which have taken . . . even as many as have believed in my name, for I am Christ, and in mine own name, by the virtue of the blood which I have spilt, have I pleaded before the Father for them.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 38:1, 3–4]<br><br>Please note that again, "By the virtue of the blood [that is, by the excellence or power of the blood] which I have spilt, have I pleaded before the Father for them."<br><br>In a still earlier revelation, he declared that he had suffered and shed his blood for all. He said, "For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent; but if they would not repent they must suffer even as I" (D&amp;amp;C 19:16). He said, your suffering will "be sore--how sore you know not, how exquisite you know not, yea, how hard to bear you know not" (D&amp;amp;C 19:15).<br><h2><b>"Heart, Soul, Mind, and Strength"</b></h2><br>When we begin to realize and in some measure comprehend who he is, and what he has done and does for us, and makes possible for us, and recognize the love that he and Heavenly Father have for us, we should begin to understand in at least a limited way the reasonableness and logic of the first and great commandment: "And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment" (Mark 12:30).<br><br>Traditionally, the heart has been a familiar symbol of love. But in the Lord's commandment, the heart represents only one of four ways in which he said we should love him. As I understand the terms<i>heart</i>,<i>soul</i>,<i>mind,</i>and<i>strength</i>, it seems to me the Lord is saying we must love him with all our emotions, our volition, our intellect, and our physical vitality. Putting it otherwise, it seems that he is saying that all that we think and do and say should be permeated with our love for him. That is consistent with the counsel he gave Adam and Eve when the angel explained to them that their sacrifices were in the similitude of the sacrifice which would later be made by the Christ. The angel said, "Wherefore, thou shalt do all that thou doest in the name of the Son" (Moses 5:8). Consider that for a moment. Suppose we never thought or said or did anything that we could not do in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. What a marvelous standard! It is a criterion we should all strive to apply constantly in our daily lives.<br><br>On another occasion and in another way the Lord emphasized how much we should love him. As he gave counsel to his apostles prior to sending them on their first mission, among other things, he said to them: "He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me" (Matthew 10:37).<br><br>Regarding the first commandment, and this remarkable statement, may I make only two observations. First, surely parents should love their children and children should love their parents--such love is fundamental to the gospel. However, as great as that love is, or should be, it would be at best short-lived and without ultimate significance were it not for the Lord and his atoning sacrifice. That love has more meaning both here and hereafter because of him. Second, husbands and wives, parents and children, are finite, imperfect beings, or objects of love. Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ are infinite, perfect beings, or objects of love. It appears to me that one's love relationships can be no more perfect or higher than his supreme love object. All our love relationships would necessarily be distorted if we had a less than perfect love object as our standard. Loving Heavenly Father and his Holy Son our Redeemer as our supreme love objects provides the illumination, inspiration, and motivation, to love all other things in the proper way. Comparable illumination, inspiration, and motivation cannot come from a lesser love object.<br><br>Recall the question of the disciples, "Who then can be saved?" and the Lord's answer, "With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible" (Matthew 19:26).<br><h2><b>Come unto Him</b></h2><br>On one occasion the Lord told the ancient Jews they had three witnesses of him, John the Baptist, his own works, and the Father (<i>see</i>John 5:33–37). He then spoke of a fourth witness in this familiar verse, "Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me" (John 5:39).<br><br>A reflective reading of that verse might suggest that the word<i>think</i>should not be there. Cursorily considered, who would want to merely<i>think</i>eternal life is in the scriptures? Perhaps most people who love the scriptures would<i>want</i>eternal life to really be in the scriptures. However, an analysis of this verse in its context suggests that the word<i>think</i>is integral to the concept the Lord was trying to get his listeners to grasp. He had just named the three witnesses which testified of him and then bade the Jews to "search the scriptures," for they also testified of him. However, the real power of his statement is implicit in that word<i>think</i>when one considers the verse which follows. May I read the two verses together:<br><br><i>Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.</i><br><br><i>And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.</i>[John 5:39–40]<br><br>In other words, he was saying his listeners "thought" eternal life was in the scriptures, but eternal life is in him, and they would not come to him that they might have life. Putting it otherwise, the scriptures are a guide to get mankind to come to him, for he is the source of eternal life, not the scriptures. Yes, there is power in the written word, but it is only because of him who is the Living Word.<br><br>In another place it is recorded,<br><br><i>Ye must be born again into the kingdom of heaven, of water, and of the Spirit, and be cleansed by blood, even the blood of mine Only Begotten; that ye might be sanctified from all sin, and enjoy the words of eternal life in this world, and eternal life in the world to come, even immortal glory.</i>[Moses 6:59]<br><br>If one searches the scriptures, he will find that they do testify of Jesus and that he is the Christ, and that it is not enough simply to acknowledge him, as important as that is, but one must come unto him, and that involves humbling oneself and being grateful for the high privilege of receiving the sacred ordinances the Lord has provided and commanded we receive from one whom he has authorized to administer them. One should not expect to "be cleansed by blood, even the blood of [the] Only Begotten . . . and sanctified from all sin" if he does not do what the Lord tells him to do.<br><br>Observe also in the verse just cited, that, when one does what he is commanded to do, he is told that he will "enjoy the words of eternal life in this world, and eternal life in the world to come, even immortal glory." In light of the assurance that one can "enjoy the words of eternal life in this world," it is clear why the prophet Nephi charged mankind to "feast upon the words of Christ," saying, "If ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life" (2 Nephi 32:3; 31:20).<br><br>Most of us in the immediate hearing of my voice have received the basic ordinances the Lord offers all mankind and asked us to receive. We have made covenants with him, and no doubt in varying degrees we are enjoying the words of eternal life daily. Doubtless much more is available to all of us than any of us is presently enjoying.<br><br>Again, recall the question of the ancient disciples, "Who then can be saved?" and the Lord's answer, "With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible" (Matthew 19:26).<br><h2><b>Ask Yourself</b></h2><br>Now, in view of the foregoing principles, may I respectfully request that each of you apply the following questions to yourself, and I shall attempt to do the same.<br><br>How does his atoning sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ affect the things you think about?<br>How does the atonement affect the things you say?<br>How does his atonement affect the kind of language you use?<br>How does the atonement affect the kinds of books and other things you choose to read?<br>How does the atonement affect the kinds of movies and TV shows you choose to watch?<br>How does the atonement affect the kind of music you voluntarily hear?<br>How does the atonement affect the way you take care of your health?<br>How does the atonement affect the way you use your time?<br>How does the atonement affect the way you use your talents and skills?<br>How does the atonement affect the way you use your means or resources?<br>How does the atonement affect the way you treat your wife or husband?<br>How does the atonement affect the way you treat your parents?<br>How does the atonement affect the way you treat your children?<br>How does the atonement affect the way you treat your brothers and sisters?<br>How does the atonement affect the way you treat your neighbors?<br>How does the atonement affect the way you treat your employer, employees, or fellow employees?<br>How does the atonement affect the way you treat your customers, your students, or your patrons?<br>How does the atonement affect the way you perform your civic duties?<br>How does the atonement affect your personal morals?<br>Really, what difference does the atonement make in your life? If it doesn't make a difference, it should.<br><h2><b>Only on His Terms</b></h2><br>Perhaps such questions could be multiplied endlessly. Life consists of a multitude of details, specifics, and we must not let the specifics be swallowed up in the general any more than we must let the general be swallowed up in the specifics.<br><br>Each specific must be met in its own time, but two remaining generic thoughts from the scriptures are always useful guides: The Lord said, "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15). And the angel said, "Do all that thou doest in the name of the Son" (Moses 5:8).<br><br>"Who then can be saved?" We all can because of the atoning sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ, but we<i>can</i>be only on<i>his</i>terms. He has paid the price and made it possible for all mankind to be saved<i>if</i>they will repent, accept him for who he is, receive his holy ordinances from his authorized servants, and be faithful and true to their covenants.<br><br>May we all strive to live in such a way that our lives constantly reflect our profound appreciation for the atonement, and may our lives be permeated by the ennobling influence that can come only from the presence of God, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, the Lord. Amen.<br><br><i><i>David H. Yarn, Jr., was a professor of philosophy at BYU when this devotional address was given on 26 July 1983.</i></i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>d Happiness - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I consider it a real privilege and honor to meet with you young people in this hour of worship, and I pray that the Spirit of the Lord will direct your minds and thoughts. I commend you for your desire to increase you knowledge and understanding of the gospel.<br><br>You are choice young people, blessed with the blood of Israel, and blessed with the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>I feel to say to you that the Lord has a special mission for each one of you, and as you live in accordance with gospel principles, the Lord will open up the way before you and assist you in solving your problems and making the right decisions throughout your life.<br><br>We are, however, living in a period where there is much hatred, conflict, and contention. People everywhere are praying for peace and happiness. Jesus Christ is called the Prince of Peace, and his message is a message of peace to the individual and to the world. It is peace that makes us really appreciate mortal life and enables us to bear heartbreaking situations and tribulations.<br><h2><b>Joseph Smith</b></h2><br>In considering the purpose of life, the Prophet Joseph Smith said: "Happiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it; and this path is virtue, uprightness, faithfulness, holiness, and keeping all the commandments of God" (<i>HC</i>5:134–35).<br><br>The gospel of Jesus Christ is the plan of life that will restore peace to the world, remove inner tensions and troubles, and bring happiness to the human soul. It is the greatest philosophy of life ever given to man. The mission of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is to establish this peace and happiness in the hearts and homes of the people.<br><br>I would like to discuss with you today four principles that can assist you in securing peace and happiness in your lives.<br><br>These principles are<i>prayer, patience, preparedness,</i>and<i>pacing.</i><br><br>First, let us consider the great principle of prayer.<br><h2><b>Prayer</b></h2><br>Implanted in the heart of every person born on this earth, regardless of his or her race or color, is the desire to worship in some manner a divine being. Really, the true meaning of prayer is fellowship with God. Prayer opened the heavens to the Prophet Joseph Smith and, likewise, opened the dispensation of the fullness of times. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a monument to prayer.<br><br>The Lord has repeatedly told us to pray always and that he will pour out his Spirit upon us and bless us greatly (see D&amp;amp;C 19:38). The Prophet Joseph Smith observed that, "It is the first principle of the gospel to know for a certainty the character of God, and to know that we may converse with Him as one man converses with another" (<i>HC</i>6:305).<br><br>Prayer is the "simplest form of speech"; it is the "soul's sincere desire, uttered or unexpressed" (James Montgomery, "Prayer Is the Soul's Sincere Desire,"<i>Hymns</i>, no. 220).<br><br>Brigham Young in his realistic manner stated, "You know that it is one peculiarity of our faith and religion never to ask the Lord to do a thing without being willing to help him all that we are able; and then the Lord will do the rest" (<i>HC</i>5:293).<br><br>"Please, Lord, help me to help myself." I am convinced that this prayer for increased personal powers–spiritual strength, greater inspiration, and greater confidence–is one that God always answers. We can learn to solve our own problems with God's help, making him our partner.<br><h2><b>Some Practical Suggestions</b></h2><br>This being the case, what can we do to supplement prayer? What is our part? Let me suggest a few examples:<br><br>As we pray for wisdom and knowledge, our part can be to study and apply ourselves.<br><br>As we ask for health and strength of body and of mind, we can supplement prayer by living the Word of Wisdom.<br><br>As we ask for protection in our travels, our part would be to use good judgment, such as driving carefully if we are going by car.<br><br>When we pray for inspiration, we should live close to the Lord by keeping his commandments. The Savior said, "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15).<br><br>When we pray for direction, let us remember the counsel the Lord gave Oliver Cowdery in the ninth section of the Doctrine and Covenants: study our problems out in our own mind, make a decision, and then ask the Lord if our decision is right. If it is, we will receive a burning of our bosom, or a good feeling. If not, we will receive a stupor of thought or a questionable feeling (see D&amp;amp;C 9:8, 9). Then, whatever the feeling, let us have the courage to follow it. This is doing our part.<br><br>When we pray for patience, our part could be to persevere and remember the Lord has counseled us to "be not weary in well doing . . . for out of small things proceedeth that which is great" (D&amp;amp;C 64:33).<br><h2><b>What to Pray For</b></h2><br>The question is frequently asked, What should one pray for? Well, prayer being the "soul's sincere desire, uttered or unexpressed," pray for you soul's sincere desire. But never forget that whatever our prayer is for, we can supplement our heavenly request with some positive action on our part. How comforting this is and how beautifully this truth is made known in the hymn:<br><br><i>When sailing on life's stormy sea,</i><br><br><i>'Mid billows of despair,</i><br><br><i>'Tis solace to my soul to know</i><br><br><i>God hears my secret prayer.</i><br><br>(H.H. Peterson, "There Is an Hour of Peace and Rest,"<i>Hymns</i>, no. 172)<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith, speaking on this subject, stated:<br><br><i>We would say to the brethren, seek to know God in your closets, call upon him in the fields. Follow the directions of the Book of Mormon, and pray over, and for your families, your cattle, your flocks, your herds, your corn, and all things that you possess; ask the blessing of God upon all your labors, and everything that you engage in"</i>(<i>Teachings,</i>p. 247).<br><br>I suggest this day we commit ourselves to so live that we may go before the Lord with a clear conscience and ask for his divine guidance and assistance. As we do this, we can truthfully say:<br><br><i>O how praying rests the weary!</i><br><br><i>Prayer will change the night to day;</i><br><br><i>So when life gets dark and dreary,</i><br><br><i>Don't forget to pray.</i><br><br>(Mrs. M.A. Kidder, "Ere You Left Your Room This Morning,"<i>Hymns,</i>no. 31)<br><br>I have, throughout my life, had my prayers answered very directly many times. Prayer has been a great blessing to me and my family and has been the means of bringing peace of mind and happiness to our lives.<br><h2><b>Patience</b></h2><br>Now let us consider the great principle of patience as a means of bringing peace and happiness into our lives.<br><br>A great revelation was given in February 1829, through the Prophet Joseph Smith to his father, and is recorded in section 4 of the Doctrine and Covenants. In this section qualities necessary for success in the Lord's service are given and include patience. (see D&amp;amp;C 4:6).<br><br>In today's world of uncertainty, pressures, strains, and tribulations, patience is an essential virtue.<br><h2><b>The Purpose of Patience</b></h2><br>The apostle Paul, in writing to the Roman Saints, said: "We glory in tribulations . . . knowing that tribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope" (Romans 5:3–4).<br><br>And so our trials and tribulations, as we meet them with patience, give us valuable experiences and prepare us for challenges that lie ahead.<br><br>In 1828, the Lord, in a revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith said: "Do not run faster or labor more than you have strength" (D&amp;amp;C 10:4).<br><br>By exercising patience, we will not be inclined to run faster or labor more than our strength justifies.<br><br>Some might construe patience to be a negative force, resulting in resignation and discouragement. However, patience is a great stabilizing influence in our lives while impatience frequently brings fear, tensions, discouragement, and failure.<br><br>In a revelation given through the Prophet Joseph Smith to his brother, Hyrum in May 1829, the Lord counseled Hyrum in regard to his assignment saying, "Be patient until you shall accomplish it" (D&amp;amp;C 11:19). Here patience is identified as a positive force and as a requisite to accomplishment. It is important to realize that patience can be a tremendous positive force when combined with prayer, faith, and works.<br><h2><b>How Can We Develop Patience?</b></h2><br>In this light, let us further consider the great value of patience and how it can be developed.<br><br>Patience means persevering, and persevering means work–mental and physical.<br><br>President Grant used to say: "That which we try to do, and persist in doing, becomes easy to do, not because its nature is changed, but because our power to do is developed" (Josiah Gilbert Holland [Timothy Titcomb, pseud.],<i>Gold-Foil: Hammered from Popular Proverbs</i>[New York: Charles Scribner, 1859], 291).<br><br>Then to develop patience: "Don't expect too much too soon." Make the most out of what you have. For instance, exercise patience in the matter of buying a new home, a new car, furniture, or other important things. Get out of debt and stay out of debt. Here patience will reward you with peace of mind, happiness, and success. A young person should plan and patiently prepare for a mission years ahead of the time he leaves, providing he wants to perform an outstanding mission.<br><br>Planning and obtaining one's education are especially important in this day and age, and, of course, planning and preparing for one's vocation become significant parts of planning and obtaining one's education. Faith and patience are vital to accomplish these desired objectives. Hasty courtships tend to create unhappy marriages and often result in divorce. Be patient in the selection of a husband or wife. Be patient and take sufficient time to prepare for a temple marriage. Here is one place that your patience will be rewarded with eternal blessings.<br><br>Our greatest need for continual patience is with our loved ones, our family. Here is where we may be the most impatient, but here is where patience pays the greatest dividends. Nothing is sweeter than to watch a loving parent patiently teach his child correctly. A father stood by his small son in a swimming pool. The boy wanted so much to learn to swim. The father patiently showed him how. Day after day, they returned to the pool, the father always evidencing patience and appreciation for the boy's efforts.<br><br>This same method is used by truly successful parents in teaching their children the lessons of life: social, moral, intellectual, and spiritual, as well as physical–telling and showing, over and over until the lesson is learned, always with patience, love, and appreciation of every evidence of progress, no matter how small.<br><br>As one reviews the various areas of life's activities and appreciates the many human inadequacies, the great value of patience becomes more and more evident.<br><br>Sometimes we are misunderstood, even by those who are closest to us. Under such circumstances, patience will develop within us the capacity to accept criticism if warranted or not. This ability to exercise forebearance under provocation means that we are following the Savior's teachings, to do good to those that despitefully use us and to turn the other cheek (see Matthew 5:44, 39).<br><br>Patience is truly a mighty virtue and can be developed as we recognize its importance and make up our minds to be patient within our own lives as well as with others.<br><h2><b>Our Heavenly Father's Patience</b></h2><br>I am grateful for my knowledge of the gospel and that the gospel incorporates the remarkable principle of patience. I am most thankful for the patience of my Father in Heaven has evidenced with me in my life.<br><br>The apostle Paul, in writing to the Hebrew Saints, said to them: "Let us run with patience the race that is set before us" (Hebrews 12:1). Yes, as we incorporate the mighty virtue of patience in our lives, it will be a great help in obtaining the desired peace and happiness.<br><h2><b>Personal and Family Financial Preparedness</b></h2><br>Now, the third point I would like to discuss in developing peace and happiness is personal and family financial preparedness.<br><br>Throughout the history of the Church, the doctrine of personal and family preparedness has been emphasized by the leaders of the Church. Regardless of the difficulties existing in the world today, we as a people must recognize that financial problems are the reason for much unhappiness and are certainly a major factor in family difficulties and divorce. The Lord has told us that if we are prepared, we shall not fear (see D&amp;amp;C 38:30). What a blessing it is to be free from financial fear!<br><br>I would like to suggest a three-point formula to attain and maintain financial preparedness.<br><br>1. Pay your tithes and offerings.<br><br>2. Get out of debt and stay out of debt.<br><br>3. Use your surplus funds wisely.<br><br>This formula is equally applicable to young and old. Let me discuss each of these three points briefly.<br><h2><b>First, Pay Your Tithes And Offerings</b></h2><br>The Lord has said,<br><br><i>Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings. . . .</i><br><br><i>Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse . . . and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it.</i>[Malachi 3:8, 10]<br><br>In this dispensation, the Lord has revealed to us that this "is a day of sacrifice, and a day for the tithing of my people" (D&amp;amp;C 64:23).<br><br>Compliance with the law of tithing opens the windows of heaven, bringing material and spiritual blessings through sacrifice and obedience. It is truly the first step toward personal and family financial preparedness.<br><br>When men, women, and children are honest with the Lord and pay their tithes and offerings, the Lord gives them wisdom whereby they can do as much with the remainder as they could if they had not been honest with the Lord–and often they can do more. They are blessed and prospered in various ways–spiritually, physically, and mentally, as well as materially. I know this to be true, and I am sure many of you can bear such a testimony. Always remember the words of the Lord Jesus: "It is more blessed to give than to receive" (Acts 20:35).<br><br>As long as one is honest with the Lord, the amount of tithing paid is not material. The widow's or the child's mite is as important and acceptable as the rich man's offerings.<br><br>Yes, compliance with the law of tithing truly is the first step toward personal and family financial preparedness.<br><h2><b>Get Out Of Debt</b></h2><br>Now, the<i>second</i>point of the formula–<i>get out of debt and stay out of debt.</i>In modern revelation, the Lord has given us these commandments: "Verily I say unto you, concerning your debts, behold it is my will that you shall pay all your debts" (D&amp;amp;C 104:78). And again, "Pay the debt thou has contracted. . . . Release thyself from bondage" (D&amp;amp;C 19:35).<br><br>President Joseph F. Smith advised the Saints to "get out of debt and keep out of debt, and then you will be financially, as well as spiritually free."<br><br>In getting out of debt and staying out of debt, there are certain basic principles that we, as individuals and families, can apply; such as:<br><br>Live within your income.<br><br>Prepare and use short- and long-term budgets.<br><br>Regularly save a part of your income.<br><br>Use your credit wisely if it is necessary to use it at all. For example, a reasonable debt may be justified for the acquisition of a home or education.<br><br>Preserve and utilize your assets through appropriate tax and estate planning.<br><br>I know that by following these simple, basic principles, it is possible to get out of debt and stay out of debt.<br><br>What will this mean to us as individuals and families?<br><br>President Heber J. Grant said, "If there is any one thing that will bring peace and contentment into the human heart, and into the family, it is to live within our means, and if there is one thing that is grinding and discouraging and disheartening, it is to have debts and obligations that one cannot meet" (<i>GS,</i>p. 111). I can personally bear witness that this is true.<br><h2><b>Use Surplus Funds Wisely</b></h2><br>Let me also suggest that you<i>use your surplus funds wisely</i>. In many respects, the real test of a man is his attitude toward his earthly possessions. A person who places earthly possessions of this world in the scales against the things of God evidences little understanding of eternal values.<br><br>President Brigham Young had this to say about this matter:<br><br><i>When this people are prepared to properly use the riches of this world for the building up of the kingdom of God, he is ready and willing to bestow them upon us. . . .</i><br><br><i>I like to see men get rich by their industry, prudence, management and economy, and then devote it to the building up of the kingdom of God upon the earth.</i>[<i>JD</i>11:114–15]<br><br>I bear you my testimony that personal and family preparedness is vital to the development of peace and happiness. Yes, it is important to be strong financially, as well as spiritually, mentally, and physically.<br><h2><b>Pacing Oneself</b></h2><br>Now let me discuss the fourth principle in order to have peace and happiness:<i>pace yourself.</i><br><br>Frequently we find ourselves under pressure and inner tension builds up.<br><br>When I first entered public life, I was under considerable pressure and suffered from migraine headaches. Inner tension contributed to this condition, and by learning how to relax mentally and physically, I overcame my problem. When I became exercised over a matter, I reminded myself that I must take it easy, that it would probably all be the same one hundred years from now, and that there were many persons in the cemetery who had thought that they were indispensable.<br><br>As I came across pictures that would remind me to take it easy, I would cut them out and paste them in my work books and other places where I could have ready access to them when I sensed I was becoming tense. When such occasions arose, I would glance at one of these pictures, relax a second, and go on benefited by this change of pace.<br><br>For example, I found a magazine photograph of some pigs sleeping in the sun. One had a particularly blissful expression on his face. The caption read, "Life is a dream." I have carried this picture with me for years. I never look at it without feeling relaxed.<br><br>In order to maintain maximum efficiency, I feel that one must learn to change the tempo–or shall we say "pace" oneself.<br><br>Some years ago, I was assigned to supervise the missions of the east coast. One was the New England Mission, of which Dr. Truman Madsen was president. After one of my tours, President Madsen published the following article in the mission's monthly periodical:<br><br><i>The Power of Pacing</i><br><br><i>Nothing impresses me more about President Richards than the way he paces himself. He came here after touring three missions in a row, without rest. He was fixed in purpose, and as steady in performance. He ate, slept with absolute regularity. When he was carrying out a plan he was undeviating. When he let go, shifting to a caramel, a lifesaver, or a respite to get the spring back in his bow, then he planned. Then he started in again with quiet efficiency . . . I commend his example to you. Pace. . . .</i><br><h2><b>Change Tempo</b></h2><br>If the task cannot be changed, then change the tempo. If sitting, stand up and stretch each hour. Start the difficult or disliked tasks first. Alternate the hard and easy tasks. Plan the specialized tasks together. Change tasks about every two hours if practical. Decrease the backtracking, and, finally, learn the relaxed approach to every task.<br><h2><b>Survey Large Fields</b></h2><br>An axiom that has been an influence in my life is, "Survey large fields, but cultivate small ones."<br><br>Too often in life one tries to cultivate fields beyond his physical, mental, and economic ability. When the grass over the fence looks greener, people are apt to overestimate their capacity.<br><br>One of the principle reasons for failure is overextending oneself. This is evident in every phase of life. I have frequently said that I would rather be small and strong than large and weak.<br><br>As stated before, these concepts incorporate basic gospel principles and will bring peace and happiness to those who apply them in their lives.<br><br>And remember that no one can cheat you out of ultimate peace and happiness but yourself.<br><br>As we apply the eternal principles of prayer, patience, preparedness, and pacing in our lives, we not only receive the rewards of peace and happiness, but we also make ourselves available to be peacemakers.<br><h2><b>Be a Peacemaker</b></h2><br>Undoubtedly, one of the greatest messages given by our Lord and Savior was the Sermon on the Mount. This message contained the Savior's plan for the abundant life. In it he admonished all to be peacemakers as he said, "Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God" (Matthew 5:9).<br><br>Have you ever wondered how you can be a peacemaker? Really, our opportunities are unlimited.<br><br>Certainly in our homes we can all be peacemakers by exhibiting love and goodwill, thus offsetting the evil of contention, envy, and jealousy. Where misunderstandings exist between children and parents, we can encourage adjustments on the part of both. We can pray together for the spirit of peace.<br><br>We can become peacemakers by avoiding criticism. Remember that Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount said, "Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with that judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged" (Matthew 7:1-2).<br><br>We can be peacemakers by practicing and teaching forgiveness. Jesus was asked how many times one should be forgiven, and he replied that we should forgive without limit. Forgive him "seventy times seven" (Matthew 18:22).<br><br>An important part of forgiving is forgetting. In some ways, being able to forget is almost as valuable as being able to remember.<br><br>Possibly there is a greater need for peacemakers today than ever before. If this world had no need of peacemakers, our Savior never would have said, "<i>Blessed</i>are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God."<br><br>The<i>blessed</i>part of being a peacemaker is that those who are peacemakers and who live the gospel principles receive a testimony born of the Holy Ghost. They enjoy the peace that surpasseth all understanding, relief from inner tensions, joy and happiness, contentment, and growth and development. I personally know this to be true.<br><br>Many people are filled with fears about what will become of them as they grow older. I met a lovely lady in her eighties working in the temple. The spirit of peace and tranquility radiated from her. She was so busy helping others that she had little concern for herself. Her needs were not great, and as she said, "The Lord is taking care of my needs."<br><br>The Lord tells us, "But learn that he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come" (D&amp;amp;C 59:23).<br><br>Yes, the Lord will take care of our needs, and help us overcome those things that worry us, when we do our part, put our faith and trust in him, and concern ourselves with serving him by serving our fellowmen. I've seen this in my own life, in the lives of those close to me, and in the lives of hundreds of others all over the world. It is the only way to personal peace, that peace that is not of this world and is beyond our understanding and comprehension, but so sweet to us.<br><br>I bear you my witness that God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ live and that through the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the power to act in the name of God have been restored to this earth, and further that President Spencer W. Kimball is a living prophet guiding and directing the affairs of The Church of Jesus Christ on the earth today. May the Lord's choicest blessings be with him, and may we have the courage and good judgment to follow the counsel and advice he has given us.<br><br>May each of us in our daily lives enjoy the peace and happiness that surpasseth all understanding, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Franklin D.

<h1> Prophets: The Apostle Paul and Joseph Smith</h1>
<br>
<br>
Where is the clear voice of authority on right and wrong? Divided and drifting churches supply religious philosophers but not prophets. Yet Latter-day Saints testify that Joseph Smith and his successors were called to rescue a world adrift in its own conceits and problems. Such a claim can be tested by the Bible, the record of prior prophets.<br><br>Would you assist me in making an important point? I would like to report accurately your awareness of the Bible, but remember that the value of the result depends upon your strict honesty now. I have two simple questions. First, do you know who delivered the Sermon on the Mount? If you do, raise your hand. Second, could you name all four Gospels in the New Testament? If you can, raise your hand. We have here observed that an audience of Latter-day Saints college students can score nearly 100 percent in a simple literacy test about Christ. A Gallup poll this year determined that only 42 percent of Americans could name Jesus as delivering the Sermon on the Mount; only 59 percent of the college graduates in this country knew who gave the sermon. Obviously a lower percentage know the critical teachings of that sermon. The national results on your second question are similar. Whereas about 85 percent of you indicated that you could name the four Gospels, only 46 percent of Americans can do so; again, only 61 percent of college graduates can name the four Gospels.<sup>1</sup><br><br>There could not be a stronger argument for a college education of the kind that you are getting, blending scriptural and secular knowledge. This world cannot rise higher than nominal Christianity until the message of Christ and his prophets is learned by educated people. Another name for religious education is missionary work. We must share our reasons for Joseph Smith as a modern prophet, restoring the religious insights to bring all to Christ in this world and in eternity.<br><br>As a religion teacher who taught many of your parents, I wish to share an approach to Joseph Smith that grows naturally out of an informed view of the Bible. I have spent half of my time studying the sources of the life of Joseph Smith, and the other half studying the words of Christ and the New Testament prophets. I find it hard to believe in the biblical prophets without also accepting Joseph Smith and those called after him. The same reasons that lead a thinking person to accept Peter and Paul as Christ's servants should also lead that person to accept Joseph Smith as commissioned by Christ. Here I am going to take Paul as an example because we know more about his life than that of any other New Testament prophet. His main strengths as a prophet are also those of Joseph Smith. If you forget some comparisons, please remember the principle--that the leading evidences that Paul is a true prophet also support Joseph Smith as called of God. Remembering that fundamental proposition, you can reconstruct this talk anytime with you own examples. Proof of the mission of any true prophet gives the format for identifying a later true prophet.<br><h2><b>Paul and Joseph Smith Different</b></h2><br>This approach does not assume that any individual is a carbon copy of another. Paul was not striking in person whereas Joseph Smith impressed most visitors by his height and bearing. Paul was a missionary apostle whereas Joseph Smith presided over apostles and mostly directed missionary work instead of traveling to do it personally. Paul had the best education that his culture could afford whereas Joseph Smith was raised in frontier poverty without training beyond junior high school skills. But in spite of such wide personal differences, there are dramatic common denominators. It matters little that one spoke English and that the other was fluent in Hebrew and Greek, provided they both spoke as inspired by the Holy Ghost. It is the question of their common calling and authority and revelation that we are addressing. This forces us to go behind appearances to inner spiritual realities. In doing this with Paul and Joseph Smith, we may also increase our abilities to be sensitive to the inner spiritual realities of those prophets who lead and will lead us in our own lives.<br><h2><b>Paul and Joseph Had Direct Revelation</b></h2><br>Both Paul and Joseph Smith were considered blasphemers by their contemporaries. Their sin? They had added to the traditional scriptures. Paul was considered anti-Jewish, and followers of Joseph Smith today are superficially labeled as non-Christian. But every Jewish and Christian prophet had added to the prior revelations by speaking God's message for a new generation. Paul demonstrated this continuity by standing before the Jewish high council and observing that he was on trial for believing what other Pharisees believed--the reality of the resurrection (see Acts 23:6). And Joseph Smith made the same kind of plea in a letter testifying to his nonmember uncle, who later joined the Church. He contended that the revelations to earlier servants of God were the history of religion, not religion. True religion demanded present communication with God. The great answers of God to biblical leaders were really an invitation to seek those answers anew. Joseph Smith asked his uncle, "And have I not an equal privilege with the ancient saints? And will not the Lord hear my prayers, and listen to my cries as soon as he ever did to theirs, if I come to him in the manner they did?"<sup>2</sup> No true servant of God teaches that the day of continuing revelation is past.<br><br>The following story about Joseph Smith comes from Parley P. Pratt's autobiography, a fast-moving introduction to Church history that is a must in your gospel education. Parley P. Pratt was in Philadelphia in January 1840, when Joseph Smith spoke at a meeting during the Christmas recess of Congress, before which he had testified on behalf of Latter-day Saint reparations after the Missouri persecutions. Joseph's counselor, the eloquent Sidney Rigdon, spoke at length on biblical evidences for the Restoration. But Joseph virtually sprang to the pulpit afterward to tell his personal experiences of how God called him, "bearing testimony of the visions he had seen, the ministering angels which he had enjoyed."<sup>3</sup> When Paul was challenged on the resurrection, he did not argue with the Corinthians about the philosophical possibility. On the contrary, he answered their objections only after insisting that he and others knew for themselves, for they had seen. If there is no resurrection, "we are found false witnesses of God" (1 Corinthians 15:15). The essential job of a prophet is to testify personally. And in the case of the great prophets Paul and Joseph Smith, they did so on the basis of their eyewitness contact with Christ.<br><h2><b>Their First Visions</b></h2><br>Thus there was a "first vision" for both Paul and Joseph Smith. Their backgrounds differed, but the vision near Damascus and the vision in the New York forest were orientations for these two prophets for a lifetime of service. Both open revelations told them to change their course and to wait for the Lord's further instruction. And both were conversations with the resurrected Christ. Criticisms of Joseph Smith demand consistency in studying the prophets. Many Christians accepting Paul comfortably think that their sniping at Joseph Smith's first vision has proved it wrong. But what appears is a double standard for these critics. Most arguments against Joseph Smith's first vision detract from Paul's Damascus experience with equal force. For instance, Joseph's credibility is attacked because he did not describe his first vision until a dozen years after it happened. But the first known mention of the Damascus appearance is in 1 Corinthians 9:1, written about two dozen years after it happened. Critics love to dwell on supposed inconsistencies in Joseph Smith's spontaneous accounts of his first vision. But people normally give shorter and longer accounts of a vivid experience that is retold more than once. Joseph Smith was cautious about public explanations of his sacred experiences until the Church grew strong and could properly publicize what God had given him. Thus his most detailed first-vision account came after several others--at the time that he began his formal history that he saw as one of the key responsibilities of his life (see JS-H 1:1–2, 17–20). In Paul's case there is the parallel. His most detailed account of Christ's call is the last recorded mention of several. Thus before Agrippa, Paul related how the glorified Savior first prophesied his work among the gentiles; this was told only then because Paul was speaking before a gentile audience (see Acts 26:16–18). Paul and Joseph Smith had reasons for delaying full details of their visions until the proper time and place.<br><br>The first visions of Paul and Joseph Smith underline the directness of their divine contact. Many writers now use <i>prophet</i> of religious leaders who are eloquent but do not merit that designation. But the overused <i>awesome</i> correctly pictures Joseph Smith and Paul standing in the presence of the resurrected Lord and receiving specific direction. Yet such powerful visions did not happen every day. Divine beings do not appear to anyone because of easy whim or casual desire. Such great revelations come when God has a purpose for them. In Paul's case, he saw the Lord on four other known occasions after his first vision--stretching through the next twenty-five years of his career in the Church.<sup>4</sup> Joseph Smith is very similar in the number of other times he saw the Lord throughout seventeen years after his first vision.<sup>5</sup> Neither Paul nor Joseph Smith fell into the impostor's trap of overclaiming such sacred experiences. And there is a corollary here that is a mark of true prophets. Visions supplement agency--they do not supplant it. For years Paul struggled in a lesser light and even opposed the truth before his first vision. We know that Joseph Smith also had a history of years of inquiry. Great answers come after intense quests. Every vision of Joseph Smith or Paul represents an important answer at a critical time.<br><h2><b>Our Involvement</b></h2><br>Each of us here is involved in the deepest realities given to these great prophets. For one thing, their visions tell us of our personal destinies. Nothing is more religiously exciting than the brilliant scene of three degrees of glory in Joseph Smith's vision recorded in Doctrine and Covenants, section 76. One proof of his inspiration is that the Christian world knows nothing of such degrees of glory--only the superficial heaven or the dismal hell. Yet Paul spoke of himself in humility as "a man in Christ" who was caught up to the "third heaven" to see glorious things (see 2 Corinthians 12:2–4). Joseph Smith and Paul agree here against the Christian world because they received true revelation that religious leaders do not have. In the modern Prophet's words, "When any person receives a vision of heaven, he sees things that he never thought of before."<sup>6</sup> Our origin and destiny are among the most powerful appeals of the restored gospel, and both are vivid in Paul.<br><br>There is another dimension where we may identify personally with the prophets. Though they were given great doctrinal guidelines to share, they did not know all answers to everything. Several statements of Joseph Smith regarding judgments and the Second Coming mirror this 1839 comment, "I know not how soon these things will take place."<sup>7</sup> Paul could shatter the arrogance of the Corinthians by comparing human knowledge to the understanding of a child: "for we know in part, and we prophesy in part" (1 Corinthians 13:9). The revealed part is critical for our perspective on earth, but the unrevealed part is essential to our agency and growth in learning through discernment and consistency with revelation.<br><br>And just at this point is one of the greatest personal messages from these prophets--the invitation for all to become prophets. The sharp distinction between the clergy and the common man never existed when prophets were on the earth. From the point of view of authority and doctrinal revelation, the New Testament apostles clearly had a special position of leadership. But from the point of view of sharing God's inspiration, they invited all to be baptized, receive the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, and participate in the gifts of the Spirit. While correcting excesses, Paul encouraged the early Saints to "desire spiritual gifts" and seek to "prophesy" (1 Corinthians 14:1). Joseph Smith's similar invitation comes in many forms but permeates his speeches. It proves that true prophets do not seek to maintain professional status in an exclusive group, but to lead all to the same power that God has shared with them. On a half-dozen occasions Joseph Smith affirmed that he claimed to be a prophet but added, in the words of Revelation 19:10, that everyone else who could gain a testimony of Jesus would also be a prophet, "for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."<sup>8</sup> That is, if all pay the price to gain the Holy Ghost, all can be prophets. The parallel between Joseph Smith and Paul is vivid here, for Paul penned the most impressive perspective of the Holy Ghost: "the things of God" can only be revealed "unto us by his Spirit"--that which searches "the deep things of God" (1 Corinthians 2:9–11). In turn Joseph Smith gave the most practical advice on how to identify these subtle but powerful spiritual promptings. "A person may profit by noticing the first intimation of the spirit of revelation," Joseph Smith counseled. Proceeding, he asked you to pay attention "when you feel pure intelligence flowing unto you--it may give you sudden strokes of ideas."<sup>9</sup><br><br>Is anyone here not concerned with a relationship with God? Paul and Joseph Smith are trustworthy guides. Their spiritual qualities stand out as impressively similar. Paul's mature letters refer to constant prayers for the Saints, and his hope that they will pray for him. The great miracle of being freed from prison by an earthquake came in the midst of the prayers of Paul and his companion (see Acts 16:25). Joseph Smith's pattern is better documented, not only in his early prayers before his early visitations. Joseph Smith's many letters, personal diaries, and Nauvoo speeches are interspersed with open prayers for the blessings of God upon his work and upon the Latter-day Saints in that work. These are not staged references, but the spontaneous appeals of a sincere man. We are trusting in God's answers to men who deeply trusted him.<br><h2><b>Their Authority</b></h2><br>And their authority in representing God is overwhelming--they knew that they knew. Paul answered when challenged, "Am I not an apostle? . . . Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord?" (1 Corinthians 9:1). Public and private remarks of Paul and Joseph Smith are filled with the personal knowledge of their authority to speak for Jesus Christ. That needs no demonstration in the case of the ancient apostle, who constantly preached Christ to a world that had scarcely heard of him. Since Joseph Smith was sent centuries later to a society that professed belief in Christ, he did not argue that point as much as explain the meaning of Christ's will. Yet his closeness to the Lord is symbolized by his private letters to his wife, which were dashed off with no thought of publication. In 1832 he told her of delay in returning home, mentioned his heartfelt prayers to God for forgiveness and blessings, and spoke of God as his friend and comfort, continuing: "I have given my life into his hands. I am prepared to go at his call. I desire to be with Christ. I count not my life dear to me, only to do his will."<sup>10</sup> Joseph Smith was a powerful witness of Christ not only in the first vision, but in the visions of the three degrees of glory and in the Savior's appearance to accept the Kirtland Temple. But strangely, the followers of this prophet who knew Christ personally are slandered as not Christians by their detractors. Joseph Smith and Paul furnish the most powerful testimonies of Christ outside the records of his ministry.<br><h2><b>Their Teachings of Sacrifice for the Gospel</b></h2><br>That raises the central issue of Christ's religion. Can one become a Christian through words alone? Isn't it odd that the saved-by-grace tracts seldom quote Christ and his central Sermon on the Mount? If Paul taught salvation by grace alone or faith alone, that would be a major cleavage from Joseph Smith, but it is not. Let's start with the foundation of the Savior whom both served. Jesus closed the Sermon on the Mount with the warning that hearing (or reading) these sayings without doing them would produce a moral catastrophe similar to the house that collapsed because it was not built on a sound foundation. In half a dozen letters Paul listed the moral sins that will keep one from God's kingdom if not repented of, saying to the Galatians, "I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God" (Galatians 5:21). What could be better proof of apostasy than the change of the Christian religion from a religion of action to a religion of belief alone? Newspaper stories of business fraud or repulsive immoralities are reminders that no Latter-day Saint goes into God's kingdom because of his name--only because of his repentance and high performance after accepting Christ's atonement.<br><br>Joseph Smith taught a restored gospel filled with mercy and the love of the Savior. But he consistently added the principle of responsibility after learning of mercy. There is no such thing as easy salvation. Someone once said of education: "Never say that learning is fun. It is difficult, painful, hard work. But it is worth it." You who have just about finished a successful semester knew the satisfaction of progress based on discipline. And Joseph Smith consistently taught salvation based on successfully controlling one's body for good. Thus salvation is not easy and pleasurable. But paying the price is worth the magnificent reward. Like Paul, Joseph Smith taught that unrepentant evil would not be ignored on the day of judgment. At a funeral he appealed to all to put their lives in order now: "Let it prove as a warning to all men to deal justly before God with all men--then we shall be clean in the day of judgment."<sup>11</sup> Paul taught accountability throughout his letters, and throughout his Nauvoo preaching Joseph Smith insisted that eternal judgment was among the first principles of the gospel.<sup>12</sup> Indeed, how to meet that judgment successfully is the gospel.<br><br>One night's binge on TV or $20 spent on movie tickets would be enough to prove that the motivating principle of this world is pleasure. But the motivating principle of Paul and Joseph Smith was putting aside easy pleasure to bring about God's kingdom. When the Corinthians doubted the resurrection, Paul simply asked why he risked his life "every hour" and faced death "daily" (1 Corinthians 15:30). Would one of Paul's intelligence live a life of discomfort for something not true? To his Corinthian detractors, he simply asked who had given more for the gospel. Paul's record is magnificent in a simple modern translation:<br><br><i>From the Jews five times I received forty stripes minus one. Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, a night and a day I have been in the deep; in journeys often, in perils of waters . . . in hunger and thirst . . . in cold and nakedness--besides the other things, what comes upon me daily: my anxiety for all the churches. </i>[2 Corinthians 11:24–28, New King James Bible.]<br><br>I seriously ask you, would you trade a record like that for sports cars, a constant tan, and other material pleasures that money can buy for a few temporary decades on this earth?<br><br>Joseph Smith also proved his sincerity by sacrifice. Writing to the Church during a legal persecution that kept him in hiding in and out of Nauvoo for months, he also looked back: "The envy and wrath of man have been my common lot all the days of my life . . . and I feel, like Paul, to glory in tribulation" (D&amp;amp;C 127:2). Why did either Paul or Joseph Smith do this? Because they positively knew the truth of the gospel, the resurrection, and the judgment, and that the riches of eternity made everything else secondary. The modern Prophet explained that his lifelong persecutions for telling his visions made him feel "much like Paul . . . [H]e was ridiculed and reviled. But all this did not destroy the reality of his vision. He had seen a vision, he knew he had, and all the persecution under heaven could not make it otherwise" (JS-H 1:24).<br><br>Many men and women sacrifice for their families and their principles. How many claim the visions of heaven and sacrifice as a witness of that? Most recent founders of successful religions live comfortably by the donations of their followers. But God's plan for his prophets tries them in fire, not only for their own postgraduate education, but for the clear validity of their testimony. Relatively few religious leaders have dared to claim visions on the level of Paul and Joseph Smith. And in the test of integrity, the quality of Joseph Smith's sacrifice clearly reaches the level of the ancient apostle. Joseph Smith's biographers will never run out of exciting copy because his life writes itself in the drama of giving for the gospel. This American prophet was too busy sacrificing to summarize all his trials, but any historian can easily take Paul's format and adapt it to Joseph Smith, who might have written:<br><br><i>A number of times Christians leveled guns at me with the threat of death. Once I was beaten, tarred, and feathered, and left unconscious. Twice I was endangered by stagecoach runaways when on the Lord's business. I have taken back roads and waded through swamps to escape my enemies. I have endured years of inconvenient travel on land for the kingdom, as well as risked many steamboat journeys on waterways. I faced years of unjust legal harassment, making my own home unsafe, and was imprisoned for a long winter in a filthy jail on unverified charges. Through all I maintained the responsibility of leading the Church, worrying, praying, and planning for the welfare of my family and my fellow Saints</i>.<sup>13</sup><br><h2><b>Their Love for the Saints</b></h2><br>Neither Paul nor Joseph Smith were strange aberrations, but vital personalities who loved and were loved. Indeed the genuineness of their selfless love is an important facet of their sacrifice for the gospel. I know of no two prophets who taught the meaning of love better than Paul and Joseph Smith. They must have been close to the Savior, who made love the foundation principle of the gospel. Indeed, the various fields of social studies recognize genuine love as the core of a healthy personality.<br><br>It is hardly necessary to comment on Paul's sketch of celestial love in 1 Corinthians 13, or his fatherly concern for cooperating and rebellious converts alike. Joseph Smith's life exhibits the same mature concern for others. For example, he could have escaped from custody at the beginning of the winter of Liberty Jail, but he would not for fear of reprisals on the Latter-day Saints. After their safety was assured by the dissipation of mobs and beginning migration, he tried three jailbreaks, all of them creative, but only the last successful. And at the end Joseph returned from the far bank of the Mississippi, observing that if his life was of no value to his people, it was of no value to himself. The historical documents surrounding this decision prove that he consciously placed himself in the danger of assassination in jail to keep angry troops from coming to Nauvoo to look for him and endanger his people. Time and again Joseph placed his safety second and the welfare of his family and Latter-day Saints first.<br><br>So there is substance in his Nauvoo teachings on love. His comments before the Relief Society are often homely in expression but godly in content: "The nearer we get to our Heavenly Father, the more we are disposed to look with compassion on perishing souls, to take them upon our shoulders, and cast their sins behind our back."<sup>14</sup> Earlier he had written to the Twelve on leaving home to preach the gospel: "A man filled with the love of God is not content with blessing his family alone, but ranges through the whole world, anxious to bless the whole human race."<sup>15</sup> I have pondered on the relationship of love and truth, an issue not very far from Keats's association of truth and beauty. The link for me is selflessness. One with true concern for you is not trying to exploit you for his benefit--thus he is most likely to give you truth and not his devious form of exploitation.<br><br>Joseph Smith gave one of his most telling insights into self just weeks before his martyrdom. Biographer Brodie thought that Joseph's "no man knows my history" hinted at deception, a 180-degree error. But this 1844 statement is really Joseph Smith's valedictory of love, linking his visions with his unlimited giving of self: "I have no enmity against any man . . . for I love all men, especially these my brethren and sisters. . . . You never knew my heart. No man knows my history. I cannot do it. I shall never undertake [it]. If I had not experienced what I have, I should not have known it myself. I never did harm any man since I have been born in the world. My voice is always for peace."<sup>16</sup> Joseph simply says that he knew marvelous things; therefore he shared. Can you believe a generous teacher or loving parent who says this? Such language pierces my soul. Knowing that Joseph Smith and Paul sincerely loved, I cannot believe that either deceived.<br><h2><b>Their Martyrdom</b></h2><br>There is little time for the many prophecies of Joseph Smith and Paul. They both pass the test of pre-inspiration, a topic for another talk and much more. There is room for a brief comment on the prophecies of each concerning martyrdom. Both Paul and Joseph Smith had predicted safety in earlier persecutions, but they accurately predicted their own deaths. This is a simple translation of that thought in Paul's final letter, 2 Timothy: "For I am already on the point of being sacrificed; the time of my departure has come" (2 Timothy 4:6, literal translation). From 1842 Joseph Smith had said that his work was virtually through and he could die at any time; in 1844 he negotiated on final arrest, bluntly telling Governor Ford in several letters that the legal process was a pretext "till some bloodthirsty villain could find his opportunity to shoot us."<sup>17</sup> Joseph gave himself into the hands of his enemies with full knowledge of his impending death. I am convinced on the basis of Nauvoo sources. Contemporary journals record his forebodings on the way to Carthage, and Willard Richards wrote the Prophet's words there the day before martyrdom: "I have had a good deal of anxiety about my safety, which I never did before--I could not help [it]."<sup>18</sup> And his non-Mormon lawyer recalled that Joseph said on the morning of the martyrdom "that he should not live to see another day, so fully was he impressed with the belief that he would be murdered, all of which proved true."<sup>19</sup><br><br>What are the most important things in the world today? Do not look for them in the media, for the three best historians of the first century barely mention Christianity as a disreputable superstition, and no one mentions Paul. The preservation of his history and personal letters we owe to the believers, who considered all he did and said far more important than the Jewish wars of the century or the aberrations of the emperors. Today's newspapers are filled with human drama, athletic scores, political power plays, shocking accidents, and actions of strange and often evil people. But the real news of the day they seldom carry--the outreach of the silent minority for righteousness, the moral choices of the faithful. Revelations to Paul and Joseph Smith make clear that this is the question on judgment day after all else has passed away. The devout Gandhi was shocked when told by his Christian friends "that all good works were useless." Thus he rejected such Christianity as irreligious, saying: "I do not seek redemption from the consequences of my sin. I seek to be redeemed from sin itself, or rather from the very thought of sin."<sup>20</sup> Through Joseph Smith the gospel was restored as originally taught by Paul, with its sweet assurance of forgiveness on condition that each believer obey the Ten Commandments and through Christ rise to perfection beyond that. Both Paul and Joseph Smith agree that perfection will come not in meditative isolation but in dynamic service, in priesthood-led programs, including the family.<br><h2><b>Their Commitment--and Ours</b></h2><br>As you read Joseph Smith's teachings and Paul's letters note the total commitment of each. Both were men consumed with a mission, which continues the question of what is really important in your world and your life. Of his work Paul said, "Necessity is laid upon me, for woe to me if I do not preach the gospel" (1 Corinthians 9:16, literal translation). One who had stood in the presence of Christ knew the urgency of each day and the real work for eternity going on around him. With the same conviction of urgency, Joseph Smith commented: "If I had not actually got into this work, and been called of God, I would back out. But I cannot back out--I have no doubt of the truth."<sup>21</sup> Does the spirit of revelation in you respond to the spirit of revelation in them? Do you expect to dwell with Christ, Paul, and Joseph Smith without paying the price that they paid--energetic service, discomfort, and ridicule for the cause of the Lord? The lives of these men who gave their all testify eloquently to the truth of their message. But their examples pose an inescapable question for everyone who knows what you know about them. How much will you give for the cause of the Lord? The answer can only be yours, and I pray that you will find an inspired one--which I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Richard Lloyd Anderson was a professor of religion at Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 9 August 1983.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1>and Managers - Hugh Nibley - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Twenty-three years ago on this same occasion, I gave the opening prayer, in which I said: "We have met here today clothed in the black robes of a false priesthood." Many have asked me since whether I really said such a shocking thing, but nobody has ever asked what I meant by it. Why not? Well, some knew the answer already, and as for the rest, we do not question things at the BYU. But for my own relief, I welcome this opportunity to explain: a "false priesthood?"<br><h2>The Explanation</h2><br>Why a priesthood? Because these robes originally denoted those who had taken clerical orders, and a college was a "mystery" with all the rites, secrets, oaths, degrees, tests, feasts, and solemnities that go with initiation into higher knowledge.<br><br>But why false? Because it is borrowed finery, coming down to us through a long line of unauthorized imitators. It was not until 1893 that "an intercollegiate commission was formed to draft a uniform code for caps, gowns, and hoods" in the United States. Before that there were no rules--you designed your own; and that liberty goes as far back as these fixings can be traced. The late Roman emperors, as we learn from the infallible Du Cange, marked each step in the decline of their power and glory by the addition of some new ornament to the resplendent vestments that proclaimed their sacred office and dominion. Branching off from them, the kings of the tribes who inherited the lands and the claims of the Empire vied with each other in imitating the Roman masters, determined to surpass even them in the theatrical variety and richness of caps and gowns.<br><br>One of the four crowns worn by the emperor was the mortarboard. The French kings got it from Charlemagne, the model and founder of their royal lines. To quote Du Cange:<br><br><i>When the French kings quitted the palace at Paris to erect a Temple of Justice, at the same time they conferred their royal adornments on those who would preside therein, so that the judgments that came from their mouths would have more weight and authority with the people, as if they were coming from the mouth of the prince himself</i> [the idea of the Robe of the Prophet, conferring his glory on his successor]. <i>It is to these concessions that the mortar-boards and the scarlet and ermine robes of the chancellors of France and the presidents of Parlement are to be traced. Their gowns or epitogia [the loose robe thrown over the rest of the clothing, to produce the well-known greenhouse effect], are still made in the ancient fashion. . . . The name "mortar-board" is given to the diadem because it is shaped like a mortar-board which serves for mixing plaster, and is bigger on top than on the bottom.</i>[Charles Du Fresne, Sieur Du Cange,<i>Glossarium ad Scriptores Mediae et Infimae Graecitatis</i>(Graz, Austria: Akademische Druck u. Verlagsanstalt, 1958; Unveränderter Abdruck der 1688 bei Anisson, Joan. Posuel u. Claud. Rigaud in Lyon erschiehenen Ausgabe)]<br><br>But where did the Roman emperors get it? For one thing, the mortarboard was called a<i>Justinianeion,</i>because of its use by the Emperor Justinian, who introduced it from the East. He got his court trappings and protocol from the monarchs of Asia, in particular the Grand Shah, from whom it can be traced to the khans of the steppes and the Mongol emperors, who wore the golden button of all wisdom on the top of the cap even as I do now; the shamans of the north also had it, and among the Laplanders it is still called "the Cap of the Four Winds." The four-square headpiece topped by the golden tassel--"the emergent flame of Full Enlightenment"--also figures in some Buddhist and Lamaist representations. But you get the idea--this Prospero suit is pretty strong medicine--"rough magic" indeed! (See Shakespeare,<i>The Tempest,</i>act 5, scene 1, line 51.)<br><br>There is another type of robe and headdress described in Exodus and Leviticus and the third book of Josephus'<i>Antiquities,</i>i.e., the white robe and linen cap of the Hebrew priesthood, which have close resemblance to some Egyptian vestments. They were given up entirely, however, with the passing of the temple, and were never even imitated again by the Jews. Both their basic white and their peculiar design, especially as shown in the latest studies from Israel, are much like our own temple garments. This is not the time or the place to pursue a subject in which Brother Packer wisely recommends a judicious restraint; I bring it up only to ask myself, "What if I appeared for an endowment session in the temple dressed in this outfit?" There would be something incongruous about it, of course, even comical. But why should that be so? The original idea behind both garments is the same--to provide a clothing more fitting to another ambience, action, and frame of mind than that of the warehouse, office, or farm. Section 109 of the Doctrine and Covenants describes the function and purpose of the temple as much the same as those of a university: a house where all seek learning by study and faith, by discriminating search among the best books (no official list is given), and by constant discussion--diligently teaching "<i>one another</i>words of wisdom"; everybody seeking greater light and knowledge as all things come to be "gathered in one"--hence <i>uni</i>versity.<br><br>Both the black and the white robes proclaim a primary concern for things of the mind and the spirit, sobriety of life, and concentration of purpose removed from the largely mindless, mechanical routines of your everyday world. Cap and gown announced that the wearer had accepted certain rules of living and been tested in special kinds of knowledge.<br><br>What is wrong, then, with the flowing robes? For one thing, they are somewhat theatrical and too easily incline the wearer, beguiled by their splendor, to masquerade and affectation. In the time of Socrates the Sophists were making a big thing of their special manner of dress and delivery. It was all for show, of course, but it was "dressing for success" with a vengeance, for the whole purpose of the rhetorical brand of education which they inaugurated and sold at top prices to the ambitious youth was to make the student successful as a paid advocate in the law courts, a commanding figure in public assemblies, or a successful promoter of daring business enterprises by mastering those irresistible techniques of persuasion and salesmanship which the Sophists had to offer.<br><br>That was the classical education which Christianity embraced at the urging of the great St. Augustine. He had learned by hard experience that you can't trust revelation because you can't control it--the Spirit bloweth where<i>it</i>listeth, and what the Church needed was something more available and reliable than that, something, he says,<i>commodior et multitudini tutor</i>--"handier and more reliable for the public"--than revelation or even reason, and that is exactly what the rhetorical education had to offer.<br><br>At the beginning of this century scholars were strenuously debating the momentous transition from <i>Geist</i>to<i>Amt,</i>from Spirit to office, from inspiration to ceremony in the leadership of the Early Church, when the inspired leader was replaced by the typical city bishop, an appointed and elected official--ambitious, jealous, calculating, power-seeking, authoritarian; an able politician and a master of public relations--St. Augustine's trained rhetorician. At the same time the charismatic gifts, the spiritual gifts, not to be trusted, were replaced by rites and ceremonies that could be timed and controlled, all following the Roman imperial model, as Alfoeldi has shown, including the caps and gowns.<br><br>And down through the centuries the robes have never failed to keep the public at a respectful distance, inspire a decent awe for the professions, and impart an air of solemnity and mystery that has been as good as money in the bank. The four faculties of Theology, Philosophy, Medicine, and Law have been the perennial seedbeds not only of professional wisdom, but of the quackery and venality so generously exposed to public view by Plato, Rabelais, Molière, Swift, Gibbon, A. E. Housman, H. L. Mencken, and others.<br><h2>Leadership vs. Management</h2><br>What took place in the Greco-Roman as in the Christian world was that fatal shift from<i>leadership</i>to<i>management</i>that marks the decline and fall of civilizations.<br><br>At the present time, Captain Grace Hopper, that grand old lady of the Navy, is calling our attention to the contrasting and conflicting natures of management and leadership. No one, she says, ever managed men into battle. She wants more emphasis in teaching leadership. But leadership can no more be taught than creativity or how to be a genius. The <i>Generalstab</i>tried desperately for a hundred years to train up a generation of leaders for the German army, but it never worked, because the men who delighted their superiors, i.e., the managers, got the high commands, while the men who delighted the lower ranks, i.e., the leaders, got reprimands. Leaders are movers and shakers, original, inventive, unpredictable, imaginative, full of surprises that discomfit the enemy in war and the main office in peace. For managers are safe, conservative, predictable, conforming organization men and team players, dedicated to the establishment.<br><br>The leader, for example, has a passion for<i>equality.</i>We think of great generals from David and Alexander on down, sharing their beans or<i>maza</i>with their men, calling them by their first names, marching along with them in the heat, sleeping on the ground, and first over the wall. A famous ode by a long-suffering Greek soldier, Archilochus, reminds us that the men in the ranks are not fooled for an instant by the executive type who thinks he is a leader.<br><br>For the manager, on the other hand, the idea of equality is repugnant and indeed counterproductive. Where promotion, perks, privilege, and power are the name of the game, awe and reverence for<i>rank</i>is everything, the inspiration and motivation of all good men. Where would management be without the inflexible paper processing, dress standards, attention to proper social, political, and religious affiliation, vigilant watch over habits and attitudes, and so forth, that gratify the stockholders and satisfy security?<br><br>"If you love me," said the Greatest of all leaders, "you will keep my commandments." "If you know what is good for me," says the manager, "you will keep<i>my</i>commandments, and not make waves." That is why the rise of management always marks the decline of culture. If the management does not go for Bach, very well, there will be no Bach in the meeting; if management favors vile, sentimental doggerel verse extolling the qualities that make for success, young people everywhere will be spouting long trade-journal jingles from the stand; if the management's taste in art is what will sell--trite, insipid, folksy kitsch--that is what we will get; if management finds maudlin, saccharine commercials appealing, that is what the public will get; if management must reflect the corporate image in tasteless, trendy new buildings, down come the fine old pioneer monuments.<br><br>To Parkinson's Law, which shows how management gobbles up everything else, he added what he calls the "Law of Injelitance": Managers do not promote individuals whose competence might threaten their own position; and so as the power of management spreads ever wider, the quality deteriorates, if that is possible. In short, while management shuns<i>equality,</i>it feeds on<i>mediocrity.</i><br><br>On the other hand, leadership is an escape from mediocrity. All the great deposits of art, science, and literature from the past on which all civilization is nourished come to us from a mere handful of leaders. For the qualities of leadership are the same in all fields, the leader being simply the one who sets the highest example; and to do that and open the way to greater light and knowledge, the leader must break the mold. "A ship in port is safe," says Captain Hopper, speaking of management; "but that is not what ships were built for," she adds, calling for leadership. True leaders are inspiring because they are inspired, caught up in a higher purpose, devoid of personal ambition, idealistic, and incorruptible.<br><br>There is necessarily some of the manager in every leader (what better example than Brigham Young?), as there should be some of the leader in every manager. Speaking in the temple to the temple management, the scribes and Pharisees all in their official robes, the Lord chided them for one-sidedness: They kept careful accounts of the most trivial sums brought into the temple, but in their dealings they neglected fair play, compassion, and good faith, which happen to be the prime qualities of leadership. The Lord insisted that <i>both</i>states of mind are necessary, and that is important: "This ye must do [speaking of the bookkeeping] but not neglect the other." But it is "the blind leading the blind," he continues, who reverse priorities, who "choke on a gnat and gulp down a camel" (see Matthew 23:23ff). So vast is the discrepancy between management and leadership that only a blind man would get them backwards. Yet that is what we do. In that same chapter of Matthew, the Lord tells the same men that they do not really take the temple seriously while the business contracts registered in the temple they take very seriously indeed (see Matthew 23:16-18). I am told of a meeting of very big businessmen in a distant place, who happened also to be the heads of stakes, where they addressed the problem of "how to stay awake in the temple." For them what is done in the house of the Lord is mere quota-filling until they can get back to the real work of the world.<br><h2>Moroni and Amalickiah</h2><br>History abounds in dramatic confrontations between the two types, but none is more stirring than the epic story of the collision between Moroni and Amalickiah--the one the most charismatic<i>leader,</i>the other the most skillful<i>manager</i>in the Book of Mormon. We are often reminded that Moroni "did not delight in the shedding of blood" and would do anything to avoid it, repeatedly urging his people to make covenants of peace and preserve them by faith and prayer. He refused to talk about "the enemy"--for him they were always "our brethren," misled by the traditions of their fathers; he fought them only with heavy reluctance, and he<i>never</i>invaded their lands, even when they threatened intimate invasion of his own; for he never felt threatened, since he trusted absolutely in the Lord. At the slightest sign of weakening by an enemy in battle, Moroni would instantly propose a discussion to put an end to the fighting. The idea of total victory was alien to him--no revenge, no punishment, no reprisals, no reparations, even for an aggressor who had ravaged his country. He would send the beaten enemy home after battle, accepting their word for good behavior or inviting them to settle on Nephite lands, even when he knew he was taking a risk. Even his countrymen who fought against him lost their lives only while opposing him on the field of battle--there were no firing squads, and former conspirators and traitors had only to agree to support his popular army to be reinstated. And, like Helaman, he insisted that conscientious objectors keep their oaths and not go to war even when he desperately needed their help. Always concerned with doing the decent thing, he would never take what he called unfair advantage of an enemy. Devoid of personal ambition, the moment the war was over he "yielded up the command of his armies . . . and he retired to his own house . . . in peace" (Alma 62:43), though as a national hero he could have had any office or honor. For his motto was, "I seek not for power," and as to rank, he thought of himself only as one of the despised and outcast of Israel. If all this sounds a bit too idealistic, may I remind you that there really have been such men in history, hard as that is to imagine today.<br><br>Above all, Moroni was the charismatic leader, personally going about to rally the people, who came running together spontaneously to his "title of liberty," the banner of the poor and downtrodden of Israel (Alma 46:12-13, 19-21). He had little patience with management and let himself get carried away and wrote tactless and angry letters to the big men sitting on their thrones "in a state of thoughtless stupor" back in the capital. And when it was necessary, he bypassed the whole system; he "altered the<i>management</i>of affairs among the Nephites," to counter Amalickiah's managerial skill (Alma 49:11; emphasis added). Yet he could apologize handsomely when he learned that he had been wrong, led by his generous impulses to an exaggerated contempt for management, and he gladly shared with Pahoran the glory of the final victory--the one thing that ambitious generals jealously reserve for themselves.<br><br>But if Moroni hated war so much, why was he such a dedicated general? He leaves us in no doubt on that head--he took up the sword only as a last resort: "I seek not for power, but to pull it down" (Alma 60:36). He was determined "to pull down their pride and their nobility"--the pride and nobility of those groups who were trying to take things over (Alma 51:17). The "Lamanite brethren" he fought were the reluctant auxiliaries of Zoramites and Amalickiahites, his own countrymen. They "grew proud . . . , because of their exceedingly great riches," and sought to seize power for themselves (Alma 45:23ff). Enlisting the aid of "those who were in favor of kings . . . those of high birth . . . supported by those who sought power and authority over the people" (Alma 51:8), they were further joined by important judges who had many friends and kindreds (the right connections are everything) plus almost all the lawyers and the high priests, to which were added "the lower judges of the land, and they were seeking for power" (Alma 46:4). All these Amalickiah welded together with immense managerial skill to form a single ultraconservative coalition who agreed to "support him and establish him to be their king," expecting that "he would make them rulers over the people" (Alma 46:5). Many in the church were won over by Amalickiah's skillful oratory, for he was a charming (<i>flattering</i> is the Book of Mormon word) and persuasive communicator. He made war the cornerstone of his policy and power, using a systematic and carefully planned communication system of towers and trained speakers to stir up the people to fight for their rights, meaning Amalickiah's career. For while Moroni had kind feelings for the enemy, Amalickiah "did care not for the blood of his people" (Alma 49:10). His object in life was to become king of both the Nephites and Lamanites, using the one to subdue the other (see Alma 46:5). He was a master of dirty tricks, to which he owed some of his most brilliant achievements as he maintained his upward mobility by clever murders, high-powered public relations, and great executive ability. His competitive spirit was such that he swore to drink the blood of Alma, who stood in his way. In short, he was "one very wicked man" (Alma 46:9), who stood for everything that Moroni loathed.<br><br>It is at this time in Book of Mormon history that the word<i>management</i>makes its only appearances (three of them) in all the scriptures. First there was that time when Moroni on his own "altered the management of affairs among the Nephites" (Alma 49:11) during a crisis. Then there was Korihor, the ideological spokesman for the Zoramites and Amalickiahites, who preached that "every man fared in this life according to the<i>management</i>of the creature; therefore every man prospered according to his genius [ability, talent, brains, and so forth], and . . . conquered according to his strength; and whatsoever a man did was no crime" (Alma 30:17; emphasis added). He raged against the government for taking people's property, that "they durst not make use of that which is their own" (Alma 30:28). Finally, as soon as Moroni disappeared from the scene, the old coalition "did obtain the sole<i>management</i>of the government," and immediately did "turn their backs upon the poor" (Helaman 6:39; emphasis added), while they appointed judges to the bench who displayed the spirit of cooperation by "letting the guilty and the wicked go unpunished because of their money" (Helaman 7:5). (All this took place in Central America.)<br><br>Such was the management that Moroni opposed. By all means, brethren, let us take "Captain Moroni" for our model, and never forget what he fought for--the poor, outcast, and despised; and what he fought against--pride, power, wealth, and ambition; or<i>how</i>he fought, as the generous, considerate, and magnanimous foe--a leader in every sense.<br><br>(Even at the risk of running overtime I must pause and remind you that this story of which I have given just a few small excerpts is supposed to have been cooked up back in the 1820s somewhere in the backwoods by some abysmally ignorant, disgustingly lazy, and shockingly unprincipled hayseed. Aside from a light mitigation of those epithets, that is the only alternative to believing that the story is<i>true;</i>nobody made it up, for the situation is equally fantastic no matter what kind of author you choose to invent.)<br><h2>Some Leaders</h2><br>That Joseph Smith is beyond compare the greatest leader of modern times is a proposition that needs no comment. Brigham Young recalled that many of the brethren considered themselves better managers than Joseph and were often upset by his economic naiveté. Brigham was certainly a better manager than the Prophet (or anybody else, for that matter), and he knew it, yet he always deferred to and unfailingly followed Brother Joseph all the way while urging others to do the same, because he knew only too well how small is the wisdom of men compared with the wisdom of God.<br><br>Moroni scolded the management for their "love of glory and the vain things of the world" (Alma 60:32), and<i>we</i>have been warned against the things of this world as recently as the last general conference. But exactly what are the things of the world? An easy and infallible test has been given us in the well-known maxim "You can have anything in this world for money." If a thing is of this world, you can have it for money; if you cannot have it for money, it does not belong to this world. That is what makes the whole thing <i>manageable</i>--money is pure number; by converting all values to numbers, everything can be fed into the computer and handled with ease and efficiency. "How much?" becomes the only question we need to ask. The manager "knows the price of everything, and the value of nothing" (Oscar Wilde, <i>Lady Windermere's Fan,</i>act 3), because for him the value<i>is</i>the price.<br><br>Look around you here. Do you see anything that cannot be had for money? Is there anything here you couldn't have if you were rich enough? Well, for one thing you may think you detect intelligence, integrity, sobriety, zeal, character, and other such noble qualities--don't the caps and gowns prove that? But hold on! I have always been taught that those are the very things that managers are looking for--they bring top prices in the marketplace. Does their value in<i>this</i>world mean, then, that they have no value in the<i>other</i>world? It means exactly that: such things have no price and command no salary in Zion; you cannot bargain with them because they are as common as the once-pure air around us; they are not negotiable in the kingdom because there everybody possesses all of them in full measure, and it would make as much sense to demand pay for having bones or skin as it would to collect a bonus for honesty or sobriety. It is only in our world that they are valued for their scarcity. "Thy money perish with thee," said Peter to a gowned quack (Simon Magus), who sought to include "the gift of God" in a business transaction (see Acts 8:9-24).<br><br>The group leader of my high priests quorum is a solid and stalwart Latter-day Saint who was recently visited by a young returned missionary who came to sell him some insurance. Cashing in on his training in the mission field, the fellow assured the brother that he knew that he had the right policy for him just as he knew the gospel was true. Whereupon my friend, without further ado, ordered him out of the house. For one with a testimony should hold it sacred and not sell it for money. The early Christians called <i>Christemporoi</i>those who made merchandise of spiritual gifts or Church connections. The things of the world and the things of eternity cannot be thus conveniently conjoined, and it is because many people are finding this out today that I am constrained at this time to speak on this unpopular theme.<br><h2>Avoid the Latter-day "Arm of Flesh"</h2><br>For the past year I have been assailed by a steady stream of visitors, phone calls, and letters from people agonizing over what might be called a change of major. Heretofore the trouble has been the repugnance the student (usually a graduate) has felt at entering one line of work when he or she would greatly prefer another. But what can they do? "If you leave my employ," says the manager, "what will become of you?" But today it is not boredom or disillusionment, but conscience that raises the problem: To "seek ye first financial independence and all other things shall be added," is recognized as a rank<i>per</i>version of the scriptures and an immoral <i>in</i>version of values.<br><br>To question that sovereign maxim, one need only consider what strenuous efforts of wit, will, and imagination have been required to defend it. I have never heard, for example, of artists, astronomers, naturalists, poets, athletes, musicians, scholars, or even politicians coming together in high-priced institutes, therapy groups, lecture series, outreach programs, or clinics to get themselves psyched up by GO! GO! GO! slogans, moralizing clichés, or the spiritual exercises of a careful dialectic, to give themselves what is called a "wealth mind-set" with the assurance that (in the words of Korihor) "whatsoever a man [does is] no crime" (Alma 30:17). Nor do those ancient disciplines lean upon lawyers, those managers of managers, to prove to the world that they are not cheating. Those who have something to give to humanity revel in their work and do not have to rationalize, advertise, or evangelize to make themselves feel good about what they are doing.<br><br>In my latest class a graduating honors student in business management wrote this--the assignment was to compare oneself with some character in the Pearl of Great Price, and he quite seriously chose Cain:<br><br><i>Many times I wonder if many of my desires are too self-centered. Cain was after personal gain. He knew the impact of his decision to kill Abel. Now, I do not ignore God and make murderous pacts with Satan; however, I desire to get gain. Unfortunately, my desire to succeed in business is not necessarily to help the Lord's kingdom grow [a refreshing bit of honesty]. Maybe I am pessimistic, but I feel that few businessmen have actually dedicated themselves to the furthering of the church without first desiring personal gratification. As a business major, I wonder about the ethics of business--"charge as much as possible for a product which was made by someone else who was paid as little as possible. You live on the difference." As a businessman will I be living on someone's industry and not my own? Will I be contributing to society, or will I receive something for nothing, as did Cain? While being honest, these are difficult questions for me.</i><br><br>They have been made difficult by the rhetoric of our times. The Church was full of men in Paul's day "supposing that gain is godliness" (1 Timothy 6:5) and making others believe it. Today the black robe puts the official stamp of approval on that very proposition. But don't blame the College of Commerce! The Sophists, those shrewd businessmen and showmen, started that game 2,500 years ago, and you can't blame others for wanting to get in on something so profitable. The learned doctors and masters have always known which side their bread was buttered on and have taken their place in the line. Business and "Independent Studies," the latest of the latecomers, have filled the last gaps, and today, no matter what your bag, you can put in for a cap and gown. And be not alarmed that management is running the show--they always have.<br><br>Most of you are here today only because you believe that this charade will help you get ahead in the world. But in the last few years things have got out of hand; "the economy," once the most important thing in our materialistic lives, has become the<i>only</i>thing. We have been swept up in a total dedication to "the economy," which like the massive mud slides of our Wasatch Front, is rapidly engulfing and suffocating everything. If President Kimball is "frightened and appalled" by what he sees, I can do no better than to conclude with his words: "We must leave off the worship of modern-day idols and a reliance on the 'arm of flesh,' for the Lord has said to all the world in our day, `I will not spare any that remain in Babylon'" ("The False Gods We Worship,"<i>Ensign,</i>June 1976, p. 6). And Babylon is where we are.<br><br>In a forgotten time, before the Spirit was exchanged for the office and inspired leadership for ambitious management, these robes were designed to represent withdrawal from the things of this world--as the temple robes<i>still</i>do. That we may become more fully aware of the real significance of both is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Hugh Nibley was professor emeritus of ancient scripture at Brigham Young University when this commencement address was given on 19 August 1983.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>eem: A Great Human Need - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is an honor to be one of the participants of the Campus Education Week and to join all of you and the distinguished faculty who are participating here. I am at once humbled and challenged in trying to speak of a great human need, self-esteem. I refer to what we think of ourselves, how we relate to what others think of us and the value of what we accomplish. Shakespeare in<i>Othello</i>said, "I have never found a man that knew how to love himself" (Act 1, scene 3).<br><br>The consequences of falling in love with oneself generally continue as an extended romance. This is what Thomas Carlyle, the famous Scottish writer referred to as "the sixth insatiable sense." And the English author Browning said self-esteem is "an itch for the praise of fools." The self-esteem that I speak of today is something different. It is not blind, arrogant, vain self-love, but self-respecting, unconceited, honest self-esteem. It is born of inner peace and strength.<br><br>Last month I went to get my driver's license renewed. I stood in the lines and looked at the eye charts. Then I waited with everyone else for the picture-taking process. In the picture on my license this time, my eyes are open! It was appalling to see the lack of self-esteem in so many who came to this public office. In the name of comfort and informality, many were immodestly dressed and others unkempt. I wondered why they would present themselves in public so poorly. In their manner of speech and their dress they had greatly shortchanged themselves. "Speech," it has been said, "is a mirror of the soul: as a man speaks so is he" (Publilius Syrus, Maxim 1073).<br><br>Self-esteem goes to the very heart of our personal growth and accomplishment. Self-esteem is the glue that holds together our self-reliance, our self-control, our self-approval or disapproval, and keeps all self-defense mechanisms secure. It is a protection against excessive self-deception, self-distrust, self-reproach, and plain old-fashion selfishness.<br><br>After a lifetime of observing, I have found the greatest respect is owed not necessarily to the rich, or the famous, but to the quiet, unsung, unknown heroes whose true identity, like the unknown soldier's, is known only to God. The unsung often have little of status, but much of worth.<br><br>When I was growing up in the Cottonwood area of Salt Lake County; it was the rural part of the valley. One of the men who had the greatest dignity and commanded the greatest respect was an old Scandinavian brother who, after walking a couple of miles, traveled by streetcar to work at the Salt Lake City Cemetery and back every day. His work was to water and mow the grass, tend the flowers, and dig the graves. He said little because he did not speak English well, but he was always where he should be, doing what he should do in a most dignified and exemplary way. He had no problems with ego, or with faith, for while he dug graves for a living, his work was to serve God. He was a man of little status, but of great worth.<br><br>Not far away from his humble home was where the more affluent people of our community lived. Many of the well-to-do were fine, honorable people; but some of them who had much status had little of worth.<br><br>When the Savior called his disciples, he was not looking for men and women of status, property, or fame. He was looking for those of worth and potential. They were an interesting group, those early disciples: the fishermen, the tax gatherer, and the others. On one occasion, after some of the apostles were beaten, they went "rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name" (Acts 5:41).<br><br>Worth has little to do with age. It has everything to do with service. The Lord has made it clear that worthiness is built upon service, not just to family and friends, but also to strangers and even to enemies. The great prophet Isaiah gave an eternal warning when he said:<br><br><i>Peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, saith the Lord; and I will heal him.</i><br><br><i>But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.</i><br><br><i>There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.</i>[Isaiah 57:19-21]<br><br>From Milton's<i>Paradise Lost</i>comes this truth: "Ofttimes nothing profits more than self-esteem grounded on just and right well managed" (Book 8, line 571).<br><h2><b>1. Keep Your Free Agency.</b></h2><br>May I suggest six essentials to keep a healthy self-esteem. The first key is to keep your free agency. To keep your free agency, you must not surrender self-control, nor yield to habits that bind, to addiction that enslaves, and to conduct that destroys. To keep our free agency we must avoid the deadly traps and pitfalls from which there may be no escape. Some, having been ensnared, spend the best years of their lives trying to escape, and so exhaust themselves in the process that in the end they find themselves freed from the addiction but spent, burned out, with their nerves shot and their brains forever dulled.<br><br>In Proverbs we read: "He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls" (Proverbs 25:28). To completely enjoy our free agency, it is necessary to follow the counsel of the 119<sup>th</sup>Psalm: "I have refrained my feet from every evil" (Psalm 119:101). As parents, we should follow the counsel of Alma. Teach them (our children) "to withstand every temptation of the devil" (Alma 37:33) and "bridle all your passions" (Alma 38:12).<br><h2><b>2. Cultivate Humility.</b></h2><br>The second key to an adequate self-esteem is humility. In speaking of humility I do not refer to the "breast beating," "sackcloth and ashes" kind of humility. I refer to the humility that comes with inner strength and peace. It is the humility that can accept and live with one's own warts without cosmetics to hide them. It is important to learn to live with our incorrectable physical and mental defects without comment and without explanation.<br><br>A few years ago I became acquainted with a delightful and wonderful new friend. He is charming, outgoing, and well groomed. He is a successful businessman. His spirituality shines through his countenance. He was completely honest in our business relationship. After many contacts and several months, I noticed a slight limp in his walk which had not been obvious before. That led to a closer observation. It was surprising that when I looked past the gracious smile, I noticed that my friend was slightly hunchbacked, with a somewhat misshapen spine. These physical defects were so well hidden by natural goodness, warmth, and great charm that they were as nothing in the total man. My friend accepts his physical defects with humility and strength and completely compensates for them with his natural personality.<br><br>There is another dimension of humility that must be mentioned--that of being teachable. The prophet Samuel counsels, "Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you" (1 Samuel 12:7). Proverbs reminds us that "Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge" (Proverbs 12:1). Any married man should be humble enough to learn from his wife. We have had a great example of this in the life of President Nathan Eldon Tanner. When Sister Sarah Tanner married President Tanner, he was a schoolteacher, not long from the farm in Alberta, Canada. Instead of bridling at receiving a suggestion from his wife, President Tanner had the humility and the strength to listen to her.<br><h2><b>3. Be Honest.</b></h2><br>The third key to self-esteem is honesty. Honesty begins in being true to one's own self.<br><br>Some years ago I sat as a spectator in a heartrending courtroom drama concerning the custody of some children. I don't know anything that is more heartrending than a custody battle for children. The contention was that the natural mother was not a good housekeeper, which was intended to add fuel to the claim that she was an unfit mother. A caseworker had testified that when she visited the family home it was in a shambles and that the kitchen was dirty.<br><br>The natural mother seeking to keep custody of her children was called to the stand. A middle-aged, heavy, physically unattractive lady came forward, took the oath, and sat in the witness stand. The attorney for the father, who had remarried and wanted custody of the children, followed up relentlessly on the testimony already provided by the caseworker. His questions to the beleaguered mother were penetrating.<br><br>"Isn't it a fact," he asked, "that your house was as dirty as a pigpen the day the caseworker came?" What drama! How could the mother answer in her own best interest and protect her custody of the children? What should she say? There was electricity in the air!<br><br>She hesitated for a tense moment, and then she responded, calmly, with complete self-assurance: "Yes, my house certainly was a mess that day."<br><br>Her honesty obviously surprised even the judge, for he leaned over the bench and asked, "What do you mean, 'that day?'"<br><br>"Well, your honor" she replied, "earlier that morning when the caseworker came I had been bottling peaches. I had peeled, cooked, and bottled two bushels of peaches. I had not finished cleaning up the mess when the caseworker came. My sink was still sticky from the syrup that had spilled over that I was trying to pour into the bottles before they were sealed. My house certainly was a mess that day. I try to be a good housekeeper, but with three children, I can't possibly keep it straight all the time."<br><br>Her frankness and candor were absolutely disarming and devastating to the opposition. When she finished, everyone in the courtroom knew the judge would rule in her favor. As she arose and stepped down from the witness stand, she had the bearing and the self-assurance of a queen.<br><br>Being true to one's own self is the essence of honesty and a keystone of self-esteem.<br><h2><b>4. Love Work.</b></h2><br>The fourth key to self-esteem is the love of work. The most gifted athlete at our university excelled at every sport. He played football and ran the hurdles--in fact, he held the conference record in the low hurdles. Our coach, Ike Armstrong, required that the sprinters run once a week with the quarter milers for three hundred yards to increase the stamina of the sprinters and increase the speed of the quarter-milers. My friend--the great athlete--would lead all of the runners for about 275 yards, but as soon as the first quarter miler passed him he would quit and wouldn't even finish. His natural talent and ability was such that he never had to extend himself to excel. He married, but the marriage failed. He went on into professional football and was something of a star until he got into the drug scene and died from the debilitating effects of drugs and alcohol. Others with much less talent have achieved far more.<br><br>In my experience there are very few people who are of true genius. There are many who are gifted, but most of the world's work and great things come from ordinary people with a talent which they develop. An ordinary, garden-variety talent can be nurtured and nourished into a great gift through hard work. Some of the artisans of China spend years making one exquisite object of art of unbelievable grace and beauty.<br><br>Some time ago we went to hear the New York Symphony in concert in Salt Lake City. The music was exceptional. The teamwork of each gifted musician blended to make a superb orchestral sound. Each of the group possesses great talent. Not everyone, however, has a talent for the arts, such as painting, sculpture, or music. Some may have a great gift to make others feel important, happy, and special. This gift should also be developed and strengthened.<br><br>The spiritual gifts likewise can be refined and enlarged by attentive application to righteous living, to prayer, to study of the scriptures, and to obedience. George Lucas has said, "It doesn't matter what people say about me, or what I say; what matters is what I accomplish." What we accomplish helps our self-esteem. Frequently we hear, "The work I do is unimportant," or "I'm just this or that." Every job that has to be done is important; no matter how minimal it seems, someone has to do it.<br><br>During the flood in Utah this summer, more than a million sandbags had to be filled, tied, and put into place. The former head of one of the biggest companies in Utah wanted to be helpful in his neighborhood. Some of the work was being directed by the bishop, and the bishop asked him to find the tie strings and tie sandbags. He found tie strings in many places, some of them on the ground, and he went around picking up the strings from the ground. It was an emergency. Someone had to do it.<br><h2><b>5. Love Others and Self.</b></h2><br>The fifth key to building self-esteem is the ability to love. The commandment given by the Savior was to love others and yourself. Am I secure enough in my love of myself to laugh at myself, to admit my mistakes, to graciously accept a compliment? Am I secure in my love of others to smile and say hello to a perfect stranger?<br><br>Years ago in seminary our class was taught:<br><br><i>I have to live with myself, and so</i><br><i>I want to be fit for myself to know.</i><br><i>I want to go out with my head erect.</i><br><i>I want to demand all men's respect.</i><br><i>I never can hide myself from me;</i><br><i>I see what others may never see.</i><br><i>I can never fool myself, and so,</i><br><i>Whatever happens, I want to be</i><br><i>Self-respecting and conscience free!</i><br><h2><b>6. Love God.</b></h2><br>The sixth and most essential key to self-esteem is the love of God. Mosiah reminds us, "How knoweth a man the master whom he has not served?" (Mosiah 5:13). In Paul's epistle to Titus he reminds us that there are many who "profess that they know God; but in the works they deny him" (Titus 1:16).<br><br>There is a key given to us: "And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us" (1 John 3:24). We can know that we know God, "And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him" (1 John 2:3–4).<br><br>There are many whose self-esteem has been devastated by the loss of loved ones, by divorce, by other personal misfortunes. Some carry an extra burden of guilt from grievous sins. Transgression is extremely devastating to self-esteem. After transgression usually comes rationalization and often lying. This is what makes justice so violent to the offending.<br><br>Fortunately we have the great principle of repentance whereby sins "as scarlet" can become "as white as snow" (Isaiah 1:18). I am grateful for this principle and pray none will hesitate to find the peace that comes from repentance. It is important to remember and never forget that all of us, male and female, were created in the image of God and created by God. Mankind is the noblest of all creations.<br><br>"What is man" asked the psalmist,<br><br><i>that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?</i><br><br><i>For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.</i><br><br><i>Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet.</i>[Psalms 8:4–6]<br><br>Frequently in my ministry, as I have been setting apart a stake Relief Society president or a stake Primary president, ordaining a bishop or a stake patriarch, or setting apart a stake president or a mission president, the distinct impression has come to me that the person on whose head I have laid hands was foreordained to that calling. The prophet Jeremiah had this assurance come to him from the Lord,<br><br><i>Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.</i>[Jeremiah 1:5]<br><br>Not all of us are called to leadership in the kingdom. Yet is there a greater work than that of teacher, father, mother? So it is that nobody is nobody. The seeds of divinity are in all of us. There will come a day when we will have to account to God for what we have done with that portion of divinity which is within each of us.<br><br>I testify that God loves each of us, warts and all. I testify that he knows each of our names. I testify that each of us has a potential in this life and beyond the grave that exceeds our fondest dreams. I testify through the gifts of the Holy Spirit that we are engaged in His holy work. I invoke the blessings of heaven upon all, and pray that we may come to know who we truly are, the sons and daughters of God. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>James E.

<h1>ne: The Demands of Discipleship - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Welcome to Brigham Young University, home of the famous Thistle Lake Marine Biology Station and Independent Student Newspaper Capital of the World! My name is Jeff Holland, and this is my wife, Pat. We deliver pizza, type term papers, coordinate family home evening groups, and play the national anthem every morning--Pat on the saxophone and I on the accordian. In our spare time we do outside consulting on Ninth East road repairs. Of course, when we grow weary and need to get away from it all, we hide out in the Harold B. Lee Library, usually in the classics section. We have found that students are reluctant to venture in there.<br><br>As a matter of fact Pat and I have been wondering how we might get you to study just a little more than you do. We wondered if, on the eve of another football season, this approach might help:<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>Hello, everybody! I'm Jeff Jackson, your play-by-play announcer. Welcome to the thrills and excitement of big-time college instruction! The Academic Broadcasting Network and the National Collegiate Academic Association are proud to bring you this live broadcast of another great college lecture. Today's lecture is a classic featuring Professor Hugh Nibley of Brigham Young University. Professor Nibley has a long tradition of success and currently ranks second in the nation in total verbiage. Helping to analyze and providing the color commentary for today's lecture will be my highly respected analyst, Patty Poindexter. Patty, how do you see today's lecture?<br><br><b>Patty:</b>Well, Jeff, the atmosphere is charged with anticipation, and the conditions are perfect for a great lecture. The classroom is well-lit, the temperature is about 74 degrees, the desks are arranged, and the chalkboard has been erased and washed. I just don't see how conditions could be any better for a great lecture.<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>Patty, you mentioned the desk formation. Professor Nibley seems to have arranged the desks in a semicircle facing the lectern. That is a brilliant stroke! What are your thoughts on that kind of formation?<br><br><b>Patty:</b>Jeff, Professor Nibley has been using that formation for several years. He is truly one of the great innovators and strategists in the conference. We are in for some kind of afternoon!<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>Thanks, Patty. We'll have prelecture interviews with the professor and with some of the students in just a minute, but first let's take time out for this message from the National Collegiate Academic Association.<br><br>The NCAA is proud of the academic accomplishments of the many students who participate in sanctioned lectures throughout the United States.<br><br>Though most of the national attention and publicity is focused on academics, the NCAA reminds our listening audience that many of the same students who excel in the classroom are also fine athletes in the academic off-season. The National Collegiate Academic Association salutes these fine students who also find time to participate in athletics and who may become the quarterbacks of tomorrow when their competitive academic careers are completed. Back now to live action with Patty and Professor Nibley.<br><br><b>Patty:</b>Professor Nibley, how have you prepared for today's big lecture?<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>Patty, we're going to stick with what has worked for us all season. This far into the academics semester, one dare not make any radical changes. So this past week I've concentrated on enunciation, voice inflection, transitions, and summaries. You might see a new wrinkle or two in there today, though.<br><br><b>Patty:</b>Professor, your record certainly speaks for itself. If my memory is correct, you lead the league in surprising transitions. Just one more question: What do you see as the deciding factor in today's lecture?<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>Patty, it's always important to be sound in the fundamentals. Content, delivery, and practical application are important, but the deciding factor today will be errors--grammatical errors. One can drill and drill on eliminating grammatical errors, but when one faces the pressure of an actual classroom situation, it's awfully difficult to predict what will happen.<br><br><b>Patty:</b>Okay, Professor, best of luck to you.<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>Thanks, Patty. There's the bell! The lecture is over! What an exciting finish! Patty, your thoughts on today's exciting lecture?<br><br><b>Patty:</b>Jeff, it was awesome! The transitions were powerful. The overheads were clear. The summary was a thing of beauty. He avoided prepositions at the end of sentences, and his voice inflection and gestures were excellent. It's easy to see why the professor ranks nationally in the top ten.<br><br>I see that we have Professor Nibley with us now. Professor, how do you feel about your performance today?<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>Patty, I'm really glad this one is over. There was a lot of pressure in that classroom today, but I thought the kids gave a great effort for the entire fifty minutes.<br><br><b>Patty:</b>Professor, what was going through your mind when you asked that thought-provoking question midway through the period, and no one seemed to have an answer?<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>I died a thousand deaths, but I knew those kids would come through because they have a lot of heart. This class really showed me something today!<br><br><b>Patty:</b>They surely did. Every student in the room took notes and fielded questions with a lot of pride and determination. What about the prospects for the rest of the semester?<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>Things look good at this point. I think we're rolling now, and I've already started reviewing notes for next week's lectures. We're all looking forward to the big showdown, which, of course, is finals week. That's where we'll be playing for all the marbles. Our task now is to maintain this kind of momentum.<br><br><b>Patty:</b>Right, Professor, and of course Jeff and I will be there covering all the action. Congratulations to you on another great lecture, and good luck to you and the students as you push towards finals. (Adapted from Robert G. Simpson, "Are We Overemphasizing Academics?"<i>Phi Delta Kappan,</i>November 1982, pp. 182–183)<br><br>Well, enough of such nonsense. We will now be pleased to hear from Sister Holland.<br><h2><b>Patricia T. Holland</b></h2><br>I know, as you all return to school, many of you are anxious and filled with some apprehension. I can understand that. From my small-town experience twenty years ago BYU seemed like a world beyond my reach. I just knew I would never be as bright or as popular or as fashionable or as successful as other students coming to the university. I was convinced I just couldn't compete! After twenty years I now plead with you: Please don't do that to yourself!<br><br>Though you may have some of the same fears we all have, may I urge you not to limit<i>your</i>growth because of a sense of excessive competition with others. We all know people who say, "I'm only going to do what I do well because I don't want to fall short," and when that is an ambition for superiority over others, we feel doubly inadequate when we fail.<br><br>Develop the courage to be imperfect while eagerly continuing your search for perfection. I use the word<i>courage</i>because it does take a great deal of strength to accept oneself as less than perfect while still seeing oneself as a person of genuine value. One must accept oneself as he or she is--good enough at<i>this</i>moment--in order to have confidence to move on.<br><br>May I tell you a story about Barbara D. Lockhart, shared with me by my friend and hers, Carolyn Rasmus. Barbara is a member of our faith who, in 1960 at the age of seventeen, was named to the Olympic speed-skating team. Of her race against the Russians she wrote:<br><br><i>The day of the 3000 meters was beautiful, and I was ready. The announcer called number 32, United States of America. My heart was pounding, and goose bumps rose up on top of goose bumps as I proudly came forward in my red, white, and blue, representing the USA. When the starter shot the gun you would have thought he shot me! I took off as if doing a 500 meter instead of a 3000, quickly settling into my stride and keeping up a very fast tempo. My feet felt as if they were barely touching the ice. I was flying! All those years of training and technique work all came together--every muscle, every move, my mind, body, and spirit all were working in total harmony. I could hear the crowd cheering--and then suddenly, I was shooting across the ice toward the crowd. As I was coming into the last lap, my feet slipped out from under me, and down I went. I scrambled back to my feet, back into my stride and did finish ahead of my pair. But I lost about 14 seconds and slipped from a possible second place to twenty-second in the standing.</i><br><br><i>Immediately after the race, I skated over to Klara Nestorova, a Soviet skater, who stood with tears steaming down her cheeks. She was in third place at the time I skated and, had I stayed on my feet, she would not have received an Olympic medal.</i>[Although she was weeping in my behalf, I did not feel sorry for myself.]<i>I felt elation, joy, excitement because I had skated so much better than I ever imagined I could--it was truly a peak experience. I knew I had done the very best I could do. People said to me, "All that work for nothing."</i>[But I say]<i>can you imagine competing in the Olympics, traveling the world over, making close friendships with people from other cultures, enjoying the fitness and health, the lessons learned from years of discipline, focused effort, persevering, failing, and trying again? Can you call that nothing?</i>[I did not win the gold or the silver or even the bronze that day]<i>but I was a winner! Many times in life no one else will be there to declare that you are a winner--that will have to come from within--when you recognize that you have done your very best at the moment!</i>[Barbara D. Lockhart, "Aspire to Excellence," talk delivered at Wilmington Delaware Stake Conference for Women, 16 April 1983]<br><br>Barbara Lockhart was a winner that day because she was competing only with herself. When you can finally learn to set your own goals, you don't spend time comparing yourself with the rest of the world, and you control your own sense of self-worth! When we tie our view of ourselves to beating others, we may trap ourselves into "winning at any cost." Excessive competition can result in cheating for high grades, bending rules for personal gain, and destroying compassion and kindness and forgiveness and love in our immodest--and sometimes immoral--quest for the top.<br><br>Of course there is a righteous motivation--from within, not without--that does encourage us to be the best we can. That inner striving comes from the Holy Spirit urging us to fulfill the very measure of our own personal, individual creation. It should be comforting to remember we each have a specific mission in life unlike any other.<br><br>President Kimball has said:<br><br><i>Remember, in the world before we came here, faithful women were given certain assignments while faithful men were foreordained to certain priesthood tasks. ... You are accountable for those things which long ago were expected of you just as those we sustain as prophets and apostles!</i>["The Role of Righteous Women,"<i>Ensign</i>, November 1979, p. 102]<br><br>May this be your most successful year ever, success achieved for the right reasons with the right motives leading to the right accomplishments. In that spirit we welcome you back to school. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><h2><b>Jeffrey R. Holland</b></h2><br>Just ten years ago this last summer we were newly back in Utah following graduate work in New England. We were living in Salt Lake City and were anxious to have our two children enjoy some of the community opportunities provided there. Our son Matt, then seven, wanted to participate in the summer tennis program offered in our neighborhood so we got him started. After about three days of instruction and practice he was ecstatic. He had the U.S. Open clearly in hand and was taking a very serious look at Wimbledon.<br><br>"Dad," he shouted, "I just love tennis. And I'm pretty darned good. And tomorrow--tomorrow they are going to put the net up!"<br><br>I wish to speak to you this morning about life with the net up. I will focus on what I think that means here at BYU, now, for this chapter of your life. But I believe the principles are true and universal. I think they will matter wherever you go and whatever you do--this year or any other year of your life. As with the net on a tennis court, the meaning, the significance, the accomplishment--indeed the fun--of your opportunity here depends on the discipline with which you stroke the BYU ball. You must hit it high enough and hard enough to clear the net, but it also has to be controlled--disciplined, if you will--to stay in bounds for the point. And, as Sister Holland has so beautifully suggested, your only real opponent is yourself. You are learning to play the game well, enthusiastically, skillfully, and your enjoyment increases with practice. I wish to speak of just three aspects of the discipline and control needed to be successful at BYU.<br><h2><b>"Take Pride in Your Principles"</b></h2><br>The most important discipline of all is that which you impose on yourself, that which is a function of your own will and your own integrity. When your choice reinforces the university's choices we unleash the highest possibilities for our collective experience here. We want you to be free in the very best gospel sense of freedom, free "to act and not be acted upon," as Lehi teaches in the Book of Mormon. The greatest opportunity will come when you agree at the beginning of this or any school year on what your personal goals are and how, with discipline, they can be achieved within the framework of the institution's goals.<br><br>I mentioned Thistle Lake, which was rather quickly formed up Spanish Fork Canyon last spring. A long time ago President George Brimhall, third president of BYU, made this application for the new students of BYU shortly after the turn of the twentieth century.<br><br>"Years ago," he wrote,<br><br><i>I was driving a buggy up Spanish Fork canyon. By my side sat my boy. A freight train came thundering along, and we speeded up the team for the purpose of enjoying the company of the great moving mass. The boy spoke up, saying, "Pa, look. There's a fellow going two directions at the same time." And sure enough, there was a man on top of the train, running to the rear. He was running west and the train was carrying him east.</i><br><br><i>The lad had heard me say that people could not go in two directions at the same time, and here was evidence against my assertion. I said, "Well, what is going to happen?" The boy replied, "Well, he will have to stop or be dumped off."</i><br><br><i>The man did stop and both he and the train sped on but it left a lesson with us. That warning might be given to you students. "Don't run in a direction opposite to that of our school, or you will be dumped off." The direction of the institution is toward the rising sun, the direction of a better school, a bigger school; those who remain with it must be in the direction of the bigger, better students. Lives of double direction are short and disastrous.</i>[George H. Brimhall,<i>Long and Short Range Arrows</i>(Provo, Utah: BYU Press, 1934), pp. 40–41]<br><br>That was three-quarters of a century ago, but we are still interested in trying to have that bigger, better school. The school's very first president, Karl G. Maeser, repeatedly asked that first generation of BYU students to "be yourself, but always your better self." That is the kind of freedom I want for you and for the university as a whole. I want us all to move toward the rising sun. Don't spend your time wondering whether you are on the right train. It is the right train, and we need every one of you for the journey.<br><br>At the start of each school year I find it necessary to speak of our Code of Honor and the significant "net" that it puts up for our time together. Notice that I refer to the Code of Honor, not simply dress and grooming standards. The latter are in some ways the<i>least</i>of the elements in a Code of Honor that addresses far more important issues of honesty, integrity, and virtuous Christian living. Nevertheless I am again forced to say something on the subject of dress and grooming this morning as one part of that code. Many of you have recently come from high school or home areas where styles, fashions, and behaviors ebb and flow in response to fads. In many cases, those fashions are not compatible with the pledge you made regarding your dress and appearance while attending BYU. This discrepancy has been apparent among a few of you this past week, especially at our dances. Some of the inappropriate fads are represented by "punk rock," "new wave," and "flashdance" appearance. These are expressions in the extreme and are not welcome nor acceptable for BYU students, whether those activities be on or off campus. And we really should not have to remind anyone that shorts, bare-midriffed blouses, tube tops, and the like, are simply not worn on the BYU campus. We have just seen too much immodest dress here this fall.<br><br>Almost all of you are doing wonderfully well. Ninety-nine percent look magnificent. And I know all will understand our concern for even a few who do not yet understand our hopes here. Please be clean and modest and disciplined in your behavior. Without being offensive, share our hopes with those few who might not be fully aware of our expectations. I will leave this subject with a thought from President Kimball: "[These guidelines] were not designed to create dissension or make you unhappy or angry. ... Your clothes do not have to be new ... , but they should be clean, modest, and neat. Be dignified in your outward appearance ... and in your inward morality. Take pride in your principles" ("On My Honor," 1978 Devotional Speeches of the Year [Provo, Utah: BYU Press, 1979], pp. 134–35).<br><br>But as I said, matters of external appearance are ancillary to the greater concerns of the Honor Code, which each of us pledges to uphold in coming here. I have already quoted two former presidents of the university. May I quote a third? My immediate predecessor, Dallin H. Oaks, may, as a justice of the Utah Supreme Court, now feel even more strongly about honesty than he did when he spoke from this podium more than a decade ago:<br><br><i>In speaking upon the subject of honesty and truthfulness I am keenly aware that most of our BYU students are honest and truthful, fulfilling the commandments to the best of their ability. But there are many who need reminding....</i><br><br><i>It is dishonest to write a check with insufficient funds in the bank to cover the check. The check, being a false representation of fact, is a lie. It is also a crime and deserves to be treated that way.</i><br><br><i>It is also dishonest to obtain merchandise on credit,</i>[including the use of]<i>a credit card, without knowing how you will pay the debt. At an aggravated level, when the individual, upon contracting a debt, has no intention of paying it, his obtaining merchandise by this means is the crime of obtaining property under false pretenses.</i><br><br><i>Similarly, it is dishonest for a student to run up a bill for rent, telephone services,</i>[television equipment,]<i>or other obligations, and then skip out, leaving roommates to carry the burden. It is dishonest to make a long-distance call and charge it to a nonexistent number. It is also dishonest and fraudulent to use the telephone to send</i>[coded]<i>messages that do not result in fair charges on the telephone bill....</i><br><br><i>Whenever I hear persons argue that</i>[these are]<i>only "little</i>[sins],<i>" I think of the criminal who approaches an employee and asked, "Would you help me steal your employer's property if I paid you one million dollars?" After a moment of thought, the surprised employee said that he supposed he would, for one million dollars. The criminal replied: "Well, I</i>[can only]<i>give you twenty dollars</i>[right now, but]<i>let's get started."</i><br><br><i>The employee angrily replied, "What do you take me for, a thief?"</i><br><br><i>"We have already established</i>[what you are],<i>" the criminal responded; "now we are just haggling over the price</i>[of your services]<i>."</i><br><br>"The qualities of honesty and truthfulness," President Oaks concludes,<br><br><i>are the foundation of all organizations and all personal relationships. ... How much trust would you place in a person who told you the truth ninety-five percent of the time? How much value is an employee who does not steal from his employer--ninety-five percent of the time? The ninety-five percenter is like a leaky bucket: the hole may be small, but it renders the entire vessel unworthy of its purpose. Unless the hole can be mended, the bucket is bound for the trash heap.</i>[Dallin H. Oaks, "Be Honest in All Behavior,"<i>Speeches of the Year</i>(Provo, Utah: BYU Press, 1972–73), pp. 85–88, 95]<br><br>Be honest in class and out, this year and always. Don't cheat. Don't plagiarize. Don't steal. Be decent and virtuous and true. If we can't teach that here, none of the other lessons matter. To paraphrase President McKay, no carefully combed head of hair can compensate for failure in the soul.<br><h2><b>"Use It or Lose It"</b></h2><br>May I move quickly to another form of discipline. The word<i>discipline</i>comes from the Latin<i>disciplina</i>which means "teaching or learning" and the root for that is<i>discipulus</i>which means<i>pupil.</i>Thus we speak of the various academic disciplines of the university and of the faculty and students who pursue them.<br><br>The court in which you have come to play and the contest you have chosen to undertake is that of Latter-day Saint higher education. This is a university, and you are invited to immerse yourself in developing your learning, and your love for learning, here. I have said before that there are less expensive ways to hold young adult conferences. Furthermore we could help you get dates, watch ball games, and stand in various and sundry lines without building and staffing what I believe to be the finest university in the world. You come here today as BYU students have for over a hundred years, committed to the proposition that "the glory of God is intelligence" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36) and that "whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection" (D&amp;amp;C 130:18). We come to the university above all to "seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118).<br><br>Study as if your life depended on it, for surely in the most important ways it does. You will have paid too much of your own and others' money if you do not take away from here the very best education we can provide you. Resist the temptation to idle your way through. Study first and then relax, when you can be more honorable and less troubled in doing so.<i>Discipline. Discipulus. Pupil.</i>Discipline your mind and your will and your habits. Set a course for yourself now that will make you successful in every private and public endeavor you pursue for the rest of your life. Get up in the morning and go to bed at night, not vice versa. Work hard. Go the extra mile along the remarkable pathway that is so generously provided you here. See the meaning now and avoid the lamentations later. I could be an independently wealthy man if I had a dollar for every freshman who wasted his first year, even in so noble a cause as waiting for a mission call. Far, far too many return to the university only to learn that like the great mark of the beast recorded in the book of Revelation, those D's and E's are forever inscribed on the forehead of their official academic transcript. Make every opportunity count--every class, every semester. Attend our forum and devotional series. They are some of the rarest opportunities BYU can afford, untried and unafforded at any other university in the country. As with every privilege we need to "use it or lose it."<br><br>There are treasures to find at BYU that may well never be our privilege to pursue again once we leave here. These include "great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures," to quote scripture, and it is your privilege to seek them out and claim them as your own.<br><br>With any luck you will, along with Barbara Sorensen Stoutner, even learn to love botany.<br><br><i>Teach me that in mitosis are two replications of chromosomes and in meiosis only one.</i><br><br><i>Teach me that there is secondary growth in dicotyledons but not in monocotyledons because monocotyledons do not have cambia.</i><br><br><i>Teach me that I can get a grade symbolizing a knowledge of botany if I study two hours out of class for every hour in.</i><br><br><i>Teach me that if I endure the semester,</i><br><br><i>I can graduate and never have to know about botany.</i><br><br><i>Teach me to marvel at the intricate difference between meiosis and mitosis.</i><br><br><i>Teach me to wonder in awe how a majestic tree developed from a tiny seed containing two cotyledons.</i><br><br><i>Teach me to know in humility that all of the textbooks of men cannot reveal the secrets contained in a tiny blade of grass.</i><br><br><i>Teach me to love botany, and a lifetime's search for knowledge will not be able to quench the thirst you created.</i><br><br>[Barbara Sorensen Stoutner, "Teach Me To Love Botany,"<i>Ensign</i>, July 1983, p. 7]<br><h2><b>"If Ye Have Love One to Another"</b></h2><br>I conclude with the most important discipline of all, connecting and converging and conveying the many meanings of all our other disciplines. I speak of discipleship, our devotion to the Father and Son and the gospel they brought, for it is the gospel of Jesus Christ which gives all ultimate meaning to the nets and controls and boundaries that mark the dimensions of the court on which we improve ourselves.<br><br>Every year as school starts, I worry through the days and nights, praying you will be safe and happy and successful. We want you to have friends and to feel welcome and to feel loved. And we want you to understand that only you can provide those guarantees to each other. In a world which has some strife and stress and disappointment, we will never have too much friendship or too many arms extended to bear us up and lead us forward. When Christ came to his final days with his disciples, he summarized all that he had said to them in one great reminder, fearing perhaps that when their own disappointments came or when pressures would increase, they might not be able to recall every commandment on every scroll and every teaching from every discourse. He then said, as if there were but one way to remember it all,<br><br><i>A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</i><br><br><i>By this shall all men know that ye are my disciple, if ye have love one to another.</i>[John 13:34–35]<br><br>The brotherly and sisterly expression of that love is the ultimate test of our loyalty to him. It is our highest form of discipline.<br><br>All of us have seen this special miracle work again and again, whether that be in our own lives, in the lives of our family, or in the lives of those with whom we've shared some experience. I remember vividly the dreadful circumstance into which a young lady had managed to fall several years ago. She was not a BYU student but was a Latter-day Saint, and yet her very life seemed to be disintegrating before our eyes. As a result of trying to play with the net down, trying to live without rules and without restraint, she was experiencing the moral and spiritual stupefaction of a broken marriage, illicit moral behavior, dark drug abuse, and finally physical violence. She was descending into a personal hell from which no one seemed to be able to retrieve her and from which she personally did not have the wish or the will to turn away.<br><br>Her mother and others who had great concern for her had been in contact with me. Her Church leaders had tried to help. All seemed to no avail. The weeks became months, and human life unraveled before our eyes.<br><br>Then something happened. A lifelong friend of this young woman contacted her and tried, with love, to open her eyes and touch her heart. When neither her eyes nor her heart seemed to be yielding, this friend, this sister in the family of God who understood Paul's reminder that when one member suffers all suffer with it, grabbed the lapels of her friend's heavy winter coat and shook it with all her might. She shook her with all the strength her 105 pounds could muster, and, sobbing, she said through her tears, "Look at yourself. Don't you see what you are becoming? Look at yourself! I can't stand it anymore. I love you, and you're breaking my heart." At that she let go of the lapels of the big heavy coat and with tears streaming from her eyes turned and ran away.<br><br>The young lady whose life was in such jeopardy later recalled for me her response to that encounter. She said, "I don't know exactly what happened in that moment. Perhaps I am not likely ever to know. I had been talked to by many people, and little of it had meant anything to me. But if I live to be a hundred, I will never forget what I saw with my eyes and heard with my ears as this my childhood friend looked at me with utter anguish and screamed into my soul, "I love you, and you are breaking my heart."<br><br>Today that girl is the beautiful, happy, safe, and productive young woman which she once had been and which surely God meant her to be. She has been remarkably successful in a graduate program at a very good university. She is fully active in the Church, and she is devoted to a life of responsibility and respectability--all because someone in her own way said at the right time and with the right intent that whatever disappointments there had been, these two were forever sisters and disciples of Christ. That stunning declaration not only changed a life, but it quite literally saved this one. We need such brothers and sisters nearby us.<br><br>We also need a Father in Heaven who stays by us in our times of necessity and fear. A great Christian writer once said, "God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our conscience, but shouts in our pains: it is His megaphone to rouse a deaf world" (C.S. Lewis,<i>The Problem of Pain</i>(New York: Macmillan, 1967), chapter 6, p. 81). We may find in our lives that God's love for us may also require a good firm grasp on our lapels.<br><br>"By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another" (John 13:35). May God bless us with controlled and disciplined lives during this coming year while we learn and grow and love together. This is a wonderful time in your life and this is a wonderful place to be. Good luck, with the net up, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Jeffrey R. Holland was president of Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 13 September 1983.</i></i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>e You, What Would I Do? - Gordon B. Hinckley - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My beloved friends, it's a very genuine pleasure and a great opportunity to be with you. It is always stimulating to look into the faces of so many young men and women. I pray for the guidance of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>I have now lived longer than the biblical three score and ten. To take a line from Psalms (90:9), I have spent my "years as a tale that is told," and, as is common with older people, the tendency is to lecture those who are younger. The fact is that I still feel young, with a love for life, its challenges, and its pleasures.<br><br>More than half a century has passed since I was a university student. My life has been rich with challenges and associations. I have wrestled with problems large and small. I have known something of discouragement and on a few occasions have felt the exhilaration of achievement. I feel a deep sense of gratitude for the marvelous and generous blessings of the Lord. Among these is the opportunity to be associated with his great cause and kingdom. A part of that is this tremendous university and this occasion to meet in council with you.<br><br>I excuse the deficiencies in this effort of speaking to you this morning by saying that I have been under tremendous pressures. I returned only yesterday from Santiago, Chile, after flying all night. We there dedicated the new temple. It was a marvelous experience. Prior to that were similar experiences in Atlanta, Samoa, Tonga, and other parts of the world. I think I have spoken to fifteen different congregations in the last ten days, scattered from California to Santiago, Chile, to Detroit, Michigan. Just ahead is the general conference, for which much preparation is needed. I do not have a speech writer. I have only the opportunity to pray and work. When I have concluded today, you may conclude that I should have prayed more and written less.<br><br>I bring you the love and the blessing of President Spencer W. Kimball, who as President of the Church came before this student body each fall until he was no longer able to do so. I feel his life epitomizes the virtues of which I am going to speak today.<br><br>I will try to put myself in your shoes at your age. I have titled my remarks, "If I were you, what would I do?" If President Holland, who is a man of dignity and a purist in all matters of English, never invites me to speak here again, I will understand why, and I think you will also as I mix in a few lines of doggerel, self-composed.<br><br><i>If I were you, what would I do?</i><br><i>I'd enjoy every day of my stay</i><br><i>On this campus of Brigham Young U.</i><br><br>What a unique and beautiful place this is! How rich and wonderful are your opportunities! You must realize that you are only a few of the very many young men and women of the Church across the world who would like to attend this great university. As the Church grows, as it surely will, the percentage of those who can come here will constantly diminish. Whether you recognize it or not, you are fortunate indeed to be here. Most of your education will be generously subsidized by all of the tithe-paying members of the Church. You relatively few are the beneficiaries of their contributions.<br><br>And so I hope your experiences here will be both challenging and pleasant. You will likely never have a greater opportunity for happiness. Cultivate good friends while you are here. Drink in the beauty of this campus--the sweeping lawns, the trees, the magnificent buildings, the mountains that rise to the east, and the quiet waters of the lake to the west. Be affirmative about your classes, and look upon the demands of your Church responsibilities as opportunities. Be happy with singing and dancing, enjoy football and basketball--yell when you win; cry, if you wish, when you lose.<br><br>Experience the fun and the hard work; both are part of the joy of being alive when you are young and healthy, and your chin is high with a smile on your face.<br><br>These are golden years. Do you know what<i>alma mater</i>means? It means<i>dear mother,</i>with all of the best that that connotes. You are here as a much loved part of her family. Enjoy your days, every one of them, and, when you leave and the years pass with the cadence of the seasons, may you look back with fondness and smiles to happy times on the magnificent campus of your beloved alma mater.<br><br><i>And so, if I were you, what would I do?</i><br><i>I'd enjoy every day of my stay</i><br><i>On this campus of Brigham Young U.</i><br><br><i>If I were you, what would I do?</i><br><i>I'd drink of the nectar of knowledge,</i><br><i>A great, full draft of its richest brew.</i><br><br>Do you ever stop to think that in the cumulative learning of this dedicated and gifted faculty, and in the books of the marvelous library of this university, you have available to you the wisdom, the knowledge, the learning of all of the generations of men and women who have gone before you?<br><br>Never again in all of your lives will you have an equal opportunity to learn so much in so brief a period of time. The marketplace into which you will go with your skills when you finish here will be fiercely competitive. It will demand of you the very best that you have to give. You are here to learn so that you might go forth to serve. I know that at times it's a grind. I know that it becomes exhausting. I know that it can be terribly frustrating and discouraging. But it also can be so wonderful and so fruitful.<br><br>Said Solomon, "With all of thy getting get understanding" (Proverbs 4:7). As you study, put a hammerlock on those technical details you wrestle so hard to conquer. There is nothing in all the world so satisfying as a task well done. There is no reward so pleasing as that which comes with the mastery of a difficult problem.<br><br>What a tremendous blessing it is to be able to study--to sit down with a book, to shut out the world around you, and to concentrate on the ideas that move before you as you read sentences and paragraphs and pages, the essence of which becomes a part of your ever-growing store of knowledge.<br><br>Charles Kettering, the man who did so much to put together General Motors, once said: "The opportunities of man are limited only by his imagination. But so few have imagination that there are 10,000 fiddler to only one composer."<br><br>A man who is driven by much pressure said to me the other day, "If only I had time to read a good book." Here you have the time; in fact, the disciplines of your studies demand that you take the time to read one good book after another. There will not again be such an opportunity.<br><br><i>And so, if I were you, what would I do?</i><br><i>I'd drink of the nectar of knowledge,</i><br><i>A great, full draft of its richest brew.</i><br><br><i>If I were you, what would I do?</i><br><i>I'd walk humbly with God and my Savior, too.</i><br><br><i>O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish.</i><br><br><i>But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God.</i>[2 Nephi 9:28–29]<br><br>So declared Jacob, the son of Nephi, long ago.<br><br>And Alma, who had been stricken dumb by an angel because of his wicked arrogance, speaking out of that harsh lesson said to his own son, Helaman:<br><br><i>O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God....</i><br><br><i>Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good; yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God.</i>[Alma 37:35, 37]<br><br>He concluded by counseling Helaman, "Look to God and live" (Alma 37:47).<br><br>The Psalmist declared,<br><br><i>But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord God.</i>[Psalms 73:28]<br><br>The Lord, through revelation in the year 1837, instructed the first of the apostles in this dispensation, giving them a great promise of significance to each of us. Said he:<br><br><i>Be thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 112:10]<br><br>It is your opportunity, yes, it is your responsibility while here, to cultivate a spiritual dimension in your lives as you train your minds in secular matters. Every student in this great and unique university may come to know--in fact, he or she has the obligation to come to know for himself or herself--that God our Eternal Father lives and that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior and the Redeemer of mankind.<br><br><i>And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.</i>[John 17:3]<br><br><i>And so, if I were you, what would I do?</i><br><i>I'd walk humbly with God and my Savior, too.</i><br><i>If I were you, what would I do?</i><br><i>I'd fall in love with a girl named Sue,</i><br><i>Or a boy named Lou,</i><br><i>And plan for the day we'd be married,</i><br><i>We two.</i><br><br>The names of Sue and Lou are not important, but the idea is. As tens of thousands can testify, some of them now elderly men and women, this is a wonderful place to start the process that leads to eternal marriage. Mating is a process of selection. There are here to choose from, thousands of boys and thousands of girls. Keep yourselves clean from the stain of the world. Keep yourselves neat and attractive and trim. Keep yourselves worthy of the best to be had. You will find none better than those on this campus. Keep yourselves worthy of marriage in the house of the Lord. There is no adequate substitute for it. Let the stars of romance dance in your eyes and fever of love touch your brain. But keep your feet on the ground and discipline your emotions with the knowledge that the God of heaven who loves you invites you to the greatest of blessings for time and all eternity, but that he also exacts a price if they be yours.<br><br>Cleanliness is next to godliness. The Psalmist declared, "Truly God is good ..., even to such as are of a clean heart" (Psalms 73:1).<br><br><i>And so, if I were you, what would I do?</i><br><i>I'd fall in love with a girl named Sue,</i><br><i>Or a boy named Lou,</i><br><i>And plan for the day we'd be married,</i><br><i>We two.</i><br><br><i>If I were you, what would I do?</i><br><i>I'd live with my love with integrity true--</i><br><i>And welcome our children, many or few.</i><br><br>We believe in chastity before marriage and in fidelity after marriage.<br><br>Under the gospel plan marriage is a companionship, with equality between the partners. We walk side by side with respect, appreciation, and love one for another. There can be nothing of inferiority or superiority between the husband and wife in the plan of the Lord. I am satisfied that our Father in Heaven loves his daughters as much as he loves his sons, and any man who demeans or belittles his wife affronts her Father in Heaven.<br><br>If husbands and wives would only give greater emphasis to the virtues that are to be found in one another and less to the faults, there would be fewer broken hearts, fewer tears, fewer divorces, and much more happiness in the homes of our people.<br><br>Marriage is for companionship, and it is also for children. Much has been said on this campus about birth control. I like to think of the positive side of the equation, of the meaning and sanctity of life, of the purpose of this estate in our eternal journey, of the need for the experiences of mortal life under the great plan of God our Father, of the joy that is to be found only where there are children in the home, of the blessings that come of good posterity. When I think of these values and see them taught and observed, then I am willing to leave the question of numbers to the man and the woman and the Lord.<br><br><i>And so, if I were you, what would I do?</i><br><i>I'd live with my love with integrity true--</i><br><i>And welcome our children, many or few.</i><br><br><i>If I were you, what would I do</i><br><i>If courtship and marriage didn't come through?</i><br><i>I'd fret, but I'd say, "There's no time to stew.</i><br><i>Get busy. Find something important to do."</i><br><br>It would be a beautiful world if every girl had the privilege of marriage to a good young man whom she could look upon with pride and gladness as her companion in time and eternity, hers alone to love and cherish, to respect and help. What a wonderful world it would be if every young man were married to a wife in the house of the Lord, one at whose side he would stand as protector, provider, husband, and companion.<br><br>But it doesn't work out that way in every case. There are some who, for reason unexplainable, do not have the opportunity of marriage. To you I should like to say a word or two. Don't waste your time and wear out your lives wandering about in the wasteland of self-pity. God has given you talents of one kind or another. God has given you the capacity to serve the needs of others and bless their lives with your kindness and concern. Reach out to someone in need. There are so very many out there.<br><br>Add knowledge to knowledge. Refine your mind and skills in a chosen field of discipline. Never in the history of the world have women been afforded such opportunities in the professions, in business, in education, and in all of the honorable vocations of life. Do not feel that because you are single God has forsaken you. I repeat his promise quoted earlier, "Be thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers."<br><br>The world needs you. The Church needs you. So very many people and causes need your strength and wisdom and talents. The time you are spending in this university is a tremendous investment. It can be planned in such a way as to yield satisfying dividends in the future.<br><br><i>And so, if I were you, what would I do?</i><br><i>If courtship and marriage didn't come through?</i><br><i>I'd fret, but I'd say, "There's no time to stew.</i><br><i>Get busy. Find something important to do."</i><br><br>To conclude this mixture of doggerel and scripture and counsel, if I were you, what would I do?<br><br><i>By now I'd just say, "Good-bye and adieu,"</i><br><i>With a prayer in my heart for each one of you.</i><br><br>I give you my love as one of your brethren. I thank you as part of a great and marvelous generation. I testify of God, your Father and mine, and of his Only Begotten Son, your Savior and my Redeemer, and invoke upon you as a servant of the Lord every good and choice blessing, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Gordon B.

My beloved brothers and sisters, I always rejoice at the opportunity to visit this campus. It is truly an inspiration to be in your presence. I love the youth of the Church. I have great confidence in you. It is my belief that the Lord has held many of you in reserve in the spirit world to come to earth at this particular time when temptations are the greatest and strength of character is most needed.<br><br>The Lord loves you and has favored you with a royal birthright.<br><br>We have just completed another glorious conference of the Church. We are all thankful to the Lord for the blessing of strength given to President Kimball and President Romney which enabled them to be present in two sessions of conference. We are thankful for the inspiration and counsel given by the General Authorities who spoke. I hope you will take occasion to review the wisdom and counsel of their messages.<br><h2><b>The Product of My Thoughts</b></h2><br>To introduce my theme today, I want to tell you, in his own words, of a life-changing experience that happened to President George Albert Smith when he was a boy. His own words are as follows:<br><br><i>As a child, thirteen years of age, I went to school at the Brigham Young Academy. . . . I cannot remember much of what was said during the year that I was there, but there is one thing that I will probably never forget. . . . Dr. [Karl G.] Maeser one day stood up and said:</i><br><br><i>"Not only will you be held accountable for the things you do, but you will be held responsible for the very thoughts you think." Being a boy, not in the habit of controlling my thoughts very much, it was quite a puzzle to me what I was to do, and it worried me. In fact, it stuck to me just like a burr. About a week or ten days after that it suddenly came to me what he meant. I could see the philosophy of it then. All at once there came to me this interpretation of what he had said: Why of course you will be held accountable for your thoughts, because when your life is completed in mortality, it will be the sum of your thoughts. That one suggestion has been a great blessing to me all my life, and it has enabled me upon many occasions to avoid thinking improperly, because I realize that I will be, when my life's labor is complete, the product of my thoughts.</i>[<i>Sharing the Gospel with Others</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1948), pp. 62–63]<br><br>Thoughts lead to acts, acts lead to habits, habits lead to character--and our character will determine our eternal destiny.<br><br>King Benjamin understood this. In the next-to-last verse of his great discourse recorded in the Book of Mormon, he states:<br><br><i>And finally, I cannot tell you all the things whereby ye may commit sin; for there are diverse ways and means, even so many that I cannot number them.</i>[Mosiah 4:29]<br><br>Then in the last verse he counsels that we must watch ourselves and our thoughts (see Mosiah 4:30)<br><br>When Christ appeared in America following His resurrection, He stated:<br><br><i>Behold, it is written by them of old time, that thou shalt not commit adultery;</i><br><br><i>But I say unto you, that whosoever looketh on a woman, to lust after her, hath committed adultery already in his heart.</i><br><br><i>Behold, I give unto you a commandment, that ye suffer none of these things to enter into your heart.</i>[3 Nephi 12:27–29]<br><br>"Enter into your heart"--why, of course, for, as the scripture states: "As he thinketh in his heart, so is he" (Proverbs 23:7).<br><br>So critical is it that we understand the necessity of controlling our thoughts that President Spencer W. Kimball devoted a whole chapter to it in his book<i>The Miracle of Forgiveness</i>. The chapter caption "As a Man Thinketh" is the title of a book by James Allen, which President Kimball recommended. He quoted from this book three times. One quotation stated:<br><br><i>A man does not come to the almshouse or the jail by the tyranny of fate or circumstance, but by the pathway of groveling thoughts and base desires. Nor does a pure-minded man fall suddenly into crime by stress of mere external force; the criminal thought had long been secretly fostered in the heart, and the hour of opportunity revealed its gathered power. Circumstance does not make the man; it reveals him to himself.</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1969, p. 105]<br><br>President Kimball also quotes President David O. McKay, who said:<br><br><i>The thought in your mind at this moment is contributing, however infinitesimally, almost imperceptibly to the shaping of your soul, even to the lineaments of your countenance. . . . even passing and idle thoughts leave their impression.</i>[Ibid.]<br><br>The mind has been likened to a stage on which only one act at a time can be performed. From one side of the wings the Lord, who loves you, is trying to put on the stage of your mind that which will bless you. From the other side of the wings the devil, who hates you, is trying to put on the stage of your mind that which will curse you.<br><br>You are the stage manager--you are the one who decides which thought will occupy the stage. Remember, the Lord wants you to have a fullness of joy like His. The devil wants all men to be miserable like unto himself. You are the one who must decide whose thoughts you will entertain. You are free to choose--but you are not free to alter the consequences of those choices. You will be what you think about--what you consistently allow to occupy the stage of your mind.<br><br>Sometimes you may have difficulty driving off the stage of your mind a certain evil thought. To drive it off, Elder Boyd K. Packer suggests that you sing an inspirational song of Zion, or just think on its words. Elder Bruce R. McConkie recommends that, after the opening song, you might preach a sermon to yourself. In fact, he says the finest sermons he has ever preached have been preached to himself.<br><br>We should not invite the devil to give us a stage presentation. Usually with our hardly realizing, he slips into our thoughts. Our accountability begins with how we handle the evil thought immediately after it is presented. Like Jesus, we should positively and promptly terminate the temptation. We should not allow the devil to elaborate with all his insidious reasoning.<br><br>It is our privilege to store our memories with good and great thoughts and bring them out on the stage of our minds at will. When the Lord faced His three great temptations in the wilderness, He immediately rebutted the devil with appropriate scripture which He had stored in His memory.<br><h2><b>"Look unto Me in Every Thought"</b></h2><br>The Lord said, "Look unto me in every thought" (D&amp;amp;C 6:36). Looking unto the Lord in every thought is the only possible way we can be the manner of men and women we ought to be.<br><br>The Lord asked the question of His disciples, "What manner of men ought ye to be?" He then answered His own question by saying, "Even as I am" (3 Nephi 27:27). To become as He is, we must have Him on our mind--constantly in our thoughts. Every time we partake of the sacrament, we commit to "always remember him" (Moroni 4:3, 5:2; D&amp;amp;C 20:77, 79).<br><br>If thoughts make us what we are, and we are to be like Christ, then we must think Christlike thoughts. Let me repeat that: If thoughts make us what we are, and we are to be like Christ, we must think Christlike thoughts.<br><br>Paul, en route to Damascus to persecute the Saints, saw a light from heaven and heard the voice of the Lord. Then Paul asked a simple eight-word question--and the persistent asking of the same question changed his life. "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?" (Acts 9:6). The persistent asking of that same question can also change your life. There is no greater question that you can ask in this world. "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?" I challenge you to make that the uppermost question in your life.<br><br>In his book<i>Youth and the Church</i>, Elder Harold B. Lee included a chapter entitled "Lord, What Wilt Thou Have Me Do?" He began the chapter by relating this experience:<br><br><i>Some time ago I heard a leader in a high Church position explain his method of endeavoring to arrive at just and equitable decisions in his council meetings. He explained that as problems would be presented, he would frequently ask himself, "As measured by the record of the Master's teaching, just what would He do in this given situation, or just how would He answer this question or solve this problem?"</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1945, p. 49]<br><br>While he doesn't mention who the man was, that man in due time, would become the President of the Church, President David O. McKay.<br><br>My friend Tom Anderson told the following story:<br><br><i>There was a little crippled boy who ran a small newsstand in a crowded railroad station. He must have been about twelve years old. Every day he would sell papers, candy, gum, and magazines to the thousands of commuters passing through the terminal.</i><br><br><i>One night two men were rushing through the crowded station to catch a train. One was fifteen or twenty yards in front of the other. It was Christmas Eve. Their train was scheduled to depart in a matter of minutes.</i><br><br><i>The first man turned a corner and in his haste to get home to a Christmas cocktail party plowed right into the little crippled boy. He knocked him off his stool, and candy, newspapers, and gum were scattered everywhere. Without so much as stopping, he cursed the little fellow for being there and rushed on to catch the train that would take him to celebrate Christmas in the way he had chosen for himself.</i><br><br><i>It was only a matter of seconds before the second commuter arrived on the scene. He stopped, knelt, and gently picked up the boy. After making sure the child was unhurt, the man gathered up the scattered newspapers, sweets, and magazines. Then he took his wallet and gave the boy a five-dollar bill. "Son," he said, "I think this will take care of what was lost or soiled. Merry Christmas!"</i><br><br><i>Without waiting for a reply the commuter now picked up his briefcase and started to hurry away. As he did, the little crippled boy cupped his hands together and called out: "Mister, Mister!"</i><br><br><i>The man stopped as the boy asked, "Are you Jesus Christ?"</i><br><br><i>By the look on his face, it was obvious the commuter was embarrassed by the question. But he smiled and said, "No, son. I am not Jesus Christ, but I am trying hard to do what He would do if He were here."</i><br><br><i>And that, my friend, is what it means to be a Christian, even on Christmas Eve. It's a matter of impersonation.</i>[<i>American Opinion,</i>December 1971, pp. 13–14]<br><h2><b>What Would Jesus Do?</b></h2><br>Some years ago Charles Sheldon wrote a book entitled<i>In His Steps.</i>It is perhaps one of the greatest best-sellers in American history. It tells the story of a small group of people within a Christian congregation who took a pledge. The pledge was that for an entire year they earnestly and honestly would not do anything without first asking the question, "What would Jesus do?" After asking themselves that question, they were to follow Jesus exactly as they knew how, no matter what the results. The book tells what happened and how their lives were revolutionized.<br><br>Just before he died, Charles Sheldon wrote a small sequel to his book entitled<i>In His Steps Today.</i>It tells of Mr. and Mrs. Ralph Ward and their four children. Their two oldest children, George and Alice, attended college while their two youngest, John and Mary, were in high school. Mr. Ward was an official in a railroad office, and Mrs. Ward was prominent in the social, church, and literary life of the city.<br><br>One morning as the family was eating breakfast, Mr. Ward told of coming across a book in the library which he and Mrs. Ward had read some twenty-five years earlier, just before their marriage. It was entitled<i>In His Steps, or What Would Jesus Do?</i><br><br>He wondered if the plan were practical, if it really worked. He knew of a large number of people who had taken the pledge to try to act as Jesus who had had some interesting experiences. He knew the children were eager to try experiments in the chemical laboratory and in other fields and wondered if they would be willing to conduct an experiment in the world of conduct.<br><br>He asked them if just for that day, for example, they would be willing to do nothing without first asking, "What would Jesus do?" and then try to do the same.<br><br>There was embarrassing silence around the table. They were a Christian family, but the subject was unusual. Finally, the silence was broken by John, "the irrepressible," as the others called him: "If we take the pledge, what's the matter with you and mother taking it too? You were talking to us yesterday about the bad example the old people set to the young generation. How about you and mother, Dad?"<br><br>The father agreed. Mrs. Ward said she would join in the pledge with the understanding that each one would give it an honest and sincere trial.<br><br>Perhaps the members of their family did not know it, but this event was to make history for all of them. The pledge was to run until ten o'clock that night. Then they were to meet at that time to share their experiences of the day, holding back nothing.<br><br>I wish I had time to tell you all of their experiences. Let me quote the parents, tell what happened to the younger ones, and consider the final question raised by Mr. Ward.<br><br>First, let's hear from Mr. Ward:<br><br><i>"My first experience came to me as I went into my office this morning, and . . . saw Crawford of the auditing department. He was very much put out yesterday when he accused me of backing into his car out in front of the office, and bending a fender. I told him he had parked his car at such an angle that I couldn't get out without hitting it. We both became angry. This morning I went in, asked his pardon, and offered to buy him a new fender. It did us both good. . . .</i><br><br><i>"This afternoon out at the golf course, while I was putting my things back into my locker, two of the members of the club came in and took flasks out of their lockers, drank, and offered some to the rest of us. This has been going on for a long time against the rules of the club and the laws of the state, but no one has ever enforced them. It seemed to me that if Jesus saw a crime being committed, he would consider it his duty as a good citizen to prevent it. I went to the chairman of the House Committee and reported the breaking of the rules, which has raised a storm.</i><br><br><i>"Several of the members came to me this evening down at the literary club, and threatened to blackball at me the next election for directors if I did not withdraw my charges against the drinkers. More will come from this. But what would Jesus do? It has been an interesting day."</i><br><br>Now let's hear from Mrs. Ward:<br><br><i>"I really did not know what following Jesus might mean, but my story has to do with the action of our women's Board of Directors in renting a part of our building to certain parties who are allowing dancing of a questionable nature to go on, together with card games that are practically nothing but gambling.</i><br><br><i>"I have known of this for some time as all the women do, but did not want to be unpopular by objecting. At the directors' meeting today, however, I expressed my opinion and objection. The club is in debt, and the amusement concessions bring in big rent. I am the only member of the board to file a protest. It will mean--"Mrs. Ward paused, and there was a moment of silence.</i><br><br>Finally, let's hear from the younger ones, John and Mary, with Mary leading out:<br><br><i>"We went to an entertainment this evening. A lot of the girls at the high school had been to see it, and they told John and me that it was grand. But I'd rather John told what happened."</i><br><br><i>John seemed to be unusually reluctant to relate their experiences. Finally he spoke in a subdued tone that was unlike his usual loud and assertive manner.</i><br><br><i>"Well, after it began," he said, "I thought it was one of those foolish things that was just for--well, just entertainment. Then I remembered what you said one day, Mother, about not wanting Mary and me to go to any entertainment that we wouldn't invite you or father to see. Well, it got pretty vulgar, and--"</i><br><br><i>Another silence was around the table. Mrs. Ward looked at the boy with a new expression, as if some very rare experience were being related--as indeed it was.</i><br><br><i>The boy went on slowly: "Just then Mary nudged me and whispered, 'Let's get up and go out!' Honest, I thought it would be a [strange] thing to do, but then when I asked 'What would Jesus do?' it seemed all right. So we got up, treading on a lot of feet in the row where we had been sitting."</i><br><br><i>"On our way out," broke in Mary, "I said to John, 'Let's do one more thing. Let's tell the manager why we are going out.' John said, 'All right, and let's tell him to give us our money back because we did not pay for that kind of entertainment.' You never will see a more surprised man than Mr. Rondus when we told him how we felt!"</i><br><br><i>"Surprised isn't the word," interrupted John. "He was flabbergasted! When I told him we thought he ought to refund our money, he didn't say a word, but forked the money right over. Do you think we did what Jesus would do?"</i><br><br><i>Mrs. Ward had a tear in her eye. She reached over and stroked the boy's head. "A thing like that never happened in this town before. Well, we certainly have had some new experiences."</i><br><br><i>"Worthwhile, don't you think? But can we keep it up?" questioned Mr. Ward.</i><br><br><i>The question provoked a discussion around the Ward table that lasted into the next morning.</i><br><br><i>What do you think?</i>[Charles M. Sheldon,<i>In His Steps Today</i>(Litchfield, Ill.: Sunshine Press, 1948), pp. 22–24, 29–31]<br><h2><b>Walking in His Way</b></h2><br>I began my remarks this morning by discussing how we are accountable for our thoughts and how we are what we think about. I have concluded by affirming that our thoughts should be on the Lord. We should think on Christ.<br><br>I testify to you that there is no greater, more thrilling, and more soul-ennobling challenge than to try to learn of Christ and walk in His steps. Our model, Jesus Christ, walked this earth as "the Exemplar." He is our Advocate with the Father. He worked out the great atoning sacrifice so we could have a fullness of joy and be exalted in accordance with His grace and our repentance and righteousness. He did all things perfectly and commands that we be perfect even as He and His Father are perfect (see 3 Nephi 12:48).<br><br>"What would Jesus do?" or "What would He have me do?" are paramount personal questions of this life. Walking in His way is the greatest achievement of life. That man or woman is most truly successful whose life most closely parallels that of the Master.<br><br>I know that the Lord lives. I know that He loves us. I know that apart from Him no one can succeed, but as a partner with Him no one can fail.<br><br>I know that God can make a lot more out of our lives than we can.<br><br>That we may all have the moral courage from this moment forward to more fully strive each day to think on Christ, learn of Him, walk in His steps, and do what He would have us do is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Ezra Taft Benson was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 1 October 1983.</i></i><br><br><i>©Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>Your Thoughts” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As President Holland mentioned our neighborhood association in Bountiful, a thought went through my mind. You know how great he is; I'm not sure you know how great his wife Pat is. Picture with me for the moment the street where the Hollands lived and we live in Bountiful. It is up against the mountains and crosses one of the canyons where it goes down and then up. Also picture me jogging about 5:30 or 6:00 in the morning. I see two forms in front of me. As I get closer, I see that they are a man and a woman. As I get closer still, I see that the woman is pushing the man up the hill. Soon I am close enough to hear him say, "But Pat, I'd rather go back and sleep. I don't want to be healthy."<br><br>She is saying, "Come on, Jeff, I know you can do it." And so she pushes him up the hill. It really was almost that way. They are great friends and it is good to be here with them and with you.<br><h2><b>Respect for BYU</b></h2><br>I have a great respect for Brigham Young University. I didn't attend school here. In the day when I wanted to be an engineer, BYU didn't have an engineering school. At least they didn't have one with the reputation that it has now, and so I didn't attend. We have four daughters who have gone to school here, and I assume a fifth one will when she finishes up at Ricks. My wife also attended here. I have great respect for you. I have been in enough places in the Church throughout the world in the last eleven and a half years to know that from the ranks of this institution have come and will come some of the great leaders of the Church, of communities, of government, of business, and--I suppose more importantly--many of the solid families of the Church.<br><br>I think your opportunities are unlimited. I think the opportunities that you have are bounded only by what you may impose, by either your willingness or unwillingness to pay the price of success.<br><h2><b>Signs of the Times</b></h2><br>We live in a day like no other. Those of you who review the scriptures know that the signs of the times are around us, and the prophecies of men of old have unfolded or are unfolding. These are the days preceding the Second Coming of the Master. I've made some observations of my own as a member of the Bishopric, involved in things for which we have responsibility. For instance, a sign of the times, if you will: In the decade of the seventies, 1970–80, somewhere in the world the Church built about 2,000 chapels. That's in a ten-year period. During 1981 and 1982 following that decade, we built somewhere in the world almost 2,000 chapels in two years. And we have more than 1,000 in some process right now. You've read of the temples that have been dedicated, four already this year, one this week, the Tahitian Temple; the first of December, another one in Mexico City. I suppose that next year there will be five or six temples dedicated somewhere in the world. As you know, the great work of the Millennium is the work that will be done in temples. It seems to me that there is a preparation going on.<br><br>There are many wonderful things happening, but there is also something I would like to address this morning that I hope will have your attention. This is also a time of danger. This is a time to be careful, as you have never been careful before. It is a time to be on guard. Because this is the time, as I read the scriptures, referred to when "men's hearts shall fail them" (Luke 21:26; D&amp;amp;C 45:26; 88:91). This is a time when even the very elect will be deceived. This is a time when some will not have the courage to stand for what is right. This is a time when there will be a complacency and taking for granted of many gospel principles. This is a time when many--I suppose some among your number--will pick and choose the commandments they will keep, and others they will put aside for the moment. This is the time when Satan is unusually cunning and effective. I think he entraps many, many of us here today, without our knowing it. It is a time of trial. I have learned that trials come to children and teenagers and university students and parents, prophets, and apostles. I weep inside as I watch the trials of President Kimball. Trials are a part of everyone's life.<br><h2><b>The Ladder of Faith and Testimony</b></h2><br>With all of this there is hope because I'm convinced that there is a spirit of revelation available to all of us, available to guide us in our trials. As you face your trials and what life may bring you, may I suggest one thing to remember. When you are in tune with the Spirit, you can handle any problem. I don't want to make you think that those who are in tune with the Spirit don't have problems. Everyone has them. But, when you are in tune with the Spirit, you are able to cope with the situation. When you aren't, and to the degree you aren't, then things can become unglued and come apart at the seams and you lose your composure.<br><br>I know it is a fact of life that all of us here this morning vary in the degree of our testimony. Not everyone here has the same strength of faith and testimony. There are those of you who are unusually strong, spiritually speaking. Others of us may be up and down the ladder. Sometimes we become discouraged if our strength and faith are not as someone else's seem to be. Sometimes we feel less important, less capable. May I suggest to you that I do not think it matters where you are on the ladder of faith and testimony. What I think matters is which way you are moving on the ladder. There are many great and wonderful people whose testimonies are just beginning to flower. They are on the lower rungs of the ladder, but they are moving up, and that is the thing that is important. There are others (some of you returned missionaries may want to keep this in mind) who have peaked out and who have begun to taper and slip somewhat in their faith. That is when I would get nervous. That is when I would become concerned. Which way you are moving is what is important.<br><br>This is the process of purification, of sanctification, this process of improving and increasing in faith and testimony. Now, as some of us may be waiting for blessings to come to us, let us remember another principle. Moroni taught in the book of Ether something that ofttimes we forget. There are those who are constantly waiting for things to happen. They are waiting for blessings to come, not understanding what that great prophet taught. Moroni taught in the twelfth chapter of Ether that first we have an evidence of our faith and a trial of our faith, and then the blessing comes. We don't receive blessings to strengthen our faith, according to Moroni. We receive blessings because of our faith. Eternal life is the blessing of the faithful.<br><br>Now a thought this morning that has to do with this sanctification and purification process. Developing purity of thought is as vital and as important a part of the sanctification process as anything I know about. President George Q. Cannon, a former counselor in the First Presidency of the Church, said the following:<br><br><i>If a man be pure in thought, he will be correspondingly pure in action, but if he allows his mind to roam in unrestricted freedom through the various avenues of evil, or to dwell unchecked upon the contemplation of forbidden indulgences, it will not be long before his feet tread those paths and his hand plucks the tempting, but deceitful fruit. Once the tempter gains the citadel of your heart, his power is very great and there is no knowing to what excesses of folly and crime he may incite his unhappy victim.</i>[<i>Gospel Truth</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1974), p. 200]<br><br>The destructive forces of Satan are becoming increasingly more effective in their relentless pursuit of the hearts and minds of men and women everywhere. Many<i>quite innocently,</i>and let me emphasize quite innocently, have been led to habits that are gaining a stranglehold on some of the very elite in the army of the Lord. I fear that there are some here this morning who are far less effective and far less satisfied with themselves than they could be or would be if they weren't so afflicted. Many of you may be victims and may not realize it.<br><h2><b>Arizona Reservoirs</b></h2><br>I would like to use an analogy that I used a few years ago because I think it makes the prime point I want to make. In east central Arizona there are some high and often snow packed mountains. We refer to them as the White Mountains. From this fountainhead stem most of the major water-producing streams that fill the agricultural valleys, the agricultural needs, and the domestic needs of central Arizona. From these mountains comes the water supply for the homes in the city of Phoenix. In the wintertime the mountains are covered with snow, ofttimes many feet in depth. The streams, as they begin here, run cool and clear, filled with delicious life-giving water. The streams run many miles in an unpolluted condition as they move down the mountains, through the valleys, eventually to empty into great reservoirs built to store the liquid during periods of drought.<br><br>There are also in eastern Arizona many high-grade ore deposits, which are and have been mined for many years, copper being one of the principle metals. Some of the streams which originate in the White Mountains run through the mining towns, and their water is used by the smelters in the processing of ore. The waste from this process in some cases finds its way back into the streams, causing discoloration and the addition of harmful elements that make the water unfit for human consumption. These streams also empty into the great reservoirs.<br><br>There are seasons of the year when there are cloudbursts in the mountains upstream from the dam. The heavens literally open up and discharge their contents. On these occasions, large amounts of soil are eroded; brush and sometimes trees are also washed down the rivers into the reservoirs. These reservoirs have the unusual capacity of holding all that is put in them: the cool, clean, clear, and delicious water coming from the glistening snow pack, as well as the polluted water from the industries and the brown, silt-filled waters resulting from the summer thunderstorms. All of it accumulates behind the huge rock and concrete dams.<br><br>As we said, part of the water that is held behind these dams is used as a domestic water supply for over a million people. In this condition the water, of course, is undrinkable because of the impurities that have been dumped into it, and so there must be a filtering system that prepares it for human consumption.<br><br>First, there are large grates and nets and coarse screens that filter out leaves, branches, and dead animal life. The filtering system gets finer and finer as it removes other harmful impurities. Finally, after much careful attention, it is released into the pipelines of the cities in a now purified condition ready to be used by the people of the valley.<br><h2><b>Pollution of Our Minds</b></h2><br>When we were born on the earth, our minds and thoughts were clean and sweet and pure, unpolluted by the harmful impurities that come to us as a part of the experiences of this life. In our infancy our minds are free from unrighteous and unwholesome thoughts. We are innocent and untouched by the harmful effects and influences of Satan. Our minds, which are like tremendous reservoirs themselves, are capable of taking in whatever they may be fed, good and bad, trash and garbage as well as righteous thoughts and experiences.<br><br>As we go through life we may be exposed to stories, pictures, books, jokes, and language that are filthy and vulgar, or to television shows, videos, or movies that are not right for us to see or hear. Our minds will take it all in. They have the capacity to store whatever we will give them. Unfortunately, what our minds take in they keep, sometimes forever.<br><br>It is a long, long, process to cleanse a mind that has been polluted by unclean thoughts. Sometimes our minds may be so cluttered with filth and pollution that they are unable to be a spiritual strength to us and to our families, let alone to mankind in general. When in this condition, we find our thinking processes are not clear or correct. Schoolwork may be overwhelming. Everyday problems are more difficult to solve. Decisions are often made on shaky ground. We say and do things we would otherwise never be a part of. We are not at our best.<br><h2><b>Cut Off the Flow of Trash</b></h2><br>There are two things we must do. First we must stop the flow into our minds of these unhealthy and unwholesome streams of experiences and thoughts. Evil acts are preceded by unrighteous thoughts, and unrighteous thoughts are born of vulgar stories, jokes, pictures, conversations, and a myriad of other satanic products.<br><br>Vulgarity appears in many ways. We live in a society where profanity and vulgarity are accepted means of conduct and expression, even a way of life for some. Elder Packer has said, "The reality of profanity does not argue for the toleration of it" ("The Message: The Clean Voice of Youth,"<i>New Era</i>, January 1976, p. 5). We are the victims of a vile habit. There are those here this morning who are victims, who are misled into thinking this is acceptable conduct for a Saint, who think the influence is not that serious. I would suggest that some are misled who think vulgarity occurs only now and then when a person utters obviously crude or offensive words. Vulgarity is not so rare as it should be. It is sustained by constant exposure to a steady diet of vulgar and filthy experiences.<br><br>We might consider vulgarity in a couple of ways: first,<i>as an expression of</i>a personal weakness; second,<i>as a contribution to</i>a personal weakness. Some demonstrate or express a personal weakness when they tell jokes or stories about the body and its functions, when they joke about or make suggestive comments concerning women or girls, when they are casual about sacred things. There is vulgarity when some speak crudely of body parts or sexual matters. Too often common slang, even gutter terms, are used by brethren of the priesthood as well as by too many of the sisters. Ofttimes anger is used as an excuse for such an utterance. This is wrong. It comes of Satan; he is the author. No one need swear or be vulgar at any time.<br><br>Some contribute to this personal weakness when they read or experience filthy magazines, movies, television shows, and videos, or remain in a group where unclean discussions occur. Some married couples will even joke about sexual matters. Each of these kinds of experiences will weaken any spirit and will make it less able to withstand the fiery darts of the adversary.<br><br>Now, my brothers and sisters, beware of loose thinkers, be they peers or teachers. The subtlety of their influence can be disarming and destructive. Regardless of what others may do, there should not be any X- or R-rated movies that we participate in viewing or talking about. Shun them as you would the plague. A good movie with only a little pornography or vulgarity is not a good movie; it is satanic. There must be no pornographic magazines or pictures or music--and I plead with you, be careful of the music--or stories, no retelling of filthy jokes or crude experiences.<br><br>Once in a while we should stop and ask ourselves, "In whose army are we fighting? Whose battle lines are we defending, Satan's or the Savior's?" We are in one or the other, and, like it or not, our actions signal our true allegiance. Do you have the courage to walk out of an off-color PG-rated movie or video? Or do you watch, listen, absorb, and suggest to yourself, "This soon will pass" or "Everyone is doing it, it must be acceptable entertainment"? Have you the courage to keep out of your home television shows and videotapes that are filled with suggestive sexual conversation and even visual experiences? I think one of the subtle dangers that we have are the so-called "soaps." They tell, teach, and display the deteriorating breakdown in morals and in marriage. Have you thought lately how effective these shows are in piercing even the strongest spirit? We must not feed ourselves a diet of trash. We become what we think; we think about things we hear and read and see.<br><br>Run through an exercise with me for just a moment. Put yourself at whatever level you are on that ladder we talked about, the ladder of faith and testimony. Whether you are low or high, as I said, doesn't really matter. Now assume that tonight or this evening you watch a movie or show of whatever kind which contains obvious sexual conversation and implications of breakdown in morals, and so on. If you watch that show, regardless of the level you are on, in my opinion, your spirit will step down just a bit after having had the experience--just a bit--not much, but a bit. Or assume that this afternoon you are involved in retelling an off-color story: your spirit will step down again.<br><br>Every time you go through one of these experiences, it has been my observation that the spirit steps down little by little, and little by little. As I have reviewed Church court cases over the years, I have found that the tragedies that occur in the lives of men and women do not occur overnight in one thoughtless act. It is a step-by-step process. Now I am not suggesting that if you go to one of these shows, you are going to be involved in immorality. Some will, in the process. But I do know this: there will be dilution of the spiritual strength within you that will have its effect, long-term, even though you never get involved in a physical immoral action. There will be dilution of your righteousness and your power to do good, to think clearly, to make decisions that are proper, every time you put some of these materials into your mind.<br><h2><b>Cleanse the Reservoirs of the Mind</b></h2><br>Assuming that you have cut off the flow of trash (and I am not saying, "Cut it down"; I am saying, "Cut it off""), the second thing you must do is set up a filtering system which will cleanse the great reservoir of your mind so that the thoughts coming from it may again be pure and fit for your use and for the blessing of others. The effectiveness of your filtration system depends upon the pattern of your life. You will be no more successful in helping yourself and others than you are pure in your mind. True, you may systematically perform many of the tasks that are assigned in the Church: teach a Sunday School class, Relief Society or priesthood lesson; prepare reports; conduct meetings; and so on, but unless your spirit is in tune, and you speak, teach, and act under the direction of the Holy Spirit, you accomplish little of an eternal value.<br><br>The secret of cleansing the spirit of whatever the impurity is not very complicated. It begins with prayer every morning and ends with prayer every night. This is the most important step I know in the process. It may simply be a prayer for strength to turn from bad habits or a prayer that sin will be distasteful to you, remembering that not all prayers are answered the next day. Sometimes it takes a long time. But with this step in place, I've seen hundreds of miracles take place. Without it, there is continued frustration, unhappiness, ineffectiveness, and despair. If you have tried and have given up, I plead with you to try again . . . and again . . . and again. He will not forsake your efforts if you persist.<br><br>Secondly, an added refinement will come in your filtering process, and added measure of spiritual maturity, if you please, can be found in a daily study of the scriptures, not long perhaps, but every day. If I were you, I would read the scriptures tonight and never let a day pass without reading some in them, even if only for a few minutes. There is an added measure of inspiration promised to those who read the scriptures regularly that others do not receive. Surely at this time in your life such an assist would be welcome.<br><br>Thirdly, continue the cleansing of your spirit by doing something good for someone that he or she doesn't expect. Keep it simple, but do it daily. It may only be a cheery hello, a short daily phone call to a homebound friend, a wheelchair ride for an elderly patient, a thoughtful note to someone who is sick or has a lost friend. It may even be picking up your dirty clothes to thrill an unsuspecting roommate. According to the scriptures, a disciple of the Savior is first a servant of others.<br><br>Fourth, when necessary receive the blessing that comes with the confession process. Too many are harboring the inner feeling of guilt resulting from unrepented mistakes. Part of the repentance process is confession. If you happen to be one of those who has this need, I plead with you to go see your bishop before the sun sets today.<br><br>And finally, pick a commandment you are still struggling with and obey; give it an honest chance to bless your life.<br><h2><b>To Cleanse the Spirit</b></h2><br>Now, remember, first stop the flow of polluted thoughts; be far more selective of the experiences you feed the great reservoir of your mind. Second, develop an effective filtering system that will remove the impurities and cleanse the spirit. Let your spirit become a powerful influence for good. Spirituality is a product of righteousness; it is not an unearned gift. Again, remember that when you are in tune spiritually, you can handle any problem and you can be sanctified.<br><br>I testify this morning that the Savior is the head of this work for which you and I are responsible. I also add my prayer that each of us will be found faithful in the things with which we have been entrusted. For the Lord said, "O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day" (D&amp;amp;C 4:2).<br><br>This then, purity of thought, is one of the secrets to a happy and productive life and to the eternal rewards of a loving Father in Heaven. This I testify in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>H.

<h1>eritage - Truman G. Madsen - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Let me begin with a legend. There is a story of a grandfather, a holy man, who, caring for his grandson, sent him out to play. Shortly the boy returned sobbing as if his heart would break. He explained, "I was playing hide-and-seek with my friends. I went and hid and waited, but no one came for me. They all ran away." The grandfather embraced him and said, "Now you know how God feels. He hides, and no one comes for him."<br><br>This church does not have a collection of what in classical terms is called devotional literature or an official manual which is a set of spiritual exercises. What we do have is a pool of experience, rich experience. This morning I would like to derive from it some bits and pieces which I believe will help draw us closer to the Lord. There are religions in the world that develop their prayer practices after the preconceptions of their theology are taken into account. We have an opposite heritage: our theology has been derived from prayer--safer, sounder, and saner, I believe.<br><br>But first may I mention two hard reflective hangups that occur in the discussion of prayer in the wider world and which have not only been resolved but dissolved for us if only we will. There is first the notion that God, being all-knowing, is therefore unchanging. Since he knows all that will occur, having, it is said, absolute foreknowledge, prayer is pointless. For if God knew yesterday what is happening today, including all that I am going to do, it is pointless to ask that it be changed. One can insist that his foreknowledge is not a cause. One can still ask, "But am<i>I</i>a cause truly if, in fact, the eventuations could not have been otherwise?"<br><br>The heritage of prayer in this church teaches us that, whether or not we settle the question of foreknowledge, there is a point in reaching up to that Person, not a thing, who is himself free and has used his freedom to forbid to himself the use of force. He is not a computer, I am grateful to report. He is a conscious Being. And it is our relation in freedom to his freedom that does make a difference. Our history is replete with instances again and again of the inevitable, as it seems, not happening because of the intervention of our prayers and his response.<br><br>But there is a second confusion. Surely God, being God, must know what is best for us. If we pray and ask him to change his mind, he would hardly be wise to answer yes. If we pray for our own hurt, God, being a loving God, would do well to answer us no to our good. If we are simply praying to remind him of what he already intends, why pray at all? A kind of intellectual lockjaw comes from such reflection. But, in truth, again the Restoration makes it clear that we have needs, and so does he. He needs us to listen as well as to ask. It is said among the Jews that God, preferring our prayers to mere silence, caused great affliction among the Israelites so they would at least cry out from their pain. We do need and he does need.<br><br>His will, one would almost gather from diaries and journals which report firsthand experience, can be swayed, in part because the very prayer process changes us, and God can respond to that change; and in part because in the two-way relationship that exists we are to learn and grow through his response.<br><h2><b>Of Faith as Trust</b></h2><br>May I turn now to questions that are more soulful and not merely intellectual and reply with experience. There is some circularity in faith itself. "Faith," a child once said in a Sunday School class, "means believing what you know darn well isn't so." Faith is sometimes thought to be, in the religious world, a substitute for knowledge and, in fact, a form of credulity. It is thought to be assurance<i>that</i>something is or isn't. But the first principle of the gospel of Jesus Christ is not such faith. It is faith<i>in</i>a person about whom we already have some knowledge. Faith does not exist in a vacuum. Trust in a person is based upon acquaintance with the person, or at least belief about the person. It may begin secondhand. But the whole point of the gospel is to make it firsthand. He who counsels us "Pray always" is asking that we come to him in confidence.<br><h2><b>Of Crutches</b></h2><br>Second, it is said that prayer is a crutch. After all, mature people stand on their own two feet. They don't have to pray. Prayer is a form of wishful thinking, a kind of wanting pie in the sky.<br><br>First of all, there is nothing wrong with crutches for people who need them, nothing wrong with escalators and elevators. Agnosticism is a kind of crutch. It is a perennial postponement of decision. And what is it but a faith that assumes postponement is safer than commitment? Atheism is a pair of iron braces. It claims to know more than can be known. Somebody observed that atheists don't find God for the same reason bank robbers don't find policemen. They are really not looking very hard. But in almost every section of the Doctrine and Covenants the admonition is, "Seek and ye shall find." The implication is don't seek and you likely won't.<br><h2><b>Of Doubt</b></h2><br>But, it is said, I don't pray because I have doubts. I doubt things about myself, about the gospel, and even about God. Truly doubt and faith do not coexist in the same person at the same time. But they can exist within a second of each other. Witness Heber C. Kimball's standing by the door as Brigham Young was lying on what appeared to be his deathbed. "I do not think," said Heber, "Brigham will ever rise from that bed." But then after a moment of meditative prayer he lighted up and said, "He shall live." And he prophesied several events to come (<i>see</i>Orson F. Whitney,<i>Life of Heber C. Kimball</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1945], p. 434). He was right the second time. From doubt to faith.<br><br>On another occasion, we are told, he stood in the old tabernacle in Salt Lake and announced to a threadbare and barely surviving people, "State goods will soon sell in Salt Lake City for less than they sell for in New York. In the name of the Lord, amen."<br><br>Someone on the stand said, "I don't believe a word of it."<br><br>As he turned from the pulpit, he himself said, "I guess I missed it that time."<br><br>Brigham Young said, "Let it stand." It did stand. When the gold rush came, it was actually and completely fulfilled (<i>see</i>Whitney,<i>Kimball,</i>pp. 389–90). He was right the first time. From faith to doubt.<br><br>It is an honest prayer to say "Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief" (Mark 9:24). And it was, after all, the Prophet Joseph Smith, who said (and he was a man of faith), "If I had not experienced what I have, I could not have believed it myself" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 361).<br><h2><b>Of Words</b></h2><br>But, it is said, I don't pray because I am not good with words; I would rather someone else would do the talking. Understandable. But our history is replete with instances of people who had mind-boggling verbal gifts and also the absence thereof. Many, like Moses, could only stammer and needed an Aaron. In our midst today are those who are both deaf and dumb, whose lips are sealed. But they yet may pray from their core, wordlessly. Joseph Smith changed the line of Paul that says "The Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered" (Romans 8:26). The Prophet's version: "With striving which cannot be expressed [meaning words]" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 278). But if one does have trust in the living God, he can from his core reach upward, put an arrow on those imprisoned needs, and they will be carried by One who speaks for all of us, a Mediator named Jesus Christ. They are then perfectly communicated and responded to. What relief when we thus pour out our souls!<br><h2><b>Of Postponed Answers</b></h2><br>But, it is said, I do not pray because my prayers have not been answered. Answered? Do we mean not heard? Ah, but they have been--and recorded. We are taught that one day<i>we</i>ourselves will have a perfect bright recollection of all that has occurred in our lives here. But what of all that has been before that? Our historian, B. H. Roberts, thought long and hard on the record he studied so often and so deeply. He tried to account for the radical differences among and between those who have received the gospel in this dispensation, observing that some seemed almost to be born with it. He concluded that their response to the gospel and its powers was far beyond anything they could have learned in the short space of mortality. He concluded they brought it with them. His summary is, "Faith is trust in what the spirit learned eons ago" (B. H. Roberts, Scriptural Notebook, BYU Special Collections under "F").<br><br>We do come bringing, though locked under amnesia, the residual powers and distillation of a long experience. To those of us who see the hand of the Lord everywhere and to those of us who see it nowhere, the same promise is made: the day will come when we shall know that we have seen him and that he is the light and is in us without which we could not abound (<i>see</i>D&amp;amp;C 88:50).<br><br>There is locked in all of us, as there was in Enos--and I read Enos to say that he was surprised to find it was there (<i>see</i>Enos 7:8)--more faith than we presently know. He was heard, and we are heard. But it may not be the response of God here and now we wish. Yet have you not lived long enough to say to the Lord, "Disregard previous memo"; to thank him that he answered no, and to ask that he erase some of the petitions that you now realize were foolish or hasty or even perverse?<br><h2><b>On Being Specific</b></h2><br>Now may I take slices from autobiographical accounts? Are we to pray in practical and specific terms? Brother Brigham Young was hung up on a sandbar crossing a river on the plains. His companion, troubled, said, "Let's pray."<br><br>Brigham replied, "Pray? I prayed this morning. Let's get out and push." There is a time for total concentration in prayer and a time for answering prayer with your own muscles--helping.<br><br>But this is the same man who was specific enough to bring to the Lord concrete and urgent feelings, even hostile ones. His prize saddle was misplaced or did not hang properly, and the horse trampled it into shreds. He sharply rebuked the neglectful man and then made a beeline for the bedroom where he said (someone overheard him), "Down Brigham." Then he knelt and prayed, "Lord, I'm sorry. I was angry. Take my anger away and help me to do better next time."<br><br>"When I am angry," he said to a friend, "the first thing I do is pray."<br><br>Some of us have been taught that should be the last thing we do, that we should soak our head in a bucket and then pray. "I never am so angry but that I can pray," said Heber C. Kimball (<i>JD</i>3:231). And as for the related emotions, the same holds true.<br><br>Of such a practice Brigham Young once said, "I do not recollect that I have seen five minutes since I was baptized that I have not been ready to preach a funeral sermon, lay hands on the sick, or to pray in private or public." Think of that! And then he added, "I will tell you the secret of this. . . . If you commit an overt act, repent of that immediately, and call upon God to deliver you from evil and give you the light of His spirit" (<i>JD</i>12:102–3) rather than spend a week rationalizing and defending what you have done amiss or not done aright. He did it.<br><h2><b>Of Lacking the Heart for It</b></h2><br>But again, can we pray when we hardly have the heart for it? Lorenzo Snow leaves us the glimpse that after he was, as he felt, stillborn into the Church, nothing really significant happened in and after his baptism and confirmation. He kept praying for life, for the witness of the Spirit. It didn't come. Not feeling as he was wont but that the heavens were as brass over him, he nevertheless went to an accustomed place for prayer. He had no sooner opened his lips than the Spirit descended upon him. He describes it as like the rustling of silken robes. (They did not have the word<i>electricity</i>then.) There descended upon him a Spirit that was more tangible in its effect upon every part of his body than the surroundment by water in baptism. He was filled, praying when he didn't want to pray (<i>see</i>Eliza R. Snow,<i>Biography and Family Records of Lorenzo Snow,</i>pp. 8–9;<i>Juvenile Instructor</i>22:22–23).<br><h2><b>Of Reverence and Candor</b></h2><br>But are we not to bring a certain proper reverence to prayer? And if we are not in that mode should we not repent and wait? Listen to Heber C. Kimball. He is praying with his family and in the midst of the prayer says, "Father, bless Brother So-and-so." And then begins a loud laugh. I can imagine the heads of his children popping up and their eyes opening. After a slight pause he said, "Lord, it makes me laugh to pray about some people," and went on with his prayer (<i>see</i>, Whitney,<i>Kimball</i>, p. 427). I leave it to you, was that light-mindedness or profound intimacy with the Lord who knows we have a funny bone? He gave it to us.<br><br>My father taught me this ancient legend about Adam and Eve. As they were departing there was a solemn farewell, and the Father recognized far more clearly than they what they, as vanguard pioneers into the real world, were going to face. They said good-bye. But just before the couple disappeared in the mists, the Father couldn't stand it. He called them back and gave them a sense of humor.<br><br>We are blessed with the admonition not to betray the sacred. That is light-mindedness (<i>see</i>D&amp;amp;C 88:121). But we are also blessed that we should have "a glad heart and a cheerful countenance" (D&amp;amp;C 59:15). And if you cannot laugh at yourself and even at some of the absurdities of this world, you take yourself too seriously. Prayer can even manifest that phase of one's core with divine approval.<br><h2><b>Of Confusion and Affliction</b></h2><br>But, again, there is a problem of method. Do you have to say it a certain way? Do you have to have an appropriate technique? "Lord," one of our diarists records, "I don't know whether I am sincere or not. I don't know whether I want to pray or not." A superb prayer.<br><br>But can you cry out of affliction with any hope of help? Of course. It was Joseph Smith who, in a dungeon ironically called Liberty Jail, asked the questions we all sooner or later will ask: "O God, where art thou?" And, "How long, O Lord?" To the first the answer was, "I am here." And to the second, "Not long. But a small moment, Joseph." (Note that it was the Lord's definition of time.) "If thou endure it well and art faithful, thou shalt triumph" (<i>see</i>D&amp;amp;C 121:1, 3, 8). I am impressed, as an amateur in our history, with the number of miracles of overcoming, of solving problems. But I give it to you as my testimony that equally impressive are those divine blessings that enabled people to endure what they could not overcome; to hold on; to wait and wait and wait faithfully.<br><h2><b>Of the Impossible</b></h2><br>But can one pray for the impossible? There is, in certain traditions about divine omnipotence, the notion that one could ask for the preservation of the life of a friend who had been killed in a foreign war the day before; and that God, having command of time, could actually answer the prayer yes. Not so, I submit. There are laws. There are conditions. And God himself cannot change them. Yes, we cry out, he could and sometimes does prevent this or that. But he could not prevent it and still accomplish others of his, and of our, multiple purposes. It must be rough to be the Father of everyone.<br><h2><b>Of Names</b></h2><br>But, it can be asked, is there a name that he prefers that we are often to use? The answer is in the life of Christ, who chose, almost without exception, one word--<i>Abba</i>. In Hebrew it means<i>Father</i>. But it means a shade more than that. It means, as a child would whisper it,<i>Daddy.</i>Intimate. We are all given names after we are born. The Lord wills to give us a name after we are reborn. We take it upon us willingly and by covenant. It is his name. And through it and with it we are equipped to pray more powerfully than if we prayed only in our own name. In my imagination I wonder if, when the Father said, "Joseph, this is my Beloved," he might also have said, "Beloved, this is our Joseph." Or if, as they stood in visitation (which is more than vision), which at first must have been bewildering to Joseph, they could have said, "Remember us?" In prayer we are to use the name of him who "descended below all things" (D&amp;amp;C 88:6).<br><br>Now, brothers and sisters, from our history I come to a focus and a conclusion. There are levels beyond levels of prayer. There are heights beyond heights. There are promises in modern revelation that in due time, after we have proved that we are "determined to serve him at all hazards" (<i>Teachings</i>, p. 150), we may receive "keys" whereby we may ask with the full assurance of an answer (<i>see</i>D&amp;amp;C 124:97). Said Joseph Smith to Brigham Young on an occasion, "You have passed certain bounds and conditions, Brother Brigham. Now you can be receptive to certain revelations." Brigham passed the same keys to others, including Wilford Woodruff. Wilford Woodruff said at the dedication of the Salt Lake Temple that it had been made known to him by revelation that the reason a representative of the Woodruff family had been called to preside was that "the Lord could not find a weaker vessel" (S. L. Temple Dedication Notes, BYU Special Collections, April 1893, p. 125). Our whole history teaches us that out of weakness we can be made strong (<i>see</i>2 Nephi 3:13; Jacob 4:7; Ether 12:27, 37; D&amp;amp;C 1:23; 133:58, 59; 135:5). Why does the Lord choose the weak? Among other reasons, because they can be taught and influenced. He has to use a jackhammer for the proud. Further, because they are transparently weak, those who have eyes to see are not confused about where the power, if there is power, comes from. It comes from God.<br><br>There are levels beyond levels, gifts beyond gifts.<br><br>This glimpse in summary. It was in a school of instruction, the School of Prophets--and prophetesses, too. (For the first thing the Smith brothers thought on a day of a rich spiritual outpouring in that room above the Newel K. Whitney store was, "Where is mother?" And they rode a piece and brought her to participate.) In that setting the Prophet asked that each in turn speak, that, as the revelation says, "not all be spokesmen at once . . . and that every man may have an equal privilege" (D&amp;amp;C 88:122). The subject was faith. Scriptures were quoted. The last man to speak, as it happened, was Brother Kimball who in effect said,<br><br><i>"It's all been said, but I can say one thing, tell you a story. My daughter, Helen Mar, was standing near the table, and her mother left her saying, 'Don't touch those dishes. Don't break one of those or I will whip you.' Vilate left, and Helen Mar did what little children often do when they are told not to do it. Not just a dish was broken. The whole table leaf collapsed. All were broken.</i><br><br><i>"Now she went out, as she had watched her parents do, near a tree. We don't know what she said, but it would have been simple enough: 'Bless my mother that she won't whip me.'</i><br><br><i>"Vilate returned. She saw the situation. She flared. She led the little girl by the hand into the bedroom. She assumed the angle. And then she couldn't go through with it. And the arms of Helen Mar came around her neck, and she said, 'Oh, mother, I prayed that you wouldn't. I'm sorry, sorry.'"</i><br><br>When Brother Heber finished, every man in the room, including Joseph, was in tears. And Joseph said, "Brethren [these are grown-up, strong, independent, willful, intelligent men], that is the kind of faith we need, the faith of a little child going in humility to its Parent" (Whitney,<i>Kimball</i>, pp. 69–79). That sums it up.<br><br>In closing, then, just this verse.<br><br><i>Pray always, and I will pour out my Spirit upon you, and great shall be your blessing--yea, even more than if you should obtain treasures of earth and corruptibleness to the extent thereof.</i><br><br><i>Behold, canst thou read this without rejoicing and lifting up thy heart for gladness?</i><br><br><i>Or canst thou run about longer as a blind guide?</i><br><br><i>Or canst thou be humble and meek, and conduct thyself wisely before me? Yea, come unto me thy Savior.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 19:38–41]<br><br>In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Truman G. Madsen was a professor of philosophy at Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 8 November 1983.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>nces at the Past at Thanksgiving Time - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
A special day set aside for thanksgiving seems very appropriate, although we should always be thankful for our blessings. The Lord suggests--even more than suggests, He commands--that we should be thankful for all things. For example, in a modern revelation reiterating in our day some of the basic commandments given through Moses, we read, "Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things" (D&amp;amp;C 59:7). A few verses later in the same section, after counsel on fasting and prayer, a reward for faithful obedience coupled with thanksgiving is promised.<br><br><i>And inasmuch as ye do these things with thanksgiving, with cheerful hearts and countenance, . . . the fullness of the earth is yours.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 59:15–16]<br><br>May I share some verse which deals with the significance of Thanksgiving Day:<br><br><i>What Thanksgiving means</i><br><i>Thanksgiving means a lot of things</i><br><i>To different ones I know.</i><br><i>To some it means a wintry day</i><br><i>With gusty wind and snow.</i><br><i>Some others see a sunny day</i><br><i>A warm and balmy time,</i><br><i>With flowers growing in the yard</i><br><i>And orange trees or lime.</i><br><i>Some see a colored autumn scene,</i><br><i>A white and frosty morn,</i><br><i>With yellow pumpkins in the field</i><br><i>And rusty rows of corn.</i><br><i>To some it's just another day,</i><br><i>And toil the body saps.</i><br><i>No chance to look ahead to see</i><br><i>A holiday perhaps.</i><br><i>To some it means a day to stuff</i><br><i>With turkey, sauce, and pie.</i><br><i>They eat so much it really hurts;</i><br><i>Then on a bed they lie.</i><br><i>Those football games in constant stream</i><br><i>On television screens</i><br><i>Take up the day from morn till night--</i><br><i>At least, that's how it seems.</i><br><i>But few there are who see this day</i><br><i>As one on which we kneel</i><br><i>In thanks to God for countless things</i><br><i>That should us to Him seal.</i><br><i>Our health, our wealth, our freedoms dear,</i><br><i>Our family and our friends,</i><br><i>The joy of living in this day--</i><br><i>The list just never ends.</i><br><i>The pilgrims felt it worth the time</i><br><i>To set aside a day</i><br><i>To think of God and thank Him, too,</i><br><i>In their own simple way.</i><br><i>We, too, should give to Him above</i><br><i>A day from busy life,</i><br><i>A day when we can think of Him</i><br><i>Without internal strife.</i><br><i>Just pause and ponder on the name--</i><br><i>Thanksgiving Day--it ranks</i><br><i>As one we make a holiday,</i><br><i>A special day for thanks.</i><br>[Robert J. Smith,<i>Thoughts on Verse</i>(Provo: private publication, 2nd ed., 1974), pp. 48–49]<br><h2><b>Present Blessing Rooted in Past</b></h2><br>This year as I contemplated Thanksgiving--or more accurately this talk for Thanksgiving--I recalled some background from the past which has led to many things for which I am now grateful. I realize that few things come into our possession full blown without roots in the past. Great new ideas--even those arising out of flashes of inspiration--are most often rooted in our experience and background from the past. Similarly, much that we enjoy in terms of material conveniences, family tradition, and educational methods and aspirations developed from past roots. At Thanksgiving time it is appropriate for us to pause to contemplate a little of the road behind us, that the road ahead might have more meaning.<br><h2><b>Marriott Center Ancestry</b></h2><br>This morning we meet in a beautiful, large facility with multipurposes, but in season emphasizing basketball competition. There are still in existence facilities for basketball which brought us to this comfortable and commodious building. On Sixth North and First East is an old building, the upper floor of which was once BYU's men's gymnasium. Within two blocks of that, on University Avenue, is the old gymnasium for women, where intercollegiate basketball games were once played. I well remember BYU's home games, played in the Springville High gymnasium so that more students and others might see this competitive sport. Many at BYU now remember the tremendous enthusiasm which accompanied the opening of the great new facility, the George Albert Smith Fieldhouse, where most of the games of the Stan Watts era were played. Today's generation of students knows only this 22,000-seat facility, now one of the finest and largest in the nation.<br><h2><b>Other Changes Based in the Past</b></h2><br>Our assemblies since my BYU student days have migrated from College Hall on the lower campus, to the Joseph Smith Auditorium, to the George Albert Smith Fieldhouse, and to the Marriott Center. Other University functions have seen like change. Our bookstore was preceded by another in the Herald R. Clark Building, which in turn was preceded by facilities in a temporary barracks building, and, for those of more ancient vintage, a cubbyhole in the basement of College Hall on the lower campus.<br><br>Although I do not consider myself old, I have experienced a variety of methods for space heating. Many armloads of wood I personally carried to provide fuel for a stove, which served three purposes--cooking, water heating, and space heating. I have had some experience with fireplace heating, coal heaters, coal furnaces, and fuel oil, and I now use a convenient electrically controlled gas furnace. The current return to wood stoves does not hold the glamour for me that it might for others.<br><br>In my early youth we carried water from the well across the street and used water which came off the roof in rainstorms. I've seen the installation of a water line in a small community which brought cold water to the kitchen sink. Water was heated in a tank on the wood stove, later by coils attached to a separate hot water tank. Of course, it's much more convenient to have natural gas or electricity as a source of fuel to provide hot water at any time, day or night.<br><br>I have studied under the light of kerosene or coal oil lamps. I went through an era when we used a single, bare electric bulb in the center of the room, and now we use specialized lamps and fluorescent and indirect lighting. All of these experiences give greater appreciation for what we presently enjoy and a sense of wonder as to what the future may bring.<br><h2><b>Gratitude for our Forebears</b></h2><br>Some traditions, such as membership in the Church, may have several generations behind them, such as mine, whereas many of the student body at BYU find themselves as the first generation in building a tradition of membership in the Lord's restored Church. Without being exhaustive, for example, many of my progenitors joined the Church in its early days. My great-grandfather Silas Smith was baptized in 1835, and his father, Asahel Smith, had received with gladness the news of the restoration of the gospel through his grandson Joseph Smith, Jr., which he felt was a fulfillment of one of his own prophecies. Two of Silas's sons accompanied their widowed mother to Nauvoo and later across the plains, arriving in Salt Lake Valley in September 1847. These two both had very large families, and the younger of the two was my grandfather.<br><br>Samuel Walker West and his family embraced the gospel in Tennessee and in 1842 migrated to Nauvoo and later moved west with the Saints. His daughter, Emma Seraphine West, pioneered in southern Utah and northern Arizona. Her youngest son is my father.<br><br>My grandfather Lorenzo Hill Hatch, was baptized in February 1840 at the age of fifteen in Vermont. The same year his father, mother, grandfather, and grandmother all joined the Church. Lorenzo's mother died in Vermont; his father died in Nauvoo in 1843. His grandparents died in Winter Quarters and Council Bluffs, but Lorenzo and two brothers began a large Hatch posterity in the Church.<br><br>His fourth wife, Alice Hanson, with other members of her family, joined the Church in England in 1854. As a nineteen-year-old young lady, she sailed to the United States and then walked across the plains in a handcart company. Her youngest child is my mother.<br><br>The faith and devotion of these ancestors have influenced family tradition and life and have also obviously influenced my feelings and attitude. But in the final analysis, for me--the same as for anyone coming into the Church--whether fifth generation or first--the conversion process was personal and individual.<br><h2><b>Thanks for the Influence of Good People</b></h2><br>Some things don't change in quite the same way as others, but we still build on the contribution of others. Who doesn't remember some influential teacher in one's life who changed the course of one's thinking or the direction one has taken? Three or four of my high school teachers are fondly remembered; they greatly influenced my learning and my desire for a college education. Much has happened at BYU during my thirty-four years of employment, plus over ten years' acquaintance at the University during my student years, including the interim periods while working, serving a mission, and completing a term in the military service by invitation of our government. Five presidents have made their marks on Brigham Young University in that period. Many teachers have sacrificed much to contribute to the ongoing flow of development. You have heard the names of many, but let me suggest a few names that may not be as familiar to you but who, in my opinion, have contributed greatly to my own growth and have greatly influenced my career--Herald R. Clark, H. Val Hoyt, A. Smith Pond, Joseph K. Nicholes, Weldon J. Taylor, Wayne B. Hales, Sidney B. Sperry, Robert K. Thomas--the list could go on. Others would have a similar but different list. Perhaps most of you may have someone whom you have known or currently know who has influenced you in such a way that they might fit the model so well described by my eldest sister in a tribute to our mother:<br><br><i>We need not search among the recounted deeds of the great to find life's intimate expressions. Her meaningful messages are truly reflected in the humble life of each individual. From the common everyday experiences of humanity, existence moves in the boundless realms of eternity; and so from the life happenings of one fragile being may other personalities be enriched and courage be summoned in the struggle of making human relationship more understandable and pleasant. Such is the aim of every noble soul.</i>[Alice S. Hansen,<i>Sketch of the Life of Lulu Jane Hatch Smith</i>(unpublished, 1938), p. 1]<br><h2><b>The Debt We Owe for Present Blessings</b></h2><br>As enjoyable as a look back may be--and certainly we should look back and be thankful for those persons and those developments which have brought us to our present state--we need to be thankful that we are endowed with the power to act, the power to think, the responsibility to do things of our own free will and choice. We should be grateful that we live in a land wherein individual initiative and rights are still accepted principles. We can make individual and collective contributions. We can begin that which for others might become tradition and history. In our generation we can hold the lamp of progress in our hand to pass it to the coming generation. At this Thanksgiving time may the brief gland behind to sources of our traditions and current blessings give us determination to carry on, to build, to grow, and to contribute to the progress of mankind. Particularly, may we further the eternal purposes and work of our Father in Heaven, that we might be worthy of the blessings promised to those who devotedly and faithfully pursue the principles of the gospel, that we might have joy and might have in our lives the fruits of the Spirit described by Paul:<br><br><i>Love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.</i>[Galatians 5:22–23]<br><br>That this might be our blessing, I pray humbly in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Robert J. Smith was the financial vice-president of BYU when this devotional address was given on 22 November 1983.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>hink Straight - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I recognize, my fellow students, that I certainly will need the help of the Lord this morning. My family, when they learned that I was going to have this opportunity to speak here, asked me on a regular basis what I was going to say. I have not been able to tell them because I have not really been sure until this moment. I have a thought in my mind, one that I feel should be said. I am fully aware that perhaps I am not the best qualified to say it but would ask you to bear with me because I feel what I have in mind, if communicated to you in the right way, can help you. That is, of course, what I would like to do--to help you.<br><h2><b>Future Leaders</b></h2><br>In 1978 I stood at this pulpit. I was impressed on that occasion to talk to those students about the great role that lay ahead in their lives to become the leaders in the Church in 1988. That was five and a half years ago. Many of those students who sat where you are now sitting are out in the Church. Several are now serving as bishops of their wards in just five and a half years. Many of the sisters who were sitting in the same seats you occupy are now serving as presidents of their Relief Society, Primary or Young Women organizations. So, when I tell you this morning that you will in fact be the leaders of the Church in a few years, I can demonstrate from past experience that that truly is going to occur in your life if you are ready.<br><br>In 1978 we had 950 stakes of the Church. Five and a half years later, we have 1,450 stakes. The church is moving forward. It is growing, meeting its ongoing charge and commission from the Lord to fill the whole earth. As more stakes are organized and more wards and branches are created, pressure will increase for new leadership to lead the units of the Church. You in very deed will become leaders in the next five and a half years.<br><h2><b>The Principle</b></h2><br>I have now had the experience of almost eight years as a General Authority and have had the opportunity to see the Church in operation worldwide. I came from the business community to the assignment as a General Authority. I had some interesting business experiences upon which I have been able to think back and reflect. I have tried to isolate a principle to discuss with you this morning. If understood and properly practiced, this principle can help you be successful in your journey through mortality. The principle I have felt to speak about this morning is learning to<i>think straight.</i>I recognize that all of you are thinking. Some of you are thinking that you wish you had studied harder now that you anticipate next week's finals. I realize that sometimes some of you think that you are thinking too much. But my charge to you this morning is to develop the skill and the capability of<i>thinking straight.</i><br><br>In my office I have a little plaque that reads, "Above all else, brethren, let us think straight." These were the last words in mortality spoken by my grandfather Melvin J. Ballard. As I understand the circumstance, Grandfather, after the very grueling experience of preaching the gospel all through the eastern part of the United States, drove his car from New York to Salt Lake City. When he came into the driveway of his home at 80 North Wolcott Avenue in Salt Lake City, he collapsed. He was rushed to the LDS hospital, where he was found to have acute leukemia. He never came out of the hospital. He went in and out of a coma. As I have had it told to me by my father, who was there, Grandfather pushed himself up in bed, looked into his hospital room as though he were addressing a congregation or a group, and said clearly, "And above all else, brethren, let us think straight." Then he died. I don't go into my office any day of the week that I don't see those words, and I find that they help me a great deal.<br><h2><b>Think until It Hurts</b></h2><br>How do we learn to think straight? The book of Proverbs has a little guide that might be helpful. It is found in the nineteenth chapter, twentieth verse: "Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise." I would suggest that straight thinking probably begins with straight listening, with careful listening, with accurate listening. Those men with whom I have associated who have developed the instinctive ability to think straight are very good listeners. As they receive counsel and instruction, they are able to extract principles that will be eternally important in their lives and then make them part of their lives.<br><br>I would like to suggest that it is important to act slowly. Know the facts. All the years that I was in business I had a little sign that sat on my desk that read, "Don't confuse me with the facts. My mind is already made up." Sometimes you can get locked in to that kind of thought process. I had the sign there to stimulate thinking on the part of those who associated with me, to remind them that indeed we wanted to deal with the facts.<br><br>Fact finding sometimes requires patience, time, and very careful consideration. A longtime friend of the Church who has since past away was Lord Thompson of Fleet. Lord Thompson, at the age of sixty-seven, started out to build a great empire. In a very short time, the Thomson Enterprises consisted of 464 different independent businesses. It is one of the most successful business ventures in the entire world. He wrote a book in the twilight of his life and said that we are all averse to thinking; that to be successful, one must think until it hurts. Thinking is the process of worrying about a solution to a problem and considering every possible aspect. He went on to say that if we learn to make good decisions in our youth, we will build up a bank account on which we can draw in later years, and decision-making becomes less painful.<br><br><i>Sloppy, inconclusive thinking becomes a habit. The more one does it, the more one is unfitted to think a problem through to a proper conclusion.</i>[Lord Thomson of Fleet,<i>After I Was Sixty</i>(London: Hamis Hamilton, 1975), p. 106]<br><br>I like those words. We can learn to be careful, fact-oriented thinkers, or we can become sloppy, inconclusive thinkers. We are living in a world which is crying out as never before for sound, solid, well-grounded thinkers.<br><br>I would like to continue with a further statement of Lord Thomson. I think it is especially applicable to you at this point in your university training.<br><br><i>If I have any advice to pass on as a successful man, it is this: if one wants to be successful, one must think. One must think until it hurts. One must worry a problem in one's mind until it seems there cannot be another aspect of it that hasn't been considered. Believe me, that is hard work and, from my close observation, I can say that there are few people indeed who are prepared to perform this arduous and tiring work. But let me go further and assure you of this: while in the early stages, it is hard work, and one must accept it as such, later one will find that it is not so difficult. The thinking apparatus has become trained; it is trained even to do some of the thinking subconsciously. . . . The pressure that one had to use on one's poor brain in the early stages is no longer necessary . . . one's mental computer arrives at decisions instantly or during a period when the brain seems to be resting. It is only the rare and most complex problems that require the hard toil of protracted mental effort.</i>[Thomson,<i>After Sixty,</i>p. 106]<br><br>In effect he is saying that, as we learn to think straight, to put this thinking process in gear and move it forward in a positive direction in our lives, we really do build up a bank account of experience. Problems that seem almost insurmountable to you today seem relatively simple to someone as old as I am. That is because many older people have thought, experienced, and worked through some of these problems in life.<br><h2><b>Maintain an Equilibrium</b></h2><br>There are those who become professional thinkers. I don't want to encourage that. Brigham Young said,<br><br><i>Some think too much, and should labor more, others labor too much and should think more, and thus maintain an equilibrium between the mental and physical members of the individual; then you will enjoy health and vigor, will be active, and ready to discern truly, and judge quickly. Is it not your privilege to have discernment to circumscribe all things, no matter what subject comes before you, and to at once know the truth concerning any matter?</i>[<i>JD</i>3:248]<br><br>I have met men who should really be out producing who are still studying. I think that there is a point at which you graduate and go on to the things that you have in mind that you want to try to accomplish in life.<br><br>As you go through life, there will be a lot of things about which you are going to be concerned. Some of you are thinking about marriage. Maybe some of you sisters are thinking more about it than some of you brethren. If the General Authorities had anything to do about that, we would try to get an equal balance so that all of you are thinking about marriage in the right way and at the right time. Some of you are undoubtedly thinking about what you want to do with your lives. Perhaps there might even be a few of you here this morning who have not yet thought out what you want to be as it relates to your professional life after you graduate.<br><h2><b>Ask for Guidance</b></h2><br>President Harold B. Lee gives some very good counsel to those of us pondering, studying, and thinking about our futures:<br><br><i>If there should come a problem as to what kind of business a man should be engaged in, whether he should invest in this matter or that, whether he should marry this girl or that one, where he should marry, and how he should marry--when it comes to the prosecuting of the work to which we are assigned, how much more certain will those decisions be if always we recall that all we do, and all the decisions we make, should be made with the eternal goal in mind: with an eye single to the ultimate glory of man in the celestial world.</i><br><br><i>If all our selfish motives, then, and all our personal desires and expediency would be subordinated to a desire to know the will of the Lord, one could have companionship of heavenly vision. If our problems be too great for human intelligence or too much for human strength, we too, if we are faithful and appeal rightly unto the source of divine power, might have standing by us in our hour of peril or great need an angel of God. One who lives thus worthy of his testimony that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ, and who is willing to reach out to Him in constant inquiry to know if his course is approved, is the one who is living life to its full abundance here and is preparing for the celestial world, which is to live eternally with his Heavenly Father.</i>[<i>Stand Ye in Holy Places</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1974), pp. 102–3]<br><br>If we learn to put into our lives a process that is based on thinking straight, we can take any point where you are today at Brigham Young University, can apply some of these basic principles (If we are living righteously and worthily so that we can supplicate the Lord for direction), and, according to President Lee, can expect to have divine inspiration and direction to help us in the mighty and heavy responsibilities of life.<br><h2><b>The Way the Brain Works</b></h2><br>I would like to share with you a story without sharing any names. I have a very good friend who was the chief executive officer and principle owner of a very large corporation. He was called to preside over a mission. Like so many of our wonderful men who have great skills, capabilities, and responsibilities, when the call came from the Lord, he did not question. He had thought enough through his life that it was instantaneous in his mind to accept the call.<br><br>But what was to happen to the business, what was to happen to this great enterprise? Situations and management were worked out for the best, but in three years lots of things can happen to a business when the guiding light is not there on a day-to-day basis. Ultimately some of the assets of the company were sold. But toward the end of the mission of this great man, an opportunity arose. Within days after his release he was back in business with a program far bigger than anything he had before he was called to be a mission president. He is presently bringing into being one of the major corporations to be based in the state of Utah.<br><br>How did he do that? I suppose he learned from the mistakes he made through his life, but, most importantly, he had learned to think straight. When the second opportunity came up, it was easier for him to define, to determine, to make decisions, and to move forward with that second opportunity.<br><br>I would like to share one more statement from Lord Thomson which pertains to this manner of thinking.<br><br><i>It was at least partly due to my discovery over a fairly long period, but more than ever during these latter years in Edinburgh and London, that experience was a very important element in the management side of business, and it was, of course, the one thing that I had plenty of. I could go further and say that for management to be good, it generally must be experienced.</i>[Thomson,<i>After Sixty,</i>p. 104]<br><br>I'd like to pause for just a moment and infringe on Mr. Thomson's statement to say please think in terms of Church leadership: to be good, it must be experienced. To be good at anything at all requires a lot of practice and skill in making decisions. The more one is exposed to the necessity of making decisions, the better one's decision-making process becomes.<br><br><i>I was entirely convinced that, through the years, in my brain as in a computer, I had stored details of problems themselves, the decisions reached, and the result obtained; everything else was neatly filed away there for future use. Then, later, when a new problem arose, I would think it over and, if the answer was not immediately apparent, I would let it go for a while, and it was as if it went the rounds of the brain cells looking for guidance that could be retrieved, for by next morning when I examined the problem again, more often than not the solution came up right away. That judgment seemed to come almost unconsciously, and my conviction is that during the time that I was not consciously considering the problem, my subconscious had been turning it over and relating it to my memory; it had been held up to the light of experiences I had had in the past years, and the way through the difficulties became obvious. I am pretty sure that other older men have had this same evidence of the brain's subconscious work.</i><br><br><i>This makes it all very easy, you may say. But, of course, it doesn't happen easily. The bank of experience from which I was able to draw in the later years was not easily funded.</i>[Thomson,<i>After Sixty,</i>p. 105]<br><h2><b>Funding Your Bank</b></h2><br>I would suggest to you here this morning that you are funding your bank. You are funding it in many different ways. Some of you young women will become mothers, and maybe you will never participate actively in the field in which you graduate. But when those children come and climb on your lap and start asking you some of the questions that children do ask as they are trying to get through grade school, junior high school, and high school, you will be grateful that you got this bank that you are presently funding here at Brigham Young University.<br><br>I would like to add one other dimension to this business of thinking. How do you develop the inherent, native ability to have good judgment, just good common sense? As I look about me and see men whom I admire, who I think are successful in their fields, I find that most generally they know how to respond with good judgment and good common sense. Lord Chesterfield is quoted as saying, "Common sense (which, in truth, is very uncommon) is the best sense I know of. Abide by it, it will counsel you best" (H.L. Mencken (ed.),<i>A New Dictionary of Quotations</i>[New York: Knopf, 1942], p. 1084). Benjamin Franklin said, "Where sense is wanting, everything is wanting" (<i>Poor Richard's Almanac</i>). Not using common sense can be fatal. Consider the pharmacist who was compounding a prescription that called for as much strychnine as you could put on the face of a dime. He didn't have a dime so he used two nickels. We don't need that kind of common sense. I could tell you story after story after story of those kinds of exercises of common sense. What I hope happens in your thinking process, as you study and try to become the very best you, is that you learn to think straight, the foundation being the building of a bank that causes you to instinctively have good judgment and common sense.<br><br>In all of this, the Lord has given us some very wonderful counsel: the problems of life, whether they be in business, government, social life, or church activity, can best be solved by following this little formula that he gave to Oliver Cowdery in the ninth section of the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me.</i><br><br><i>But behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 9:7–8]<br><br>You all know that, you have read it, and you have quoted it to each other in your various teaching relationships. I call on you to practice it.<br><br>At the risk of having all of you lose your faith in me, I am going to tell you a story about my own life. When most of you were still in the spirit world, I signed an Edsel franchise with Ford Motor Company. Some of you may not know what the Edsel was. The older brethren know that it was one of the most disastrous national marketing mistakes ever made in the United States. Ford Motor Company spent over two hundred million dollars producing an automobile that would carry the name of Edsel Ford, the father of Henry Ford II, who was then the president of Ford Motor Company. The sales promotion, anticipation, and the excitement were unbelievable. You can appreciate what it was like, being a relatively young businessman and having all the power of the Ford Motor Company brought to bear on me to encourage me to become the Edsel dealer for Salt Lake City. I wrestled with the decision. I said to my father, who was a great man in my life, "Before I sign the franchise, I want to see the car."<br><br>They made special arrangements for us to fly to California to see the car. Now, as I wrestled with this, I was also asking the Lord about it, asking for direction. It was a big decision; it involved a lot of money, a lot of commitment on my part. The minute my father and I saw the cars I had the distinct impression not to go ahead with the franchise. When I got away from the new car showing, the sales power of Ford Motor Company started to work on me again--they assured me the car was going to be the greatest thing that ever came into the automobile industry. And I allowed myself to drift from the promptings of the Spirit that I had earlier. I had followed the counsel of the ninth section of the Doctrine and Covenants, but I wavered from the impression the Lord had given me. I made the decision to sign the franchise, then went through the torments of the damned, almost. If we had more time, I could tell you that it is not fun to lose a lot of money fast. Regardless of what I did, it didn't matter; I couldn't stop the losses. Ultimately I had to sell the franchise at a great loss. This was a learning experience. I am now able to sit down with just about anybody who wants to talk about the automobile business and instinctively draw from my bank of experience to give pretty good counsel.<br><br>I can think straight now when it comes to those kinds of decisions because of what I suffered. Perhaps we need to understand that failure is part of life. We are not going to be successful in everything we do, but we never need to fail to learn the lesson and to place in the bank of our memories those things that will then cause us to become increasingly powerful and, most importantly, increasingly helpful to the building of the kingdom of God.<br><h2><b>Straight Thinkers</b></h2><br>We have much for which we look to you, the youth of the Church. You just can't imagine the conversations that go on at the Church headquarters about you. We worry about you; we pray for you. Not that we don't trust you; that is not the case at all. We just want you to be ready. We want you to be prepared. We want you to be able to think straight in this very crooked-thinking world. There are many things going on all about us at almost every level--international, national, local--that are going to require the soundest and the most solid-thinking generation that our Father in Heaven has ever raised. We believe you can be that. We want to do our part as your leaders. We want to sustain you and to help you. We want you to become the very best you.<br><br>My purpose this morning is to ask our Heavenly Father to bless you with the instinctive desire to plead with him in prayer that you might arrive at the point in your life when you can consistently think straight. For straight thinkers, my brothers and sisters, do not make serious mistakes in life. Those who think straight do not have moral problems. Those who think straight really do not have problems with the Word of Wisdom. They don't have problems paying tithing. They don't have problems with being righteous and good. Build your bank while you are here at this great university, build it and struggle, really struggle if necessary, with this concept: "Heavenly Father, bless me to be a good thinker, a straight thinker, so when I am called upon to be the bishop of my ward, a member of the stake high council, president of my elders quorum or Relief Society, Primary or Young Women organization, I might bless those who will look to me for leadership."<br><br>God bless you then in your struggle to think straight. Make this principle part of you so you will be a great source of power for the building of the Church in the future. I, of course, would like to give you the greetings of the First Presidency. Certainly I would like to leave the greetings of President Kimball. He loves you far beyond your ability to comprehend. His great desire is that the youth of Zion, the young men and women who are members of the Church, attending universities about the world, may become educated in the ability to have common sense and the ability to think straight. May this be your lot. I leave my witness and testimony with you that I know that Jesus is the Christ. This is his Church, he presides over it, and we are on his errand. I leave this testimony humbly in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>M.

<h1>ement and Our Part in It - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Tonight I have not come to entertain you; I have come to teach you--to teach you the most important thing I know. I cannot do this, however, without your help. The words and many of the principles I intend to teach you have already heard before. Tonight we approach the season of the celebration of the birth of the Son of God. We join with the rest of the Christian world in observance of His birth at this time. To us He is far more than the Babe born in Bethlehem. I want to teach about the culminating event, the single most important thing He did--the atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ--and, for us, equally important, our part in it.<br><br>I've done everything I know how to do to prepare for tonight--except to write a talk! That is why I especially need your help. Would you please pray for an outpouring of the Spirit of the Lord? The promise is that if you will do this, we can enjoy a sweet, spiritual experience that will bring great growth. You will be able to understand more than I say. My common words will take on relevance and have meaning. You will gain insights that I will not have explained. The united faith and prayers of this great body can call down from heaven a mighty spiritual power. Will you please pray for that Spirit to come?<br><h2><b>Some Basic Principles</b></h2><br>I have time to put in place only a few basic principles about the atonement.<i>No doubt the best part of my effort tonight will be when, in your future thought and study, you will have strokes of insight come that you have not experienced before.</i><br><br>I call to your mind again the pleading words that the First Stake choir sang so beautifully. Charles Gounod couched in beauty and eloquence the universal plea of all men who finally come to realize their total dependence upon the "Divine Redeemer":<br><br><i>Grant me pardon and remember not my sins.</i><br><br><i>Oh, help me, my Savior.</i><br><br>When we finally understand that, then we pray for mercy--especially when we realize our dilemma--standing as it were, subject to all the demands of justice.<br><br>Keep in mind that God is just. The law is just. The plan is just. Our part is to learn this and to learn how the plan of mercy operates to free us from the total demands of justice. We can turn to Alma where, nearing the close of his life, this great prophet instructed his young sons.<br><br>Corianton did no understand some of these principles we are going to explain tonight. He thought (what many mistakenly think today) that he could "sow his wild oats," then later be restored to righteousness. In the three preceding chapters (Alma 39–41) his father instructed him in some basic principles. He explained:<br><br>1. "Wickedness never was happiness." Some never learn that until it is too late.<br><br>2. The meaning of the word<i>restoration.</i>Corianton thought he could sow wickedness and reap happiness. That is not restoration. Restoration is evil for evil and good for good, etc.<br><br>3. "No unclean thing can inherit the kingdom of God." It is this fact that causes our dilemma--especially in view of the plan that we were to come to earth, get a body, hear the gospel, and go back to our Father in Heaven.<br><br>Alma told Corianton that if we transgress and become unclean, we cannot make it! Keep these thoughts in mind as we go to the scriptures to work out the solution to this dilemma as we "feast on the words of Christ."<br><h2><b>Spiritual and Temporal Death</b></h2><br>The forty-second chapter of Alma is one of those difficult ones to understand unless we have some guidance and inspiration. Alma started by talking to his son about the condition of our first parents.<br><br>The Lord God sent our first parents forth from the Garden because they had transgressed--they had partaken of the forbidden fruit. The penalty of death was a part of that commandment.<br><br>"And now, ye see by this that our first parents were cut off both temporally and spiritually from the presence of the Lord" (Alma 42:7).<br><br>Spiritual death means to be separated from the presence of God the Father. Temporal death means the separation of body and spirit. They died a spiritual death when the Lord thrust them out of the Garden, and they were no longer in His presence. They had previously been under His instruction as He walked and talked with them. Adam experienced temporal death when he was 930 years old--which was "in the day" that the Lord had said he would die.<br><br><i>And thus we see they became subjects to follow after their own will. . . .</i><br><br><i>And thus we see that all mankind were fallen, and they were in the grasp of justice; yea, the justice of God, which consigned them forever to be cut off from his presence.</i><br><br><i>And now, the plan of mercy could not be brought about except an atonement should be made; therefore God himself atoneth for the sins of the world, to bring about the plan of mercy, to appease the demands of justice, that God might be a perfect, just God, and a merciful God also.</i><br><br>Then he went on and explained,<br><br><i>Now, how could a man repent except he should sin? How could he sin if there was no law? How could there be a law save there was a punishment?</i><br><br>Then he concluded,<br><br><i>But God ceaseth not to be God, and mercy claimeth the penitent, and mercy cometh because of the atonement; and the atonement bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead; and the resurrection of the dead bringeth back men into the presence of God; and thus they are restored into his presence, to be judged according to their works, according to the law and justice.</i><br><br><i>For behold, justice exerciseth all his demands, and also mercy claimeth all which is her own; and thus, none but the truly penitent are saved.</i>[Alma 42:7, 14–15, 17, 23–24]<br><h2><b>The Law of Sacrifice</b></h2><br>Let us read the thirty-fourth chapter of Alma, where Amulek, Alma's missionary companion, was teaching. What follows is part of the golden thread woven throughout the scriptures concerning the atonement.<br><br><i>For it is expedient that an atonement should be made; for according to the great plan of the Eternal God there must be an atonement made, or else all mankind must unavoidably perish; yea, all are hardened; yea, all are fallen and are lost, and must perish except it be through the atonement which it is expedient should be made.</i><br><br><i>For it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice; yea, not a sacrifice of man, neither of beast, neither of any manner of fowl; for it shall not be a human sacrifice; but it must be an infinite and eternal sacrifice.</i>[Alma 34:9–10]<br><br>After Adam and Eve were thrust out of the Garden, the Lord commanded them to offer the firstlings of their flock as a sacrifice. Sometime later an angel came and visited them and asked, "Why do you sacrifice?" And Adam said, "I know not, save the Lord commanded me," which is a very good reason. Then the angel explained to him, "This is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father, which is full of grace and truth" (Moses 5:6–7).<br><br>And so, whenever the gospel was in force and understood, from that day until the Savior Himself was sacrificed, the Lord's covenant people sacrificed the firstlings of their flocks--a ram without blemish--in similitude of the sacrifice of the Lamb of God.<br><br>Alma and others of the prophets who are quoted here knew about the law of sacrifice. They lived under the law. But he was talking about an<i>infinite</i>and<i>eternal</i>sacrifice.<br><br><i>And that great and last sacrifice will be the Son of God, yea, infinite and eternal.</i><br><br><i>And thus he shall bring salvation to all those who shall believe on his name; this being the intent of this last sacrifice, to bring about the bowels of mercy, which overpowereth justice, and bringeth about the means unto men that they may have faith unto repentance.</i><br><br><i>And thus mercy can satisfy the demands of justice, and encircles them in the arms of safety, while he that excerciseth no faith unto repentance is exposed to the whole law of the demands of justice; therefore only unto him that has faith unto repentance is brought about the great and eternal plan of redemption.</i>[Alma 34:14–16]<br><br>On what basis is this brought about? Let us go to 2 Nephi 9. Jacob spoke these words approximately 545 B.C. They knew of the plan of redemption a long time ago.<br><br><i>For it behooveth the great Creator that he suffereth himself to become subject unto man in the flesh, and die for all men, that all men might become subject unto him.</i><br><br><i>For as death hath passed upon all men, to fulfill the merciful plan of the great Creator, there must needs be a power of resurrection, and the resurrection must needs come unto man by reason of the fall; and the fall came by reason of transgression; and because man became fallen they were cut off from the presence of the Lord.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, it must needs be an infinite atonement.</i>[2 Nephi 9:5–7]<br><br>The atonement for man's sins could not be made by man. No man can give his life for another man's sins because we all must die anyway. So whether we die a little earlier or later, it matters not. We learned earlier that an animal could not be sacrificed. It had to be some<i>one</i>special. It had to be infinite and eternal. It had to be the Lord, Jesus Christ.<br><br>He could do this because He was uniquely qualified. He was born of Mary. From His mother He inherited mortality, or the power to die. From His Father, God, He inherited immortality, or the power to live forever. The First Begotten in the spirit became the Only Begotten in the flesh. He had the power of resurrection within Him. He could experience death on the cross and after three days walk out of that tomb as the first resurrected being. No other being in the world could do that except the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><h2><b>The Resurrection</b></h2><br>Then Jacob continued (with good reason):<br><br><i>O how great the goodness of our God, who prepareth a way for our escape from the grasp of this awful monster; yea, that monster, death and hell, which I call the death of the body, and also the death of the spirit.</i>[2 Nephi 9:10]<br><br>Because, when He broke the bands of death through resurrection, that made it possible for all men, every creature, to resurrect. The scriptures tell us that when the Savior resurrected, many Saints arose from their graves and appeared unto many (see Matthew 27:52, 53, see also 3 Nephi 23:8–13).<br><br>It is a significant thing that when the Savior came to this hemisphere, one of the things He verified was the prophecy that Samuel the Lamanite had made concerning the resurrection of many Saints who had slept. Christ said, "Bring forth the record which ye have kept" (3 Nephi 23:7). They brought forth the records and discovered that the fulfillment had not been recorded. "And it came to pass that Jesus commanded that it should be written; therefore it was written according as he commanded" (3 Nephi 23:13).<br><br>Without doubt the Savior wanted this prophecy and its fulfillment recorded in the Book of Mormon, especially in view of future conditions:<br><br><i>And the angel spake unto me, saying: These last records, which thou hast seen among the Gentiles, shall establish the truth of the first, which are of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, and shall make known the plain and precious things which have been taken away from them; and shall make known to all kindreds, tongues, and people, that the Lamb of God is the Son of the Eternal Father, and the Savior of the world; and that all men must come unto him, or they cannot be saved.</i>[1 Nephi 13:40]<br><br>We have testimony in the Bible that the resurrection occurred in the Eastern Hemisphere. It is recorded also in the record of the Book of Mormon.<br><br>Jacob continued by explaining the conditions of salvation which help us to better understand our part in the atonement: "And he cometh into the world that he may save all men<i>if they will hearken unto his voice"</i>(2 Nephi 9:21). Watch for those conditions. They are critically important if we are to understand justice and mercy, the atonement, and our part in it.<br><br><i>For behold, he suffereth the pains of all men, yea, the pains of every living creature, both men, women, and children, who belong to the family of Adam.</i><br><br><i>And he suffereth this that the resurrection might pass upon all men, that all might stand before him at the great and judgment day.</i>[2 Nephi 9:21–22]<br><br>We mortals cannot understand the suffering which the Savior underwent. It is describe for us in our scriptures better than elsewhere, yet we still cannot understand it. There is no pain He did not experience, nor any anguish through which we may pass that He did not know.<br><br><i>And he commandeth all men that they must repent, and be baptized in his name, having perfect faith in the Holy One of Israel, or they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God.</i><br><br><i>And if they will not repent and believe in his name, and be baptized in his name, and endure to the end, they must be damned; for the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, has spoken it.</i>[2 Nephi 9:23–24]<br><br>Let us now go to the nineteenth section of the Doctrine and Covenants, where the Lord explained more fully His suffering. The Lord gave this revelation to Martin Harris. (We need to learn a principle in passing, that when the Lord speaks to one, He speaks to all. He instructed him, and He is instructing us at once.)<br><br><i>Therefore I command you to repent--repent, lest I smite you by the rod of my mouth, and by my wrath, and by my anger, and your sufferings be sore--how sore you know not, how exquisite you know not, yea, how hard to bear you know not.</i><br><br><i>For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 19:15–16]<br><h2><b>The Plan of Mercy</b></h2><br>On one occasion President Joseph Fielding Smith was my teacher for two weeks on board ship traveling to South America. He was reading this very verse to me. Instead of stopping, however, with the word<i>repent</i>, he added, "if they would have faith, repent, be baptized, receive the Holy Ghost, etc., etc."<br><br>"President," I asked, "where are you reading? My scripture does not say that."<br><br>He got that twinkle in those beautiful blue eyes and with a smile on his face said, "That is what it means; it is supposed to say that." I now have a corrected version!<br><br>What is the gospel of repentance? Surely it is not<i>just</i>repentance, is it? Can you see what is beginning to develop?<br><br><i>What is the plan of mercy?</i>Be thinking of another name for the plan of mercy as we continue.<br><br><i>But if they would not repent they must suffer even as I;</i><br><br><i>Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 19:17–18]<br><br>Most of you know already that it was in the Garden of Gethsemane that the Lord suffered so greatly and brought about the atonement. Later He was taken to Caiaphas, to the San-hedrin, to Pilate. During most of the night He was scourged, tortured, beaten; was sentenced and then taken and hung on the cross to die that excruciating death. Other men had been crucified, but they had not atoned for man's sins. Do you see the difference? He did more than any man has ever done, or all men together. He suffered the pains of all men that He might bring about the atonement.<br><br><i>And would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink--</i><br><br><i>Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 19:18–19]<br><br>Now, in summary, let us read from 3 Nephi. Here we have a record of the Savior's visit to this hemisphere. The Savior was instructing His disciples and all the righteous people. He talked about the atonement, and he defined the gospel.<br><br><i>Behold I have given unto you my gospel, and this is the gospel which I have given unto you--that I came into the world to do the will of my Father, because my Father sent me.</i><br><br><i>And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; and after that I had been lifted up upon the cross, that I might draw all men unto me, that as I have been lifted up by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil--</i><br><br><i>And for this cause have I been lifted up; therefore, according to the power of the Father I will draw all men unto me, that they may be judged according to their works.</i><br><br><i>And it shall come to pass, that whoso repenteth and is baptized in my name shall be filled; and if he endureth to the end, behold, him will I hold guiltless before my Father at that day when I shall stand to judge the world.</i>[3 Nephi 27:13–16]<br><br>He emphasized the theme again:<br><br><i>And no unclean thing can enter into his kingdom; therefore nothing entereth into his rest save it be those who have washed their garments in my blood, because of their faith, and the repentance of all their sins, and their faithfulness unto the end.</i>[3 Nephi 27:19]<br><br>The Savior paid for our sins through His atonement. We do not need to suffer on condition of our repentance. Question: What do we owe Him?<br><br>Can you see that we owe Him everything--love, service, obedience? Do you see why we do a lot of the things that we do? We are<i>commanded</i>to do certain things. We are invited<i>to do many things of our own free will and choice.</i><br><br><i>Now this is the commandment: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and be baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day.</i><br><br><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, this is my gospel.</i>[3 Nephi 27:20–21]<br><br>Let me ask you that question again.<i>What is another name for the plan of mercy? The plan of mercy is the gospel of Jesus Christ.</i>Is that not what we have been talking about all evening?<br><h2><b>Steps We Need to Take</b></h2><br>The third article of faith says, "We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel." The fourth one says, "we believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost." Those are the first principles and ordinances. But can it be<i>only</i>faith, or<i>only</i>repentance, or<i>only</i>baptism, or<i>only</i>the gift of the Holy Ghost? No. No single principle or ordinance will save you. It requires all of these--and more!<br><br>Next, all men and women must be endowed in the temple of the Lord. There in those sacred places we receive an endowment of knowledge, of ordinances, of covenants, which, when accepted, understood, and lived, teaches us how to walk back into the presence of our Heavenly Father. You who have been through the temple know what I am talking about. And you who have not do not yet know how to walk into the presence of your Heavenly Father. Everybody that is going to get into our Father's presence simply must do that.<br><br>Next, we must be sealed to our companions in eternal marriage in order to get back into the presence of our Heavenly Father and become like Him. I am reminding you of the things you already know. I am trying to put them in proper context, so that you will understand that all these things pertain to the central theme of the gospel--the atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ--and what we must do to partake of that atonement.<br><br>The Savior said to Moses, "This is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). All of us know what many of the people of the world do not--that immortality and eternal life are two different things. The resurrection of the Master brought about the resurrection of every creature. All people will live again whether they have faith in Him or whether they do not.<br><br>Eternal life is the quality of existence in the presence of our Heavenly Father which comes upon conditions we have explained. We must earn it by obedience. The plan of mercy pays justice its due, and the Lord can still be just. Mercy can pay for our sins--upon conditions of our acceptance and our doing what we should. The dilemma has been overcome by the Savior--our part is to accept Him and to be obedient.<br><br>I understand that next week is test week. I suppose that you are all mature enough to know that in reality test week is every week! The adversary has taught, "Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow you die." ( I wish that thought were dead, but it is not!)<br><br>The Savior has taught that we are in a test all of the time. That is the purpose of our coming here. We came here to get a body and to see if "they will do all thing whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them" (Abraham 3:25).<br><br>This is our test. "Test week" only intensifies things. Do not complain about that. Understand its place and know that we qualify by obedience. "Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered" (Hebrews 5:8). In our modern scriptures it says, "And my people must needs be chastened until they learn obedience, if it must needs be, by the things which they suffer" (D&amp;amp;C 105:6). Obedience is the only way back into our Father's presence. We can have less than exaltation without it, but we cannot have eternal life.<br><br>The Church has three great missions. All are a direct outgrowth of the atonement--to proclaim the gospel, perfect the Saints, and redeem the dead.<br><br>This gospel plan is for every one of our Father's children. Why do you young men need to fill missions? Why must we reach out to our neighbors? They must have an opportunity to hear the gospel and undergo the ordinances that put them on the pathway to perfection.<br><br>Why must we redeem the dead? Why do genealogical research? To save the billions on the other side of the veil, who did not have a chance to hear the gospel of Jesus Christ or undergo the saving ordinances. Modern revelation teaches that they are there. The work is organized and going forward among our Father's children. You and I will have the opportunity to perform the essential ordinances for many people. All during the millennium we will be involved in this supernal work of saving and exalting all of those who will.<br><br>Our opportunity is to participate in the gospel of Jesus Christ. For your time and age you have done all you are supposed to do. Now endure! Do not turn away from the Lord because you err--especially if you err. The gift of repentance is to help us straighten out our lives, to get cleaned up so that we can get back into His presence.<br><br>Nearly everything I have told you tonight comes from the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. These modern scriptures will lead men and women into the celestial kingdom of our Father.<br><br>I bear witness that God lives, that He is our Father, that He loves us enough to send His Only Begotten Son to the earth to die for our sins and to purchase us. I bear witness that Jesus is the Christ, the literal Son of God, our Savior and our Redeemer. He redeemed us through His atonement. I bear witness that Joseph was a prophet. These modern scriptures are the evidence. We are led by a living prophet, President Spencer W. Kimball, today. May our Heavenly Father bless all of you with increased understanding and knowledge of the atonement and what we must do in appreciation for the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ--in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>A.
