<h1>our Trials With Trust - Cecil O. Samuelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As we begin a new year and a new semester, let me add my welcome to all who are with us on campus as well as all who participate with us in various ways around the world. This is a wonderful season of new beginnings and reflections. The year 2008 was tumultuous in many ways. It was a time of some significant triumphs and also a time of unprecedented trials for many, both individually and collectively. Much that was unsettled around us continues to be unclear as we enter the new year of 2009.<br><br>In spite of ample causes for concern and caution, there is much about which we should be encouraged, grateful, and optimistic. In addition to those things we share with all who reside in this land of promise and those in other free lands, we who know who we are and understand what we have should feel great comfort and confidence in our future. We know that challenges, threats, disappointments, and even temporary defeats are part of the great plan that ultimately can lead us to live "after the manner of happiness" (2 Nephi 5:27) as described by Nephi in times much more difficult and perilous than even our own.<br><br>But, as Helaman lamented, "these are [our] days" (Helaman 7:9) with their own special challenges and opportunities. One of the disappointments of our times is the seeming loss and lack of trust among us. We have seen this in the failures of government, business, and commerce and in the personal lives of those both far and near. Like many symptoms of failure, this lessening of trust at multiple levels seems infectious and may be spreading.<br><br>Today I would like to suggest why this should not and must not be so. Trust in its various dimensions is essential for each of us and for the world around us as well. I speak not in favor of blind trust but for the essentiality of informed and earned trust that is integral to all that is good, necessary, and uplifting.<br><br>President David O. McKay, the ninth president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, was the prophet of my youth and young adult years. He was loved and respected. He spoke with great eloquence and style, and I was always very impressed and touched by his teachings. On many occasions over the years he liked to quote George Macdonald: "To be trusted is a greater compliment than to be loved" (<i>The Marquis of Lossie,</i> chapter 4, 1877).<br><br>As a youth, I don't know that I ever doubted the idea that being trusted is more of a compliment or of greater importance than being loved, but I am sure that I didn't fully understand the significance of this relationship between love and trust that I am still striving tolearn more about and better comprehend.<br><br>We all long to be loved, and when we feel love from another person or from the Lord, we feel lifted, encouraged, and happy. I think we also yearn to be trusted but perhaps do not always focus clearly on how it is that we come to be trusted and by whom we are trusted.<br><br>I believe all of us understand the fundamental notion of trust. We need to trust the Lord and others, others need to trust us, and we especially need to trust ourselves. Like most of you, I know of instances where important trust has been breached in relationships and agreements. In our recent political campaigns the issue of trust was raised frequently from every side about who was most trustworthy. It is not a topic that has been foreign to this campus and certainly one worthy of and necessary for our consideration even today. Failures of trust occur when we do not keep even small commitments as well as large ones. Dishonesty of any sort is a breach of trust and has potentially dire consequences not only for the offended but particularly for the perpetrator.<br><br>Sixteen years ago President Gordon B. Hinckley gave a tremendous devotional address here at BYU entitled "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/gordon-b-hinckley_trust-accountability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trust and Accountability</a>." It is not my purpose to repeat all that he said on that occasion, but it is germane to reference some of the concerns and comments he shared that day.<br><br>He talked in great detail about the trust imposed on each one privileged to be at this university. He included students, faculty, staff, and administrators in his observations and admonitions. He was largely complimentary of the entire BYU community in 1992, and I believe if there is any difference in those here today compared with those he addressed, things and people are even better now. Just as President Hinckley observed in 1992, I would suppose there are also a few exceptions to the general rule today, but they would be few. Unfortunately, some of these very few in our midst have breached their trust in egregious and serious ways, and their disappointments have often splashed on the rest of the community.<br><br>While love and trust are often linked and even intertwined, there are some very significant differences. We hold unconditional love to be a very high virtue. Trust, on the other hand, is conditional in that it must be earned and can be very easily and quickly forfeited. Long before he became the prophet of the Church, President McKay made this observation:<br><br><i>Love is the sweetest thing in the world, but to be trusted throws upon him who receives that trust an obligation that he must not fail to discharge.</i> [<i>CR,</i> October 1934, 91]<br><br>We are often loved even when we are almost unlovable. Think, for example, of an impatient two-year-old's tantrum in the middle of the night or in the middle of sacrament meeting. Frustration does not usually diminish love. This unconditional love persists even when young adults, missionaries, and BYU students do foolish things, although they know better when making unwise and dangerous decisions.<br><br>Trust, however, cannot and is not able to operate with a similar lack of reciprocity. Rather, trust--like knowledge, understanding, and self-discipline--is usually gained "line upon line, precept upon precept" in a gradually increasing way until the aggregate of experience causes one to conclude that the individual is trustworthy. Sadly, often a single careless or willful act can destroy the trust that has taken a lifetime to earn. While broken or lost trust can be regained, it is not easily or quickly restored. The blemish can be removed only with serious, long-term effort--and even then a permanent scar may remain.<br><br>A special dimension of both trust and love is found in genuine friendship. A true friendship, one of life's most precious possessions, expresses unqualified love but also demands absolute trust. Few true friendships are ended by a lessening of affection, but far too many are seriously damaged when trust is breached. Think of this example of true friendship that was enveloped in both love and trust: Willard Richards felt this way about the Prophet JosephSmith.<br><br>Elder Richards of the Quorum of the Twelve was jailed with Joseph and Hyrum Smith and Elder John Taylor in the Carthage Jail. Because of the threats on the life of Joseph, the jailer suggested moving the men into a cell, where he thought they might be more safe. Joseph asked Elder Richards if he would go with him into the cell. Listen to Willard Richard's reply:<br><br><i>"Brother Joseph, you did not ask me to cross the river with you--you did not ask me to come to Carthage--you did not ask me to come to jail with you--and do you think I would forsake you now? But I will tell you what I will do; if you are condemned to be hung for treason, I will be hung in your stead, and you shall go free." Joseph said, "Youcannot."</i> [Elder Richards] <i>replied, "I will."</i> [<i>HC</i> 6:616]<br><br>What a blessing to have such a friendship based on love and absolute trust.<br><br>Your lives before you came to BYU have been documented sufficiently through the admissions process for students or our hiring practices for faculty, staff, and administration for you to be deemed trustworthy. Listen to these words of President Hinckley in his devotional address that I have previously referenced:<br><br><i>Every one of us who is here has accepted a sacred and compelling trust. With that trust, there must be accountability. That trust involves standards of behavior as well as standards of academic excellence. For each of us it carries with it a larger interest than our own interest. It carries with it the interest of the university, and the interest of the Church, which must be the interest of each and all of us.</i><br><br><i>Some few students resent the fact that the board has imposed a code of honor and a code of dress and behavior to which all are expected to subscribe.</i> [Priesthood leaders] <i>are requested to interview each student and certify his or her acceptance of the standards set forth in these codes.</i><br><br>President Hinckley continued:<br><br><i>And so, my friends, we ask you to subscribe to these codes and to have the endorsement of your</i> [priesthood leaders] <i>in doing so. It is not that we do not trust you. But we feel that you need reminding of the elements of your contract with those responsible for this institution and that you may be the stronger in observing that trust because of the commitment you have made. With every trust there must be accountability, and this is a reminder of that accountability.</i><br><br>Lest any of us who are not students but still part of the BYU community think we are exempt from this counsel and standard, President Hinckley then went on to clarify:<br><br><i>It is</i> [also] <i>so with the faculty and with all of us. We ask that all members of the faculty,</i> [administration, and staff,] <i>who are members of the Church, be what we speak of as "temple-recommend worthy." This does not evidence any lack of trust. It simply represents a standard, a benchmark of belief and action. The setting of this standard is not new or unusual. It is not new at BYU or in the Church Educational System. . . . It is a standard applied widely in the Church.</i> ["<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/gordon-b-hinckley_trust-accountability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trust and Accountability</a>," BYU devotional address, 13October 1992]<br><br>It is not my purpose to describe all the ways we may violate the trust vested in us at BYU. In fact, I don't believe it would be possible to do so. In that context, I think of the words of King Benjamin as he concluded his great benedictory sermon with his testimony of the Atonement and his counsel about appropriate and righteous living. Said he:<br><br><i>And finally, I cannot tell you all the things whereby ye may commit sin</i> [or violate your sacred trust]; <i>for there are divers ways and means, even so many that I cannot number them.</i><br><br><i>But this much I can tell you, that if ye do not watch yourselves, and your thoughts, and your words, and your deeds, and observe the commandments of God, and continue in the faith . . . concerning the coming of our Lord, even unto the end of your lives, ye must perish. And now, O man, remember, and perish not.</i> [Mosiah 4:29–30]<br><br>I hope that you will conclude as I have that the matter of trust is a serious issue that deserves our careful and prayerful thought and attention. Let me offer in my concluding minutes four suggestions or homework recommendations that will help us all achieve the necessary dimensions of trust in our ownlives.<br><br>First, learn to trust the Lord.<br><br>In Proverbs we read:<br><br><i>Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</i><br><br><i>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</i> [Proverbs 3:5–6]<br><br>A computer search of the scriptures leads to over 300 references to the instruction to trust in the Lord. The first principle of the gospel is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. We may not know everything about God, but we do know, as did Nephi, that He loves His children and He is completely trustworthy and keeps His promises (see 1 Nephi 11:17).<br><br>Second, learn to trust yourself.<br><br>Our doctrine teaches us that as literal spirit children of a loving, absolutely trustworthy Heavenly Father, we are trusted by Him. One of the fundamental reasons for our mortal or earth-life experience is to learn to prove or trust ourselves. The Lord who knows you better than you know yourself has given you commandments so "that you may prove yourselves . . . that ye are faithful in all things ..., that I [the Lord] may bless you, and crown you with honor, immortality, and eternal life" (D&amp;amp;C 124:55). We honor our understanding of our relationship with our Father in Heaven when we show that His trust in us is warranted because we have learned to trust ourselves. A necessary component of being able to trust ourselves is repentance--sincere, regular, and authentic repentance. As we are taught by the Lord, "By this ye may know if a man [or woman] repenteth of his sins--behold, he will confess them and forsake them" (D&amp;amp;C 58:43). We must forsake our sins if we expect to be trusted by others and especially by ourselves.<br><br>Third, learn to trust others.<br><br>President David O. McKay often included in his discourses the principle of learning to trust others. More than 80 years ago, in the general conference of the Church, he said this:<br><br><i>Tell a young boy that you trust him, and you have one of the greatest means of guiding him uprightly that can come into your hands. Young boy, I trust you! To be trusted is a greater compliment than to be loved. Boys are few indeed who will not hold inviolate an implicit trust.</i> [<i>CR,</i> April 1928, 104]<br><br>President McKay's counsel is true of all of us--boys, girls, men, and women.<br><br>All of us have had experience with those who have violated a trust or our trust, but the principle of expected trust is generally accurate. Most of us adjust our views of others and ourselves with the input, whether positive or negative, of those we love and respect. Listen to these words of Alma, given to the faithful Saints in Gideon and representing his trust inthem:<br><br><i>I trust, according to the Spirit of God which is in me, that I shall also have joy over you. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . I trust that ye are not in a state of so much unbelief as were your brethren.</i> [Alma 7:5, 6]<br><br>Or listen to these words of Alma to his son Shiblon:<br><br><i>And now, my son, I trust that I shall have great joy in you, because of your steadiness and your faithfulness unto God; for as you have commenced in your youth to look to the Lord your God, even so I hope that you will continue in keeping his commandments; for blessed is he that endureth to the end.</i> [Alma 38:2]<br><br>Trusting others is an expression of faith in them. When trusting is exercised wisely, like exercising faith, trust is increased, and increased trustworthiness on the part of well-intentioned others can be the result.<br><br>Last of all, learn to trust the power of the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ that makes the first three relationships of trust truly possible.<br><br>Because the Atonement of Christ is real, continually operative, and limitless in its scope and possibilities, we can trust it unconditionally with the assurance that all things we cannot accomplish entirely on our own are possible when they fit with the mind and will of the Lord.<br><br>Just as Abinadi described the Savior's terrible trek through the Crucifixion and Atonement process as a demonstration of "thewill of the Son being swallowed up in the will of the Father" (Mosiah 15:7), the Atonement provides us with the means of developing sufficient trust, faith, and obedience that our own wills also might follow that pattern of being "swallowed up" in the wills of the Father and the Son. Becoming one with God and the Savior must be a primary goal for each of us. It was the reason for the expectations and promises explained to each of us long before we accepted the assignment to come to earth and be tested and trusted.<br><br>May we all strive to trust those things of greatest truth and importance to us and may we also strive to be fully trustworthy in every dimension of our own lives and particularly with the special trusts conveyed to us in our blessed circumstances at BYU.<br><br>God does live, and He trusts us. Jesus Christ, His Son, likewise loves and trusts us so much that He gave His mortal life for us. President Thomas S. Monson and those who serve with him love and trust us as well. May we never ignore or betray the sacred trusts bestowed upon us. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O.

<h1>Light Shine - Sharon G. Samuelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is indeed my pleasure to welcome you, my dear friends, back to a new semester at Brigham Young University in a new year--2009. I tend to view a new year as somewhat of a fresh start in my life. It offers me the opportunity to reflect on the previous year and to evaluate my life and the growth I hopefully have made as I strive to become the person I want to be in relation to the teachings of our Savior, Jesus Christ. I would surmise that most of you have done the same as you attempt to set New Year's goals.<br><br>As I went through this process and reflected upon the birth of Christ this past Christmas season, I felt deeply that the world today has an even greater need to make room in our hearts for Him. This past year we have seen that conditions of the world economically, politically, and socially can be extremely dark and depressing without the hope and knowledge of the Savior's mission and message.<br><br>A short time ago a friend related to a group of women an experience she had in 1980. While she was attending Sunday School at a church meeting in eastern Washington, the class was informed that there were unusual cloud formations in the sky. The class went outside to view them and saw that the formations were indeed very strange and unique. The entire sky consisted of huge, puffy gray clouds for as far as they could see. They were told it was possible that a volcano had erupted on the coast. Then they heard over a car radio that Mount Saint Helens had erupted and that, even though the volcano was hundreds of miles away from them, the wind was blowing the clouds of ash toward the east. At that point no one was too concerned.<br><br>However, later in the afternoon the sky began to get darker and darker. Before long it was completely black with an eerie darkness that she had never seen before or since. The members were counseled to be careful as they drove home.<br><br>As my friend continued telling her experience to our group, she said:<br><br>There was a sense of concern and fear of the unknown. When we went to the cars, there was powdery stuff everywhere. It was falling all around us. It was coming down like a dry rain and contributed to the darkness. There were now clouds of ash surrounding us. It was so dark that we could barely see a person standing three feet away. We held hands and ran to our cars.<br><br>As we drove, we could barely see what was in front of us. Even with the headlights on, our visibility was minimal. The windshield wipers were working hard to push away the constantly falling ash. As we slowly drove into the blackness, one thing stood out to me. Birds were flying directly into the beams of the headlights. It was obvious that they were seeking light in this time of turmoil and confusion.<br><br>After we got to our grandmother's house, the same thing happened. This time the birds were flying toward the windows of the home, often hitting the glass. It was apparent that they were disoriented and fearful. The only thing they wanted was light. They were searching for some kind of hope in the distant lights ahead.<br><br>It was obvious to my friend, as she related this experience, that when surrounded by darkness, confusion, fear, and panic, the birds sought the only hope of safety they had at that time--and to them their only hope was the light.<br><br>You young men and women are on a wonderful journey during this stage of your lives as you move ahead in gaining an education. There will be pathways to follow that you cannot yet imagine and experiences that will teach you many lessons of life. Just as the birds experienced darkness, confusion, and fear at one point in their lives, so will you. There are wonderful joys and blessings in your futures but challenges, fears, sorrows, and disappointments as well.<br><br>I am certain that even now you could relate numerous examples in your lives that illustrate all of these different circumstances. You have faced challenges and had disappointments as well as successes and wonderful achievements. You have been excited and joyful, and you have felt inadequate and fearful. However, you are so blessed that whenever you find yourselves amidst difficult and dark times in this troubled world, you have a safe and sure guiding light to bring you peace, joy, and happiness. It is available to anyone who would seek it in every nation, kindred, and tongue.<br><br>The scriptures teach us that "when the times of the Gentiles is come in, a light shall break forth among them that sit in darkness, and it shall be the fulness of [the] gospel" (D&amp;amp;C 45:28). The restored gospel of Jesus Christ is the sure light that shines for those who seek Him--even when we see the workings and mighty influence of the adversary in today's world. Satan seeks to bring darkness into the lives of the children of our Father in Heaven--and thus into yours.<br><br>The previous scripture continues and states, "But they receive it not; for they perceive not the light, and they turn their hearts from me because of the precepts of men" (D&amp;amp;C 45:29). Many are like those in Lehi's dream, described in the Book of Mormon, who could not hold fast to the iron rod--or the word of God--and go toward the tree of life. They succumbed to the temptations of Satan and to the pride, wisdom, and vanity of the world. This is much too common in the world in which you live today.<br><br>In Mosiah 16:9 we are taught that our Savior, Jesus Christ, "is the light and the life of the world; yea, a light that is endless, that can never be darkened." Jesus and His gospel are the lights that can guide you throughout your journey here on earth. These lights are brighter and stronger than any darkness you will encounter in this life.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught this wonderful principle as he related Christ's message to us in the Doctrine and Covenants: "And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you" (D&amp;amp;C 88:67). However, Christ's light and the gospel message of light can be darkened in your own lives when you choose to disobey the commandments or when your faith grows dim.<br><br>Each of you makes choices every day. Some choices can keep you walking in the light; others can cause you to begin walking toward darkness. You make choices about those with whom you associate. Do they help instill the light of the gospel in your life? Do they walk the path toward the light with you, or do they tend to nudge you in another direction?<br><br>The gospel teaches: "That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter" (D&amp;amp;C 50:24). Conversely, we are warned, "And that which doth not edify is not of God, and is darkness" (D&amp;amp;C 50:23).<br><br>In September 1989, Joshua Dennis was a 10-year-old Scout who found himself alone, trapped, and lost on a ledge in an abandoned mine in Tooele County, Utah. He spent five days in pitch-black darkness as searchers frantically tried to find him. To this day, I can recall reading the accounts of this story and following the reports on television. I remember thinking how frightened I would be if I were the one lost or if it were one of my loved ones in such a circumstance. I could not imagine being alone in total darkness, not daring to move in any direction. I couldn't see myself in that situation at any age--and for five days! Imagine what Joshua must have felt when he first heard the searchers and saw the light from a flashlight--a light that let him know he had been found and would soon be with his family.<br><br>When young Josh spoke at a fireside sometime after his recovery, he said, "I wasn't alone in the mine. Heavenly Father sent angels to be with me. I didn't see them, but I knew they were there because I was comforted" (in Carolyn Goates Campbell, "Hidden Treasure: Ten-Year-Old Josh Dennis Lost in Mine," Ensign, August 1991, 35).<br><br>I am sure Josh had been taught that Jesus Christ is a light in our lives and that His light can be with us whatever darkness surrounds us. Josh surely knew that he had the Light of Christ with him. This light sustained him and thus helped him find the courage to be brave during his ordeal. It gave him the hope that he would be found.<br><br>Each one of you has the light of Jesus Christ within you. How wonderful that is for you as you strive to discern what is truly of great worth in your life. The world of today will offer you many counterfeits to tempt you to turn away from the light of the gospel. Riches, power, and status are all worldly aspirations that have been built up to great importance in the eyes of men, but these can take you down the path toward darkness if you let them. Live so that you are worthy to have the Holy Ghost as a constant companion to help guide you in your choices and in the paths you take that will lead you in righteousness and eternal joy.<br><br>During President Gordon B. Hinckley's service as our prophet, we heard often that the Church had come out of obscurity. We have become very visible, and our work, which is the work of our Savior, is being viewed by the world. It cannot and will not be hidden. This brings many challenges as well as opportunities for all of us. The adversary knows this and will attempt to dim the light of the gospel so that it cannot shine brightly in the world or in our lives. We must be a light of the gospel of Jesus Christ to others. Christ Himself commanded, "What manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am" (3 Nephi 27:27).<br><br>You wonderful young men and women are the leaders of the future. You will be leaders in your communities, in the Church, and, most important, in your families. You will not and cannot be hidden from the world. Others will view you not only as representatives of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints but also as representatives of the Savior and the message He taught. The Lord loves you and will bless you each day. He has given you the light of the gospel and has asked that you "let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven" (Matthew 5:16).<br><br>That each one of you here will continually let the light of the gospel shine in your faces wherever you go and in whatever you do is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><em style="color: #333333; line-height: 24.375px;">Sharon G.

<h1>pectations - Thomas S. Monson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear young friends, the spirit which permeates this meeting here in the Marriott Center at Brigham Young University and in hundreds of other locations throughout the world is a reflection of your strength, your devotion, and your goodness. How grateful I am to be with you this evening. You bring to mind the words penned by the poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow:<br><br><i>How beautiful is youth! how bright it gleams</i><br><i>With its illusions, aspirations, dreams!</i><br><i>Book of Beginnings, Story without End,</i><br><i>Each maid a heroine, and each man a friend!</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>In addition to being with all of you, I'm pleased to be with members of my family tonight.<br><br>Recently I reread an old favorite of mine by Charles Dickens entitled <i>Great Expectations.</i> You who have read this classic will recall that Dickens speaks of a young boy by the name of Philip Pirrip, more commonly known as Pip. Little Pip was an orphan who could not remember ever having seen his mother or his father. He had all the desires of a boy. He wished with all his heart that he were a scholar. He wished that he were a gentleman. He wished that he were less ignorant. Yet all of his ambitions and all of his hopes seemed doomed to failure until one day a London lawyer by the name of Jaggers approached little Pip and told him that an unknown benefactor had bequeathed a fortune to him. Then that lawyer said that little Pip was "a young fellow of great expectations."<sup>2</sup><br><br>Today, as I contemplate who you are and what you are, who you may become and what you may become, I say to you, as that lawyer said about Pip, you have <i>great expectations--</i>not as the result of an unknown benefactor, but as the result of a known benefactor--even our Heavenly Father--and great things are expected of you.<br><h2><b>Prepare for the Race of Life</b></h2><br>Many of you here tonight are close to completing your formal education. (We'll have a moment of cheer on that one.) Others of you have additional periods of academic preparation ahead. Each is in what could be called the race of life.<br><br>The writer of the book of Ecclesiastes wrote, "The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong" (Ecclesiastes 9:11); it is to him who endures to the end. The race of life is so important, the prize so valued, that great emphasis must necessarily be placed on adequate and thorough preparation.<br><br>When we contemplate the eternal nature of our choices, preparation is a vital factor in our lives. The day will come when we will look upon our period of preparation and be grateful that we properly applied ourselves.<br><br>Many years ago, before I was called to the Quorum of the Twelve, I had the opportunity to address a business convention in Dallas, Texas--known as "the city of churches." After the convention I took a sightseeing bus ride about the city's suburbs. As we would pass the beautiful churches, our driver would comment, "On the left you see the Methodist church," or "There on the right is the Catholic cathedral." As we passed a beautiful red brick building situated upon a hill, the driver informed us, "That building is where the Mormons meet."<br><br>A lady's voice from the rear of the bus asked, "Driver, can you tell us something about the Mormons?" The driver pulled the bus over to the side of the road, turned around in his seat, and replied, "Lady, all I know about the Mormons is that they meet in that red brick building. Is there anyone on this bus who knows anything about the Mormons?"<br><br>I gazed at the expression on each person's face for some sign of recognition, some desire to comment. I found nothing--not a sign. Then I realized the truth of the statement "When the time for decision arrives, the time for preparation is past." For the next 15 minutes I had the privilege of giving, as Peter declared, "a reason [for] the hope that is in you" (1 Peter 3:15). At that time I developed a much greater appreciation concerning the matter of preparation.<br><br>Actually, my young friends, the period of your preparation did not begin the day you walked into your first college or university classes. It began long before you ever came to mortality, when we lived as spirit children of our Heavenly Father. I am so grateful that in His wisdom He has given us a record, in the book of Abraham, which tells us something ofthat existence:<br><br><i>Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, theintelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many ofthe noble and great ones;</i><br><br><i>And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those</i> [who] <i>were spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born.</i><br><br><i>And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said unto those who were with him: We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell;</i><br><br><i>And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them;</i><br><br><i>And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon; and they who keep not their first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate; and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads forever and ever.</i> [Abraham 3:22–26]<br><br>Then, in the wisdom of our Heavenly Father, you and I were born into mortality and welcomed into loving families.<br><br>I pause to let you know how much your families pray for you. They worry about you. They wonder how you're getting along. They love you so much. Don't disappoint them.<br><br>The Lord tells us in the Doctrine and Covenants that during the first eight years of our lives, power is not given unto Satan to tempt us as little children (see D&amp;amp;C 29:46–47). We had an eight-year head start on Lucifer.<br><br>This information was given by the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith back in 1830. In our own time Dr. Glenn Doman, a renowned scholar and scientist who has almost definitely never heard of the revelation quoted, has, through his research, come to the conclusion that<br><br><i>a newborn child is almost an exact duplicate of</i> [a] <i>computer, although superior to one in almost every way.</i><br><br><i>What is placed in the child's brain during the first eight years of life is probably there to stay. If you put misinformation into his brain during this period, it is extremely difficult to erase it.</i><br><br>He believed that the most receptive age in human life is that of two or three years old.<sup>3</sup><br><br>You might ask, "Why is President Monson emphasizing this? Our first eight-year period of learning is long past." But you, my brothers and sisters, are going to be parents one day, and you will want to emphasize the importance to your children and to your future generations of descendants of that first eight-year period.<br><br>When I consider some of the things you and I no doubt did as children, as teenagers, and as young adults, I think it is a wonder at times that our parents survived, let alone retained their sanity. One woman who had been experiencing a very challenging morning trying to keep her children under control felt that she was about to lose her sanity.<br><br>Her small son, Matthew, came to her and said brightly, "Mom, you remember that vase that your grandmother gave to your mother, and she gave to you, and you are always worried that I am going to break it?"<br><br>"Yes," she said.<br><br>"Well," Matthew replied, "you can quit worrying!"<br><h2><b>Prepare Academically</b></h2><br>You, my brothers and sisters, have now entered into another great preparation period in order that you might qualify for the race of life. I speak of academic preparation. This is important because it is here that we learn the lessons which will help us meet the challenges of this changing world in which we live.<br><br>Just a few generations ago, if someone were applying for a position of responsibility in the business world, a personnel director would probably ask: "Are you willing to work hard? Are you healthy?" And if the answers to those questions were "Yes," chances are he'd be hired.<br><br>This, of course, is not so today. Assuming one's application--usually submitted online--is chosen for a personal interview, the modern human resource director will ask such questions as What sort of degree do you have? What contributions can you make to our firm? Which computer programs can you use skillfully?<br><h2><b>Put Forth the Effort</b></h2><br>Many years ago I had the opportunity to teach at the university level, and I remember that some students seemed to know where they were going. They applied themselves, they had objectives, they had goals, and they worked toward the achievement of these objectives and goals. But other students could not have cared less. They seemed to be drifting on a sea of chance, with waves of failure threatening to engulf them. First they became lazy, then discouraged, and then indifferent, and then they became dropouts.<br><br>One such student who dropped out of school went home to his mother and said, "Mom, I've quit school. I'm going out to make my own way in the world." He packed his suitcase and went out to meet life head-on. After three weeks of meeting life, he called his mother. "Mom," he said, "remember telling me when I left home that if I quit school I wouldn't be able to get a job? Well, you were wrong. I've only been out on the road for three weeks, and I've already had six jobs!"<br><br>In your pursuit of excellence, real effort is required. Remember, "he which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully" (2 Corinthians 9:6).<br><br>Life is a sea upon which the proud are humbled, the shirker is exposed, and the leader is revealed. To sail it safely and reach your desired port, you need to keep your charts at hand and up-to-date. You need to learn by the experience of others, to stand firm for principles, to broaden your interests, to be understanding of the rights of others to sail the same sea, and to be reliable in the discharge of yourduty.<br><br>Your efforts in school will have a notable effect on your opportunities after you leave school. As you struggle for that grade point average, don't overlook the importance of really learning to think. Henry Ford, the great industrialist, said:<br><br><i>An educated man is not one whose memory is trained to carry a few dates in history--he is one who can accomplish things. A man who cannot think is not an educated man however many college degrees he may have acquired. Thinking is the hardest work any one can do--which is probably thereason why we have so few thinkers.</i><sup>4</sup><br><h2><b>Prepare Spiritually</b></h2><br>Greater than our period of academic preparation is the matter of spiritual preparation. We must acquire for ourselves a testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ, which testimony will be an anchor to our soul.<br><br>In this inquiring, uncertain period of your lives, some of you may ask, as did Pilate, the Roman procurator in Judea at the time of Christ, "What is truth?" (John 18:38). And again we turn to the revelations for guidance:<br><br><i>And that which doth not edify is not of God, and is darkness.</i><br><br><i>That which is of God is light.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 50:23–24]<br><br>Thousands of honest, searching souls continue to be confronted by that penetrating question which coursed through the mind of Joseph Smith as he surveyed the declarations made by the churches of his community concerning who is right and who is wrong. Josephsaid:<br><br><i>In the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions, I often said to myself: What is to be done? Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together? If any one of them be right, which is it, and how shall I know it? . . .</i><br><br><i>At length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in darkness and confusion, or else I must do as James directs, that is, ask of God.</i> [Joseph Smith--History 1:10, 13]<br><br>He prayed. The results of that prayer are best described in Joseph's own words. You know them:<br><br><i>I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other--</i>This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him! [Joseph Smith--History 1:17; emphasis in original]<br><br>Joseph listened; Joseph learned. His question had been answered.<br><br>To those who humbly seek, there is no need to stumble or falter along the pathway leading to truth. It is well marked by our Heavenly Father. We must first have a desire to know for ourselves. We must study. We must pray. We must do the will of the Father. And then we will know the truth, and the truth will make us free. Divine favor will attend those who humbly seek it. That is a promise which I leave with you. Think of it.<br><br>Remember that doubt and faith cannot exist in the mind at the same time, for one will dispel the other. Whereas doubt destroys, faith fulfills. An attitude of faith brings one closer to God and to His purposes.<br><br>President David O. McKay often mentioned:<br><br><i>Man's earthly existence is but a test as to whether he will concentrate his efforts, his mind, his soul, upon things which contribute to the comfort and gratification of his physical nature, or whether he will make as his life's pursuit the acquisition of spiritual qualities.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>Faith implies a certain trust, even a reliance, upon the word of our Creator.<br><br>If you should have doubting thoughts, remember the counsel given by President Stephen L Richards, a former counselor in the First Presidency, who declared:<br><br><i>Just say to those skeptical, disturbing, rebellious thoughts, "I propose to stay with my faith, with the faith of my people. I know that happiness and contentment are there and I forbid you, agnostic, doubting thoughts, to destroy the house of my faith. I acknowledge that I do not understand the processes of creation, but I accept the fact of it. I grant that I cannot explain the miracles of the Bible and I do not attempt to do so, but I accept God's word. I wasn't with Joseph, but I believe him. My faith did not come to me through science and I will not permit science to destroy it."</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>As your preparatory period at school comes to a close and you embark on the great race of life, may I suggest some helpful hints which will assist you to achieve your great expectations.<br><h2><b>Avoid Life's Pitfalls</b></h2><br><i>First, avoid the pitfalls in the track.</i> Avoid the detours which will deprive you of your celestial reward. You can recognize them if you will. They may be labeled "Oh, just this once won't matter" or "My parents are so old-fashioned."<br><br>Bad habits also can be such pitfalls. At first we could break them if we <i>would.</i> Later, we would break them if we <i>could.</i> John Dryden, an influential English poet and playwright of the 17th century, wrote:<br><br><i>Ill habits gather by unseen degrees,</i><br><i>As brooks make rivers, rivers run to seas.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>Good habits, on the other hand, are the soul's muscles. The more you use them, the stronger they grow.<br><br>Our Heavenly Father has counseled us to seek after "anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy" (Articles of Faith 1:13). Permissiveness, immorality, and the power of peer pressure cause many to be tossed about on a sea of sin and crushed on the jagged reefs of lost opportunities, forfeited blessings, and shattered dreams.<br><br>Whatever you read, listen to, or watch makes an impression on you.<br><br>Avoid any semblance of pornography. It is dangerous and addictive. If you continue to view pornography, your spirit will become desensitized and your conscience will erode.<br><br>Don't be afraid to walk out of a movie, turn off a television set, or change the radio station if what's being presented does not meet your Heavenly Father's standards. In short, if you have any question about whether a particular movie, book, or other form of entertainment is appropriate, don't see it, don't read it, don't participate.<br><h2><b>Persevere Toward Goals</b></h2><br><i>Second, beware of the flashy start and the fade-out finish.</i> I love the simple wisdom found in this poem by an unknown author. I don't think it's a literary masterpiece, but you can understand it.<br><br><i>Stick to your task till it sticks to you;</i><br><i>Beginners are many, but enders are few.</i><br><i>Honor, power, place, and praise</i><br><i>Will come, in time, to the one who stays.</i><br><br><i>Stick to your task till it sticks to you;</i><br><i>Bend at it, sweat at it, smile at it too;</i><br><i>For out of the bend and the sweat and the smile</i><br><i>Will come life's victories, after awhile.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>Formula "W" is interesting: "Work will win when wishy-washy wishing won't." An attitude of work results in the capacity to make continuous effort toward the accomplishment of a given goal.<br><br>I've always been an ardent sports fan. Long will I remember one sportscaster as he praised the marvelous performance of Y. A. Tittle, one of the all-time great professional football quarterbacks. He said:<br><br><i>This will be the key play of the game. Tittle has the snap from center; he fades to throw, but his line cannot hold. It appears the game is over.</i><br><br><i>Wait! Wait! Tittle has eluded his tacklers; he's fallen deep behind the line. He cocks his arm to throw, and the pass is away and caught in the end zone for a touchdown.</i><br><br><i>That was a great second effort by Y. A. Tittle!</i><br><br>In the game of life, a second effort is often required. The happy life is not ushered in at any age to the sound of drums and trumpets. It grows upon us year by year, little by little, until at last we realize that we have it. It is achieved by a body of work done so well that we can lift our heads with assurance and look the world in the eye.<br><br>Follow the example of Christopher Columbus. Take a leaf out of the log of his journal on his first voyage. Day after day, as they hoped to find land and never found it, he wrote simply, "This day we sailed on."<sup>9</sup> Perseverance will pay rich rewards.<br><h2><b>Help Others</b></h2><br><i>Third, help others in their race of life.</i> Remember that when you help another up a mountain, you are a little nearer the top yourself. Try to look at your brother or your sister in the right perspective. One man said, "I looked at my brother through the microscope of criticism, and I said, 'How coarse my brother is.' Ilooked at my brother through the telescope of scorn, and I said, 'How small my brother is.' Then I looked into the mirror of truth, and I said, 'How like me my brother is.'"<br><br>An attitude of love characterized the mission of the Master. He gave sight to the blind, legs to the lame, and life to the dead. Perhaps when we make face-to-face contact with our Maker, we will not be asked, "How many positions did you hold?" but rather, "How many people did you help?" In reality, you can never love the Lord until you serve Him by serving His people.<br><h2><b>Seek the Lord's Help</b></h2><br><i>Fourth, and finally, seek the help of the Lord.</i> Souls are precious--your soul and my soul. Our Heavenly Father Himself has said so.<br><br>Remember that we do not run alone in this great race of life; we are entitled to the help of the Lord. To the Hebrews the Apostle Paul urged:<br><br><i>Lay aside . . . sin . . . , and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,</i><br><br><i>Looking</i> [for an example] <i>unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith.</i> [Hebrews 12:1–2]<br><br>Before we can take Him as our companion, before we can follow Him as our guide, we must find Him. In order to find Him, I would like to suggest, first of all, that we must make room for Him in our lives. He said, "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head" (Matthew 8:20).<br><br>The physician Luke described the nativity scene: "And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn" (Luke 2:7).<br><br>The invitation of the Lord is directed to each of us. Think of it as the words of the Lord to you individually: "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him [and, I might add, to her]" (Revelation 3:20).<br><br>Oh, my young brothers and sisters, make room for the Lord in your homes and in your hearts, and He will be your companion. He will be by your side. He will teach you the way of truth. With His help, and with the preparation about which we have spoken, you can go forward in this race of life and achieve your own great expectations. Then, at the conclusion of it all, you'll be able to say, "I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith" (2 Timothy 4:7).<br><br>By so doing, the blessings of heaven will attend. He who notes the sparrow's fall will, inHis own way, acknowledge our service.<br><br>Let me share with you an experience that illustrates this assurance.<br><br>Brother Edwin Q. Cannon Jr., we call him Ted, was a missionary to Germany in 1938. He loved the people and served faithfully. At the conclusion of his mission, he returned home to Salt Lake City. He married and commenced his own business.<br><br>Forty years passed by. One day Brother Cannon came to my office and said he had been pruning his missionary photographs. (That's a good word. You go through all of them, throw two away, and keep all rest.) Among those photographs he had kept since his mission were several which he could not specifically identify. Every time he had planned to discard them, he had been impressed to keep them, although he was at a loss as to why. They were photographs taken by Brother Cannon during his mission when he served in Stettin, Germany, and were of a family--a mother, a father, a small girl, and a small boy. He knew their surname was Berndt but could remember nothing more about them. He indicated that he understood there was a Berndt who was a Church leader in Germany, and he thought, although the possibility was remote, that this Berndt might have some connection with the Berndts who had lived in Stettin and who were depicted in the photographs. Before disposing of the photos, he thought he would check with me.<br><br>I told Brother Cannon I was leaving shortly for Berlin, where I anticipated that I would see Dieter Berndt, the Church leader, and that I would show the photographs to him to see if there was any relationship and if he wanted them. There was a possibility I would also see Brother Berndt's sister, who was married to Dietmar Matern, a stake president in Hamburg.<br><br>The Lord didn't even let me get to Berlin before His purposes were accomplished. I was in Zurich, Switzerland, boarding the flight to Berlin, when who should also board the plane but Dieter Berndt. He sat next to me, and I told him I had some old photos of people named Berndt from Stettin. I handed them to him and asked if he could identify those shown in the photographs. As he looked at them carefully, he began to weep. He said, "Our family lived in Stettin during the war. My father was killed when an Allied bomb struck the plant where he worked. Not long afterward, the Russians invaded Poland and the area of Stettin. My mother took my sister and me and fled from the approaching enemy. Everything had to be left behind, including any photographs we had. Brother Monson, I am the little boy pictured in these photographs, and my sister is the little girl. The man and woman are our dear parents. Until today, I had no photographs of our childhood in Stettin or of my father."<br><br>Wiping away my own tears, I told Brother Berndt the photographs were his. He placed them carefully and lovingly in his briefcase.<br><br>At the next general conference, when Dieter Berndt visited Salt Lake City, he paid a visit to Brother and Sister Edwin Cannon Jr. so that he might express in person his gratitude for the inspiration that came to Brother Cannon to retain these precious photographs and for the fact that he followed that inspiration in keeping them for 40 years.<br><br>William Cowper penned the lines:<br><br><i>God moves in a mysterious way</i><br><i>His wonders to perform;</i><br><i>He plants His footsteps in the sea,</i><br><i>And rides upon the storm.</i><br><i>. . .</i><br><i>Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,</i><br><i>But trust Him for His grace;</i><br><i>Behind a frowning providence</i><br><i>He hides a smiling face.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>This testimony I bear to you, this witness Igive unto you, that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the Living God, that He is our Elder Brother, He is our Redeemer, He is our Savior, and He is the author of your great expectations.<br><br>I leave with you my blessing; I express to you my love. You are a choice generation with great expectations. May our Heavenly Father ever guide and bless you; may you strive always to achieve those great expectations, Ipray, in the name of Jesus Christ, our Savior, amen.<br><br><i>Thomas S.

<h1>member Lot&#039;s Wife:&quot; Faith Is For the Future - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
You all look so good. Sister Holland walked in and said, "I think I'm going to cry." You have to understand: Give yourselves 20 or 30 years--then you'll know how we feel coming back here.<br><br>We love this campus. We're thrilled to be with you on it, and we love you personally with all our hearts.<br><br>You have had, will have, and now have better university presidents than I was, but you'll never have one who loves you and loves this university more than I do. Thank you for serving here, and thank you for being in attendance on a bright, clear, January morning.<br><br>We are grateful to President and Sister Samuelson for their kindness and their leadership at this university. We actually know something about their jobs and what they entail. You and we are very lucky to have them at the helm of this special school, and we praise them publicly for the time they spend, the success they are having, and the strength that they bring. Iloved every word of their counsel to you last week, and I pray that my remarks to you today are consistent with their messages about light, about trust, and about the privilege it is to have the gospel of Jesus Christ enhance our study at BYU. President and Sister Samuelson, we do love you. You have our prayers, our gratitude, and our support.<br><br>The start of a new year is the traditional time to take stock of our lives and see where we are going, measured against the backdrop of where we have been. I don't want to talk to you about New Year's resolutions, because you only made five of them and you have already broken four. (I give that remaining one just another week.) But I do want to talk to you about the past and the future, not so much in terms of New Year's commitments per se, but more with an eye toward <i>any</i> time of transition and change in your lives--and those moments come virtually every day of our lives.<br><br>As a scriptural theme for this discussion, Ihave chosen the second-shortest verse in all of holy scripture. I am told that the shortest verse--a verse that every missionary memorizes and holds ready in case he is called on spontaneously in a zone conference--is <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/11.35?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John 11:35</a></span>: "Jesus wept." Elders, here is a second option, another shortie that will dazzle your mission president in case you are called on two zone conferences in a row. It is <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/17.32?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luke 17:32</a></span>, where the Savior cautions, "Remember Lot's wife."<br><br>Hmmm. What did He mean by such an enigmatic little phrase? To find out, I suppose we need to do as He suggested. Let's recall who Lot's wife was.<br><br>The original story, of course, comes to us out of the days of Sodom and Gomorrah, when the Lord, having had as much as He could stand of the worst that men and women could do, told Lot and his family to flee because those cities were about to be destroyed. "Escape for thy life," the Lord said, "<i>look not behind thee</i> ... ; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/19.17?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genesis 19:17</a></span>; emphasis added).<br><br>With less than immediate obedience and more than a little negotiation, Lot and his family ultimately did leave town, but just in the nick of time. The scriptures tell us what happened at daybreak the morning following their escape:<br><br><i>The Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven;</i><br><br><i>And he overthrew those cities.</i> [<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/19.24-25?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genesis 19:24–25</a></span>]<br><br>Then our theme today comes in the next verse. Surely, surely, with the Lord's counsel "look not behind thee" ringing clearly in her ears, Lot's wife, the record says, "looked back," and she was turned into a pillar of salt.<br><br>In the time we have this morning, I am not going to talk to you about the sins of Sodom and Gomorrah, nor of the comparison the Lord Himself has made to those days and our own time. I am not even going to talk about obedience and disobedience. I just want to talk to you for a few minutes about looking back and looking ahead.<br><br>One of the purposes of history is to teach us the lessons of life. George Santayana, who should be more widely read than he is on a college campus, is best known for saying, "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it" (<i>Reason in Common Sense,</i> vol. 1 of <i>The Life of Reason</i> [1905–1906]).<br><br>So, if history is this important--and it surely is--what did Lot's wife do that was so wrong? As something of a student of history, I have thought about that and offer this as a partial answer. Apparently what was wrong with Lot's wife was that she wasn't just <i>looking</i> back; in her heart she wanted to <i>go</i> back. It would appear that even before they were past the city limits, she was already missing what Sodom and Gomorrah had offered her. As Elder Maxwell once said, such people know they should have their primary residence in Zion, but they still hope to keep a summer cottage in Babylon (see Larry W. Gibbons, <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2006/10/wherefore-settle-this-in-your-hearts?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Wherefore, Settle This in Your Hearts,"</a></span> <i>Ensign,</i> November 2006, 102; also Neal A. Maxwell, <i>A Wonderful Flood of Light</i> [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1990], 47).<br><br>It is possible that Lot's wife looked back with resentment toward the Lord for what He was asking her to leave behind. We certainly know that Laman and Lemuel were resentful when Lehi and his family were commanded to leave Jerusalem. So it isn't just that she looked back; she looked back <i>longingly.</i> In short, her attachment to the past outweighed her confidence in the future. That, apparently, was at least part of her sin.<br><br>So, as a new year starts and we try to benefit from a proper view of what has gone before, I plead with you not to dwell on days now gone, nor to yearn vainly for yesterdays, however good those yesterdays may have been. The past is to be learned from but not lived in. We look back to claim the embers from glowing experiences but not the ashes. And when we have learned what we need to learn and have brought with us the best that we have experienced, then we look ahead, we remember that <i>faith is always pointed toward the future.</i> Faith always has to do with blessings and truths and events that will <i>yet</i> be efficacious in our lives. So a more theological way to talk about Lot's wife is to say that she did not have faith. She doubted the Lord's ability to give her something better than she already had. Apparently she thought--fatally, as it turned out--that nothing that lay ahead could possibly be as good as those moments she was leaving behind.<br><br>It is here at this moment in this little story that we wish Lot's wife had been a student at BYU enrolled in a freshman English class. With any luck, she might have read, as I did, this verse from Edwin Arlington Robinson:<br><br><i>Miniver Cheevy, child of scorn,</i><br><br><i>Grew lean while he assailed the seasons;</i><br><br><i>He wept that he was ever born,</i><br><br><i>And he had reasons.</i><br><br><i>Miniver loved the days of old</i><br><br><i>When swords were bright and steeds were prancing;</i><br><br><i>The vision of a warrior bold</i><br><br><i>Would set him dancing.</i><br><br><i>Miniver sighed for what was not,</i><br><br><i>And dreamed, and rested from his labors;</i><br><br><i>He dreamed of Thebes and Camelot,</i><br><br><i>And Priam's neighbors. . . .</i><br><br><i>Miniver cursed the commonplace</i><br><br><i>And eyed a khaki suit with loathing;</i><br><br><i>He missed the medieval grace</i><br><br><i>Of iron clothing. . . .</i><br><br><i>Miniver Cheevy, born too late,</i><br><br><i>Scratched his head and kept on thinking;</i><br><br><i>Miniver coughed, and called it fate,</i><br><br><i>And kept on drinking.</i><br><br>[<i>Miniver Cheevy</i> (1910), stanzas 1–3, 6, 8]<br><br>To yearn to go back to a world that cannot be lived in now; to be perennially dissatisfied with present circumstances and have only dismal views of the future; to miss the here-and-now-and-tomorrow because we are so trapped in the there-and-then-and-yesterday--these are some of the sins, if we may call them that, of both Lot's wife and old Mr. Cheevy. (Now, as a passing comment, I don't know whether Lot's wife, like Miniver, was a drinker, but if she was, she certainly ended up with plenty of salt for her pretzels.)<br><br>One of my favorite books of the New Testament is Paul's too-seldom-read letter to the Philippians. After reviewing the very privileged and rewarding life of his early years--his birthright, his education, his standing in the Jewish community--Paul says that all of that was nothing ("dung" he calls it) compared to his conversion to Christianity. He says, and I paraphrase: "I have stopped rhapsodizing about 'the good old days' and now eagerly look toward the future 'that I may apprehend that for which Christ apprehended me.'" Then comes this verse:<br><br><i>This one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,</i><br><br><i>I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</i> [<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/philip/3.13-14?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Philippians 3:13–14</a></span>]<br><br>No Lot's wife here. No looking back at Sodom and Gomorrah here. Paul knows it is out there in the future, up ahead wherever heaven is taking us where we will win "the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus."<br><br>At this point, let me pause and add a lesson that applies both in your own life and also in the lives of others. There is something in us, at least in too many of us, that particularly fails to forgive and forget earlier mistakes in life--either mistakes we ourselves have made or the mistakes of others. That is not good. It is not Christian. It stands in terrible opposition to the grandeur and majesty of the Atonement of Christ. To be tied to earlier mistakes--our own or other people's--is the worst kind of wallowing in the past from which we are called to cease and desist.<br><br>I was told once of a young man who for many years was more or less the brunt of every joke in his school. He had some disadvantages, and it was easy for his peers to tease him. Later in his life he moved away from his community. He eventually joined the army and had some successful experiences there in getting an education and generally stepping away from his past. Above all, as many in the military do, he discovered the beauty and majesty of the Church and became very active and happy in it.<br><br>Then, after several years, he came back to the town of his youth. Most of his generation had moved on, but not all. Apparently when he returned quite successful and quite reborn, the same old mind-set that had existed before was still there, waiting for his return. To the people in his hometown he was still just old "so and so"--you remember the guy who had the problem, that idiosyncrasy, this quirky nature, and did such and such and such and such. And wasn't it all just hilarious?<br><br>Well, you know what happened. Little by little this man's Pauline effort to leave that which was behind and grasp the prize that God had laid before him was gradually diminished until he died about the way he had lived in his youth. He came full circle: again inactive and unhappy and the brunt of a new generation of jokes. Yet he had had that one bright, beautiful midlife moment when he had been able to rise above his past and truly see who he was and what he could become. Too bad, too sad, that he was again to be surrounded by a whole batch of Lot's wives, those who thought his past was more interesting than his future. Yes, they managed to rip out of his grasp that for which Christ had grasped him. And he died even more sadly than Miniver Cheevy, though as far as I know the story, through absolutely no fault of his own.<br><br>That happens in marriages, too, and in other relationships we have. I can't tell you the number of couples I have counseled who, when they are deeply hurt or even just deeply stressed, reach farther and farther into the past to find yet a bigger brick to throw through the window "pain" of their marriage. When something is over and done with, when it has been repented of as fully as it can be repented of, when life has moved on as it should and a lot of other wonderfully good things have happened since then, it is <i>not</i> right to go back and open up some ancient wound that the Son of God Himself died trying to heal.<br><br><i>Let people repent. Let people grow. Believe that people can change and improve.</i> Is that faith? Yes! Is that hope? Yes! Is it charity? Yes! Above all, it is charity, the pure love of Christ. If something is buried in the past, leave it buried. Don't keep going back with your little sand pail and beach shovel to dig it up, wave it around, and then throw it at someone, saying, "Hey! Do you remember <i>this?</i>" Splat!<br><br>Well, guess what? That is probably going to result in some ugly morsel being dug up out of <i>your</i> landfill with the reply, "Yeah, I remember it. Do <i>you</i> remember <i>this?</i>" Splat.<br><br>And soon enough everyone comes out of that exchange dirty and muddy and unhappy and hurt, when what God, our Father in Heaven, pleads for is cleanliness and kindness and happiness and healing.<br><br>Such dwelling on past lives, including past mistakes, is just not right! It is not the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is worse than Miniver Cheevy, and in some ways worse than Lot's wife, because at least there he and she were only destroying themselves. In these cases of marriage and family and wards and apartments and neighborhoods, we can end up destroying so many, many others.<br><br>Perhaps at this beginning of a new year there is no greater requirement for us than to do as the Lord Himself said He does: "Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.42?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D&amp;amp;C 58:42</a></span>).<br><br>The proviso, of course, is that repentance has to be sincere, but when it is and when honest effort is being made to progress, we are guilty of the greater sin if we keep remembering and recalling and rebashing someone with their earlier mistakes--and that "someone" might be ourselves. We can be so hard on ourselves, often much more so than with others!<br><br>Now, like the Anti-Nephi-Lehies of the Book of Mormon, bury your weapons of war, and leave them buried. Forgive, and do that which is harder than to forgive: Forget. And when it comes to mind again, forget it again.<br><br>You can remember just enough to avoid repeating the mistake, but then put the rest of it all on the dung heap Paul spoke of to those Philippians. Dismiss the destructive and keep dismissing it until the beauty of the Atonement of Christ has revealed to you your bright future and the bright future of your family and your friends and your neighbors. God doesn't care nearly as much about where you have been as He does about where you are and, with His help, where you are willing to go. That is the thing Lot's wife didn't get--and neither did Laman and Lemuel and a host of others in the scriptures.<br><br>This is an important matter to consider at the start of a new year--and every day ought to be the start of a new year and a new life. Such is the wonder of faith and repentance and the miracle of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>We started this hour with a little verse remembered from one of my BYU English classes. May I move toward a close with a few lines from another favorite poet whom I probably met in that same class or one similar to it. For the benefit of all BYU students in the new year of 2009, Robert Browning wrote:<br><br><i>Grow old along with me!</i><br><br><i>The best is yet to be,</i><br><br><i>The last of life, for which the first was made:</i><br><br><i>Our times are in His hand</i><br><br><i>Who saith, "A whole I planned,</i><br><br><i>Youth shows but half; trust God: see all, nor be afraid!"</i><br><br>[<i>Rabbi Ben Ezra</i> (1864), stanza 1]<br><br>Sister Holland and I were married about the time both of us were reading poems like that in BYU classrooms. We were as starstruck--and as fearful--as most of you are at these ages and stages of life. We had absolutely no money. Zero. For a variety of reasons, neither of our families was able to help finance our education. We had a small apartment just south of campus--the smallest we could find: two rooms and a half bath. We were both working too many hours trying to stay afloat financially, but we had no other choice.<br><br>I remember one fall day--I think it was in the first semester after our marriage in 1963--we were walking together up the hill past the Maeser Building on the sidewalk that led between the President's Home and the Brimhall Building. Somewhere on that path we stopped and wondered what we had gotten ourselves into. Life that day seemed so overwhelming, and the undergraduate plus graduate years that we still anticipated before us seemed monumental, nearly insurmountable. Our love for each other and our commitment to the gospel were strong, but most of all the other temporal things around us seemed particularly ominous.<br><br>On a spot that I could probably still mark for you today, I turned to Pat and said something like this: "Honey, should we give up? I can get a good job and carve out a good living for us. I can do some things. I'll be okay without a degree. Should we stop trying to tackle what right now seems so difficult to face?"<br><br>In my best reenactment of Lot's wife, I said, in effect, "Let's go back. Let's go home. The future holds nothing for us."<br><br>Then my beloved little bride did what she has done for 45 years since then. She grabbed me by the lapels and said, "We are not going back. We are not going home. The future holds <i>everything</i> for us."<br><br>She stood there in the sunlight that day and gave me a real talk. I don't recall that she quoted Paul, but there was certainly plenty in her voice that said she was committed to setting aside all that was past in order to "press toward the mark" and seize the prize of God that lay yet ahead. It was a living demonstration of faith. It was "the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/heb/11.1?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hebrews 11:1</a></span>). So we laughed, kept walking, and finished up sharing a root beer--one glass, two straws--at the then newly constructed Wilkinson Center.<br><br>Twenty years later I would, on occasion, look out of the window of the President's Home across the street from the Brimhall Building and picture there on the sidewalk two newlywed BYU students, down on their money and down even more on their confidence. And as I would gaze out that window, usually at night, I would occasionally see not Pat and Jeff Holland but you and you and you, walking that same sidewalk. I would see you sometimes as couples, sometimes as a group of friends, sometimes as just a lone student. I knew something of what you were feeling. Some of you were having thoughts such as these: Is there any future for me? What does a new year or a new semester or a new major or a new romance hold for me? Will I be safe? Will life be sound? Can I trust in the Lord and in the future? Or would it be better to look back, to go back, to go home?<br><br>To all such of every generation, I call out, "Remember Lot's wife." Faith is for the future. Faith builds on the past but never longs to stay there. Faith trusts that God has great things in store for each of us and that Christ truly is the "high priest of good things to come."<br><br>My young brothers and sisters, I pray you will have a wonderful semester, a wonderful new year, and a wonderful life all filled with faith and hope and charity. Keep your eyes on your dreams, however distant and far away. Live to see the miracles of repentance and forgiveness, of trust and divine love that will transform your life today, tomorrow, and forever. That is a New Year's resolution I ask you to keep, and I leave a blessing on you--every one of you--to be able to do so and to be happy, in the name of Him who makes it all possible, even the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Jeffrey R.

<br>
I love words and word origins. One of my favorite words is <i>serendipity,</i> because it is one of those words that just rolls off the tongue. I know it's strange, but I get a great deal of pleasure saying certain words, and <i>serendipity</i> is one of them. <i>Serendipity</i> is defined as the occurrence and development of events by chance in a beneficial way. Its origin is attributed to Horace Walpole, an English poet and writer who coined the term from the heroes of the fairy tale The Three Princes of Serendip, who "were always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things which they were not in quest of" (in letter to Horace Mann, 28 January 1754; quoted in <i>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language,</i> 4th ed., 2000, s.v. "serendipity").<br><br>According to British-born author and Sri Lankan lexicographer Richard Boyle, the story of the three princes of Serendip is an old Persian or possibly Indian fairy tale about three princes from Serendip who, having been taught by the wisest men in the kingdom, are sent by their father on a mission of observation. They discover things by good fortune and sagacity (discernment or wisdom). For example, in one part the three princes use trace clues to precisely identify a camel they have never seen that has been lost by its driver. When the driver asks if they have seen the camel, they say no, but they then ask the driver if his camel is lame, blind in one eye, missing a tooth, carrying a pregnant maiden, and bearing honey on one side and butter on the other. The driver is astonished that, having never seen it, they could know that much about the camel, eventually accuses them of stealing the camel, and has them arrested.<br><br>When they are brought before the emperor, he asks them how they knew about the camel. They explain how they deduced the characteristics of the camel from simple observations, and the emperor is so impressed with their wisdom and judgment that he not only spares their lives but also appoints them as his advisors and rewards them. The rewards, which were unsought, came serendipitously--not because they had been seeking them, but because they were in the right place at the right time and doing the right things. (See Richard Boyle, "The Three Princes of Serendip" [part 1] and "Serendipity and the Three Princes" [part 2], <i>Colombo [Sri Lanka] Sunday Times,</i> 30 July and 6 August 2000, www.sundaytimes.lk/000730/plus7.html#7LABEL1 and www.sundaytimes.lk/000806/plus6.html#6LABEL1.)<br><br>This reminds me of a statement expressed by former BYU professor and poet Arthur Henry King in his book <i>The Abundance of the Heart,</i> in which he stated:<br><br><i>If we aim at self-fulfillment, we shall never be fulfilled. If we aim at education, we shall never become educated. If we aim at salvation, we shall never be saved. These things are indirect, supreme results of doing something else; and the something else is service, it is righteousness, it is trying to do the right thing, the thing that needs to be done at each moment.</i> [<i>The Abundance of the Heart</i> (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1986), 255]<br><br>I love this quote for two reasons. First, the sentiment it portrays focuses on process or means and not on ends. When I was an undergraduate student here many years ago, I took asummer job working for a very wealthy man. He was an interesting man and one, I must admit, I didn't like very much. However, he taught me something that I have never forgotten, and, like Arthur Henry King, it had more to do with process than with outcomes.<br><br>At one point in an orientation, someone asked him what he was worth or how much money he made. He took this opportunity to teach us a lesson. He told us that he had only a vague idea of how much he was worth or how much money he made, as neither of those were his primary goals. His goal was to deliver the best product in the most efficient way. He said that if you focus on the process, then the ends will come. In this case, the process was delivering a product and the end was a high income.<br><br>I decided to try and apply that principle to my schooling: instead of focusing on the end (grades), I would focus on the process (learning). I determined that if I could go into every class with the attitude that I was going to learn as much as possible, and put forth the effort to do so, then I would be happy with whatever the outcome. Although I still had a vague idea of how I did in every class, I never again picked up my report card to see my final grades. Did I then get an A in every class? No. Were there classes that I was frustrated with? Were there classes in which I did not particularly like the way a professor taught? Was there an 8:00 a.m. art history class in which I accidently fell asleep because they always turned out the lights? Yes. (And, by the way, I feel bad about falling asleep in that class to this day.) My grades did improve, but what I really gained was not improved grades but an increased love of learning and freedom from worrying about whether or not I would be judged as good enough.<br><br>The second reason I like the quote is the phrase "the thing that needs to be done at each moment." Life for me is just a series of moments. Most of these are normal, everyday moments that are difficult to differentiate one from the other--moments that we rarely reflect on or even notice. Nevertheless, there are moments in life when, like the three princes of Serendip, we are in the right place at the right time and when we need to do the right thing.<br><br>For example, I enjoy watching college football, and I have often heard it said that the outcome of a close and evenly matched game will be determined by just a few plays. Now, if the players knew what those plays were in advance, they could specifically prepare for them and put forth their best effort on just those plays. But they don't know which plays they will be. Because of that uncertainty, it's necessary for them to be fully prepared and to put forth their best effort all of the time--to be in the right place at the right time and doing the right thing in order to have the biggest impact. Those three or four or five plays in a game--or those five or 10 or 100 moments in life--will determine, to a large extent, the outcome.<br><br>In many cases we will not know what the crucial plays or moments will be until we can look back and analyze what happened. When we do the analysis, we may find that it wasn't the big plays or moments that made the most difference. President Gordon B. Hinckley, in the book<i> Stand a Little Taller, </i>said:<br><br><i>The course of our lives is seldom determined by great, life-altering decisions. Our direction is often set by the small, day-to-day choices that chart the track on which we run. This is the substance of our lives--making choices.</i> [<i>Stand a Little Taller</i> (Salt Lake City: Eagle Gate, 2001), 13]<br><br>The choices we make fill in the details of our lives and determine who we will become. In ancient times cartographers often labeled large areas on their maps as <i>terra incognita,</i> or "places unknown," because while the cartographers may have had a broad outline of the continents, they had little or no information about the details within. Similarly, as members of the Church, we have a broad outline of a spiritual map that provides information on where we came from, why we are here, and where we want to end up. This map is called the plan of salvation. It is within the plan of salvation that our lives are given and we obtain meaning.<br><br>I can't imagine not having such a blueprint for this life, and I will be forever grateful for the Restoration of the gospel; the Prophet Joseph Smith; my ancestors, who had the courage and fortitude to join the Church; and my parents, who taught me in the language and learning of the gospel. However, while the great plan of happiness does provide broad outlines for where we came from, why we are here, and where we are going, the details are less clear. Even with the insights gained from patriarchal blessings, current revelation, and modern-day prophets and apostles, we are still left with a terra incognita. I believe that for most of us here today, our spiritual maps have large territories labeled "places unknown"--that is, we have some idea of the beginning and we know where we want to end up. The question is: How do we get there?<br><br>In a general sense, we do as Moroni counseled in Mormon 9:27:<br><br><i>O then despise not, and wonder not, but hearken unto the words of the Lord, and ask the Father in the name of Jesus for what things soever ye shall stand in need. Doubt not, but be believing, and begin as in times of old, and come unto the Lord with all your heart, and work out your own salvation with fear and trembling before him.</i><br><br>How do we "work out [our] own salvation," or, keeping with the metaphor I have been using, how do we <i>map out</i> our salvation? How do we prepare for those moments in our lives when everything hangs in the balance, especially given the uncertainty of not knowing which moments will be the most important? How do we keep our perspective focused on the process of living the gospel? How do we integrate our lives into the gospel or the gospel into our lives in such a way that doing what's right at all times and in all places becomes habit? While the underlying principles are the same for all of us, the details will vary as we each journey into those unknown places and begin to fill in the details of our maps. As you continue on your journey in this life, I have a few suggestions that may help.<br><h2><b>First: Show Up</b></h2><br>Someone once asked the director/actor Woody Allen why he was so successful, and he told them that 80 percent of his success could be attributed to just showing up. I believe he meant that what made the difference was not just that he was there, but that he was there with the right attitude--as someone who was willing to learn, willing to work, and willing to start something that might be difficult, and then willing to come back the next day, knowing that it would be difficult.<br><br>My stake's welfare assignment is to go out to a Church dairy farm to do whatever is asked of us. This includes moving cows from one pen to another, branding, dehorning, fixing up and tearing down, cleaning, painting, and so forth. The work is generally not something most of us look forward to with great anticipation, but afterward we always look back on it warmly.<br><br>When we received our new stake calendar in December, we noticed that our ward's first assignment was on Saturday, January 3. This was relatively short notice and over a holiday weekend. We usually meet at the church about 7:15 a.m., have some doughnuts and hot chocolate (it's amazing what some of the youth will do for a doughnut), and head out about 7:30. We reach the farm about 8:00 and work for four hours. Some of you probably were not in the valley on January 3, but it snowed the previous night, and when we woke up we had close to a foot of snow on the ground. And it was cold. No members of the bishopric were able to go on this particular assignment, and we worried whether or not we would have anyone show up. But show up they did--we had 17 people show up, which is about what we always get, but that seemed like a lot for such a cold and snowy day on a holiday weekend. It was later reported to us by the Young Men president that the manager of the farm told him that any time he sees that a ward is coming from Elk Ridge, he never worries, because he knows that people from these wards show up ready and willing to work. I felt, probably unrighteously, proud of my ward for showing up.<br><br>Showing up, in this sense, equates to doing. One of my favorite scriptures is the entire book of James because it's about doing. For example, in James 1:22–25, James stated:<br><br><i>But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</i><br><br><i>For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:</i><br><br><i>For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.</i><br><br><i>But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.</i><br><br>Why is it so important that we show up? God doesn't really need us to do His will or His works. So why is it important? Because, as with all that God commands, He wants us to do it for our benefit. It is through doing the work that we become converted. In a recent missive to all of the faculty and staff, academic vice president John S. Tanner quoted the following from C. S. Lewis:<br><br><i>I had never noticed that all enjoyment spontaneously overflows into praise. . . . The world rings with praise--lovers praising their mistresses, readers their favourite poet, walkers praising the countryside, players praising their favourite game. . . . Ihad not noticed how the humblest, and at the same time most balanced and capacious, minds, praised most, while the cranks, misfits and malcontents praised least. . . . Praise almost seems to be inner health made audible. . . .</i><br><br><i>I think we delight to praise what we enjoy because the praise not merely expresses but completes the enjoyment; it is its appointed consummation. It is not out of compliment that lovers keep on telling one another how beautiful they are; the delight is incomplete till it is expressed.</i> [<i>Reflections on the Psalms</i> (New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company, 1958), 94–95]<br><br>I had also never thought of praise in this way before, and, as I started to ponder it, I had one of those moments when clarity struck--everything God asks us to do is for our benefit, not for His.<br><br>I started to better understand King Benjamin's address to his people concerning how we are unprofitable servants. Even when we do what is right for the right reasons, neither seeking nor wanting any reward, we are blessed--because the very act of doing what is right changes who we are for the better. We become more Christlike, which prepares us for eternal life--the greatest of all God's blessings. Somehow, for some reason, I always thought that such blessings were exogenous to the process, but they are not. To me this is an example of heavenly serendipity--we receive a reward that was not sought because we were in the place we needed to be at the time we needed to be there and doing what was right. Christ also taught this principle when He said:<br><br><i>My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</i><br><br><i>If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.</i> [John 7:16–17]<br><br>The knowing doesn't come in some intellectual way--it comes by changing who we are. Ibelieve this is what Alma was talking about inAlma 5:14, when he said:<br><br><i>And now behold, I ask of you, my brethren of the church, have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?</i><br><br>Conversion to Christ comes through the mighty change in our hearts, and the mighty change in our hearts can only come from doing His will. Thus, my first suggestion is to show up.<br><h2><b>Second: Recognize and Remember</b></h2><br>Just a few verses later, Alma asked members of the Church:<br><br><i>And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, if ye have experienced a change of heart, and if ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel so now?</i> [Alma 5:26]<br><br>One of the things I learned as I went through graduate school and since I have been teaching here at BYU is that we sometimes lean too much to our own understanding. Nephi warned us of this in 2 Nephi 9:28:<br><br><i>O that cunning plan of the evil one! O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and itprofiteth them not. And they shall perish.</i><br><br>It is clear from everything we are told in the Church about education, including President Monson's recent talk here in the Marriott Center, that Heavenly Father values an educated people. We have been told in scripture and repeatedly by prophets in this dispensation that we should gain as much education as possible. Learning--lifelong learning--is good. I don't believe there is ever too much learning or too much education, but we also need to remember that education misused "profiteth [us] not."<br><br>Simplifying it somewhat, I think that learning can have two outcomes for our spiritual journey here. First, it can humble us. I have been amazed that the more things I learn, the more things I realize I don't know. Learning does require and leads to questioning, but it can do so in a way that is not destructive of one's faith. A more dangerous outcome of learning is that it can lead from hubris to a discounting of eternal truths because they seem quaint or outdated; then to a trusting in the arm of flesh rather than in what current prophets and apostles tell us; and finally to dismissing as coincidence those tender mercies that we receive from the Lord.<br><br>Elder Bruce C. Hafen recounted the following story:<br><br><i>A few years ago, a university student related to his priesthood quorum a boyhood experience that happened just after he had been ordained a deacon in the Aaronic Priesthood. He had lived on a farm, and had been promised that a calf about to be born would be his very own to raise. One summer morning when his parents were away, he was working in the barn when the expectant cow began to calve prematurely. He watched in great amazement as the little calf was born and then, without warning, the mother cow suddenly rolled over the calf. She was trying to kill it. In his heart he cried out to the Lord for help. Not thinking about how much more the cow weighed than he did, he pushed on her with all his strength and somehow moved her away. He picked up the lifeless calf in his arms and, brokenhearted, looked at it, the tears running down his cheeks. Then he remembered that he now held the priesthood and had every right to pray for additional help. So he prayed from the depths of his boyish, believing heart. Before long the little animal began breathing again. He knew his prayer had been heard.</i><br><br><i>After relating this story, the tears welled up in his eyes and he said, "Brethren, I tell you that story because I don't think I would do now what I did then. Now that I am older, less naive, and more experienced, I 'know better' than to expect help in that kind of situation. I am not sure I would believe now, even if I relived that experience, that the calf's survival was anything more than a coincidence. Idon't understand what has happened to me since that time, but I sense that something has gone wrong."</i> ["Is Yours a Believing Heart?" <i>Ensign,</i> September 1974, 52–53]<br><br>Is it any wonder that Christ taught us that we have to be as little children to enter the kingdom of heaven? I do not believe that the fellow in this story is alone in feeling the way he does. Too many of us sense that something has gone wrong in our lives. Why do we stop believing? Why aren't the signs and signals from God clearer? Doesn't God want us to know for a surety? Why should we have to struggle with discerning between God's power and simple coincidence? Maybe this is a better question: Would a more direct manifestation of God's power cause us to believe in Him? But would that not eliminate our agency? Elder Hafen put it this way:<br><br><i>The Lord has used the highly visible forms of his power so sparingly--enough to leave us with clear witnesses but not enough to compel us to believe. ...</i><br><br><i>What a careful balance has been struck between too much and not enough in the manifestations of divine power. How essential, then, to be willing to recognize the quiet evidences for what they are.</i> ["IsYours a Believing Heart?" 55]<br><br>My second suggestion is to learn to recognize the hand of the Lord in your life, to listen to the whisperings of the Spirit that can and will guide and direct your path, and to remember with childlike innocence those coincidences in life that brought you closer to God.<br><h2><b>Third: Enjoy the Journey</b></h2><br>Let's go back to serendipity for a minute. In his book <i>The Last Voyage of Somebody the Sailor,</i> John Barth said, "You don't reach Serendib by plotting a course for it. You have to set out in good faith for elsewhere and lose your bearings . . . serendipitously" ([Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1991], 13).<br><br>I am afraid that I was one of those people who set out for Serendib, or Serendip, and never seemed to get there. I thought that as soon as I reached the next milestone in my life I would be happy--as soon as I graduated from college, as soon as I got married, as soon as I finished graduate school, as soon as I completed my dissertation, as soon as I got my first real job, and so forth. Then one beautiful spring evening as I was walking down the stairs toward the Richards Building and enjoying a spectacular sunset, I had an epiphany: This was my life, and it wasn't getting any better than it was at that moment. The Spirit whispered to me to quit looking forward to what might be and start making do with whatis.<br><br>As I stood there feeling dumbfounded, I felt an enormous weight lift from my shoulders. Now, if you ask people who know me, they will probably wonder if I have in fact changed, but I have. I have been blessed in my life far beyond anything I actually planned for. Trying to do the right thing, even in places I had never planned on being, has given me unsought-after rewards so great that I am continually amazed at how the Lord has blessed my life.<br><br>Standing on those stairs, I realized that I had found Serendip and didn't even know it. For the first time in a long time, I felt at peace with who I was, with what I was doing, and with where I was. I knew then and have had it confirmed many times since that I am supposed to be here doing what I am doing. (Although I do think I will enjoy it much more when I am no longer department chair!) True joy comes from preparing to make and then actually making the right choices in the right places at the right times--and then not worrying about what might or might not happen.<br><br>In a recent talk, Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin told the following story about Elder Matthew Cowley:<br><br><i>When Elder Matthew Cowley (1897–1953) was first called into the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, President J. Reuben Clark (1871–1961) invited him into his office and counseled with him about his new assignment. President Clark was one of the great leaders and thinkers of the Church. He left a post as the United States ambassador to Mexico to accept a position in the First Presidency of the Church. He was a man long accustomed to bearing the weight ofheavy responsibility.</i><br><br><i>As the meeting between Elder Cowley and President Clark drew to a close, President Clark said, "Now, my boy, kid [President Clark called all the members of the Quorum of the Twelve 'kid']--Now, kid, don't forget rule six." Elder Cowley asked, "What's rule six?" President Clark said, "Don't take yourself too darn seriously." Elder Cowley asked, "What are the other five?" President Clark said, "There aren't any."</i> ["Lessons Learned in the Journey of Life," <i>Ensign,</i> December 2000, 12; see <i>Matthew Cowley Speaks</i> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1954), 132–33]<br><br>Life is a serious business, but not so serious that we should not enjoy it, take the opportunities that have been given to us and make the most of them, and, as Elder Wirthlin counseled us in his last conference address, learn how to laugh. So my third suggestion is to enjoy the journey.<br><h2><b>Fourth: Endure to the End</b></h2><br>In Lehi's vision of the tree of life, the path to the tree is "strait and narrow" (1 Nephi 8:20). Idon't know about you, but I have always envisioned the path as being on relatively flat terrain. While the scriptures tell us time and again the path is strait and narrow, it doesn't say anything about it being level. If my experience is any indication, those who walk the path will be going down some steep inclines, up some rugged ravines, and across some raging rivers. It's not just that the mists of darkness make it difficult to see the path--the path you are on will not always be smooth or level and your journey will not always be easy. Nevertheless, staying on the path is the only way back to our Heavenly Father.<br><br>I want to be able to say, as Paul told Timothy: "I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith" (2Timothy 4:7).<br><br>Enduring to the end means remaining faithful to the laws and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ throughout your life. It is a fundamental requirement for salvation in the kingdom of God. Enduring to the end is not just a matter of passively tolerating life's difficult circumstances; it requires faithfulness to the end. Obviously this is not an easy task, but it was never meant to be easy. Our life's journey is intended to be difficult, challenging, and ultimately refining. Otherwise we would not be pure enough to return and live with our Father in Heaven and receive His eternal blessings. When you get to the end of your rope, don't let go--tie a knot and hang on until help can come. And I promise that help will always come.<br><br>In a beautiful talk on enduring, Elder Neal A. Maxwell gave the following advice:<br><br><i>Patient endurance permits us to cling to our faith in the Lord and our faith in His timing when we are being tossed about by the surf of circumstance. Even when a seeming undertow grasps us, somehow, in the tumbling, we are being carried forward, though battered and bruised. . . .</i><br><br><i>The customized challenges are often the toughest and the most ironical. For instance, King Mosiah was venerated of his people, yet, ironically, his sons became damaging enemies of the Church for a season. Nevertheless, his discerning people still esteemed Mosiah.</i><br><br><i>Will we have that same perceptive tolerance for those being wrenched by a cruel irony? When, for the moment, we ourselves are not being stretched on a particular cross, we ought to be at the foot of someone else's--full of empathy and proffering spiritual refreshment. On the straight, narrow path, which leads to our little Calvarys, one does not hear a serious traveler exclaiming, "Look, no hands!" (See 1 Cor. 10:13.)</i> ["Endure It Well," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1990, 34]<br><br>Paul wrote of how, even after they had "done the will of God," faithful disciples had "need of patience" (Hebrews 10:36). How many times have good individuals done the right thing initially, only to break under subsequent stress? Sustaining correct conduct for a difficult moment under extraordinary stress is very commendable, but so is coping with sustained stress subtly present in seeming routineness. Either way, however, we are to "run with patience the race that is set before us" (Hebrews 12:1), and it is a marathon, not a dash.<br><br>Anytime that I start to dwell on my difficulties in life, my mind turns to Joseph Smith's experience in Liberty Jail and to what the Lord told him. These few verses simultaneously frighten me, make me feel guilty for dwelling on my inadequacies and tribulations, but ultimately give me hope:<br><br><i>If thou art called to pass through tribulation; if thou art in perils among false brethren; if thou art in perils among robbers; if thou art in perils by land or by sea;</i><br><br><i>If thou art accused with all manner of false accusations; if thine enemies fall upon thee; if they tear thee from the society of thy father and mother and brethren and sisters; and if with a drawn sword thine enemies tear thee from the bosom of thy wife, and of thine offspring, and thine elder son, although but six years of age, shall cling to thy garments, and shall say, My father, my father, why can't you stay with us? O, my father, what are the men going to do with you? and if then he shall be thrust from thee by the sword, and thou be dragged to prison, and thine enemies prowl around thee like wolves for the blood of the lamb;</i><br><br><i>And if thou shouldst be cast into the pit, or into the hands of murderers, and the sentence of death passed upon thee; if thou be cast into the deep; if the billowing surge conspire against thee; if fierce winds become thine enemy; if the heavens gather blackness, and all the elements combine to hedge up the way; and above all, if the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 122:5–7]<br><br>Wow. Can't you just feel the weight of the world pushing down on Joseph? Just reading that passage makes me grateful for my relatively insignificant problems, and I am pretty sure I don't want that much experience. Nevertheless, it is through such a refiner's fire that the Lord prepares us for those moments in our lives when we will have to stand strong, when we will have to keep the faith, and when we will have to endure. We really do not know when those moments will be, so we always need, like good Scouts, to be prepared. Be prepared so that you can serve the Lord in those moments that will determine your fate. Ibelieve that if we endure our experiences well, then the suffering, the pain, and the uncertainty, which are but for a small moment, will prepare us for greater things.<br><br>In the same section of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord gave us some more perspective when He stated, "The Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou greater than he?" (D&amp;amp;C 122:8).<br><br>How can we not endure our short and relatively painless experiences when compared with Christ's incomprehensible suffering? Maybe we should think of it a little differently. Jesus Christ suffered greatly because He had to pay the price for all sin. And because He suffered for us, He understands our suffering, our pain, our grief. I believe that we have some of the experiences we do so that we mayhave increased empathy. Once you have traveled the steep and rocky slopes on the path of life, your ability to help others safely negotiate the path increases, and God can use you.<br><br>Now, finally, let's read verse 9, which once again gives me hope:<br><br><i>Therefore, hold on thy way, and the priesthood shall remain with thee; for their bounds are set, they cannot pass. Thy days are known, and thy years shall not be numbered less; therefore, fear not what man can do, for God shall be with you forever andever.</i><br><br>We really are here in mortality for such a short time. Knowing the plan of salvation is real will help keep the troubles, disappointments, heartaches, and trials we have in a proper perspective--an eternal perspective--aperspective that gives us hope in salvation through Jesus Christ. Please know that God loves you, He wants you to succeed, and He will be with you forever and ever. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>J.

<h1>ur Neighbor: Tolerance as We Come Together in Knowing Christ</h1>
<br>
<br>
I was 38 years old when I joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. When Itell people that, I always notice a hint of satisfaction in my voice. Being aware of that sense of gratification has led me to reflect on why I think it is significant that I am a convert and that I was an adult when I was converted. I've come to realize that being a convert at age 38 signifies several things to me.<br><br>First, my age at conversion signals to me that I was mature enough to make the decision despite pressure from others to reject the Church and its teachings. I was raised Catholic and practiced Catholicism until I was in college. I didn't join the LDS Church because it was the accepted thing to do. I had participated in an active search for truth, and I was able to think and reason for myself as I did so. With the help of the Holy Ghost, I was tenacious in figuring out what was right for me. I was open-minded enough to consider the possibility that what some considered an unusual religion could be true and of great worth to me. The Spirit converted me, but I needed to be the one taking charge of the exploration.<br><br>Second, my conversion reminds me that the Lord knew who I was. My conversion came after a long painful time in my life, brought about by having rejected what I had learned about God as a child, including His guidelines for our safety and peace. The conversion process told me that although I had rejected religion, God hadn't forgotten about me. He knew where I was in my journey, and He loved and cared about me even when I wasn't living according to His teachings. He led me to where He wanted me to be.<br><br>Third, the time that I had lived away from God prior to my conversion taught me that all experience has value. Some of us do learn from our mistakes and, through the gift of the Atonement, can be led to a better place because of them. One of my favorite scriptures is "All these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good" (D&amp;amp;C 122:7). Some experiences lead us away from God, and some bring us toward Him. But even the separation experiences can eventually bring us to a place where we desire peace, comfort, and greater understanding of the purpose of life.<br><br>Experiencing another religion, living for a time without religion, and exploring other faiths broadened my perspective on other people's lives, giving me a deeper appreciation for people whose faith, background, current standards, and mistakes are different from mine. Today I want to speak of the importance of understanding, accepting, and respecting those who may be on paths different from our own.<br><br>To introduce the importance of valuing other backgrounds, I would like to tell you about experiences I have had with family members and friends. I draw on my personal experiences to share with you how important I think it is to acknowledge, accept, and love people who are of a different religion, culture, or background. Reflecting on my life and my conversion process, I have been able to identify some principles about tolerance and acceptance that have been significant to me. While I am going to emphasize religious tolerance, these principles apply to the acceptance of cultural and experiential differences as well.<br><h2><b>1. Look for Commonalities</b></h2><br>I often hear members emphasize in testimonies or lessons how very different our church is from others. Sometimes the way that we state that we have <i>the</i> truth implies forcefully that other churches don't have any truth. When I hear this exaggerated, I become a bit saddened. Other religions have many aspects of truth.<br><br>In 1986 my brother was ordained to the Catholic priesthood. His life is very different from mine and from yours, but I have great respect for his faith and his dedication to it. As pastor of a church in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, he is devoted to his parishioners, programs, and school. As I attend Catholic services when I visit my brother, I see more similarities than differences in our religions. He has a deep love for the scriptures, and I am always touched when I hear him talk about his love for the Savior. I recall Elder M. Russell Ballard's statement that "all of us, regardless of race, color, or creed, belong to the family of our Heavenly Father" ("How Is It with Us?" <i>Ensign,</i> May 2000, 32), and I know that the Lord receives mybrother's love and blesses him for it.<br><h2><b>2. Accept People Where They Are</b></h2><br>There is a traditional saying that we judge others based on their actions but we judge ourselves based on our intentions. If we were to give others the benefit of the doubt by looking at their intentions, our lives would be much richer and we would be more tolerant.<br><br>My father is an example of someone who does not have the benefits of the restored gospel in his life, but the purity and strength of his intentions have made him a powerful example to me. My father lives a very spiritual life. He goes to mass every morning and reads the priest's prayers morning and night. My father also says heartfelt personal prayers with a reverence like no other I have experienced. In his talk "Building Bridges of Understanding," Elder Ballard advised, "All of our interpersonal relationships should be built on a foundation of mutual respect, trust, and appreciation" (<i>Ensign,</i> June 1998, 62). I know God loves and admires my father's loyalty and dedication to Christianity. My father lives according to the light he has, and he does it well.<br><h2><b>3. Reflect on the Goodness in Other Religions</b></h2><br>My mother, who passed away in 1992, was outstanding in her ability to reflect on and accept the goodness in other religions. Although she, like my father, had been raised a Catholic, my mother had more ecumenical leanings than my father, as her father had been a Lutheran. But she accepted the good she found in the Catholic Church and faithfully practiced Catholicism. Her father had converted from Lutheranism to Catholicism in order to marry my grandmother. He stopped attending the Lutheran Church, but he maintained his deep faith, believed in the Bible, and longed for his own religion. Because of my grandfather's goodness and the strength of his desire to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience, my mother and grandmother softened on their stance that Catholicism is the only true religion and accepted the good in his former religion aswell.<br><br>After I converted to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I told my mother about the restored gospel. She could see where it could be true, but she wanted to be loyal to my father, since he believed Catholicism to be the only true church. Later, after doing my mother's temple work, I strongly felt her presence with me. I am convinced that her understanding and acceptance of the restored gospel has grown on the other side of the veil. I believe that my mother's openness--and my respect for her beliefs--eventually led her to the fulness of the gospel.<br><h2><b>4. See Differences and Weaknesses as Part ofLife--Each Is a Gift and an Opportunity toProgress</b></h2><br>My sister is a psychiatric nurse in a child and adolescent unit. Daily she deals with challenging teenagers who have made some very poor decisions in their lives. The psychiatrists help workers avoid judging their patients by reminding them that the troubled teens are often the healthiest members of their families. To help these patients improve their lives, the mental health professionals must maintain this perspective in order to have patience and compassion for the young people but still help them accept responsibility for their choices. Many of the patients emerge stronger as they learn from the mistakes they have made.<br><br>In my life I have grown and progressed fromthe changes brought about by poor choices and painful consequences. Doing so has strengthened my ability to view weaknesses in others with tolerance--as barriers that can be overcome. One of the things that I love about the gospel is the understanding that we will continue to progress after this life. That principle in and of itself should keep us tolerant and accepting of others, since mistakes and painful experiences may be catalysts for an individual to begin searching for, attaining, and ultimately appreciating deeper meaning inlife.<br><h2><b>5. Value What We Can Learn from Others</b></h2><br>My son shared with me a lesson about acceptance and tolerance that he learned while he was on his mission. He served in Mexico in an area presided over by Elder Lynn A. Mickelsen, who began conducting conferences on the topic of tolerance when he became aware that some of the missionaries were making disparaging remarks about other religions. Elder Mickelsen shared with me what he taught to his missionaries:<br><br>[Members of other religions are] <i>honorable people. They teach the commandments; they teach of Christ. In the seventh chapter of Moroni, Mormon refers to the Light of Christ, and he makes it clear that if people are teaching of the Christ, they are of Him. Both Joseph Smith and Brigham Young taught that we need to gather everything good we can from everyone else in the world. The goodness and teachings of other religions often become the base for preparing individuals to accept the fulness of the gospel at a later time.</i><br><h2><b>6. Serve People from Different Faiths andBackgrounds</b></h2><br>I have learned much about tolerance, acceptance, and love from my friends both in and outside the Church. I would like to introduce you to two of them.<br><br>About two years ago MacLeans Geo-JaJa, a professor in the McKay School of Education, asked me to help with the Inner City Refugee Project, which is designed to meet the needs of refugees settling in the Salt Lake area. In the process I met Bob and Amy Wylie, humanitarian service missionaries who devote nearly constant attention to serving individuals from diverse cultures and religions.<br><br>I was so touched by what I learned of their work. While conversions to the Church do occur as a result of their efforts, Bob and Amy follow Elder Henry B. Eyring's admonition to love and serve those who are not of our faith before we consider sharing our testimonies (see "Let Us Raise Our Voice of Warning," <i>Ensign,</i> January 2009, 5–9). Amy and Bob serve and love these refugees because they think of them as brothers and sisters who have needs. Because this is their motivation, the service is heartfelt and sincere.<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley often admonished us in general conferences to love our neighbors and to be accepting of those who are not members of our church--to reach out to those from different cultural and religious backgrounds. I always strongly felt the Spirit when he would deliver this counsel. I knew we were receiving prophetic advice to extend Christlike love beyond the membership of the Church. It is by our fruits (especially our love and service) that those from other backgrounds shall know that we follow Christ.<br><h2><b>7. Give a Soft Response When Criticized</b></h2><br>As we are careful to show respect for others, we also wish that others would show respect for our principles, our worship, and our lifestyle. When we encounter individuals who are critical of our church, we must be careful to avoid engaging them in contentious debate, which does not bring out the best in any individual or religion.<br><br>As I mentioned, one of my brothers is a Catholic priest; ironically, my other brother disregards organized religion altogether and likes to negate Christian doctrine. I'm careful in my dealings with him to avoid saying things that will drive away the Spirit or fuel the debate. I have also encountered friends who have been critical of my beliefs. Although these kinds of criticisms cause me concern, I have been careful to respond mildly and respectfully. After several such interactions, friends have apologized for their harshness. Their hearts have been softened because of my soft response.<br><br>I began this devotional by talking about my conversion story. Many years have passed since the day I entered the waters of baptism. The passing of time has given me a greater appreciation for the good I encountered growing up in a religious home and for the good I encountered over the years in individuals from very different backgrounds and religions.<br><br>When I think back on participating in the Catholic religion as a child, rejecting a spiritual way of life during my youth, and then being led by Heavenly Father to the Church, Ibecome weak in my knees with gratitude. I am grateful for each encounter I have had, before and after becoming a member of the Church, with individuals from different faiths and backgrounds who have enriched my life.<br><br>I am in awe as I reexamine the path that hasbrought me to this place. Along the way I have developed a commitment to being respectful and understanding of others. I believe that we draw nearer to Christ as we love, serve, and accept those from different religions, cultures, and experiential backgrounds, including those who have made serious mistakes or who don't practice a religion. It is my prayer that we all can have the respect our Savior would have us feel for our brothers and sisters outside of the Church--brothers and sisters He loves and for whom He atoned. Ileave these things with you in the name of our Savior, Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Barbara Culatta was a BYU professor of education when this devotional was given on 3 February 2009.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>emple Worship a Pattern in Your Life - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, President Samuelson, for that warm and friendly introduction. Sister Rasband and I are deeply honored to be here today to participate in this devotional.<br><br>We are grateful to have had all five of our own children, and some of their spouses, attend Brigham Young University and are pleased to have several of them, as well as other members of our extended family and dear friends, here in the audience with us today.<br><br>The year 2009 will be a historic year for the Church in Utah as we participate in the cultural events, open houses, and dedications of the Draper Utah and Oquirrh Mountain Utah temples in the Salt Lake Valley. These significant events are wonderful reminders and opportunities for us to inspire and strengthen each other in our personal commitment to attend the temple and worship there on a regular basis.<br><br>As we gather here this morning on the campus of Brigham Young University, thousands of members and many of those not of our faith are walking through the Draper Utah Temple, as the open house is under way for an eight-week period prior to the dedication. Obviously there is an extremely high interest among our members and friends to walk through this beautiful, new temple and experience the beauty, spirit, and inspiration that come with such a visit. This is the first temple open house in the Salt Lake Valley since 1981, when the Jordan River Temple had an open house and was dedicated.<br><br>The Draper Utah Temple will be the third temple to be dedicated in the Salt Lake Valley, the 12th in the state of Utah, and the 129th in the Church.<br><br>During the open-house period, over one million tickets have been requested and given out for the eight-week public open house. I have had the personal privilege of taking the media, interfaith groups, government officials, and my own family through this beautiful, new temple. As I have taken guests through the spacious baptistry, beautiful ordinance rooms, the holy celestial room, and sacred sealing rooms, I can tell you without any reservation that the Spirit of the Lord is already in this temple. It leaves a deep and wonderful impression on all who visit.<br><br>For those of you who have not made plans to visit the Draper Temple, I would invite you to do so today. You can still make reservations through the Church Web site (lds.org) and enjoy a wonderful opportunity with your friends and family in this most special and sacred place on earth, the house of the Lord.<br><br>On Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, March 20–22, 2009, the Draper Utah Temple will be formally dedicated by President Thomas S. Monson. Latter-day Saints in the area served by the new temple will attend 12 dedicatory sessions. After the dedication, the temple will serve approximately 60,000 members of the Church in Draper, Sandy, and surrounding communities.<br><br>Additionally, the First Presidency recently announced the dates for the new Oquirrh Mountain Utah Temple open house and dedication. June 1 is the start of the eight-week open house. The dedication will be Friday through Sunday, August 14–16, 2009. If you miss the Draper Temple open house, plan to visit the Oquirrh Mountain Utah Temple open house!<br><br>Temples are houses of the Lord, where our Savior's teachings are reaffirmed through sacred ordinances such as marriage, which unites families for all eternity. Sister Rasband, who is here with me today, and I were sealed in the Salt Lake Temple on September 4, 1973, by her granduncle, Elder LeGrand Richards. On that occasion, Elder Richards, speaking to his niece, Sister Rasband, handed her the marriage certificate and said, "Melanie, here is the deed to your new property," meaning me! I have been safely in her watchful care ever since.<br><br>Years ago, at the Logan Temple cornerstone ceremony in 1877, President George Q. Cannon said this:<br><br><i>Every foundation stone that is laid for a Temple, and every Temple completed . . . , lessens the power of Satan on the earth, and increases the power of God and Godliness, moves the heavens in mighty power in our behalf, invokes and calls down upon us the blessings of the Eternal Gods, and those who reside in their presence.</i> ["The Logan Temple," <i>Millennial Star</i> 39, no. 46 (12 November 1877): 743]<br><br>Certainly in a day and time like we live in, the importance of every temple built and dedicated to the Lord cannot be overstated.<br><br>Concerning temple building, Brigham Young said in the early days of this work in Utah:<br><br><i>To accomplish this work there will have to be not only one temple but thousands of them, and thousands and tens of thousands of men and women will go into those temples and officiate for people who have lived as far back as the Lord shall reveal.</i> [<i>JD</i> 3:372]<br><br>Many years later, another of our latter-day prophets spoke of the importance of temple building. In 1980, President Ezra Taft Benson said this about temples:<br><br><i>Our predecessors have prophesied that temples will dot the landscape of North and South America, the isles of the Pacific, Europe, and elsewhere. If this redemptive work is to be done on the scale it must be, hundreds of temples will be needed.</i> [<i>TETB,</i> 247]<br><br>At the time President Benson gave this message, there were 19 temples operating in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br><br>As President Gordon B. Hinckley became the prophet in 1995, early in his ministry he said this about his desire to see temples built and taken closer to the Latter-day Saints:<br><br><i>I have in my heart a great burning desire, my brothers and sisters, to make it possible to have a temple where every faithful Latter-day Saint can come and receive his or her temple blessings, and have opportunity to extend those blessings to his or her forbears.</i> ["Messages of Inspiration from President Hinckley," <i>Church News,</i> 4 May 1996, Z2]<br><br>When President Hinckley gave this message there were 47 temples operating in the Church.<br><br>I would suggest that one of the great legacies of President Gordon B. Hinckley is the number of temples that were built during his presidency. During his almost 13 years as our prophet there were 77 temples built and dedicated.<br><br>Now I ask you all, my dear brothers and sisters, to what end and to what purpose is all of this focus and emphasis on temple building? How does it apply to you at this stage of your life? As we consider this together, I am reminded of a passage of scripture in Doctrine and Covenants 52:14, which reads:<br><br><i>And again, I will give unto you a pattern in all things, that ye may not be deceived; for Satan is abroad in the land, and he goeth forth deceiving thenations.</i><br><br>I would recommend to you today that temple worship is an important pattern for each of you to set--individually and as families--as you consider your own areas of focus and attention, as you put in place firm foundations in your life. I know many of you already do this, and for that we are most grateful to you.<br><br>Let us ponder for a few moments some of the doctrine that has been revealed to us concerning temple worship. We know as Latter-day Saints that temple and family history work is one great work. We refer to the feelings that we can have in seeking out our departed ancestors as having the Spirit of Elijah. About this work President James E. Faust said:<br><br><i>Searching for our kindred dead isn't just a hobby. It is a fundamental responsibility for all members of the Church. We believe that life continues after death and that all will be resurrected. We believe that families may continue in the next life if they have kept the special covenants made in one of the sacred temples under the authority of God. We believe that our deceased ancestors can also be eternally united with their families when we make covenants in their behalf in the temples. Our deceased forebears may accept these covenants, if they choose to do so, in the spirit world.</i> ["The Phenomenon That Is You," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2003, 54]<br><br>A significant and wondrous prophecy was given by God to the ancient prophet Malachi some 400 years before the coming of Jesus Christ:<br><br><i>Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord:</i><br><br><i>And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.</i> [Malachi 4:5–6]<br><br>In this dispensation, the Lord spoke to the Prophet Joseph Smith through His heavenly messenger Moroni. Joseph recorded the following concerning the evening of September 21, 1823, in his father's home:<br><br><i>While I was thus in the act of calling upon God, I discovered a light appearing in my room, which continued to increase until the room was lighter than at noonday, when immediately a personage appeared at my bedside, standing in the air, for his feet did not touch the floor. . . .</i><br><br><i>He called me by name, and said unto me that he was a messenger sent from the presence of God to me, and that his name was Moroni.</i> [<i>JS--H</i> 1:30, 33]<br><br>The importance of this experience was emphasized with Moroni appearing four times and repeating the same message each time with some additions. Joseph recorded a portion of that experience as revelation in section 2 of the Doctrine and Covenants, chronologically the first section received:<br><br><i>Behold, I will reveal unto you the Priesthood, by the hand of Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.</i><br><br><i>And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers.</i><br><br><i>If it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 2:1–3]<br><br>When and where was this to happen? It had been over 2,200 years since Malachi first gave this prophecy. Direction came to Joseph Smith from the Lord, who instructed Joseph to build the first temple in this dispensation in Kirtland. This temple was built out of the poverty of the Saints, and shortly after its dedication the Lord came and accepted it. At that glorious time other heavenly manifestations also took place, including the fulfillment of the prophecy found in Malachi.<br><br>From section 110 of the Doctrine and Covenants, received in 1836, we read:<br><br><i>After this vision had closed, another great and glorious vision burst upon us; for Elijah the prophet, who was taken to heaven without tasting death, stood before us, and said:</i><br><br><i>Behold, the time has fully come, which was spoken of by the mouth of Malachi--testifying that he [Elijah] should be sent, before the great and dreadful day of the Lord come--</i><br><br><i>To turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the children to the fathers, lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse--</i><br><br><i>Therefore, the keys of this dispensation are committed into your hands; and by this ye may know that the great and dreadful day of the Lord is near, even at the doors.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 110:13–16]<br><br>Since that remarkable day in 1836, through a continuation of the priesthood authority given to the Prophet Joseph, that power has been on the earth through prophets, seers, and revelators of the Church. We are so privileged to have President Thomas S. Monson as our prophet today. He holds that same priesthood authority that was given by Elijah to the Prophet Joseph in 1836. This is known as the sealing authority of God, by which we perform the sacred work in the temples today.<br><br>Let us ponder the importance of that experience at Kirtland and the sealing authority of God for each of us gathered here. This was stressed by the Prophet Joseph Smith when he declared: "The greatest responsibility in this world that God has laid upon us is to seek after our dead" (<i>HC</i> 6:313). He also said, "Those Saints who neglect it in behalf of their deceased relatives, do it at the peril of their own salvation" (<i>HC</i> 4:426).<br><br>The First Presidency has issued an invitation to all the members of the Church, which certainly applies to you and me:<br><br><i>Where time and circumstances permit, members are encouraged to replace some leisure activities with temple service. . . .</i><br><br><i>"All of the ordinances which take place in the House of the Lord become expressions of our belief in that fundamental and basic doctrine of the immortality of the human soul. As we redouble our efforts and our faithfulness in going to the temple, the Lord will bless us."</i> [Letter from the First Presidency, 11 March 2003; in "Encouraging Temple Worthiness and Preparation," <i>Ensign,</i> June 2003, 76, and in <i>Ensign,</i> March 2004, 45]<br><br>As we, my young friends, consider righteous patterns that we want to establish in our lives, we all would be well to continue remembering this admonition from the First Presidency.<br><br>May we also consider the promised blessings by prophets, seers, and revelators as we faithfully attend the temple.<br><br>I would like to share a few of these promised blessings for our faithful service in the temple. First, from President Gordon B. Hinckley:<br><br><i>I would hope that we might go to the house of the Lord a little more frequently. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . I encourage you to take greater advantage of this blessed privilege. It will refine your natures. It will peel off the selfish shell in which most of us live. It will literally bring a sanctifying element into our lives and make us better men and better women.</i> ["Closing Remarks," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2004, 104, 105]<br><br>He also promised:<br><br><i>If there were more temple work done in the Church, there would be less of selfishness, less of contention, less of demeaning others. The whole Church would increasingly be lifted to greater heights of spirituality, love for one another, and obedience to the commandments of God.</i> [<i>TGBH,</i> 622]<br><br>Now let me share a quote from President James E. Faust:<br><br><i>We unavoidably stand in so many unholy places and are subjected to so much that is vulgar, profane, and destructive of the Spirit of the Lord that Iencourage our Saints all over the world, wherever possible, to strive to stand more often in holy places. Our most holy places are our sacred temples. Within them is a feeling of sacred comfort.</i> ["Standing in Holy Places," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2005, 62]<br><br>And from President Thomas S. Monson comes this promise:<br><br><i>Come to the temple and place your burdens beforethe Lord and you'll be filled with a new spiritand confidence in the future. Trust in the Lord, and if you do He'll hold you and cradle you and lead you step by step along that pathway that leads to the celestial kingdom of God.</i> [Quoted in Dell Van Orden, "San Diego Temple: 45th House of the Lord Dedicated in 'Season for Temple Building,'" <i>Church News,</i> 8 May 1993, Z8]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, another comforting blessing of temple worship is the assurance of protection and peace from the storm that isupon us in our day.<br><br>I think of a promise given in the Book of Mormon through Ammon in the book of Alma. Speaking of where members will be gathered into the garners, or temples of the Lord, he said:<br><br><i>Yea, they shall not be beaten down by the storm at the last day; yea, neither shall they be harrowed up by the whirlwinds; but when the storm cometh they shall be gathered together in their place, that the storm cannot penetrate to them; yea, neither shall they be driven with fierce winds whithersoever the enemy listeth to carry them.</i> [Alma 26:6; see also verse 5]<br><br>I bear my testimony, brothers and sisters, that some of the safest places that Heavenly Father has established for the gathering of His people are in the temples of the Lord. I invite you to the Draper Utah Temple open house--or the Oquirrh Mountain Utah Temple open house that will follow this summer--to experience anew the feeling that you receive in these temples of the Lord.<br><br>More important, I invite you, as has the First Presidency, to make temple worship a pattern in your life. Most all of you in this congregation can participate in the temple in one way or another. Most all of you can perform baptisms for the dead. Many of you who are endowed can perform washings and anointings, endowments, and sealings--first for yourselves and then for others living on the other side of the veil who are waiting for you and me to serve as proxies for them in this great redemptive work.<br><br>President Hinckley taught:<br><br><i>Now, I'd like to submit to you that when all is said and done, the work and the mission of this Church is to save. It's just that simple and just that profound . . . to save people. That's the whole purpose of what we are doing. That's why we have home teachers. That's why we have visiting teachers. That's why we have classes. That's why we have sacrament meeting. That's why we build temples, to save the living and the dead. That's our work.</i> [<i>TGBH,</i> 119]<br><br>The statement on the outside facade of everytemple reads: "Holiness to the Lord / The House of the Lord." I testify that all of the temples of the Lord are His sanctuaries here upon the earth. I invite all of you to attend more frequently, as your circumstances permit, and claim your blessings and protections that have been promised to you by prophets of God. Jesus Christ lives. This is His Church. This service in temples is rolling forward throughout the earth--as prophets throughout the ages have seen in vision and prophecy--to bless the lives of the Latter-day Saints and carry out the work of redeeming the dead.<br><br>I know that President Thomas S. Monson is God's prophet upon the earth today and holds the sealing power of God, the same authority that was given to Joseph Smith by the prophet Elijah in the Kirtland Temple. It is by that authority that new families are created and sealed together for time and all eternity--so unlike that which is done out in the world relative to the divine institution of marriage.<br><br>I pray the Lord will bless each of us here today with a greater desire and greater intent to hearken unto the words of the living prophets and attend the temple.<br><br>I leave my testimony and reaffirm these prophetic blessings to all of you today, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Ronald A.

<h1>ng Matters - Arthur C. Brooks - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It's an honor for me to be here at Brigham Young University, and it's a delight for me to be here in beautiful Provo. The last time Iwas here was in the fall of 2007. I have happy memories of my last visit, and I have great anticipation of my next. I'm always delighted to be here, and I can see why statistics show that Utahns are some of the happiest people in the United States. It's quite clear, just by looking around, why that would be so.<br><br>I'm going to talk to you today about something that you've probably given a lot of thought to: charity. But I want to talk about it in a way you maybe haven't thought about it: about how you can use it in your lives and in the lives of others. I want to talk to you about how charity can and should prominently figure in the lives of Christian people--but in a way that maybe hasn't quite occurred to you before. I want to start with a quote from the famous industrialist John D. Rockefeller from 1905.<br><br>Rockefeller was famously quoted in that year as saying, "God gave me my money" (in Reo Bennett, "How the Richest Man in the World Observes Christmas,"<i>Woman's Home Companion,</i>December 1905, 14). Now, that's sort of troubling to Christian people. God<i>gave</i>him his money? Some have used the quote as evidence that John D. Rockefeller was a bad man--that he believed he deserved to be rich when other people were poor. But that's not actually what he meant.<br><br>In 1906 Rockefeller went on to tell a newspaper reporter for the<i>New York American:</i>"Ibelieve the power to make money is a gift from God . . . to be developed and used to the best of our ability for the good of mankind" (to William Hoster, quoted in Jules Abels,<i>The Rockefeller Billions: The Story of the World's Most Stupendous Fortune</i>[New York: Macmillan, 1965], 279–80).<br><br>What Rockefeller meant was this: He believed that he made money because he was charged with helping others with his money, and he honestly believed (as he wrote at other times) that if he stopped giving his money and giving it in the right way, then God would take his money away.<br><br>Now, that still might trouble you theologically that God would intervene in the direct finances of John D. Rockefeller, but you have to admit that it doesn't sound so weird at that point. John D. Rockefeller believed that he was rich because he gave so much, and throughout his life, before he was a rich man, he gave a lot. He was a charitable person.<br><br>A lot of entrepreneurs believe that one of the reasons that they're rich is because they give. Entrepreneurs in this country are some of its most charitable citizens. And I've always heard this, because for years I taught in a department of entrepreneurship, so I got to know the modern John D. Rockefellers who thought that they were rich partly because they gave. But, you know, I never believed it--never believed a word of it--because I was trained as an economist.<br><br>A lot of you have taken classes in economics. When you walk into your first class in economics, here's what the professor doesn't say: "You want to get rich? Give all your money away." That's not the advice you hear. It doesn't make sense. No, you have to have money first, and then you can give it away. That's what economists like me think. So I set out to test John D. Rockefeller's view that he was rich because he--and all the other entrepreneurs I talked to--gave. That way, the next time I heard somebody say that you could get rich by giving your money away, I was going to respond, "No, you're wrong. I have the data that say you haveto have it before you can give it away."<br><br>Well, I'm going to tell you what I found, and in a nutshell what I found was that Rockefeller was right and I was wrong. I'm going to show you the evidence that proves how wrong I was and tell you how you can use this information in your life and how I'm using it in mine.<br><br>But first a little background on charitable giving in America: Americans give. Americans give a lot. In 2006 American citizens privately gave about $300 billion away to charity. Now, $300 billion--is that a lot, or is that a little? Who even knows these days? The president with the stroke of a pen could give away three times that to people who cannot pay their mortgages, for all we know. It's a crazy time out there, but to put it into perspective, $300 billion is more than the entire national income of Sweden. We give away to charity more than the whole country of Swedes makes in income. That's a lot of money. Seventy-five percent of America's families give every year. Fifty percent volunteer their time, and many Americans give in myriad other ways that are not captured in data.<br><br>At one point when I was teaching about this subject, I decided to figure out who in America is the most charitable. I compared states, and you are not going to be very surprised at what I found. The most charitable state in the United States, of course, is Utah, where people give approximately twice as much as the second leading state in charitable giving. So congratulations to you. I'm tempted to say that that should make Utahns proud. But I suppose that's not the right word. You should be pleased--and determined to keep it up.<br><br>Now, given this, one often asks, How do Americans compare in charitable giving with people around the world? There's a perception out there, if you listen to politicians, that we're stingy. Jimmy Carter, the former president of the United States, said in a relatively recent speech that Americans are indifferent to the suffering of the poor around the world: "The problem lies among the people of the U.S. It's a different world from ours. And we don't really care about what happens to them" (16th Annual Nobel Peace Prize Forum, 21 February 2004, St. Olaf College, Northfield, Minnesota).<br><br>The data say that President Carter is wrong. If we look at how much money Americans give per capita compared to citizens in other countries of the world, we will find that the average American citizen gives away three-and-a-half times as much money each year as the average French citizen, seven times as much as the average German, and 14 times as much as the average Italian.<br><br>Now, as an economist I want to know whether or not that's because we are richer. However, when you correct for income differences and tax differences and all the things that make the United States a different country, you find that the gap doesn't close. This is an authentic difference in culture--once again something I do believe we can be quite pleased with. The questions, then, are why does it matter and which is pushing and which is pulling? Is the fact that we're, generally speaking, a richer country the reason that we give so much, as I'd always thought? Or is what John D. Rockefeller would have said true: that the fact that we give so much is one of the secrets to our success?<br><br>That's what I set out to show. I set out to show that Rockefeller was wrong: that you have to have the money before you give it away, that we all need to go to work, and that we need tax policy that puts plenty of money in our pockets--then we'll help each other. That's what I intended to show.<br><br>The way I set out to show that was by gathering data on 30,000 American families from all over the country. Actually, colleagues at Harvard University collected the data in the year 2000. Working from coast to coast, they collected the data from 41 communities big and small and towns north and south. Salt Lake City was one of the communities we looked at. We also looked at Washington, D.C., and Seattle, Washington (my hometown)--lots of places were in there. Thirty thousand families were asked questions about how much they gave, what they gave to, how much money they made, their education, their family life, and everything in between. It was the most comprehensive look at people's service behavior and their charitable giving that we've ever had before, and I eagerly anticipated these data because I was going to show what I'd always thought. This was going to give me a statistical way to show that you have to have the money first.<br><br>So I charted it up and did the statistical analysis. I worked for months with my computer in my darkened office to get my conclusion. The conclusion was, sure enough, that when people get richer, they tend to give more money away. But I also came up with the following counterintuitive finding: When people give more money away, they tend to prosper.<br><br>Specifically, here's what I found. If you have two families that are exactly identical--in other words, same religion, same race, same number of kids, same town, same level of education, and everything's the same--except that one family gives a hundred dollars more to charity than the second family, then the giving family will earn on average $375 more in income than the nongiving family--and that's statistically attributable to the gift.<br><br>Now, when I got this I was perplexed. Iwas really confused because it didn't go with my theory. In psychology this is what we call cognitive dissonance--two competing ideas in conflict with each other. On the one hand I had the theory that I'd always worked under. On the other hand I had data that completely contradicted the theory. So I did what college professors always do in this case: I got rid of the data. I said, "That can't be right. I've obviously messed something up." I got new software. I looked for new data. I recrunched the numbers. I kept coming up with the same thing.<br><br>I ran the numbers again, and I looked at volunteering. I found the same thing: People who volunteer do better financially. I ran the numbers on blood contributions and blood donations. Think about that--giving blood. You're not going to get richer if you give blood, are you? Well, yes, you are.<br><br>I figured it couldn't be right, so I ignored the findings. I didn't publish them. I let them roll around in my head for a long time. And I thought, you know, I've got a better way to test this--I'm going to look at the whole United States. I wanted to see how charitable giving had changed over a 50-year period and compare it to how income had changed. Then I could see which was statistically pushing and which was pulling.<br><br>I examined the average family between 1954 and 2004 and found (adjusted for inflation) a 150-percent increase in real purchasing power. This is great news. This is actually an amazing thing worldwide. You simply don't see growth like this in real purchasing power in already rich countries. It's an incredible achievement that the United States has undertaken. This is a testament to prosperity that comes from productivity and hard work and dedication. This is a good thing.<br><br>Charitable giving also increased over the same period per family on average by 190 percent. And this is an even better story because what this says is that we're getting more prosperous in this country, but we're getting even more generous over time. I'm pleased with this result. It tells me once again that what Jimmy Carter said about this country is not right. We're not a stingy country. Could we be more generous? Of course we could. But we're not getting stingier.<br><br>Here's the real question: Which is pushing and which is pulling? Is income driving up donations or are donations driving up income or what? And the answer, once again, is both. You find that when our country gets richer, people do give more away. And as we give more away, that translates into better economic growth for this country.<br><br>Statistically what we find is that if we were to increase our private charitable donations by just 1 percent, which is about $2 billion a year--$2 billion a year from people like you and me writing checks for our favorite causes: our churches and our favorite charities--if we just did that, that would translate into a gross domestic product of about 39 billion new dollars. That's a great multiplier.<br><br>Now, $39 billion by today's stakes is nothing. The president pulls $39 billion from behind the cushions of the couch at the White House. It's laundry money. It's three months in Iraq. It's 5 percent of the stimulus package. It's nothing. But it's a great multiplier. If I can take your $2 billion in charity and turn it into $39 billion, then suddenly charitable giving is not just a great investment for you. It's also a patriotic act for our country because it translates into jobs and growth and opportunity and tax revenues and all the stuff that we really like.<br><br>The more I ran the numbers, the more I kept getting this crazy result. I kept getting the same thing over and over and over. Rockefeller was right, but I still refused to believe it. So in desperation I finally went to a colleague who specialized in the psychology of charitable giving, and I said, "I'm getting this result I can't understand. It doesn't make sense. It's like the hand of God or something on the economy, and I can't believe it's true."<br><br>And the first thing he asked was, "Why don't you believe it's true? You're a Christian, aren't you?"<br><br>This shook me a bit, but just for a second. "Yeah, but I'm a social scientist," I shot back. "We're not supposed to believe those things. Ineed a more earthbound explanation."<br><br>"Well, I'll give you one," he said. "We've known this for 30 years in the psychology profession."<br><br>And I said, "Well, tell me, tell me."<br><br>He said, "We haven't just been talking about money. You economists--you worry about money all the time, and money is boring. We worry about something that people really care about--the currency by which we really spend our days--and that's happiness. We've known for 30 years that people who give get happier as a result. Can you use that?"<br><br>And I said, "Oh, yeah." Because I know from teaching at a business school that the best way to run a successful business is to hire happy people. That's really where the action is. Some of you know that too. If you want to have a productive business and if you want to be a productive person, work on your happiness. Happy people show up for work more, they work longer hours, they work more joyfully, and they're happier with every aspect of their productive lives. Happiness is the secret to success, and if that's true, I've got the answer. Charity brings happiness, happiness brings success, and now I'm onto something.<br><br>It turns out that the data on happiness and charitable giving are beyond dispute. People who give to charity are 43 percent more likely than people who don't give to say they're very happy people. People who give blood are twice as likely to say they're very happy people as people who don't give blood. People who volunteer are happier. The list goes on. You simply can't find any kind of service that won't make you happier.<br><br>Laboratory experiments using human subjects find that when people are asked to give to other people, it elevates their mood. Furthermore, if you increase your level of charitable giving, you can permanently alter your level of what psychologists call positive effect--which is to say, being in a good mood. You can be a happier person that way. It's the secret, basically. The real question is not whether that's true; the question is why that's true.<br><br>There's a very interesting set of studies that tell us why it is that giving will make you into a happy person. The first has to do with how it changes your brain. I'm going to explain that in a minute. The second is what it does to how other people treat you. Let me explain. The first is that the wiring of our brains is conducive to charitable giving, and it works something like this. In the late 1980s there was a famous study of charitable giving that looked at how people reacted with respect to the endorphins that they experienced. Endorphins are neurochemicals that make you feel a sort of euphoria. If you like to run marathons, it's probably because afterward you feel really good--you feel sort of high in a way. Psychologists came forth with studies that showed that when people volunteer to help other people, they get what they call "the helper's high." Volunteering actually gives people a mild sense of euphoria.<br><br>I think that's an interesting study, but it doesn't help me explain prosperity. The helper's high doesn't get me there, and the reason is this. When I was in high school I went to school with a lot of kids who specialized in getting high. And it turns out that that was not a secret to success. Now that I'm 44 years old and keeping in touch with a couple of people from high school, I can assure you that the pathway they took was not the one to great prosperity. So it's interesting that you get this helper's high, but it doesn't help us explain all this worldly prosperity that I keep finding in my data.<br><br>Later studies of the brain came up with a more compelling explanation. These studies showed that when people give, it lowers their levels of stress. This is really important to understand in prosperity because one thing that we know is that people who do their jobs with less stress tend to be more productive and more successful than those who perform it with more stress. You'll find throughout your lives that if you can find ways to relax, you will profit from this level of relaxation. Studies have shown that charitable giving will objectively lower the stress levels that people feel in their everyday lives.<br><br>There is one famous study from the Duke Medical School in 1996. It's a study that I love because it's so strange. Senior citizens were asked in an experiment to give massages to infants, to little babies--which is a funny thing. It just goes to show you that in the university community you can get tenure for doing anything. Of these senior citizens, half of them gave massages to infants and the other half didn't. The researchers monitored the stress hormones in the senior citizens' brains to see what happened.<br><br>There are three stress hormones, for your information. (This is the kind of thing that, when you're like me and write books for a living, you find out about.) What are the three stress hormones? They're called cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. When somebody cuts you off in traffic or insults you or you get a D on an exam or something like that, those chemicals are lighting up your brain like a Christmas tree, and you're unhappy as a result because you're stressed out. What you want to do is go through life with less cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine in your day-to-day life. And what they found in the study of the senior citizens was that those who gave the massages to the babies cut their stress hormones in half. Big finding! Their interpretation was that this is great advice for people who want to be more effective, and this tells us something about why people who give a lot as part of their regular lifestyles are going to be more successful.<br><br>The second set of studies has to do not with what happens in your brain when you give but with what happens in other people's brains when you give. A study from the University of Kent in southern England was dedicated to figuring out how people see others who are givers. There is an experiment called a cooperation game in which people are gathered in a large room, given a little bit of money, and asked to contribute to a common fund. Then the researchers look in the common fund, double it, and pass it out equally among the participants. If you think about that game, the best thing for everybody to do is to put in all of their money and have it doubled. But if you're crafty, what you want to do is hold back all your money when everybody else puts in theirs and don't cooperate. That way you get your own money<i>and</i>a chunk of everybody else's. That's the idea. And, as the experiment showed, there is always a proportion of people who opt to do so.<br><br>Now, researchers have been studying this kind of thing for years. What made it interesting when the University of Kent studied it was this. There was a second phase in which people in the game who had witnessed each other cooperating in giving to each other were asked to break up into teams and elect leaders. What they found was that in 82 percent of the cases, the leaders who were elected were the biggest givers from the first phase.<br><br>Their conclusion, a conclusion that has been verified in subsequent experiments, is that when people see strangers giving charitably, they recognize a leadership quality in those strangers. If people witness you as a giver, they will see a leader. Servant leadership is no joke, and it's a secret to success, whether you're looking for success or not. When people see you giving and cooperating and serving others, they will see in you a leader, or a future leader, and they cannot help but help you.<br><br>There are many other studies that show that givers have better health and that givers are better citizens. It goes on and on. The bottom line is this: Givers are healthier, happier, and richer in this country--and probably around the world. It gives us stronger communities; indeed, it gives us a more prosperous nation.<br><br>The question for me now is this: Who gives the most? And who's getting all this benefit--wonderful benefit--for themselves and for their communities? Well, I told you before: people from Utah. But that doesn't get me far enough, because if you move across the border from Idaho you are not suddenly going to start coughing up to charity. You're just not going to do it.<br><br>There is something else going on, and you know what it is. It's practicing faith. The number-one characteristic of those who give in this country is that they practice a faith. Of people who practice their faith regularly--which is to say, they attend worship services every week--91 percent give to charity each year. Of people who don't attend every week, 66 percent do. This translates into millions and millions of people who are healthier, happier, and more prosperous than their neighbors, and it charts back to a lot of their religious experiences.<br><br>There are two ways to explain this link between God and giving. Explanation number one: You're better people. That's not a very Christian explanation. Explanation number two: You've been given a special gift--the gift of giving. Now I'm going to ask you to take a pretty sophisticated understanding here of charitable giving. As Christian people we are taught that giving is important to help others. I'm telling you that the data say giving helps you, so if you want to help others, don't just give to them--think about what you can do today to help somebody else to give. The main beneficiary of a charitable gift is the giver him-or herself.<br><br>Let me summarize that. What do the data tell me as a Christian man? They tell me that Iam the big beneficiary of my own giving, that people similar to me who take their faith seriously are the beneficiaries because we tend to give a lot. We've been taught to do what is right, and we are reaping the reward. So how can we, given this fact, reinterpret the scriptures about charitable giving? How can we take it to the next level?<br><br>Consider Mosiah 4:21:<br><br><i>And now, if God, who has created you, on whom you are dependent for your lives and for all that ye have and are, doth grant unto you whatsoever ye ask that is right, in faith, believing that ye shall receive, O then, how ye ought to impart of the substance that ye have one to another.</i><br><br>The traditional interpretation of this passage, which is similar to passages in any sacred text, is basically this: "Give more to other people. You have so much; give more." Take it to the next level. Take it to the source of the prosperity. You have been given the gift of giving. Help others by giving them the gift of giving.<br><br>How are you going to do that? How are you going to help somebody to give more today? There are a lot of ways to do it. Let me tell you how you've done it for me.<br><br>Let me tell you a quick story about a briefcase. I know it's a weird subject for a story, but it's actually a magic briefcase. It's my magic Brigham Young University briefcase. I visited here in the fall of 2007 for the first time--I'd never been here before. My friend Gary Cornia, who is the dean of the business school, gave me a beautiful briefcase that said "Brigham Young University" on it. I took it home and put it away because I already had a briefcase, and Ididn't think about it.<br><br>About a month later my briefcase broke, and I was complaining to my wife, and I said, "The handle's broken. It's very inconvenient."<br><br>And she said, "What about that BYU briefcase you brought home? Why don't you carry that?"<br><br>And I said, "Oh. Okay. That's a good idea."<br><br>So I took all my stuff and put it in the BYU briefcase, and I started carrying it around.<br><br>At the time, my research assistant at Syracuse University, Nick Bailey (he's here--heactually works at BYU now), noticed, and he said, "You're carrying a BYU briefcase."<br><br>I said, "Yeah, it's great. It's an Italian briefcase. It's very nice."<br><br>I travel a lot, and one of the funny things I noticed is that when you are out in public carrying a briefcase that says something on it, the first thing people you don't know do is read the briefcase and then look at you. It occurred to me that people were thinking, "He's a Mormon guy." And that's actually sort of false religious advertising because I'm a Roman Catholic. I take my faith seriously, but no matter how seriously I take my faith, technically that still doesn't make me a Mormon.<br><br>So I was walking around saying, basically, "I'm a Mormon," and the funny thing is that it was changing my personality. And the reason it was changing my personality was because I was mortified by the idea that somebody would say, "You know, I was in the airport, and I saw this Mormon guy, and he was being a real jerk." I wanted to live up to someone else's reputation, and it was making me into a better person. It was a magic briefcase.<br><br>So what's the implication of this story? Well, obviously it might just be that I'm trying to get a new briefcase right now. (Maybe the greatest kind of evangelization that the LDS Church could undertake would be to buy 300 million briefcases and give them out to all Americans.) But the bigger point here is that carrying the briefcase was actually making my life better. Iwas happier; things were going really well for me as I was carrying that briefcase. And the reason is that the service for which Mormons have become justifiably famous was infecting my life. It was making me better as a person. Itwas helping<i>me.</i>And I thank you for that.<br><br>So how else (besides accidentally buying somebody a briefcase) can you help other people give more today? First, you can help to dispel some myths about charitable giving.<br><br>Myth number one: Giving makes us poorer. You hear this all the time. This is what the economist like me thinks. It's wrong; you have to fight thinking that way. And there are arguments that say the way it works is not just the hand of God--at least not directly the hand of God. Instead, maybe it's the hand of God through our neurochemistry, having to do with the structure of our brains. But there are good explanations for why this is not true.<br><br>Myth number two: People are naturally selfish. I hear this constantly: "They are not going to give. People are just selfish." People are selfish, it's true, but they're not naturally selfish; people are unnaturally selfish. When we are our best selves, when we are in equilibrium, when we are where we're supposed to be cognitively, neurochemically, and spiritually, then we are giving people.<br><br>Myth number three: Giving is a luxury. It's not. It's a necessity--the first 10 percent, not the last 10 percent. And the reason is that if we want to be better, we have to give.<br><br>Myth number four: This is not a public policy lecture, but I'm a public policy professional, so I'm going to make one public policy point here today. You will hear in the coming days and weeks and months that if our country were doing what it should be doing for people in need, then we wouldn't need private giving, that the government would be taking care of people who need it, and that we would not need you to step in to provide needs. Having looked at the data, I am here to tell you today that the day the government takes over for you in your private charity is the day we get poorer, unhappier, and unhealthier. The process starts right now on the day the government crowds us out. We must demand to take our place as givers and to support our communities of need and people who need the services that we can provide.<br><br>Second, how else can we help others give more? Well, by teaching. We're teachers. I'm a teacher. You're a teacher. We're leaders in our communities. Everything we do demonstrates what we believe. People mimic those who are successful, happy, and well adjusted. You've heard many times throughout your training in church and in school that you're never really alone. Somebody is always watching you. You're always creating an example, and, as such, you're a teacher. What you do today people will see. Make sure that it's clear that you're a charitable giver--and they will emulate you.<br><br>And third, how can we bring our creativity to bear more in our families, in our churches? How can we create a curriculum where giving is a core competency? We're very good at teaching reading and writing--well, we're not that good at that either, but in theory we're pretty good at teaching reading and writing. We're not very good at taking teaching giving seriously, yet this is a core competency for successful citizenship and a happy life. We need tobe better about teaching this.<br><br>What I charge you with today is what I charge myself with, which is to discover more creative solutions to working these concepts into our everyday lives. You can tell this has changed my life a lot. I hope you can tell that it really has. When I was working on this research four years ago, I came home with a chapter from a book that showed these data analyses, and my wife read it. She reads everything I write. She tells me pretty honestly when it's not so good. She read the chapter and said, "I think this is really something. I think we can use this."<br><br>"Yeah, we should give more," I answered. "We should write bigger checks. We should take this seriously."<br><br>She said, "No, no, no. I think we should do something bigger. I think we should adopt a baby."<br><br>And I said, "Sweetheart, it's only a book.<br><br>But I had no argument. We had to do it. And we did it. It was the best thing we ever did. And that changed our lives even more.<br><br>As for your money being cheerfully refunded, I can't guarantee that, but I promise you that this stuff really works. It works--if you want--because of God in heaven, or it works--if you want--because of your neurochemistry, but it really works, and I leave you with that and one more thought.<br><br>As an American citizen and as a person withgreat delight to be here at BYU and livingin this great country, one of the things that I've learned as a result of my research is that I'm a happy prosperous person because I live in a country with people who serve. Because you give to your churches and the causes that you care about here in Utah, Ihavea richer, happier, and healthier life eventhough I live in Washington, D.C. So for all that you do between your student life and your giving and your missions and everything else that characterizes your life of service that helps me so much, my last words to you are thankyou.<br><br><i>Arthur C.

<h1> Attain the Spiritual High Ground in Life - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
What a joy it is to be with you tonight and share my testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. With you, I give thanks for gospel principles that give us an eternal perspective and teach us how to have joy in this life and in the life to come.<br><br>After I was set apart in the Salt Lake Temple as an Assistant to the Twelve Apostles, Elder LeGrand Richards, who was 46 years my senior, put his arms around me and whispered into my ear, "Oh, to be a boy again and have my whole life ahead of me." To be a boy again? I was 42 years old! The reason I say that is because tonight I'm going to talk to you as though you were a little bit younger than what you may think you are. So, my dear brothers and sisters, as I look into your eyes, I see the youth of Zion. You are a royal army with a noble heritage. You stand as living examples for future generations. As the hymn says, "Shall the youth of Zion falter . . . ? No! . . . Faithful and true we will ever stand."1<br><br>Tonight I would like to talk to you about how we can stand "faithful and true" always. I suggest to you that we will only be able to stand "true to the faith" as we seek, obtain, and retain spiritual high ground in our lives.<br><h2><strong>What Is High Ground?</strong></h2><br>It is interesting that prophets of all dispensations sought inspiration in the tops of the mountains. For example, Moses "saw God face to face" on "an exceedingly high mountain" (see Moses 1:1–2). Nephi "went up into the mountain, and cried unto the Lord" (see 1 Nephi 17:7–8). The brother of Jared saw the premortal Christ--a profoundly sacred experience--on the mount Shelem (see Ether 3:13). Isaiah and Micah of the Old Testament prophesied that "in the last days . . . the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains" (Isaiah 2:2; see also Micah 4:1; 2 Nephi 12:2).<br><br>Our Savior also went to the mountains often to seek spiritual guidance and to teach His disciples. Christ was transfigured before Peter, James, and John on "an high mountain apart" (see Matthew 17:1–2; Mark 9:2; see also Luke 9:28). One of His greatest discourses--the Beatitudes--comes from the great Sermon on the Mount (see Matthew 5:1). On another occasion He went up into a mountain above the Sea of Galilee, and when the multitudes came, He blessed and healed all those who were afflicted (see Matthew 15:29–31).<br><br>From such high ground ancient prophets and the Lord Himself received direction and power to keep the commandments and serve others. To seek spiritual high ground is to rise above the world and its temptation and to follow our Savior. Tonight I would like to share with you a particular story in the scriptures which demonstrates the importance of seeking--and staying--on the high ground.<br><h2><strong>The Importance of High Ground</strong></h2><br>Lehonti, in the Book of Mormon, teaches us an important lesson about seeking and maintaining the high ground (see Alma 47). Lehonti took his followers to a high place atop a mountain and built a fortress for safety, security, and protection. The Lamanite king sent his army, led by the Nephite dissenter Amalickiah, to conquer Lehonti and his people. But Amalickiah was "a very subtle man to do evil" (Alma 47:4), and he wanted to "gain favor with the armies of the Lamanites" so that he could overthrow the king "and take possession of the kingdom" (Alma 47:8).<br><br>Three times Amalickiah sent a message to Lehonti, asking him to come down to the valley to meet with him. Three times Lehonti refused to leave his safety on high ground. But Amalickiah was persistent. The fourth time, Amalickiah came near Lehonti's camp and said to Lehonti, in effect, "Just step outside of your fortress--and bring your guards with you. I will meet you there" (see Alma 47:12).<br><br>This time Lehonti accepted Amalickiah's invitation and left the security of the mountaintop. Now Amalickiah presented his devious plan, tempting Lehonti with victory and power. Lehonti was invited to bring his men down from the mountain in the middle of the night and surround the Lamanite army as they slept. Amalickiah promised that he would surrender to Lehonti, giving Lehonti command of the entire Lamanite army--as long as Lehonti made Amalickiah second in command.<br><br>The plan was executed as Amalickiah had outlined. The Lamanite army surrendered, and Lehonti became their chief. But then Amalickiah had his servants slowly poison Lehonti. With Lehonti dead, Amalickiah took command of both armies, gained control of Lehonti's people, and returned victorious to the king of the Lamanites, whereupon Amalickiah completed his evil plan by killing the king and becoming ruler of the Lamanites.<br><br>Amalickiah's deception shows just how Satan works in our lives. His temptations are incessant invitations to leave our high ground and spiritual safety. And he will--with great patience--wait for us to give in to his enticements. Lehonti did not respond the first time a messenger came from Amalickiah, nor the second, nor even the third time. But on the fourth visit, Lehonti stepped just below the safety of the high ground, succumbing to the false promises of power and glory. Of course Lehonti's demise was not immediate. Perhaps for a few days he gloried in his status as commander in chief of the Lamanite army, and he probably thought that leaving the mountaintop fortress was worth it. But like Amalickiah's treachery, the enticements of the adversary are always short-lived--and poisonous. Whenever we leave the high ground, we succumb to spiritual illness.<br><h2><strong>Why Stay on High Ground?</strong></h2><br>Can you see how important it is to stay on high ground? Just as the Savior called His disciples to come to Him on a mountain so that He could ordain them with priesthood power (see Mark 3:13–15), He invites all of us, as His disciples today, to come to Him. Those who hearken to that invitation will receive blessings not available anywhere else.<br><br>In this life we will be constantly tried and tested to see if we will keep the commandments of God. But all the trials of this probationary period called mortality are here to make us stronger, not to pull us under and defeat us! As the Lord taught the Prophet Joseph Smith: "All these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good" (D&amp;amp;C 122:7).<br><br>Thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;<br><br>And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high. [D&amp;amp;C 121:7–8]<br><br>Sometimes we forget who we are: we are children of God, and we are striving to achieve exaltation! We want to live eternally on the highest ground--in the presence of God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. It is called exaltation. But sometimes, like Lehonti, we put ourselves in compromising circumstances by choosing to step down even just a little from the safety of living the commandments. We then become vulnerable to Satan and the enticements of the world.<br><h2><strong>Staying on High Ground Together</strong></h2><br>Keep in mind that Lehonti wasn't the only one who suffered from the consequences of his choices. So many times you and I think that when we compromise our standards "it can't hurt anyone but me," but in reality so many depend on us to be obedient, to be worthy, to be true, and to be chaste. Just think--there are our friends, our parents, our brothers and sisters, and, most importantly, our eternal companion and our children. Even if you are not married yet, your future companion and those children are interested in your spiritual well-being. Your choices now may determine whether or not you will be worthy of them in the future.<br><br>There may be some who won't be married. May I say to you, the most important thing you have to remember is to stay on the high ground and make sure that you are worthy, because we are told that there will be many blessings in the eternities to come that will be rightfully yours. So do not get that discouraged. The most important thing is to stay worthy and true and on the spiritual high ground.<br><br>When Lehonti came out of the fortress and succumbed to temptation, all of his people suffered. Amalickiah brought them back into captivity, and many were killed in battle later on. As converted followers of the Savior, we are commissioned to strengthen those around us. We get on high ground not just to save ourselves from the adversary but also so that we can lift others to safety.<br><br>Good friends help keep us on the high ground. Good friends strengthen us and help us live the commandments when we are with them. True friends will not make us choose between the Lord's ways and their ways (see Isaiah 55:8). If your present friends are taking you off the strait and narrow path and taking you from the high ground, depart from them now! Do not let the mocking from those who have chosen the "great and spacious building" shame you into leaving spiritual safety (see 1 Nephi 8:25–28).<br><br>Choose your friends carefully. When I was a little boy, my mother took me down to a pond, and we fed bread to the swans. She was a great teacher. She would say to me, "Do you see any vultures or birds of prey among those beautiful, peaceful swans? There are only swans because birds of a feather flock together!" The message was simple. Your friends will reflect what kind of a person you are and who you feel comfortable being around in your life. It is from your friends that you will ultimately choose your eternal companion, and it is your friends who help you stay on the strait and narrow path and be true and faithful.<br><br>At the same time we must ask ourselves "What kind of a friend am I?" Be a good example; be a light unto the world; lead and guide those around you on the path of righteousness. They are depending on you to lift and strengthen them.<br><h2><strong>Staying on High Ground: Desire and Faith</strong></h2><br>How then do we get to high ground and stay there? First, we must desire and seek to always be faithful to gospel teachings, commandments, and covenants. We must seek for the blessings which come from such obedience. We do this by cultivating an atmosphere in which the Spirit can always abide with us. Once on high ground, we stay there through obedience to the commandments, study and prayer, living principles of provident living and self-reliance, preparing for and honoring temple covenants, and building strong marriages and families.<br><br>To reach the high ground, we must first have the desire to be in the kingdom of God and above the things of the world. Faith is the principal element of that desire. The scriptures explain that faith is "not a perfect knowledge," but even if we "can no more than desire to believe," we can develop faith by experimenting upon the word (Alma 32:26–27)--or in other words, as we keep the commandments, our faith grows.<br><br>Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is the first principle of the gospel and the cornerstone of our eternal salvation. As we exercise our faith in our Savior and apply His teachings in our life, we will be strengthened and we will not fear the world or heed its enticements. The Lord's admonition to trust Him is clear: "Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not" (D&amp;amp;C 6:36).<br><br>We can be like Joseph Smith, whose service to the Lord began with a boy's simple faith in a scripture verse: "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God" (James 1:5). Joseph's sincere prayer was answered with the First Vision, and from that time he followed the Lord's instructions. Like Joseph did as he matured, we will also faithfully grow in gospel service. We will become more like our Savior in our actions of caring, giving, and testifying as we rely on the Holy Ghost to lead and guide us in all we do.<br><h2><strong>Having the Spirit to Be with Us</strong></h2><br>As we exercise our faith, relying on the Spirit helps us to reach high ground. At baptism we receive the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands by one having authority, just as the Savior promised His ancient Apostles that He would leave a Comforter with them (see John 14:26). I marvel that even though the Apostles were ultimately killed for their faith, all of them--other than Judas--remained true to the Savior to the end.<br><br>The Holy Ghost will also give us guidance, courage, and strength to stay on high ground. Through the influence of the Holy Ghost we can receive revelation in answer to our prayers, maintain strong testimonies of the Savior throughout our lives, endure to the end, and attain eternal life.<br><br>None of us are immune from the temptations of the adversary. That is why we are here in mortality. It is a test. We all need the fortification available through the Holy Ghost. How important it is during troubled times when we are tested that we do not do anything to lose the Holy Ghost's comfort, peace, and direction! Companionship with the Spirit will give us the strength to resist evil and, when necessary, to repent and return to the strait and narrow path that leads to eternal salvation.<br><br>I believe we cannot go far from the high ground if we always have the Spirit with us. Each Sabbath day we have an opportunity to renew our baptismal covenant by partaking of the sacrament. In doing so, we promise the Lord that we are willing to take His name upon us, always remember Him, and keep His commandments (see D&amp;amp;C 20:77). If we are willing to do this, we are given the great promise that we will always have His Spirit to be with us.<br><br>In the Book of Mormon, King Benjamin explained why our willingness to take upon ourselves the name of the Savior is so important:<br><br>There is no other name given whereby salvation cometh; therefore, I would that ye should take upon you the name of Christ, all you that have entered into the covenant with God that ye should be obedient unto the end of your lives.<br><br>And it shall come to pass that whosoever doeth this shall be found at the right hand of God, for he shall know the name by which he is called; for he shall be called by the name of Christ. [Mosiah 5:8–9]<br><br>As we strive to take upon us the name of Christ, to become Christians, we put Him and His work first in our lives. We sanctify ourselves and try to become like Him by seeking His will and faithfully serving others. As we follow the promptings of the Holy Ghost in this manner, we reach spiritual high ground.<br><h2><strong>Obedience</strong></h2><br>Obedience to Christ's teachings keeps us on high ground. As the Psalmist wrote:<br><br>Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? . . .<br><br>He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart. [Psalm 24:3–4]<br><br>We keep our hands clean and our hearts pure through obedience.<br><br>In the premortal existence we were blessed with agency--the ability to choose. We maintain that agency in this life by being obedient. Such obedience keeps us free from the bondage of Satan. If we are faithful and obedient, he cannot dominate or control us. I think what we have to remember is that if we have the Spirit with us, we have light, and Satan, who is the prince of darkness, cannot stand light. Therefore, with that light, if we tell him to depart, he must depart.<br><br>But just like in the scripture story of Lehonti and Amalickiah, the adversary is so clever in his temptation. He entices us to choose a momentary lapse in judgment, to come down from the high ground. In the process we can lose all of the blessings that are in store for us if we are faithful. I want so much for you to understand that you do not want to live your life regretting poor decisions or disobedient actions. I am reminded of Whittier's words:<br><br>For of all sad words of tongue or pen,<br><br>The saddest are these: "It might have been!"2<br><br>There is nothing sadder than spending your life in the present plagued by the decisions of the past. And what you have to remember about repentance is that an element of repentance is to forgive yourself, to let go of it, and the Lord will not call it to mind. Just remember there is nothing you have done that will stop you from putting it behind you.<br><br>If such a moment of weakness should come, please understand that through the Atonement of our Savior Jesus Christ there is a way back through repentance so that we can return to Them with honor. Even if we are already feeling the effects of evil's poison, there is an antidote. We can be restored to full spiritual health and happiness. Mercy can satisfy the demands of justice as we repent and return to the Father in our prayers and our conduct. Repentance and obedience to the commandments, faithfulness, and honoring our covenants will enable us to once again be worthy of eternal blessings.<br><h2><strong>Study and Prayer</strong></h2><br>Another important way we stay on the high ground is through faithful and thoughtful study and prayer. We can learn so much from our Savior. When He was tempted by Lucifer, He prayed to His Heavenly Father for strength and said, "Get thee behind me, Satan" (Luke 4:8).<br><br>You have to understand that you have a mortal body because you made a decision to come to this world to have a mortal experience, but Satan will never have a body, nor will his followers. And when you tell him to depart, he must depart. Once you understand that, you begin to understand who you are as a child of God.<br><br>What would have happened if Lehonti had prayed for guidance as Jesus did? Had he done so, I feel he would not have succumbed to Amalickiah's request to come down from the safety of the mountaintop. I am sure the Spirit would have warned Lehonti of the dangers to him and his people. I am grateful for the scriptures because I can learn from those who were examples of faithfulness and courage and can avoid the mistakes of those who were not faithful. I am grateful that I can seek guidance in prayer and follow the Spirit's promptings.<br><br>I am also grateful for the opportunity we each have to learn from the study and observation of others, especially our families. My mother was a great influence on me. I never would have done anything that would have caused her any heartache and pain. I also loved my father. Dad didn't preach to me. He quietly set a good example and led by gentle persuasion and kind expectations. As the youngest in our family, I also learned from my older brother and sister--I would say to myself, "Boy, I don't want to do that one!" It's very interesting. If you can learn from the scriptures, and if you can learn from those around you and not have to experience it yourself, it really helps. But the greatest influence on me is my eternal companion. The most important decision that we make in our lives is whom we will marry, and I am so grateful for my sweetheart--for the example that she has been for over 50 years, tenderly guiding me and our family along the strait and narrow path.<br><h2><strong>Spiritual and Temporal Well-Being</strong></h2><br>In addition to faith, the gift of the Holy Ghost, study, and prayer, the Lord has given us some other important principles for our spiritual and temporal well-being so that we can stay on high ground.<br><br>The Lord's storehouse is both spiritual and temporal. Through faith and obedience to the commandments, we build a spiritual reservoir of strength to meet life's challenges. But we must replenish it all the time. It's a little like the story in the Old Testament about the manna. The Israelites had to get new manna each day, so they would have to be faithful to have it replenished. That's the way spiritual power is. Similarly, we should follow wise principles of provident living and self-reliance to build temporal resources to meet our needs and serve others.<br><br>Provident living means not coveting the things of this world. It means using the resources of the earth wisely and not being wasteful, even in times of plenty. Provident living means avoiding excessive debt and being content with having that which is sufficient for our needs.<br><br>For example, one element of provident living is to obtain an education and vocational training to prepare us for a profession that will sustain us and our families. Then we must give a full day's effort for a full day's pay. Such a work ethic, coupled with the qualities of integrity, character, and trustworthiness, qualify each of us as a "laborer . . . worthy of his hire" (D&amp;amp;C 31:5).<br><br>Another element of provident living is the ability to live joyfully within our means--avoiding excessive debt and not coveting the temporal things of this world. I want so much for you to understand that now at your age. There seems to be a sense of entitlement in today's culture--a feeling that we should acquire right now everything that our parents have acquired over many years. Debt can enslave us. When we become burdened with excessive debt, we have given away our precious, priceless agency and placed ourselves in self-imposed servitude, spending all of our time, all of our energy, and all of our means to the repayment of our debts. A mounting feeling of hopelessness from this situation builds stress, which depresses us mentally and physically, affecting our self-worth, our relationship with our companion, and ultimately our feelings toward the Lord.<br><br>It is essential that we understand the need for and develop a spending and savings plan--a budget--and distinguish between wants and needs. I have often felt that a companionship needs not only to hear the cherished three words "I love you" but also the tender four words of caring "We can't afford it." When a couple makes financial decisions, they have to talk with one another. If a wife or a husband makes a large purchase without discussing it together and taking it to the Lord in prayer, it causes financial stress in a marriage. And financial stress is the number one cause of divorce! (That and, of course, immorality.) If couples are not one in temporal and financial matters, I can assure you they are not going to be one in spiritual matters.<br><br>Self-reliance is taking responsibility for our own spiritual and temporal welfare and for those whom Heavenly Father has entrusted to our care. When we are self-reliant, we can better emulate the Savior in serving and blessing others. We raise ourselves to a higher ground so that we can reach down and lift others. The reason you will have success in your life is not for self-gratification but so that you can help others. Our ability to serve is increased or diminished by the level of our self-reliance.<br><br>These welfare principles are practical guidelines to teach us a prudent lifestyle that will bring happiness in our daily lives and prepare us to meet and endure the challenges and emergencies in the tests of life. Having applied these welfare principles in our own life, we then are able to stay on high ground and reach out to others in need of help. We can also teach them how to have provident living and self-reliance in their lives.<br><br>These principles are just as important for an individual as for a family. If you are not married yet, begin practicing them yourself so that when that time comes you have already formed sound habits. Such self-discipline will bless your family greatly in the future.<br><br>The payment of tithing and fast offerings is an important element in establishing a provident-living lifestyle. Paying our tithes and offerings develops personal righteousness and fortifies our faith to sustain us through the trials, tribulations, and sorrows in our life's journey. It helps to quench the selfish, temporal thirst for the things of this world and turns our thoughts and actions to eternal objectives and a willingness to help others in need. If we are willing to give our tithes and offerings, we will be blessed, and we will experience a mighty change of heart--from a worldly taking and getting mentality to a Christlike loving, sharing, and giving attitude.<br><br>If we are prepared by following welfare principles, not only shall we "not fear" (D&amp;amp;C 38:30) for ourselves, but we will also be able to overcome our adversity and assist others in their time of need. That is the great blessing of provident living and becoming self-reliant. I hope that you will all learn it and practice it in your lives.<br><h2><strong>The Temple</strong></h2><br>Provident living also blesses us with the time and peace of mind to focus on other important aspects of staying on the high ground. The temple is the highest ground we can achieve in mortality. For us today, the temple is our mountaintop--it is the Lord's chosen house for sacred teachings, eternal covenants and ordinances, and personal communication with the Lord. It is where we covenant with the Lord, and when we make those covenants, it's as though we are in His presence.<br><br>The temple is a place apart from the world--dedicated and consecrated to the Lord. It is a place where we learn of the foundation of the world, the purpose of mankind in mortality, and the qualifications necessary to receive eternal blessings. In the temple, what is recorded on earth is recorded in heaven, and what is sealed on earth is sealed in heaven for time and all eternity. The eternal covenants we make with the Lord in the temple can never be broken--except by our own disobedience. If we are obedient to these eternal ordinances and covenants, we are prepared to live eternally with God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. The temple is also a place where we can go before the Lord in prayer and pour out our desires and concerns. It is a sacred place where we can ponder and pray for strength to deal with our problems and for direction for our lives. When we are troubled or have crucial decisions that weigh heavily on our mind and soul, we can take our cares to the temple and receive spiritual guidance. I hope that you will take advantage of that in your life.<br><br>Temple covenants and worship are critical to staying on high ground. If we have not yet received sacred temple covenants, we must set our sights on going to the temple to receive the Lord's promised blessings. After we have been to the temple, we should faithfully and frequently return to worship and perform sacred ordinances for others.<br><br>Many of you are preparing to be sealed as eternal companions with a choice son or daughter of Heavenly Father. Some of you have already attained that blessing and are preparing to fulfill your responsibilities as parents. Whether these blessings come in this life or in the next, they will come to all who are faithful. If you have been born to parents who were sealed in the temple, thank them and our Heavenly Father for this great blessing. If not, be grateful to your parents and all who have helped you stand today on the high ground of the gospel. Commit yourself to be sealed in the temple and to raise your children in the covenant. The blessings of a temple marriage that you enjoy in this life and the next will bless you and your posterity throughout eternity.<br><h2><strong>Building Strong Marriages and Families</strong></h2><br>As we strive to keep our temple covenants and build strong marriages and families, we fortify ourselves with a shield of faith to protect us from the fiery darts of the adversary.<br><br>Knowing that temple ordinances and covenants are necessary for us to enter into the highest degree of the celestial kingdom, I have often wondered why some who have taken upon themselves sacred temple covenants and reached the high ground would ever break them and come down from the high ground. Such unfaithfulness, in turn, breaks the hearts of their companions and children, who desire to be an eternal family.<br><br>I have observed over the years many, many couples who have maintained strong and vital marriages as they have remained true to their temple covenants. In conclusion tonight, let me share with you what I have seen these successful couples do. These seemingly "little" things have fortified and strengthened these families.<br><br>First, couples who build strong marriages and families know who they are. They know that they are a son or daughter of God. They set eternal goals to once again live with our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. They strive to leave the ways of the natural man behind.<br><br>Second, they know the doctrines of the gospel and the importance of temple ordinances and covenants. They know that keeping their covenants is necessary to achieve eternal goals.<br><br>Third, they choose to obtain the eternal blessings of the kingdom of God rather than the temporal and temporary possessions of the world. They seek high ground and stay there.<br><br>Fourth, such couples realize that when they are sealed for time and all eternity, they have chosen an eternal companion. There is no need to look any further. Their courting days are over.<br><br>Fifth, these couples think of one another before self. They grow together, and not apart, as they serve one another, love one another, care for one another, and communicate together with the Lord in prayer. They converse often with one another, thereby never letting little things become big things. They talk early about the "little hurts" with little fear of offending. In this way they avoid big explosions of bitter feelings. It is so much better to let off a little steam before the top blows off the pressure cooker! These couples seek one another's good and avoid selfishness, which suffocates spiritual sensitivity. They do not nag, ridicule, or speak ill of one another to others. They know that such language and behavior damages the eternal potential of their relationship. They are willing to change their hearts, to repent, to apologize, and to ask forgiveness if they have hurt the one they love. They work now to improve their relationship, knowing that they are not suddenly going to become nicer when they die! They cultivate a thoughtful, considerate spirit and love one another always. In so doing, they lift each other to high ground and strengthen one another in their determination to stay there together.<br><h2><strong>Conclusion and Testimony</strong></h2><br>My brothers and sisters, I hope that you can see the importance of seeking and maintaining spiritual high ground in our lives and of bringing others to the high ground with us. My hope and prayer is that you will truly understand who you are and conduct your life in such a way as to always have the Spirit to be with you. As you do, you will attain the spiritual high ground that will qualify you and your posterity for all of the eternal blessings that are rightfully yours.<br><br>May the Lord's choicest blessings be with you, the rising generation. You are the royal army that will lead you, your families, your friends, and those you serve to the high ground. I testify that those who make seeking and maintaining the high ground their lifelong quest will be blessed to one day stand on the highest ground--in the presence of God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. That we may all live our lives to be worthy of attaining such celestial blessings through our obedience in keeping sacred covenants is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><em style="color: #333333; line-height: 24.375px;">Robert D.

<h1>rward with Faith During Difficult Times - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
During the past year we have seen much economic turmoil--banks failing, businesses laying off employees, home mortgages being foreclosed, and retirement accounts shrinking. Thousands have lost their jobs, and many worry about paying for necessities such as food, clothing, and housing. In January of this year the unemployment rate in the United States hit a 16-year high at 7.6 percent, and it continues to rise.<br><br>I am sure many of you students have asked yourselves, "After I graduate, will I be able to find employment?" In addition to economic troubles, across the globe terrorist threats continue and mistrust, misunderstanding, and hatred abound. It is a discouraging and disheartening time. As I thought about the challenges we face today, my mind went back to the struggles of my great-great-grandmother and my parents as well as to two of my favorite scriptures.<br><br>My great-great-grandmother Eliza Cusworth was born in England in 1824 and married Joseph Burton in 1846. They lived happily for a few years and had two children, Joseph and Martha. In 1849 two LDS missionaries came to the area, and both Eliza and Joseph listened to them, gained testimonies of the gospel, and were baptized. The counsel of the prophet at that time was for the Saints to migrate to Utah. Joseph and Eliza started saving so that they could make the journey.<br><br>Joseph was employed as a carrier delivering goods from the depot to various stores. While lifting at work he broke a blood vessel, which resulted in his death a short time later. His dying request to Eliza was for her to migrate to Utah so she could do their temple work and raise their children among the Saints in Zion. Eliza promised him she would do this.<br><br>Understandably, both Eliza's and Joseph's families discouraged her from making what they said was "a foolish journey." Eliza's mother said that if Eliza would stay with them, they would take care of her and her children, and she would want for nothing. Joseph's family offered to give her any amount of money if she would stay in England. It was a difficult decision for Eliza. However, she had made a promise to her dying husband, and she knew the gospel was true, so she chose to go.<br><br>In the spring of 1856, at age 32, Eliza packed her trunks and embarked on the 6,000-mile journey with Joseph and Martha, her two children. They went by train to Liverpool, England, and boarded the ship<i>Horizon</i>on May25, 1856. During the voyage Eliza suffered from severe seasickness. It got so bad that for about 10 days she was unable even to care for her children. The<i>Horizon</i>landed in Boston on June 30, 1856, and then Eliza and her children traveled by boat and train to Iowa City, Iowa, where the railway ended. She had planned to join a wagon train at Iowa City; however, upon arrival she discovered that they were too late--the last of the wagon trains had already gone. She had no choice but to wait for handcarts to be made. When the handcarts were ready, the travelers were told they would have to leave most of their belongings behind, as they could bring only necessities on the handcarts. Eliza's trunks contained many of her valuable possessions--silverware, linen, bedsheets, and clothing. Most of it had to be left behind.<br><br>Eliza joined the Martin Handcart Company, which left Iowa City on July 30, 1856, for the 1,300-mile trek to Salt Lake City. She pulled the handcart, little seven-year-old Joseph walked and helped her pull the cart part of the time, and four-year-old Martha rode in the handcart. During the first part of the journey everyone got along quite well. At night many would gather around the campfires after supper and sing songs such as "Come, Come, Ye Saints." However, travel was slower than expected because they had to stop frequently to repair the hurriedly made handcarts.<br><br>The days wore on, and the members of the company tried to encourage one another. Often the only fuel available was buffalo chips with which they made fires to do their cooking and dry their clothing. After a while their food began to run low. Sometimes the men were able to kill buffalo, but after the company's store of salt gave out, the meat often made them sick. Toward the latter part of their journey, the food was almost gone, and rations were reduced to one-fourth pound of flour per person per day. The season was getting late and the nights were cold--their clothing was thin, and they had little bedding. In their weakened condition, many became discouraged and wondered if they would ever reach the Salt Lake Valley.<br><br>When the company reached Devil's Gate, they ran out of food entirely. At some ranchers' cabins they tried to buy food, but the ranchers could sell them only some pelts of deer and mountain sheep that were dry and old. After soaking them and scraping off the hair, they cooked them into a soup that was thickened with their last remaining flour. Eating this helped relieve their hunger for a time.<br><br>Eliza waded across the Sweetwater River three times in one evening. First, she took little Joseph across on her back. When she reached the other side, Joseph was so frightened that he wouldn't stay by himself and tried to follow her back. Eliza had to tie him to a nearby tree while she went back to get Martha. Then she had to go back a third time to get her handcart. She spent part of the night in freezing weather drying her clothes over the fire.<br><br>An early winter storm struck as the group was plodding its way along the Sweetwater River about 50 miles north of what is now Rawlins, Wyoming. The company waded through an icy stream and sought shelter in a nearby cove. Using frying pans and tin plates, they cleared the snow away as best they could and pitched their tents beside a tiny spring. As the desperate Saints huddled together in the cove, everyone hoped and prayed that they could survive until help arrived.<br><br>Brigham Young heard that the handcart company was marooned in the snow and sent rescuers with teams and food to assist them. More than one-fourth of the 500 members of the Martin Handcart Company perished, and many more would have died had Brigham Young not sent the rescuers. Eliza and her two children suffered greatly, but somehow they made it, arriving in the Salt Lake Valley on November 30, 1856.<br><br>When Eliza reached the Salt Lake Valley, sheinquired about William Cusworth, a cousin who had gone to Utah earlier in the season in a wagon train and with whom she intended to make her home for a while. She learned that he had become discouraged and had taken his family back to Iowa. She and her children were taken to the home of Isaac Leney, where they received care for a few weeks. Little Joseph lost two of his toes because his feet hadbeenfrozen.<br><br>They eventually settled in Pleasant Grove, where Eliza met and married Nathan Staker, a widower with several children. Eliza and Nathan moved to Mount Pleasant, where they helped pioneer Sanpete County. In addition to Joseph and Martha, Eliza had four children with Nathan Staker: three daughters and one son. Eliza raised her children and was a faithful Latter-day Saint all of her life, dying at age90.<br><br>By any objective standard it was foolish for her, a single mother with two young children, to attempt the 6,000-mile journey by boat, train, and handcart. Why did she do it? Because she wanted to keep a promise she had made to her husband. As I look back on her decision 153 years later, I believe she did the right thing. She was able to make it safely, have her and Joseph's temple work done, and raise their children in Zion. Because she was true to the promises she made to her husband and to God, I and her other descendants have been blessed beyond measure. I am confident that she and her husband Joseph are now together. I bless her name and am proud to call her my great-great-grandmother. One day when I meet her, I will embrace her and thank her for having the courage and humility to keep a promise to her husband and to follow the counsel of aprophet.<br><br>I also think of my mother and father and how they faced the troubles of their day. They both entered BYU in the 1930s during the Great Depression. They met at BYU, married in 1936, and had their first child early in 1938 while they were still in school. They struggled to pay tuition and to earn enough money for food and rent. My father majored in agronomy, and as he approached graduation in 1938, the unemployment rate was 15 percent, about twice what it is today. He wondered if he would be able to find a job and support his wife and child. One of his professors encouraged him to take the civil service exam, and he did well enough on the exam that he was offered a job with the Soil Conservation Service within the Department of Agriculture. He was assigned to do soil surveys in New England, North Dakota--a small town in the southwestern part of the state. It was not where he or his wife would have chosen to go, but it was a job, and they went.<br><br>When they arrived, they discovered that there were no other members of the Church in the town. Dad and Mother held Sunday School in our home, and occasionally the full-time missionaries, who served in Dickinson, 30 miles to the north, would visit us. Money was tight, and some vital commodities were rationed during World War II, including gasoline, meat, sugar, and butter. These items were in short supply, and rationing was the only way to make sure everyone got their fair share. Even if you had money to buy more, you were only allowed to buy small amounts of the rationed items.<br><br>When I was six we moved to Dickinson, North Dakota, and after 14 years of marriage, my parents were able to buy a home. The economic situation improved somewhat after World War II; we had basic necessities, but with six children it was a challenge for my parents to meet their expenses. My mother taught us Primary at home, and we held church in our living room with our family, the two full-time missionaries, and Frank Whitney, the only other Church member in the town at the time. Gradually the Church grew--several families moved in, and a few were baptized. We rented a hall in the community center to hold church services. My Dad worked with the local Lions Club and Methodist Church to start a Scout program.<br><br>When I was 13 my dad was transferred toBismarck, North Dakota, a beautiful little town on the Missouri River. My parents bought a three-bedroom rambler with an unfinished basement and no garage, and our family had one car, which we all shared. Mother took a job as a medical stenographer. I was happy that there was a small branch of the Church in Bismarck with several other teenagers. Our branch met in the basement of a local hotel, and as we set up for church on Sunday mornings, we usually had to clear away a few beer cans that had been left from the night before. As the branch grew, we were able to rent a small church from the Seventh-day Adventists.<br><br>At that time, Church policy was that localunits had to earn a certain percentage of the cost before they could build a chapel. Iremember many branch bake sales being heldso we could earn money and one day have our own chapel. In addition, members were encouraged to contribute what they could to the building fund, but the branch wassmall and most members could not afford to give much. Accumulation of funds was slow, and I wondered if we would ever be able to build our own chapel. Finally, when Ireached age 18--after years of dreaming, planning, and working--we had earned enough to pay our share of the cost to build asmall chapel.<br><br>After I left North Dakota, the Church continued to grow. The Bismarck Stake was organized in the 1980s, and then in 1998 a small temple was constructed. For those of us who grew up in North Dakota and lived through the early struggles, the construction of a temple in Bismarck was a miracle that we had never dreamed could happen. Prior to that time the closest temple was in Idaho Falls, Idaho, 750 miles away.<br><br>My parents married and graduated during a challenging time--the Great Depression. They were sent to a cold and unknown place far from their families and their beloved Utah. Mother and Dad experienced North Dakota blizzards, rationing during the war, and the birth of a handicapped son. They went forward with faith and did the best they could during difficult times. As I look back on my life, I cherish the experiences I had in North Dakota. It is not where my parents would have chosen to raise us, but I thank God for sending them there. We associated with many good people of different faiths who enriched our lives, and we learned much from facing economic and spiritual challenges. I thank my parents for their faith and courage through much adversity. They taught us well and were true to theirideals.<br><br>Another inspiring example of great faith under severe economic adversity is recorded in 1 Kings 17. There was a severe drought, and the Lord told Elijah to go dwell in Zarephath, where a widow would sustain him. In verses 8through 16 it states:<br><br><i>And the word of the Lord came unto him, saying,</i><br><br><i>Arise, get thee to Zarephath, . . . and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.</i><br><br><i>So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.</i><br><br><i>And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.</i><br><br><i>And she said, As the Lord thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.</i><br><br><i>And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.</i><br><br><i>For thus saith the Lord God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth.</i><br><br><i>And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.</i><br><br><i>And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the Lord, which he spake by Elijah.</i><br><br>Finally, Nephi was a wonderful example of faith during a time of great adversity. As recorded in 1 Nephi 16, after he broke his bow his family was "much fatigued," "did suffer much for the want of food," and "did begin to murmur exceedingly, because of their sufferings" (verses 19–20). While everyone else complained, Nephi tried to find a solution to the problem. He used his mind and the resources available to him to make a sling and a new bow, and with them he was able to obtain food. Nephi was as tired and hungry as everyone else, but rather than complain, he used his mind and energy to seek for a solution to the problem.<br><br>I gain courage and hope from the examples of my great-great-grandmother, my parents, the widow who fed Elijah, and Nephi. I have learned much from them, and I offer several suggestions that may be helpful to all of us as we face the problems and uncertainties of today.<br><br>First, as we face difficulties, we can use our minds and the resources God has given us to seek solutions to our problems. If we spend our energies trying to solve problems rather than complaining about them or blaming others, we will have fewer problems.<br><br>Second, every difficulty brings opportunities. Too often we stress over the closed doors rather than taking advantage of the open doors. Even in difficult economic times, I am confident that there are opportunities, and we will find them if we are diligent in looking forthem.<br><br>Third, even though we may have very little, we can share what we have with those around us. The widow of Zarephath scarcely had sufficient food for herself and her son, but she shared with Elijah and had faith that the Lord would provide. As we exercise faith by sharing with others and paying our tithes and offerings, I am sure we will be blessed.<br><br>Finally, no matter how challenging our situations, if we trust in God, obey His laws, and offer our best efforts, He has promised to sustain us. His help will not always be in the way we prefer and may not come as quickly as we desire. Even with His help, the road may not be easy--but He will help us. Great blessings come when the faithful endure adversity.<br><br>I testify that our Father in Heaven and His Son live and love us. Our Savior wants us to succeed and will support us through our trials if we have the faith to follow Him and the counsel He has given through His prophets. Isay this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Stephen J.

<h1> upon the Rock - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Sister Jensen and I are thankful to be here today. We feel a debt of gratitude to the administration, faculty, and staff of this great university. To have studied and taught here are among the great experiences of our lives, and now they are memories we treasure. Three of our four sons and a daughter-in-law are BYU graduates.<br><br>No one who knows the scriptures, specifically the prophecies concerning the latter days, is surprised by the events in the world. We do live in the perilous, stormy times prophesied (see Matthew 24, 2 Timothy 3:1–7, and D&amp;amp;C 45), and we see the fulfillment of the prophecy to Joseph Smith that "all things shall be in commotion; and surely, men's hearts shall fail them; for fear shall come upon all people" (D&amp;amp;C 88:91). However, the Lord promises, "My people will I preserve" (Moses 7:61).<br><br>During my lifetime, or the last 60-plus years, we as a Church and as a people have successfully weathered the storms of life because of our willingness "to be guided in a right and proper way" (D&amp;amp;C 101:63) and because of the rock upon which we build. Helaman counseled his sons:<br><br><i>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.</i> [Helaman 5:12]<br><br>I know that we will face both current and future storms successfully because of this rock upon which we build our lives, our faith, and our testimonies. I began to build on this foundation in my childhood at home.<br><h2><b>Making Jesus Christ the Rock in My Parents'Home</b></h2><br>I hold in my hand two books that are truly among my most prized possessions. The first is titled <i>A Voice from the Dust,</i> a narrative edition of the Book of Mormon (Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1939); the other is a leather edition of the Pearl of Great Price. These two books, and my experiences with them, helped me to build my life, my faith, my testimony, and my ministry on Jesus Christ and His gospel.<br><br>I am the sixth of 10 children. We lived in a humble home in Mapleton, Utah, about eight miles south of Provo. Father and Mother listened to and followed the counsel of the prophets and apostles. They had faith in President Joseph F. Smith's promise that parents will not lose their children if they teach them the gospel at home. It was in that humble setting that Father and Mother held what were called family nights.<br><br>The family nights I remember consisted of lessons, games, and Mother's desserts. I can visualize myself sitting by my father's side or on his lap, listening to him read stories from <i>AVoice from the Dust </i>and helping us build our lives on the rock of our Redeemer.<br><br>We experienced together a central Book of Mormon theme that I call "the power of the word" (see Alma 31:5).<br><h2><b>Emphasizing the Word--A Central Book ofMormon Theme</b></h2><br>In the very first verse of the Book of Mormon, Nephi emphasized the power of words when he wrote, "I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; ... having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God" (1 Nephi 1:1). A focus on words continues on through the Book of Mormon. Moroni's last chapter concludes with an emphasis on the power of the word and an invitation to come unto Christ:<br><br><i>And I exhort you to remember these things; ... for ye shall see me at the bar of God; and the Lord God will say unto you: Did I not declare my words unto you, which were written by this man? ...</i><br><br><i>And God shall show unto you, that that which Ihave written is true.</i><br><br><i>And again I would exhort you that ye would come unto Christ....</i><br><br><i>Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him.</i> [Moroni 10:27, 29–30, 32]<br><br>Similarly, a significant theme repeated through Mosiah, Alma, Helaman, and 3 Nephi is this power of the word. From page 195 to page 427 in the Book of Mormon, the word <i>word</i> appears over 165 times. Not surprisingly, most of the instances center on learning and teaching the word. For example:<br><br><i>Now these sons of Mosiah were with Alma at the time the angel first appeared unto him;</i> [and] <i>they were still his brethren in the Lord; yea, and they had waxed strong in the knowledge of the truth; for they were men of a sound understanding and they had searched the scriptures diligently, that they might know the word of God.</i> [Alma 17:2]<br><br>These missionaries said their successes were "because of the power of his word which [was] in [them]" (Alma 26:13).<br><h2><b>Comparing the Word to a Seed</b></h2><br>A powerful focus on the power of the word is found in chapters 31 through 34 of Alma, beginning with this verse:<br><br><i>And now, as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which was just--yea, it had had more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had happened unto them--therefore Alma thought it was expedient that they should trythe virtue of the word of God.</i> [Alma 31:5]<br><br>To try the virtue of the word is to try the power of the word.<br><br>I have learned much by studying these four chapters in Alma as a single treatise on the power of the word. I recommend that you take time to study, search, and ponder this treatise, disregarding the chapter breaks and verse numbers. Consider reading them aloud. Focus on the doctrines, principles, and commandments and on the power of the word and the central message of Jesus Christ and His infinite Atonement! It can be a profound experience!<br><br>Alma compared the word unto a seed. Ipause to emphasize that I have heard some in the Church cite Alma 32:28 and teach that Alma compared faith to a seed. The precise comparison is the word to a seed. I will read verses 28 and 30, and in each instance following the first sentence where the word <i>seed</i> appears, I will substitute the word <i>word:</i><br><br><i>Now, we will compare the word unto a seed. Now, if ye give place, that a</i> [word] <i>may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be a true</i> [word], <i>or a good</i> [word], <i>if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves--It must needs be that this is a good</i> [word], <i>or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me....</i><br><br><i>But behold, as the</i> [word] <i>swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, then you must needs say that the</i> [word] <i>is good; for behold it swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow. And now, behold, will not this strengthen your faith? Yea, it will strengthen your faith: for ye will say I know that this is a good</i> [word]; <i>for behold it sprouteth and beginneth to grow.</i> [Alma 32:28, 30]<br><br>True words, true doctrines, and true principles planted by faith, like seeds, will sprout and grow. They lead to testimony. Listenagain to three words from the last line of verse 30. They are "I know that." These words often introduce expressions of testimony: "I know that God lives" or "I know that Jesus is the Christ" or "I know that the Book of Mormon is true." We hear variations of this phrase in "I testify that" or "I declare that" or "I witness that"--all acceptable and appropriate.<br><br>Alma continued his emphasis on the power of the word. He then concluded his message, encouraging the people to<br><br><i>begin to believe in the Son of God, that he will come to redeem his people, and that he shall suffer and die to atone for their sins; and that he shall rise again from the dead, which shall bring to pass the resurrection, that all men shall stand before him, to be judged at the last and judgment day, according to their works.</i><br><br><i>And now, my brethren, I desire that ye shall plant this word in your hearts.</i> [Alma 33:22–23]<br><br>While Alma was teaching, Amulek had discerned the thoughts of the multitude and pointed out, "We have beheld that the great question which is in your minds is whether the word be in the Son of God, or whether there shall be no Christ" (Alma 34:5). Amulek then reminded the people that Alma had used scriptures--the testimonies of others--to prove "that the word is in Christ unto salvation" (Alma 34:6; see also verse 7). Amulek then went on to give his own witness and testimony, anexcellent example of what scriptures call "pure testimony" (Alma 4:19):<br><br><i>And now, behold, I will testify unto you of myself that these things are true. Behold, I say unto you, that I do know that Christ shall come among the children of men, to take upon him the transgressions of his people, and that he shall atone for the sins of the world; for the Lord God hath spoken it.</i> [Alma 34:8]<br><br>All of this is summarized by Alma's promise to those who experiment upon the word:<br><br><i>And because of your diligence and your faith and your patience with the word in nourishing it, that it may take root in you, behold, by and by ye shall pluck the fruit thereof, which is most precious, ... sweet, ... and pure.</i> [Alma 32:42]<br><br>I pause to note that the words <i>by and by</i> today may mean a future time or occasion, but an archaic meaning is "before long, soon." In the New Testament they mean "immediately" (see Bible Dictionary, s.v. "by and by," 627–28).<br><h2><b>Building a Testimony on the Rock of Revelation</b></h2><br>Beginning in my home under the loving care of my faithful parents and through my mission and marriage and family life, Jesus Christ and His gospel have been the rock upon which I have built my testimony. As I look back now, Ifind that my knowledge and testimony of the doctrines and principles of the restored gospel came sequentially in four ways.<br><br>First, during my childhood and youth my testimony was one of faith--faith in the words, the testimony, and the examples of parents, teachers, and leaders.<br><br>Second, my testimony was strengthened intellectually during missionary service. I immersed myself in the scriptures, especially in the Book of Mormon. I read and studied all four standard works and found a symphony of divine doctrine--so reasonable, so logical, and so satisfying.<br><br>Third, my testimony developed through experiences such as receiving answers to prayers, giving and receiving priesthood blessings, paying tithes and offerings, recognizing the blessings of fasting, and many others.<br><br>Fourth, I received absolute assurances of the Holy Ghost--revelations that came directly to my mind and my heart.<br><br>The testimony that took root in me those many years ago--like the seed that is watered, nurtured, and cared for--has grown into a tree and continues to grow today.<br><br>Sister Jensen and I dated in high school and graduated together in 1960. In January 1961 we decided that we would marry and that I would not serve a mission. We attended sacrament meetings together, either at her ward in Springville or at mine in Mapleton. In mid-January we attended my ward and listened to a returned missionary report on his mission to Mexico. Following that meeting I turned to Lonie and said, "We have made a mistake. Iwant to serve a mission."<br><br>At that time prospective missionaries were interviewed by a General Authority. The Presiding Bishop of the Church, Joseph L. Wirthlin, interviewed me. I remember only two questions he asked me: The first was "Can you walk 25 miles a day?"<br><br>I said "yes." I was playing a lot of basketball and was in excellent physical condition.<br><br>The second question was "Can you stand on a street corner anywhere in the world, gather a crowd around you, and testify to them that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God?"<br><br>I said "yes" to Bishop Wirthlin because of the second book I brought with me today, the Pearl of Great Price. This book was always visible in our home. Of course it is shorter than the triple combination, so, as a boy, I read it. I read it several times, especially the accounts of the First Vision and the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. I knew that what I read was true. I began to feel the power of the word in my heart. There were other influences on my testimony, such as the hymns of the Restoration, experiences in seminary, Church meetings, and service, but at its bedrock, my testimony was founded on the word of God as recorded in scripture.<br><br>Sister Jensen said she would wait for me, and, as you can see, she did--although during the mission I did detect some apostasy on her part when I learned that she was dating another man. A few well-worded letters from me about not getting serious with him had their desired effect. I am thankful she listened. We married in the Manti Temple 33 days after Ireturned home.<br><br>Although I left for my mission partially relying on the borrowed light of the faith and testimony of excellent parents, wonderful neighbors, and good teachers and leaders, I soon lost myself in the service of others. I worked hard and I was obedient. As a result, I experienced what President Gordon B. Hinckley experienced on his mission. "Something happened inside of me in England that was so significant and deep-rooted that Ihave never gotten over it," he said. "It is the same thing I have seen happen to thousands of other young men and women who commit themselves to the Lord, and their faith in Him becomes their anchor. Everything good that has happened to me is a result of what happened while I lived in that land" (in Sheri L. Dew, <i>Go Forward with Faith: The Biography of Gordon B. Hinckley</i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1996], 547).<br><h2><b>Building on the Rock Through Consistent and More Meaningful Scripture Study</b></h2><br>During my mission I resolved to live the gospel, to be obedient, to keep sacred covenants, to remain active and serve in the Church, and to always be worthy of and have acurrent temple recommend. Two specific commitments were to never let a day go by without daily personal prayer and daily scripture study. Since coming home from my mission more than 45 years ago, I have not faltered in keeping these commitments.<br><br>Studying and searching scriptures are not ends in themselves; rather, they are means to the higher ends of building our faith and testimony on the rock of our Redeemer so we can "pluck the fruit thereof, which is most precious, ... sweet, ... and pure" (Alma 32:42).<br><br>I have identified six suggestions. Some of them come from the apostles. These suggestions have constantly helped me to make daily scripture study more meaningful and ensure that Iam building upon the rock of our Redeemer. I testify they will help you.<br><br>1. Pray. Make prayer a part of scripture study. Pause to ask God for His Spirit to teach you. I had a chastening experience by the Spirit one day for failing to pray and reverence the scriptures. I had boarded an airplane, and while waiting to take off I thumbed through an in-flight magazine and a newspaper. I then took my scriptures from my briefcase and began to thumb through them, treating them like the magazine and newspaper. Suddenly this thought came into my mind: "You are treating my holy words like ordinary magazines. The scriptures are sacred. Pause to pray. Treat them with reverence and respect."<br><br>2. Pay the right price. Whether you study and search the scriptures chronologically, by themes, by topics, or by using a combination ofthe two, pay the right price: study, search, ponder, liken, feast upon, compare, analyze, and synthesize.<br><br>3. Look for patterns, themes, and connections. The footnotes and other scripture study aids are there to assist you.<br><br>4. Create outlines and write down your scripture insights. Have paper and pencil by you as you study the scriptures to mark and annotate them and to write down your impressions. Going through the scriptures regularly is good, but to have the scriptures go through you and to have them change you only comes at a price. A superb illustration of this principle is recorded in the vision of the redemption of the dead found in Doctrine and Covenants 138. Note the following:<br><br>a. As we are told in verses 1 and 2, President Joseph F. Smith sat in his room pondering the Atonement. I visualize him seated at a table with scriptures, paper, and pencil, having eliminated distractions. Ihave learned that it is not productive to lie down while studying the scriptures. Perhaps you have learned this same lesson.<br><br>b. He opened his scriptures, read them, reflected, and connected ideas (see verses 2–6).<br><br>c. He pondered, he marveled, and he wondered (see verses 11, 25, 28–29).<br><br>d. He recorded the revelation on paper, and it is now canonized (see section 138 heading).<br><br>5. Mark, annotate, and write in your scriptures. Shading, underlining, and making marginal notes and annotations are useful practices. I found in my early years that I over marked my scriptures. Since serving as a mission president in 1975, I am on my fourth set of scriptures and will likely do a fifth set. Two purposes for marking, annotating, and writing in your scriptures are (1) to capture revelations you receive as you study and (2) to retrieve or recall what you learned. In a way, well-marked scriptures are a portable revelatory filing system.<br><br>6. Teach what you learn. By this you will demonstrate if you have truly mastered a topic. Until I am able to articulate what I am studying, I confess that I have not yet mastered it. I will be forever thankful to the faculty in the College of Education who instilled in me the simple concept "teach to learn" rather than "learn to teach." Dr. Walter Gong, father of Gerrit Gong, assistant to President Samuelson, was a visiting faculty member in the mid-1980s who taught me principles of learning and teaching that are central to my service as aGeneral Authority.<br><h2><b>A Pattern for Using the Word to Prepare for the Coming of the Lord</b></h2><br>Before I conclude, allow me to briefly summarize what has been taught today. We began by noting that those who build on the rock of our Redeemer are successfully meeting the challenges of our day. We discussed how to ensure that we build on the rock, focusing on the power of the word as an effective way to build a firm testimony. Finally, I shared with you six suggestions for ensuring that your study of the word leads you always to the rockof our Redeemer.<br><br>One of those six suggestions was to look for patterns. The Lord told the Prophet Joseph Smith, "I will give unto you a pattern in all things" (D&amp;amp;C 52:14). One pattern that has singular parallels with us and our day can be seen in the Book of Mormon, beginning in Mosiah 25 and ending in 3 Nephi 11.<br><br>The events described in Mosiah 25 took place about 145 B.C., when we see the formation of a church. In the rest of Mosiah, in all of Alma and Helaman, and in the first 10 chapters of 3 Nephi, parents, prophets, missionaries, and other leaders labored diligently to prepare a people for the First Coming of the Savior.<br><br>In 1830, as described in the Doctrine and Covenants, we see the formation of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Today, parents, prophets, missionaries, and other leaders labor diligently to prepare a people for the Second Coming of the Savior. I have heard some teach that the Book of Mormon is a handbook to that end. That preparation will not be free from opposition. You, my young brothers and sisters, and you who teach them, have an obligation to participate fully in this wonderful and sometimes tumultuous time of preparation. We simply cannot afford to be anchored to anything less consequential than the saving rock of our Redeemer.<br><br>I place my love, my loyalty, and my devotion in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ. I bear witness that They live. They spoke to Joseph Smith in the Sacred Grove, and I testify that he is the Prophet of the Restoration and that Thomas S. Monson is God's spokesman today. He and the other 14 apostles are prophets, seers, and revelators. Ibear you my solemn witness that the Book of Mormon is the word of God. In the name ofJesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Jay E.

<h1> and Overcoming, Adversity</h1>
<br>
<br>
Whenever I visit my sister's family in Salt Lake City, as I am about to leave, my six-year-old niece usually chirps up with "Wait, Carol! We haven't written in my journal yet." Writing in her journal consists of the two of us going out to my car, where she uses a small notebook I keep in the glove compartment to draw pictures of different fairy tales such as Sleeping Beauty. She then spells out the names of the characters with my help. No matter what story she chooses, it inevitably consists of a princess and prince seeking to overcome difficult circumstances involving a wicked person and then eventually living happily ever after.<br><br>Over the last five years I have spent time working with the Young Women in my ward and in my stake. As I listen to them talk, many of them describe their worthy goals and their planned paths, which usually include getting an education, getting married, having children and grandchildren, and, hopefully, living happily ever after. They say it all with a smile. It's interesting that they never mention overcoming difficulties or facing a wicked person as part of their plans.<br><br>In 1840 Wilford Woodruff and other apostles traveled to England to share the message of the restored gospel. In the beautiful, green, rolling countryside of Herefordshire, Worcestershire, and Gloucestershire, Elder Woodruff experienced phenomenal success, and hundreds of people joined the Church. Fourteen-year-old Thomas Steed of Malvern converted to the Church during this time period. Shortly after his baptism, while at a gathering of Saints, Thomas experienced a wonderful spiritual manifestation, which he recorded later in life:<br><br><i>The house was filled with the Spirit and the power of God, and every one present was thrilled with the convincing power of the Holy Spirit and which I could feel through my whole system like fire shut up in my bones. It was then plainly made known unto me that God lives, that Jesus is the Redeemer and that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the Most High God. Of the truth of this a doubt has never crossed my mind from that day to this.</i> [<i>The Life of Thomas Steed from His Own Diary: 1826–1910,</i> Salt Lake Family History Library, film 1036342, item 2, 43pages, 6; http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/u?/FH25,79893]<br><br>A few years after that exhilarating experience, Thomas immigrated to America, arriving in Nauvoo on April 13, 1844. He recorded:<br><br><i>The Prophet Joseph Smith was at the pier. At first glance I could tell it was him, by his noble expression. He came on board to shake hands and welcome us by many encouraging words, and express his thankfulness that we had arrived in safety. As he could not stay with us, he sent Apostle Geo. A. Smith to preach on board. "What did you come here for?" asked he. "To be instructed in the ways of the Lord," answered someone.</i> [Apostle Smith said,] <i>"I tell you, you have come to the thrashing floor, and after you have been thrashed and pounded you will have to go through the fanning mill, where the chaff will be blown away and the wheat remain." (The troubles of Nauvoo were just coming upon them).</i> [<i>Life of Thomas Steed, </i>8–10]<br><br>Thrashed and pounded! Now, can you imagine a stunned Thomas and his fellow British converts possibly thinking, "Actually, no, this isn't what we had in mind." I'm sure they weren't contemplating a life full of trials upon arriving in Zion.<br><br>Yet overcoming difficulties is part of life's experience, as the Saints in Nauvoo discovered--and so will we. During my time working here at BYU, I have come to know of many students who have experienced difficulties in their lives. These trials range in degree of difficulty and include not getting into the school of one's choice, coping with eating disorders, loss of health (one of my students almost died last April), loss of loved ones, and experiencing abuse, to name a few. If trials haven't come into your life yet, rest assured that they will come to each of you at some point. As they say in the advertising business, "Watch this space!"<br><br>Now, I don't want you to think, "Oh, no--this is a doom-and-gloom talk." Adversity is part of the reality of life. Rather than push the topic under the carpet and hope it never affects us, I aim with my comments today to try and help you know how to deal with adversity when it does come into your life.<br><br>Why is there adversity in life? One reason adversity can come into our lives is sin. Another reason trials come is that they can help us develop. It is this latter reason that I wish to explore. Elder Richard G. Scott stated:<br><br><i>When those trials are not consequences of your disobedience, they are evidence that the Lord feels you are prepared to grow more. . . . He therefore gives you experiences that stimulate growth, understanding, and compassion which polish you for your everlasting benefit. To get you from where you are to where He wants you to be requires a lot of stretching, and that generally entails discomfort and pain.</i> ["Trust in the Lord," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1995, 16–17]<br><br>Our Father in Heaven wants us to <i>become</i> like Him, and in so doing He wants us to <i>overcome</i> the world and the influence of Satan. Difficulties in life allow us to find out how much we need the divine strength and love of our Father--not just during the difficulties, but always. As we reach out to God, we can find and experience His goodness and want to be like Him. Satan also wants us to be like him--evil and miserable--and so he seeks to overcome us and thwart God's plan.<br><br>Elder Henry B. Eyring said, "The great test of life is . . . not to endure storms, but to choose the right while they rage" ("Spiritual Preparedness: Start Early and Be Steady," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2005, 38). In the premortal life we shouted for joy at the opportunity to come to earth to take this test. Yet there have been times when I've been really struggling in the midst of a trial and I've thought, "In pre-earth life was I excited for this? What was I thinking?" And I've wondered if when all the joyful shouting took place I was actually in the spiritual restroom taking a break!<br><br>I'd like to place difficulties into two categories: short-term difficulties and long-term difficulties. I will define short-term difficulties as those that occur in a period of time that extends from minutes to a few months. For example, you lose an object and try to find it; your car breaks down and you need help; you don't get into the school you wish to enter and have to choose another.<br><br>As difficulties come into our lives, there are two ways to approach them. The first approach leads to allowing yourself to be influenced and overcome by Satan. This approach consists of not exhibiting any faith, ignoring spiritual promptings, and refusing to seek for divine help and instead relying on your own abilities. When difficulties come and they're not resolved quickly, you may just feel extremely irritated.<br><br>The second approach leads to overcoming the world and the influence of Satan through having faith in Christ. With this approach, you are obedient, you plead for help, and you exhibit faith. You may find that the trial is just a test of your faith and can be resolved relatively quickly. Many of you have probably experienced the situation where you have lost an object and after a prayer were able to find it. Or maybe you have had someone show up to help with a broken-down car. However, even though a difficulty is short-term, it can still be somewhat traumatic.<br><br>For example, 20 years ago I had just finished my mission in England. I had worked in the U.S. prior to going on a mission, and I felt impressed by the Spirit to return to the U.S. to continue working. An application for a green card had been submitted by my company in the United States 18 months earlier, and I began to wonder if it was ever going to come through. I prayed for help, tried hard to be obedient, and waited. One morning as I lay in bed at my parent's home in England, I heard the postman push the mail through the letter box in the front door of the house. The Spirit immediately confirmed to me that the letter stating the date of my interview at the U.S. embassy had arrived, and I felt that all was going to be well.<br><br>On the day of my interview, I traveled to London and sat in the embassy and waited for my interview. Suddenly I noticed an older man come out from a back room and go over to one of the interviewers. With a start I recognized him as an individual I had encountered several years before at the embassy when I was renewing a temporary work visa enabling me to work in the U.S. The temporary visa I had applied for at that time was totally legal, but this fellow seemed to be perturbed and told me that after looking at my passport he thought I looked like a visitor to my own country and that he never expected to see me again at the embassy. As it turned out, the visa I obtained from him was the wrong one, and I had to return to the embassy to get the correct one. Fortunately I didn't see him on that visit.<br><br>Now, several years later, here he was talking to an interviewer, and both of them kept glancing over at me with penetrating stares. I continued to read my book and pretended that I didn't notice their stares. However, inside me, my stomach was going into spasms, doing all sorts of gastrointestinal gymnastics, and I started to feel nauseated and light-headed as afeeling of panic swept over me.<br><br>I began to think I was doomed in my current endeavor to obtain a green card. I said a silent prayer, reminding Heavenly Father that I was only trying to follow spiritual promptings in going back to the U.S. and that I desperately needed His help. The older man returned to his office, and a short while later the interviewer called me over. Everything went smoothly as he told me not to worry about previous comments that had been made about my visas. My panic subsided, and as I walked out of the building, a feeling of elation came over me. I silently expressed my gratitude to my Heavenly Father, and immediately the thought came to my mind "You felt confirmation earlier from Me about the visa. Why did you doubt that I would come through for you?" I felt chagrined at my lack of faith in that difficult moment.<br><br>Sometimes a difficulty isn't resolved as quickly as we would like it to be, and the problem becomes a long-term problem, lasting for many months or years. Examples of chronic problems are illness; coping with the loss of a loved one; and experiencing the effects of sin in someone else's life, such as wayward parents, wayward children, or a spouse with an addiction to pornography. In such situations, let's first consider responses to the difficulty that can lead us down the path to rebellion and that could ultimately lead us to being overcome by Satan. The purpose of doing this is so you'll know what behaviors to avoid.<br><h2><b>The First Approach</b></h2><br>The first approach--the one that leads to rebellion and being overcome--consists of the following steps:<br><br><i>Step 1. Your Plan Is Thwarted; You Become Baffled and Questioning</i><br><br>Things are not going according to the plan you had for your life. You're baffled, and so you question. You don't understand why things are going wrong. You ask questions such as "Why is God allowing this to happen to me if I don't deserve this?" or "This is a righteous desire; why doesn't He help me?" You don't ask the Lord to help you understand the situation.<br><br>Laman and Lemuel are prime examples ofpeople who took this approach by not asking for understanding. When they could not comprehend some of their father's teachings, Nephi asked them if they had inquired of the Lord. They responded, "We have not; for the Lord maketh no such thing known unto us" (1 Nephi 15:9; see also verse 8). You can become bogged down in the fact that the Lord hasn't granted your desire. When you use this approach, you find that your own reasoning leads you nowhere.<br><br><i>Step 2. Faith Doesn't Bring the Desired Results; You Become Hurt and Doubtful</i><br><br>You have exhibited faith, but as time has passed, it hasn't brought the results you desired. You feel let down and hurt, and you start to doubt your Father in Heaven. You may think to yourself, "God doesn't love me or care about me." You know He could remove the problem, as He is omnipotent, so you may wonder why He doesn't.<br><br><i>Step 3. You Set Conditions</i><br><br>You still want your desires to be fulfilled, and since you think <i>you</i> know best, you decide to set certain conditions. Maybe you set the condition that you're not going to give your full effort in your Church calling unless Heavenly Father helps you get a job you've been seeking. Or you mistakenly think that if you have enough faith, you can set a time frame for the Lord to come through for you. For example, you might think, "I'm going to exhibit faith--I want to meet my spouse by the end of this year. But if it doesn't happen, Iwon't have faith anymore." Elder Scott advised us:<br><br><i>Our Father in Heaven has invited you to express your needs, hopes, and desires unto Him. That should not be done in a spirit of negotiation, but rather as a willingness to obey His will no matter what direction that takes. His invitation, "Ask, and ye shall receive" (3 Ne. 27:29) does not assure that you will get what you</i> want. <i>It does guarantee that, if worthy, you will get what you</i> need, <i>as judged by a Father that loves you perfectly, who wants your eternal happiness even more than do you.</i> ["Trust in the Lord," 17; emphasis in original]<br><br><i>Step 4. Your Desire Is Not Met; You Become Angry, Bitter, and Rebellious</i><br><br>Your desire is still not met, and so you become angry or bitter, which can lead to rebellion. When you rebel, the Spirit leaves you. Satan whispers to you, and you may have thoughts such as: "I was right--God doesn't care about me; Church members are all hypocrites; the leaders aren't right; the Church isn't true; there is no God." You listen to these whisperings and allow Satan to overcome you, and you become miserable like him.<br><h2><b>The Second Approach</b></h2><br>In contrast to this first approach in dealing with long-term difficulties is the second approach in which you continually seek to be obedient to the commandments, plead for divine help, and have faith in the Lord. This approach leads us to become like God and overcome the world and the effects of Satan through faith in the Savior.<br><br>The second approach--the one that leads to becoming and overcoming--consists of the following steps:<br><br><i>Step 1. Your Plan Is Thwarted; You Trust God and Ask Different Questions</i><br><br>Things are not going according to your plan. You don't understand why things are going wrong. You know Heavenly Father could solve the problem, as He is omnipotent. Yet you know that you don't know the meaning of all things, so, remembering times when He has come through for you in the past, you decide to absolutely trust God. You trust that He knows what He is doing with you and that it will be for your good, even though you haven't the faintest idea of how He is going to do it. Instead of asking "why" questions, you ask questions such as "What should I do?" or "What do you want me to learn from this?"<br><br>Try to find out what the Lord's will is. Obviously He wants you to be obedient to His commandments, but what else does He have in mind for you? Tell Him what your desires are, but be prepared to do His will. Sometimes your desire is not in line with His will. Remember that in Gethsemane, the Savior petitioned His Father several times for His own will, that the cup would pass from Him, while at the same time being willing to submit to His Father's will, which He ultimately did (see Matthew 26:39).<br><br>Sometimes God is taking us down a different path than we expected, and righteous desires may not be met on our time schedule. Elder Scott said:<br><br><i>As you trust Him, exercise faith in Him, He will help you. That support will generally come step by step, a portion at a time. While you are passing through each phase, the pain and difficulty that comes from being enlarged will continue. If all matters were immediately resolved at your first petition, you could not grow.</i> ["Trust in the Lord," 17]<br><br>Even when we feel a prompting to do something, God may have an entirely different goal in mind than what we think will be the case as we start to follow the prompting. For example, in 1830 Oliver Cowdery, Parley P. Pratt, Ziba Peterson, and Peter Whitmer were called to serve a mission to the Lamanites. On the way out to the Missouri frontier to preach to the Lamanites, they stopped in Kirtland, Ohio, and gave a Book of Mormon to Parley's friend Sidney Rigdon, a Reformed Baptist minister. Prior to joining the Church, Parley had also been a member of the Reformed Baptist Church in the Kirtland area. After reading the Book of Mormon for two weeks, Sidney was converted, and through him manywho attended his several congregations eventually accepted the restored gospel. The missionaries served the mission but didn't bring many Lamanites into the Church. Yet the mission <i>was</i> a success in terms of converts--just in a different way than what they had originally expected. So you need to pay attention to promptings and circumstances as they unfold in your life. Heavenly Father will use these to unfold His will to you. Prepare yourself for bends in the road and lots of surprises!<br><br><i>Step 2. Faith Doesn't Bring Desired Results; You Ask for Strength</i><br><br>When your faith doesn't bring the results you desire and you struggle with the trial, you need to ask for strength. Through the Holy Ghost, God will strengthen you, show you that He loves you, comfort you, and bring peace to your heart.<br><br>I came to the United States from York, England, when I was 25 years old. After completing graduate work, I returned to England to look for a university teaching job and to be near my family. However, after initially rejecting a job offer in Utah because it wasn't part of my plan, I felt strongly prompted to take the job and did so.<br><br>After being in the U.S. for some time, I remember feeling homesick one day and wondering where Heavenly Father was taking me. I went to the Jordan River Temple and was waiting outside the dressing room for a friend to join me. As I sat there, feelings of homesickness swept over me, and I remember thinking how much I missed my home and family. I turned to look at the photograph on the wall behind my chair. It was of the Jordan River Temple. Immediately a thought came clearly into my mind: "You are home." A sweet, loving peace swept over me as I turned to look at the painting on the wall to my left. It showed Jesus appearing to a kneeling Mary outside the Garden Tomb, and as I gazed at it, another thought came clearly to my mind: "And I am here." I suddenly felt totally at home, loved, and comforted.<br><br><i>Step 3. You Are Not Consumed with the Trial; You Focus on the Good Things in Your Life</i><br><br>Don't be consumed with the trial. This can be hard to do. Try to focus on the good things in your life, not on what you don't have. Choose to be happy in spite of the difficulty you are dealing with. Don't wait for circumstances to make you happy. Sometimes you may think, "When I get married, then I'll be happy. When I get a certain job, then I'll be happy. When this trial is over, then I'll be happy." Look for small miracles as the Lord reaches out in kindness to touch your life. Isaiah confirms that the Lord's kindness shall not depart from us, nor will He remove His covenant of peace (see Isaiah 54:10).<br><br>Life can be sweet and peaceful in the midst of difficulty. Donna Turley, a Church member who suffered chronic illness, wrote this shortly before her death:<br><br><i>When I am gone, most of all I hope you will know that life was not too hard, too pained, too discouraging--that it never once seemed overwhelming to me. Please don't spend much time upon my illnesses, my difficulties, the disappointments, and the pain. Don't ever let that overshadow and obscure the splendor and the glory of life as it was always felt and known by me. . . . Please don't miss seeing and feeling the happiness and the beauty with which life as I have known it has been filled.</i> [Letter to family and friends, November 1984]<br><br><i>Step 4. You Consecrate Your Life to God; You Draw Closer to Him</i><br><br>Fully consecrate your life to Heavenly Father and draw ever closer to Him and His Son. Have an attitude that you will serve Him in spite of the pain you are going through and the lack of true understanding you have of where He is taking you. Continue to feast on the word of God and have faith. Be willing to spend time with God; desire it with all of your heart. Make the time to pray fervently while being willing to submit to His will, serve Him by serving others, spend time in meaningful meditation, and attend the temple with a worshipful attitude. I bear you my witness that as you do this, the veil will become thin, and you will feel a wonderful closeness to your Father. Like the bee that gathers precious, life-sustaining nectar and pollen, we come to the Light to be spiritually fed and leave feeling a sweet peace in our own lives and a sure knowledge that one day, in the Lord's time, all will bewell.<br><br>I have taken a poem by the poet Eunice Tietjens and modified it, but I give her the credit for much of the poem. This best describes my own feelings that have come as a result of spending sacred time with my Father in Heaven.<br><i>But I will descend from this elevated state, this seeping sweet peace, this consuming love.</i><i>And time will close about me, and my soul stir to the rhythm of the daily round.</i><i>Yet, having known, life will not press so close, and always I shall feel time ravel thin about me;</i><i>For I have felt</i><i>The still, pure, white presence of divinity.</i><br><br>[Adapted from Eunice Tietjens, "The Most-Sacred Mountain," <i>Profiles from China</i> (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1922), 38–39]<br><br>When you consecrate your life to the Lord's service and draw ever closer to Him and His Father, you will move along the path, as Elder Bruce C. Hafen said in his devotional address last year, from being a servant of the Lord to becoming His friend. Ultimately, as you become like Him, you will become His son or daughter and a joint heir with Him (see "A Disciple's Journey," BYU devotional, 5February 2008).<br><br>This past Christmas I made star-shaped shortbread cookies for my neighbors. In order to roll out the dough, I had to hold it in my hands so that the butter softened and the dough became malleable. As we have faith in Christ and let Him hold us in His hands in submission to the Father's will, He will mold us, roll us out, and cook us through adversity in our lives until we reach the point where, through faith in Him, He is able to make of us bright, glowing stars. Shining individuals who are sensitive to others who are struggling--sensitive because of the pain they've felt, which helps them know better how to succor others--mirror in a very small way the way Christ succors us. Ultimately, through this process, we can become one with Him and with our Father. So we <i>become</i> like Him and then <i>overcome</i> the world through faith in our Savior.<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell confirmed this process. He said:<br><br><i>Attributively, we are to become even as Jesus, with His virtues being increasingly replicated in our lives. Even in the midst of our obvious imperfections, a sacred process is to be underway--if slowly, nevertheless resolutely. Whatever one's unfolding agendum, he can be</i> overcoming <i>if he is </i>becoming<i> more like Christ!</i> ["Overcome . . . Even As I Also Overcame," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1987, 72; emphasis in original]<br><br>The wonderful promise is, "To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne" (Revelations 3:21).<br><br>Heavenly Father is preparing us to be gods. We don't understand what this really means, but He does. He knows the necessary process to help us achieve this end.<br><br>Trust in our Father and His Son as you seek to become like Them. Choose to live a happy life in spite of the trials of life. With God's help you can overcome them and Satan and find peace and happiness in this life. Then, one day, if we have been faithful, we will have the happiness that is far beyond any fairy-tale ending as we experience the reality of eternal life with our Father and His Son. I know this to be true, for His Spirit has borne witness of this to me. I am grateful for the gospel and the great plan of happiness. I am grateful for the abundant love I feel from my Father and His Son. May each of us endure well and grow from the various situations we are called upon to face in this life. And may we each reach out in kindness to succor others in their trials and help them along the way, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Carol Wilkinson was a BYU professor of exercise sciences when this devotional address was given on 17 March 2009.</i><br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>ed Gift of Agency, Choice and Decisions</h1>
<br>
<br>
One of the key issues in the Council in Heaven--and one of the key differences between our Heavenly Father's plan for us and the plan advocated by Lucifer--was whether or not we would be given agency, or the ability to make our own choices. Lucifer argued that he could return us all to our Father without any need for agency on our part. Lucifer said:<br><br><i>Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and Iwill redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not belost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor.</i><br><br>But our Elder Brother said:<br><br><i>Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, because that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him, and also, that I should give unto him mine own power; by the power of mine Only Begotten, I caused that he should be cast down.</i> [Moses 4:1–3]<br><br>In the Father's plan, championed by Jesus Christ, agency was integral. In fact, Lucifer's plan could not have worked. Learning to exercise agency is the very essence of learning to be like our Father in Heaven.<br><br>I am a scientist, and for me (and I hope for you) it is fun to think about what science can teach us about the gospel in general and about agency in particular. For me, science is highly faith affirming, but I recognize that for some people it is not. I'll come back to that later.<br><br>I like to look at a picture taken with the Hubble Space Telescope. The image is called the Hubble Deep Field. The telescope was pointed at a certain patch of sky that looked empty and was allowed to collect light for a long time. Looking at the image, one can see that space is not empty. Almost all the objects in the picture are galaxies, each consisting of billions of stars. Some are among the most distant objects ever imaged. I'm reminded of Psalm 8, where we read:<br><br><i>When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;</i><br><br><i>What is man, that thou art mindful of him?</i> [Psalm 8:3–4]<br><br>Many in science have noted what is sometimes referred to as the Goldilocks principle: allthe fundamental forces that govern matter in the universe seem to be--like the little bear's porridge in the Goldilocks story--"just right" to allow stars, planets, life, and people to exist. If, for example, the force of gravity were only slightly weaker than it is, modern physics suggests that stars could not form because gravity would not be strong enough to hold them together; if there were no stars, there could be no planets and no people. On the other hand, if gravity were slightly stronger than it is, all matter would quickly end up in black holes; again, these are conditions that do not allow the existence of stars, planets, or you or me.<br><br>Some have argued that this "just rightness" of the universe proves the existence of a Creator. Others argue that the fact we exist just means that we must live in a universe that allows it. Fundamentally, we can't tell which position is right simply through reason. Furthermore, it is important to our sacred gift of agency that this be the case.<br><br>However, I'd like to take this idea of "just rightness" one step further. Not only do we live in a universe with conditions just right for us to exist, but we also live in a universe that is just right in terms of allowing us agency, the ability to make choices that have consequences.<br><br>From the time of Isaac Newton until the early 20th century, it was believed that the universe was completely deterministic, that if you knew the starting conditions and all the rules, everything in the universe--from galaxies and stars down to atoms and electrons--would have to play by those rules, and you could mathematically determine everything that would happen in the future. In such a universe, two plus two would always equal four, and every decision would likewise be predictable by an equation. There would be no agency because all actions and all results would depend ultimately on how things were set up in the beginning. Every action would be a consequence of the way things were created, and there could be no free will.<br><br>However, by the early 20th century, this view began to change. A fundamental concept of modern physics and chemistry is known as the uncertainty principle. This is a scientific statement that claims there are limits to how accurately we can measure such things as the position and speed of an electron. We don't have time to talk about the reasoning behind the uncertainty principle, but it is well established and accepted, and it is one of the key ideas that helps us understand scientifically the way the universe functions. Quantum uncertainty explains why atoms behave the way they do. It's important in chemical bonding. Uncertainty is a key part of how practical devices like transistors and lasers work. According to the uncertainty principle, there is a built-in uncertainty in the way small things like electrons and atoms behave. We can say what we think they will probably do, but we can't predict individual events with certainty.<br><br>I find it fascinating that the biochemistry of thought and decision making, of signal transmission in neurons, occurs at the level of electrons and atoms, where quantum uncertainty operates and behavior is not deterministic. At this level we can't always predict exactly what will happen. Therefore this basic idea of quantum mechanics suggests that our thoughts and decisions are not deterministic.<br><br>At the same time, uncertainty only becomes important for very small particles like electrons and atoms. For larger things, we can make accurate predictions. This is important too--otherwise, all would be chaos. Instead, after we make choices, consequences inevitably follow. Therefore, we live in a universe that is predictable enough that our actions have consequences but not so predictable that it is deterministic.<br><br>It is as if the Lord designed the very fabric of the universe in such a way as to guarantee us the opportunity of agency while still demanding consequences to the way we use our agency. Thus not only do we live in a universe that is "just right" to allow human existence, it is also "just right" to give us the sacred gift of agency.<br><br>None of this is surprising when viewed in the light of the gospel. In fact, we know a lot more about agency from the scriptures than we know from science. Agency is a key part of the plan of salvation, and learning to use it is one of the main purposes of mortality. Consider how precious the gift of agency is in the eyes of God:<br><ul><br> 	<li>He gave us a universe whose very fabric allows it.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>We pass through the veil and come into this life without memory of the premortal existence so that we can have it.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>We live now by faith so that we can have it.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>We face adversity and opposition so that we can have it.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>God's Son, our Elder Brother, Jesus Christ, suffered and died so that we can have it.</li><br></ul><br>Agency is a sacred gift.<br><br>As much as I love science as a means for discovering truth, my life's experience suggests that it will never be possible to arrive at full spiritual knowledge by purely scientific methods. I know this because if such a course were possible, it would destroy our agency, and the Lord does not work that way. Agency is sacred. If we could prove the gospel true and always know how to act purely through reason or logic or science, only choices in accord with the gospel would be reasonable or acceptable. Correct choices would become obvious with minimal effort on our part. That was essentially the plan all of us rejected in the premortal existence. Although sometimes our choices have consequences that limit our future choices, our Father in Heaven never compromises our agency.<br><br>The practical question for us, then, is "How do we learn to use the precious gift of agency given to us by our Heavenly Father?" This question is critically important for all of us every day; it is what life is about. Let me suggest four things to keep in mind as you use your agency:<br><br>1. Choose in the light of the gospel.<br><br>2. Remember that help is always available ifyou will stay in tune.<br><br>3. Little choices matter because they add up to make big ones.<br><br>4. Know that ultimately the choice is yours.<br><br>Let's talk about choosing in the light of the gospel. I love the words of Mormon, recorded by his son, Moroni, in Moroni 7:<br><br><i>For behold, my brethren, it is given unto you to judge, that ye may know good from evil; and the way to judge is as plain, that ye may know with a perfect knowledge, as the daylight is from the dark night.</i><br><br><i>For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God.</i><br><br><i>But whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do evil, and believe not in Christ, and deny him, and serve not God, then ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of the devil. ...</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, I beseech of you, brethren, that ye should search diligently in the light of Christ that ye may know good from evil; and if ye will lay hold upon every good thing, and condemn it not, ye certainly will be a child of Christ.</i> [Moroni 7:15–17, 19]<br><br>According to Mormon, our choices are clear. However, our agency is not compromised. We still have to learn and understand the ways of Christ, and we have to choose whether or not to follow Him. If we will consider the consequences of our choices and whether they lead us toward the Savior or away from Him, we will use our agency well.<br><br>Second, because He loves us, the Lord does not leave us without help in using our agency, but He does it in such a way that our agency is always preserved. As a consequence of our choice to make sacred baptismal covenants, we've been given another sacred gift to assist us--the gift of the Holy Ghost. At the time we make covenants to live the gospel, the Lord gives us exactly the help we need to keep those covenants as we exercise our agency.<br><br>It is crucial that we live so that this gift can operate and bless our lives and help us choose correctly. The Holy Ghost has been compared to a "still small voice" (1 Nephi 17:45). Thus we must be careful not to let the frenzied, loud voices of the world drown out the promptings of the Spirit. The Spirit is like a faraway radio station that can be heard clearly when the radio is in tune; the still small voice can easily be drowned out by noise if our lives are not in tune. Sins of commission are a sure way to let this happen. They can cause so much noise that it may damage the receiver and require repairs only the Savior can make. Sins of omission are perhaps just as bad. They seem smaller and more innocent, so it is easier for them to sneak up on us. They are just little things, aren't they? Those little things we can be prone to neglect--like reading the scriptures and offering up daily, sincere prayers--are what keep our hearts in tune so that the signal of the Spirit remains strong. That's why the little things are so important.<br><br>Do you remember the story of the rich young ruler? His sad story shows that it is possible to make mostly right choices while still letting little things get in the way. Matthew, Mark, and Luke all recorded what happened. I'll quote from Mark.<br><br>We read that a certain rich young ruler came to the Savior and asked what he could do to inherit eternal life.<br><br>The Savior told him to keep the commandments.<br><br>When the young man affirmed that he had done so from his youth up, the Lord told him there was one little thing he lacked:<br><br><i>Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me</i><br><br><i>And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.</i> [Mark 10:21–22]<br><br>His love of wealth held him back. He was not able to give up the things of the world, and so he did not choose well. Perhaps he could have been a Peter or a James or a John; we don't know.<br><br>Do we have cares of the world that prevent us from exercising our sacred gift of agency righteously? They might even be simple things like being too busy to stop and care for those we home teach or visit teach. The Lord wants to bless us, and He will, if we allow Him to do so. Sometimes it is little things that matter.<br><br>Finally, remember that no one can exercise your agency for you. The Lord certainly will not. Doing that would not allow us to accomplish what we are here to do. Doing that wouldn't teach us the things we must learn. As Oliver Cowdery learned when attempting to translate, we need to make the best decision we can before we ask the Lord if it is right:<br><br><i>But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</i><br><br><i>But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of thought that shall cause you to forget the thing which is wrong.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 9:8–9]<br><br>When we do ask, I believe the most common answer for one who is living the gospel and is already tuned to the Spirit will likely be "You decide." The Lord does not tell us this because He does not care or does not want to help. He does not tell us precisely because He does care and He does love us. It blesses us to learn to use our agency on our own. That is why we are here.<br><br>A number of important opportunities to use our agency usually occur for many people around the college years. For instance, many have the following questions:<br><ul><br> 	<li>What major should I choose?</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>What career should I pursue?</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Should I serve a mission?</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Whom should I date?</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Whom should I marry?</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>When should we begin a family?</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>What do I believe?</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>How will I act on my beliefs?</li><br></ul><br>I'll touch on just a few of these.<br><br>How do you choose a major and a career? Some of you are having trouble with this and have changed your minds a few times. That's okay. Please indulge me as I tell you how I made that choice. I grew up with a love for science. I guess I was a nerd (but I didn't know it until later when my wife told me). However, I didn't have much exposure to chemistry until one summer during high school when I participated in a chemistry program at that excellent university to the north. I found that chemistry was fun and that I had some aptitude for it; so I decided to major in it. I got to BYU and promptly bombed my first chemistry exam. I feared I had made a bad choice, but, fortunately, my professor had mercy on the class and made it possible to overcome that stumble. After that I made the adjustment to college and did okay.<br><br>On my mission I discovered that I also loved teaching. I found great joy in seeing the lights come on in someone else's eyes. I returned home and wondered if I might be able to combine these things and become a chemistry professor. My resolve became stronger as I observed the examples of my professors and saw a little of their family lives through some good friends whose parents worked at the university. What I saw was compatible with my goals of having a family and of being able to serve others, and my choice was confirmed as Iwent forward.<br><br>One of the great experiences of my life came as I was beginning my independent career as a faculty member at the University of Texas at Arlington. Paul had a great experience on the road to Damascus, and I had my own on the road to Dallas. No, I did not see the Savior as Paul did, but I did experience His love, and I got to see how many little, seemingly less-important choices added up to bless me.<br><br>I was trying hard to raise a family and to serve faithfully in the Church. It is challenging to do this as a young assistant professor. I had taken the job planning to pursue a certain course of research that appeared to have good opportunities for funding. I set up my lab and needed a test problem to check whether or not my instruments were working. I wasn't quite ready to do what I had originally planned, and I remembered some work I had done years before as an undergraduate at BYU. This gave me an idea for a new experiment. It wasn't a big deal, but I tried it, and it worked.<br><br>I wanted to attend a scientific meeting I thought would further my career. I needed something to present at the conference because the university required me to present in order to fund the trip, so I took the results of my test experiment and drove 700 miles from Dallas to Nashville to attend the meeting. It was just a poster presentation, one among hundreds, but I was shocked at the strong positive response Ireceived.<br><br>I had to drive the 700 miles home by myself, and that was when the revelation began. All the way home it was as if I heard a voice saying over and over, "Drop your original plans and pursue this other course of research." I did, and that choice laid the foundation for my entire subsequent career. In part, that is why I am here at BYU today. It may not have won a Nobel Prize, but the choice was a good one. It came after much thought and hard work and led to much more thought and hard work. I still don't know if the Lord cares about the science I did. I doubt it matters at all to Him, but I do know for sure that He loves me and my family, and that matters a lot. It has blessed my life.<br><br>Some of you face the choice of whom to marry. Quoting Elder Bruce R. McConkie, President Thomas S. Monson recently said, "The most important single thing that any Latter-day Saint ever does in this world is to marry the right person, in the right place, by the right authority" (Bruce R. McConkie, "Agency or Inspiration?" <i>New Era,</i> January 1975, 38; quoted in Thomas S. Monson, "Whom Shall I Marry?" <i>New Era,</i> October 2004, 6).<br><br>I think that if this is not the most important decision we will make in our entire eternal existence, it certainly must be in the top 10.<br><br>I came home from my mission with a desire to make that choice. I dated, and I learned a lot from some wonderful people, but things never quite seemed to click. Horror of horrors, I graduated from BYU single. I wondered if there was something wrong with me, but the only thing that was really wrong was that the time was not right. I needed to be in the same place as the other who would choose me. I needed to develop talents that would be attractive to her. I had to learn to distinguish between my own feelings and the confirming voice of the Spirit. But when the time was right, the choices were made, and calm, peaceful confirmation then followed. I made the best choice ever, and that has been a foundation for the greatest blessings in my life ever since.<br><br>Let me give one final example. One of the most important choices we make is actually the same choice we already made following the Council in Heaven--a choice to believe the Father and to follow Christ. Because we have passed through the veil, which was essential in obtaining our agency in mortality, we don't remember our earlier choice, and now in faith we must continue to choose.<br><br>Well-meaning people may honestly disagree with my interpretation of how the universe is put together. Agency allows and requires this possibility. But for me, as I noted above, science is faith affirming because I choose to believe, and everything else follows.<br><br>At some point in our lives, in one way or another we all face the choice to believe. It may come in little things we choose to do every day, it may come in big life decisions, like the decision to be baptized, but often it comes in combinations of these.<br><br>I was raised in the gospel, and in my early years I owed most of my testimony to the example of my parents. For me, the critical point in the choice to believe came the year after I returned to BYU from my mission. I had a wonderful experience as a missionary and had the opportunity to teach the plan of salvation and about the Resurrection. I taught of priesthood power and blessings and did so in sincerity and faith.<br><br>However, all of this took on new meaning in the year after I came home, when the person I was closest to in all the world, my father, was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Suddenly the doctrine of the gospel became more than theory, and I had to decide what I really believed. Was there really power in priesthood blessings, even if after receiving one my Dad did not get better? Would I ever really see him again? Do the covenants we make and the blessings we are promised in the temple with regard to eternal families have meaning? I had to make that choice to believe and to go forward in faith.<br><br>I testify that my own life has been richly blessed because I chose then to believe and to try to live in accord with that belief and because I have continued to make that choice. "And," in the simple words of the poet Robert Frost, "that has made all the difference" ("The Road Not Taken" [1916]). Quantum uncertainty may turn out to be as incomplete a view of the universe as the Newtonian determinism that came before it, but it does not matter to me--I have chosen to believe, and that choice has been confirmed by the Spirit many times over. It has made all the difference.<br><br>If you struggle with the choice to believe, take comfort in the fact that all you need to begin is a desire, as Alma taught the Zoramite poor:<br><br><i>But behold, if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment</i> [and I love that word <i>experiment</i>] <i>upon my words, and exercise a particle of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you, even until ye believe in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of my words.</i> [Alma 32:27]<br><br>Let that desire work in you. Experience the joy that will come as you choose good and your agency takes you upward. May the Lord bless us all as we use the sacred gift of agency wisely. I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>David V.

<h1>mbark Upon This New Era - Dieter F. Uchtdorf - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
President Samuelson, honored guests, parents, family members, graduates, my dear brothers and sisters--Sister Uchtdorf and I extend our congratulations, commendation, and deep love to all of you whom we honor on this happy day. Even nature seems to be honoring you with the beauties of springtime as we mark the culmination of many years of hard work and study.<br><br>It is a great privilege for us to be with you today. And we are pleased to be with Elder and Sister Nelson, who are wonderful friends and true servants of the Lord.<br><br>I love this university. During my years as an airline captain, I would sometimes cross this beautiful part of Utah on flights from Frankfurt, Germany, to Los Angeles. When I did, I would often announce to the passengers that if they looked out their windows they would have the privilege of seeing the world-famous Brigham Young University below. Some captains might reserve such an announcement for sites like the Grand Canyon or the Eiffel Tower, but to me Brigham Young University has always had aspecial place in my heart.<br><br>My wife and I did not have the privilege of attending BYU as students. However, our daughter received her bachelor's and master's degrees here--and, by the way, she graduated summa cum laude. I assume that there are enough proud parents here today who can easily recognize one of their own. Let me share with you briefly why the memory of our daughter's BYU experience is so tender to us.<br><br>Only a few months before receiving her degree, our daughter gave birth to twin boys who arrived six weeks early. Talk about student efficiency! When we observed how she and her husband found time to raise these two little babies while at the same time finishing their schooling, we were convinced that there is a special spirit at BYU. In this atmosphere not only does knowledge grow and multiply, so does the population!<br><br>My wife and I came all the way from Germany to attend our daughter's commencement exercises. We sat way up there in the high bleachers with the two little babies in a double stroller, watching the students receive their diplomas. Little did we know that 19 years later we would be here once again, attending another commencement--this time with slightly better seats--representing the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br><br>By the way, our handsome twin grandsons, who were born at Utah Valley Regional Medical Center, are now six feet tall and serving missions for the Lord in Asia. Isn't it wonderful how life brings change, challenges, and blessings into our lives?<br><br>Today is a significant day of change for all ofyou. It is a day of closing and opening doors. It is a day of gratitude and rejoicing, a day of acknowledgment of our many debts to God, family, and friends. It is a day of radiant horizons and great expectations, and perhaps a day of a few fears as well.<br><br>My wife, Harriet, and I are honored to share this moment with you.<br><br>On a personal note, I am both humbled and grateful to receive this honorary degree. I thank you all for this. It will link my family even closer to this wonderful institution.<br><br>Happily, the honor I receive today comes without the necessity of taking final exams or, even worse, facing a panel of skeptical professors bent on uncovering vacuums of academic ignorance. So for that I am truly grateful. Nevertheless, I assure you that my family will treasure this honor as we treasure the memories of this beautiful day.<br><br>May I add that Harriet, who is with me here today, is the love of my life, and she actually deserves the highest honor within any authority to grant for being my wife and the sunshine of my life for 46 years.<br><br>When I asked our children what I should talk about at a commencement service, they quickly responded, "Keep it short, and don't worry about the topic. Everyone will be thinking about other things anyway."<br><br>That is excellent advice. However, there are three things I would like to leave with you--three things that may help you as you embark upon this new era of your lives. First, use time wisely. Second, continue to learn. Third, seek the Spirit always.<br><h2><b>First: Use Time Wisely</b></h2><br>A wise man once distinguished between "the noble art of getting things done" and "anobler art of leaving things undone." True "wisdom in life," he taught, consists of "the elimination of non-essentials" (Lin Yutang, <i>The Importance of Living</i> [New York: Reynal and Hitchcock, 1937], 162, 10). May I suggest that you periodically evaluate how you are doing in this area? What are the nonessential things that clutter your days and steal your time? What are the habits you may have developed that do not serve a useful purpose? What are the unfinished or unstarted things that could add vigor, meaning, and joy to your life?<br><br>Sometimes we make the mistake of neglecting the essentials of life. The Savior had harsh words for the scribes and Pharisees of His day: "Woe unto you," He told them, "for [you] have omitted the weightier matters of the law, [justice], mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done" (Matthew 23:23).<br><br>Although the Savior's words were directed to a specific audience thousands of years ago, they apply to us as well today.<br><br>In modern revelation, the Lord has commanded, "Thou shalt not idle away thy time, neither shalt thou bury thy talent that it may not be known" (D&amp;amp;C 60:13). It is quite common to hear people and friends of ours say, "Where has the time gone?" or "If I only had more time."<br><br>In reality, time is perhaps the only commodity of life that is divided equally among every person in the world. Think about it--we all have 24 hours in a day. Though some people have more demands on their time than others, we all have an equal opportunity to use those 24 hours wisely.<br><br>I learned how remarkably fair time is while performing long-range flights around the world. For example, we departed Frankfurt at 10:00 a.m. local time and, after an 11-hour flight in a B747, arrived in San Francisco at 12:00 noon California time, apparently only two hours later. That was wonderful--we had gained nine hours! Of course, you all know, on the next day, on our way back to Frankfurt, we lost the nine hours again.<br><br>Someone has said, "Time cannot be expanded, accumulated, mortgaged, hastened, or retarded" (anonymous, in John Cook, comp., <i>The Book of Positive Quotations,</i> 2nd ed. [Minneapolis, Minnesota: 2007], 274).<br><br>And it is ever renewing. Even though we may have wasted time yesterday, there is hope. There is a full day waiting for us today and tomorrow. However, if we continue to take our allotted time for granted, we may findourselves like Elder Neal A. Maxwell put it: "Either we use time wisely or it uses us; either we manage tasks effectively, or we are pushed about and prodded by them" (<i>The Smallest Part</i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1973], 46).<br><br>So how can we use our time wisely? In a world of so many things to do, how can we be sure that we are doing the best things? Elder Maxwell continued: "Since our impact must be selective [we must] do some goal-setting in terms of the outcomes we wish to achieve. Such goal-setting needn't be a hassling, hustling experience but rather a calm, periodic reasoned assessment of what we cherish enough to choose to do with our time" (<i>The Smallest Part,</i> 46).<br><br>In qualifying for the degrees from this wonderful and grand institution today, you have shown the ability to determine what is most important, to set goals to achieve it, and to then use your time to accomplish these goals. I urge you to continue to set and work toward temporal and spiritual goals. These may include goals to give of your talents, of your time, and of your means to the weightier matters in life. Such goals will guide your decisions about how best to use your time.<br><h2><b>Second: Continue to Learn</b></h2><br>It has been said that a university "is a place where those who hate ignorance may strive to know, where those who perceive truth may strive to make others see" (John Masefield, remarks on receiving an honorary degree from England's University of Sheffield in 1946, excerpts in "Beautiful Places," Education, <i>Time,</i>17February 1947, 80).<br><br>What an eloquent reminder of your BYU motto: "Enter to learn; go forth to serve."<br><br>Isn't this also a description of life itself? Isn't this what the great plan of happiness, the plan of salvation, is all about? Isn't this the purpose of our existence? My dear young friends, never stop learning. Never stop learning and never stop using what you learn to serve God and your fellowmen.<br><br>I encourage you to continue to pursue as much schooling as possible. In the competitive world of today, there is certainly a need to become an expert in your field of knowledge. However, there is also a great need to broaden and extend your horizons of learning and of interest.<br><br>Walk through life with open eyes and ears. The prophet Mormon as a child was described as one who was "quick to observe." He was told to remember the things that he had learned by observing the things around him (see Mormon 1:2–3).<br><br>Just think about it--even during the very difficult and challenging times in Kirtland, the Lord gave the Saints a charge to educate themselves:<br><br><i>My grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in . . . all things that . . . are expedient for you to understand;</i><br><br><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, . . .</i><br><br><i>That ye may be prepared in all things.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 88:78–80]<br><br>Expand and broaden your knowledge. My young friends, this is also your charge and your mission--for today and for the rest of your lives.<br><br>In my life I have learned that we can trust in God and in His promises. My family's circumstances during and after World War II made it almost impossible to get any advanced formal schooling. Most of my schooling had to be done after a full day's work. Looking back, Ican say the blessings of Church membership, the gospel, the unceasing desire to learn, and the willingness to work hard provided great opportunities even in most difficult times.<br><br>You and I cannot know everything. There is, however, One who does know it all, who understands all, who created all and everything--He is the Father of our spirits, our Father in Heaven. Because He is our Father, He has an intense interest in our education. He knows what we need to learn to fulfill our mission in life. Let us always be His students. Let us always open His textbooks. Let us sit at His feet and learn from Him. He knows every language and culture on this earth, and He will teach us in a way that we can understand. Let us always seek further light and knowledge from Him, theonly real source of truth and light.<br><h2><b>Third: Seek the Spirit Always</b></h2><br>In piloting an airplane, you learn quickly that your flight path depends greatly on how you handle challenging external influences such as wind and weather. Even more important, however, are the decisions you make in response to those external influences. Your decisions, in fact, can counteract the external influences to ensure that you stay on course and reach your desired eternal, divine destination. In order to make those decisions correctly, it helps to know what your actual position is. Therefore, it is of vital importance to have a true and valid reference point like the polar star in the Northern Hemisphere or a reliable electronic platform wherever you are.<br><br>As you know, there are plenty of winds and storms in the world today that attempt to blow you off course. In order to continue the course you have begun here at Brigham Young University, you need a spiritual polar star in your life. You need a point of reference that has eternal consistency and reliability.<br><br>Today I bear witness to you, individually and collectively, that you do have the most stable and dependable reference platform for your spiritual and physical position available to you. It will help you to know at all times and in all places whether or not you are on theright path.<br><br>It is the companionship of the Holy Ghost. Always be worthy of the companionship of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>I firmly believe that a special spirit has rested upon this school from its very beginning. You have heard many times what Brigham Young told Karl G. Maeser as he commenced his work at Brigham Young Academy: "Remember that you ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God" (in Reinhard Maeser, <i>Karl G. Maeser: A Biography by His Son</i> [Provo: Brigham Young University, 1928], 79).<br><br>This wonderful and straightforward counsel by a prophet of God still applies to everything you do today and in the future. Keep this special BYU spirit in your lives. Do nothing without the Spirit of God. The presence of the Spirit of God will bring focus, certainty, and confidence into your life. And "by the power of the Holy Ghost [you] may know the truth of all things" (Moroni 10:5). The gift and the power of "the Holy Ghost . . . will show unto you all things what [you] should do" (2 Nephi 32:5).<br><br>What a wonderful promise for you as you move forward into your future.<br><br>You are a marvelous generation. You are blessed beyond measure. The world needs you and your goodness. Great opportunities await you. I love you; I admire you. Do not fear. God is with you; have faith. Use your time wisely, continue to learn, and always live worthy to have the Spirit with you.<br><br>I leave you my blessing and love, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Dieter F.

<h1>ither Trust in the Arm of Flesh&quot; - Russell M. Nelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, President Samuelson. Thank you for your excellent service and exemplary leadership. We admire you and Sister Samuelson greatly. We also express our gratitude to the faculty and staff for their help to these choice students at Brigham Young University. Wendy and I are grateful to be herewith you today.<br><br>We are very pleased that President Dieter F. Uchtdorf has been awarded an honorary doctorate. We congratulate him. When we think of all he has accomplished--from his childhood days as a refugee in Europe's cold, cruel cauldron of war to his position now in the First Presidency of the Church--we stand in awe. Through those years he has become a great man of faith and a devoted disciple of the Lord. Wendy and I have deep affection for him, for his dear wife, Harriet, and for their family.<br><br>Now to each individual graduate we extend our heartfelt congratulations. We commend you for completing the course. You are winners. To your families and loved ones who have encouraged you, prayed for you, and sacrificed for you, we also express our gratitude and love.<br><br>Some of you graduates will continue your educational studies. Keep up the good work! We're proud of you! Most of you will not pursue more formal education but will embark on your chosen career. We're grateful for you and wish you well.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, regardless of your choices for the future, you will continue to learn. As long as you live, you will learn. It is part of God's plan for us. You will grow intellectually and spiritually. Just as Jesus the Christ "increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man,"<sup>1</sup> so may you.<br><br>To increase your wisdom and stature, you will exercise your agency. You will choose your teachers and your role models. Choose them wisely. Heed this counsel of Alma: "Trust no one to be your teacher . . . , except he be a man of God, walking in his ways and keeping his commandments."<sup>2</sup><br><br>If you enter the job market now, you will do so at a time of economic distress. Job opportunities throughout the world are diminishing and becoming more competitive. You will need to work hard and perform well to hold a job in the difficult days that lie ahead.<br><br>Challenges are not limited to your age group. The decline of our economy is affecting many others. Senior citizens who have retired from their work are strained because the value of their nest egg has now been substantially eroded.<br><br>Such economic woes are not new. Verses recorded long ago in the Book of Mormon apply today. From the book of Helaman we read:<br><br><i>The time cometh that . . . your riches . . . become slippery, that ye cannot hold them; and in the days of your poverty ye cannot retain them. . . .</i><br><br><i> . . . Yea, in that day ye shall say: O that we had remembered the Lord our God in the day that he gave us our riches, and then they would not have become slippery that we should lose them; forbehold, our riches are gone from us.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>Throughout history economic conditions have been cyclic in nature. So you will live to see more ups and downs in the economy, just as surely as you will see the seasons change.<br><br>With the cycles of man and nature all about us, we need to remember that truth never changes. God lives. He is our Father. He loves us. He wants us to be happy. Because He loves us, He wants us to prepare well now for our eventual return to Him. Can you imagine anything more joyful than that homecoming? It truly will be glorious for those who have qualified for the blessings of eternal life.<sup>4</sup><br><br>To assist us in that quest, we have been given help through the teachings of God's prophets and the scriptures. Here is one example: "Cursed is he that putteth his trust in man, or maketh flesh his arm."<sup>5</sup> To rephrase that in today's terms, if you trust only in your 401(k)s or IRAs, your retirement plans may be disappointing. But your investments in tithing will continue to pay rich dividends--here and hereafter. Indeed, the nest egg of tithing will never be eroded.<br><br>We learn more about the limitations of the arm of flesh from the Doctrine and Covenants. In its preface we read that "the weak things of the world shall come forth and break down the mighty and strong ones, that man should not counsel his fellow man, neither trust in the arm of flesh."<sup>6</sup> Or, to rephrase that warning, even though you may be learned in the ways of the world, don't forget the power of God.<br><br>More than 30 years ago my medical school classmates and I learned that lesson in an unforgettable way. We will never forget it. Our experience took place in the little town of Manzanillo on Mexico's western coast. The year was 1978. We were attending a meeting with our medical school graduating class and their wives.<br><br>One evening after the scientific sessions hadbeen completed, one of the doctors suddenly became seriously ill. Without warning, he began to lose massive amounts of blood from his stomach. Totally stunned, we surrounded him, watching life's precious blood flow out from him. There we were, medical specialists skilled in various disciplines--including surgeons, anesthesiologists, and internists--with wisdom gained through more than 30 years of experience. What could we do? The nearest hospital was in Guadalajara, more than 100 mountainous miles away. It was night. No planes could fly. Blood transfusions were out of the question because of lack of equipment. All of our combined knowledge could not be mobilized to stop his hemorrhage. We were totally without the facilities or equipment needed to save the life of our beloved friend.<br><br>Our stricken colleague, a faithful Latter-day Saint, was well aware of his plight. Ashen and pale, he whispered a request for the administration of a priesthood blessing. Several of us held the Melchizedek Priesthood. We responded to his request immediately. I was asked to seal the anointing. The Spirit dictated that he be blessed to the end that the bleeding would stop and that he would continue tolive and return to his home. That blessing was administered in the name of the Lord.<br><br>The next morning, his condition had improved. Miraculously, the bleeding had stopped. His blood pressure had returned to normal. In a couple of days he was able to return to his home. Unitedly, we thanked the Lord for this most remarkable blessing.<br><br>The lesson we learned was simple: "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding."<sup>7</sup> We experienced this firsthand. This doctrine, taught repeatedly in the scriptures,<sup>8</sup> had now become our sure and certain knowledge.<br><br>Please do not misunderstand me, brothers and sisters. Of course we need to prepare for worthy work to do. Yes, we do need to do our work well, whatever we choose to do in life. We need to be able to render significant service. And before we can achieve that competence, we must have an education. With us, education is a religious responsibility. "The glory of God [really] is intelligence."<sup>9</sup><br><br>But the learning of man has its limitations. And sometimes, as in our circumstance in rural Mexico, the combined learning of many experts cannot be applied when we need it most. We have to place our trust in the Lord.<br><br>That experience in Mexico taught us another important lesson. It pertains to our ultimate priorities and highest destinies as mortal beings. We learned that a doctor's ultimate destination is not in the hospital. For a lawyer, it is not in the courtroom. For a jet pilot, it is not in the cockpit of a Boeing 747. Each person's chosen occupation is only a <i>means</i> to an end; it is not an end in itself.<br><br>The end for which each of you should strive is to be the person that you can become--the person that God wants you to be. The day will come when your professional career will end, as it has already for President Uchtdorf and Elder Nelson. The career that you will have labored so hard to achieve--the work that will have supported you and your family--will one day be behind you.<br><br>Then you will have learned this great lesson: Much more important than what you have done for a living is what kind of a person you have become. On your final graduation day--when you leave this frail existence--what you have become will matter most. Attributes such as "faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility, [and] diligence"<sup>10</sup> will all be weighed in the Lord's balance.<br><br>Keep learning and keep preparing for your ultimate graduation day.<sup>11</sup> From time to time ask yourself these questions:<br><ul><br> 	<li>Am I ready to meet my Maker?</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Am I worthy of all the blessings He has in store for His faithful children?</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Have I received my endowment and sealing ordinances of the temple?</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Have I remained faithful to my covenants?</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Have I qualified for the greatest of all God's blessings--the blessing of eternal life?<sup>12</sup></li><br></ul><br>Long ago, Moses and the children of Israel sang this song together: "The Lord is my strength . . . and he is . . . my salvation: he is my God."<sup>13</sup> I hope that graduates from Brigham Young University can sing that song with equal conviction.<br><br>Those who cherish their faith in God--those who trust in Him--have been given this great scriptural promise:<br><br><i>Let no man glory in man, but rather let him glory in God. . . .</i><br><br><i>These shall dwell in the presence of God and his Christ forever and ever.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>That this may be the ultimate destiny for each of us is my humble prayer, in the name ofJesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Russell M. Nelson was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this commencement address was given on 23 April 2009.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1> To Serve</h1>
<br>
<br>
Fellow graduates, when I moved into my dorm room in Helaman Halls in the fall of 2003, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I certainly never dreamed I would be standing here in a blue, dress-like outfit, in a square hat, doing this. I thought, like most of my friends, that I was just coming to college. I would be here for a few years, get my degree, go somewhere else, and move on. I've gotten the degree, and I'm going somewhere else, but I will never be able to just move on--none of us will. We can't just move on, because BYU has changed us; it has become a part of us, and we are connected for good to this university.<br><br>This enduring connection to BYU is shared by hundreds of thousands of successful BYU alumni who have preceded us in all fields of work, service, or advanced study--and we have a responsibility to live up to their reputation. We will live up to it, because we have been well prepared.<br><br>Our preparation began the moment we arrived on campus. We arrived from all over the world; in fact, we are perhaps the most diverse graduating class in BYU history. In our pre-BYU lives we had many distinct experiences. As diverse as our experiences may have been, however, we were united by at least one commonality when we arrived on this campus: we were full of questions--questions we started asking ourselves the moment we passed the sign that declares "Enter to Learn."<br><br>Ironically, it was the issue of learning that was the genesis of most of our uncertainty when we first arrived, and the prominent letters that mark the entrance of campus seemed to prompt our initial questions: What am I going to major in? Am I going to be successful? What or where is the SWKT?<br><br>Four years later (give or take) and we've all finally decided on a major and HBLL, the Wilk, and SWKT roll off our tongues as if by second nature.<br><br>During these four years in academia we have learned that knowledge is often born of questioning that which is given to us as truth. And so, naturally, besides answering many of the questions we came with, we leave with others. Our parting questions resemble those that we had when we arrived: What am I going to do with that major? And, once again: Am I going to be successful?<br><br>The unique and magnificent thing about a BYU education is that in addition to being taught truths that we are meant to question, we are also taught far more important truths that we need not doubt. These truths are simple: God loves us, He sent His Son to save us, and He wants all of His children to be happy. These truths answer the deepest desires of our souls.<br><br>To be successful, or to be of worth, is one of the deep desires that unite us as we leave BYU. Fortunately the unquestionable truths of God teach us how to attain true success--no matter our major. He has taught us about true success through the life of His Son, who found His life by losing it--figuratively and very literally--in the service of others (see Matthew 16:25).<br><br>Surely we have all realized the importance of service while here at BYU. I have had the opportunity to learn from some amazing examples. As president of the Student Alumni Association, I have personally seen thousands of fellow students donate hundreds of thousands of pounds of food and tens of thousands of dollars to the needy in our community. I have also witnessed hundreds of alumni return often to their alma mater to help students network and prepare for life after BYU. Students and alumni alike have given not so much out of a desire for attention but because they understand the importance of service. Such service blesses the lives of those who selflessly give.<br><br>When we have served, we have discovered an extra measure of strength and have witnessed our own problems shrink in size and in complexity. I know that just as our university experience was not complete without finding ways to lose ourselves in the service of others, our lives will remain unfulfilled if we keep to ourselves and do not give to the world of what BYU has given us.<br><br>And so, just as the sign leading into campus, "Enter to Learn," prompted so many questions in our young and eager minds, the rest of the sign, "Go Forth to Serve," answers the questions of our still young and eager souls. It is only by learning and living this final lesson that we can honor this university and the name of Him who directs it.<br><br>May we all go forth then with a knowledge of how vital service will be to our future success.<br><p style="color: #333333; font-style: normal; line-height: 24.375px;"><em>Joseph R.

<h1>in the World, live True to your Beliefs</h1>
<br>
<br>
Today as we gather for commencement, wecome together with each of us wearing caps, gowns, hoods, and cords that signify different things. Someone with a trained eye can look at an individual's commencement regalia and tell whether that person holds a PhD, a master's degree, or a bachelor's degree; the university that granted it; and even the person's academic discipline.<br><br>I've always been fascinated by the way we seem to understand and sort out our world through the symbols, colors, and cues with which we surround ourselves. We each tell a story about ourselves by what we choose to wear, what we drive, what we buy, and what we do. Companies and products have become highly proficient in telling their stories through the brands they cultivate. A Nike swoosh, for example, automatically means something to each of us--the positive attitude to "just do it."<br><br>Rarely is it that anyone outside of a university will know the official mission or brand promise of the institution. This year, you and I and tens of thousands of others carried a short message to the world about what this place stands for. It was in the form of two words: "The Quest." While some people never could get past connecting the quest with the number of wins and losses on the football field, others who listened gained insight to what it means to be from BYU.<br><br>The mission of Brigham Young University is "to assist individuals in their <i>quest for perfection and eternal life</i>" (<i>The Mission of Brigham Young University</i> and <i>The Aims of a BYU Education</i> [Provo: BYU, 1996], 1; emphasis added). That's a pretty hefty brand promise--there's a little more to it than "have it your way" or "just do it" and slogans from other popular brands in the world. But, make no mistake, that is the brand of distinction you carry forward with you today as you leave Brigham Young University to find your place in the world.<br><br>Arthur Brooks, the president of the American Enterprise Institute, was the speaker at the BYU forum in February. He spoke about happiness, business success, and prosperity. Not a member of the Church, he quoted from the Book of Mormon and shared with us results of study after study demonstrating the causal link between providing volunteer service and financial giving that leads to happiness, leadership opportunities, business success, and prosperity. If you are interested in those kinds of things, you might want to look up his talk online.<br><br>But for today, I'd like to share his story about his "magic briefcase." As a guest lecturer at BYU a couple of years ago, he was given a briefcase as a gift by a professor here at BYU. It was a nice briefcase with the BYU logo on it. A few months later the handle on his own briefcase broke, and he began to use the BYU briefcase at work and when he was traveling. After a short while he realized people would notice the briefcase and would assume he was LDS. Realizing his actions would reflect upon the brand he was carrying, he began trying to live true to that brand. In his words, the magic briefcase<br><br><i>was actually making my life better. I was happier; things were going really well for me as I was carrying it. And the reason is that the service for which Mormons have become justifiably famous was infecting my life. It was making me better. ... And I thank you for that.</i> [Arthur C. Brooks, "Why Giving Matters," BYU forum address, 24February 2009]<br><br>The BYU brand <i>is</i> justifiably famous. A big part of the reason is that its mission has nothing to do with BYU and everything to do with you and the kind of person it seeks to help you become--a person "of faith, intellect, and character who [has] the skills and the desire to continue learning and to serve others throughout their lives" (<i>Mission</i> and <i>Aims,</i> 3). Today marks only the beginning or "commencement" of your fulfilling the BYU mission or brand promise--which is ultimately measured in the kind of person you will become.<br><br>As graduates of Brigham Young University today, you join a great alumni family of men and women now more than 370,000 strong throughout the world who share this mission--this mission that is now yours--to "let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven" (Matthew 5:16; see also 3Nephi 12:16).<br><br>At the Alumni Association, we believe the "light" we each hold as alumni can be magnified when we connect with others who share the Spirit of the Y. We are dedicated to cultivating the Spirit of the Y by keeping you informed and connected to the good works faculty and alumni are doing in the world and by providing opportunities for you to learn, volunteer, contribute, and serve with the students, programs, and activities of your alma mater--keeping you "Connected for Good."<br><br>We feel so strongly about this idea of being connected for good that we have adopted it as the slogan of the Alumni Association. No longer students, we will remain connected as alumni with a shared commitment to go forth to do "good" in a world that has now become our campus.<br><br>As president of the Brigham Young University Alumni Association Board of Directors, I hereby confer on each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. Congratulations!<br><br>I invite you to wear the BYU brand with distinction and honor. Let our brand promise continue to lift and inspire you. Find ways you can be connected for good and receive the blessings that come to those who continue to learn and serve others throughout their lives.<br><br>May God bless you. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Dee Allsop was president of the BYU Alumni Association when this commencement address was given on 23 April 2009.</i><br><br>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>-Changing Partnership with the Spirit - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, despite my anxiety over the assignment I have been asked to fill today, I am truly pleased to be with you. I am grateful for the support I have received from colleagues and friends. I express particular gratitude to my sweet wife, Angela, who supports me today and always.<br><br>You have heard that I am an electrical engineer, and this leads me to a confession: I am a classic science geek. Shocking, I know. I am fascinated by the workings of our world, and I love to learn and to teach about them. I am guilty of soliciting opportunities to give science demonstrations to kids, even ones as young as four years old. After all, you can never start geek training too early.<br><br>One scientific discovery that has always fascinated me is the laser, which was first demonstrated in the early 1960s. To illustrate what makes this light source so interesting, let me make a quick comparison between light generated in a fluorescent bulb and light generated in a laser. In a fluorescent bulb, the gas molecules in the bulb are energized into an excited state by an electric current, and then they spontaneously and randomly release light as they transition to their original energy state. The resulting light moves in different directions and, in fact, will be different colors, which is why most fluorescent light is white. In the case of the laser, the excited molecules release their light energy in response to other light energy hitting the molecule. Amazingly, under this circumstance the released light is identical to the incident light in direction, color, and other characteristics, and as a result the light is particularly intense. As an analogy, consider how people engaged in a tug-of-war can be most effective when they all pull at precisely the same time. The laser light source is powerful despite the fact that it does not consume a lot of electrical power.<br><br>This scientific phenomenon reminds me of the account in the Book of Mormon of the Nephites gathering together immediately before the appearance of the resurrected Savior. We read:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that while they were thus conversing one with another, they heard a voice as if it came out of heaven; and they cast their eyes round about, for they understood not the voice which they heard; and it was not a harsh voice, neither was it a loud voice; nevertheless, and notwithstanding it being a small voice it did pierce them that did hear to the center, ... yea, it did pierce them to the very soul.</i> [3 Nephi 11:3]<br><br>To me this voice is a lot like a laser: not loud but powerful and pointed. Of course this was the voice of the Father introducing the Savior to the Nephites, but it seems that the voice of the Holy Ghost could be described in a similar way. This scriptural story also tells us that the Nephites heard the voice twice without understanding it. The third time, they understood it only because they "did open their ears to hear it" (3 Nephi 11:5). Isn't this often the way the promptings of the Spirit work for us? It is on this process of understanding the guidance androles of the Spirit that I would like tospeaktoday.<br><h2><b>Promptings for Personal Well-Being</b></h2><br>When I was serving as a bishop in a BYU student ward, one Sunday afternoon a young woman came into my office to tell me that she had been dating a young man for some time and that he had recently proposed to her. (That happens occasionally on this campus.) Before giving an answer to the young man's question, she wanted to pray for assurance that marrying him was the Lord's will. She prayed frequently and even fasted, waiting for an unmistakable witness instructing her of the choice she should make. However, she felt that clear direction never came. She was frustrated and had begun to question her own worthiness, fearing that she didn't deserve the promised guidance associated with the gift of the Holy Ghost. Fortunately, as we discussed the situation, she was able to feel comfortable with a decision, although she left still feeling a desire to receive a clear witness.<br><br>Other similar experiences suggest to me that difficulty in recognizing clear guidance from the Spirit is a common frustration among Church members and one that is not limited to youth or young adults. We all desire to use the great gift of the Holy Ghost that we have received in order to confidently make life's key decisions. We seek answers to difficult questions such as "What major or career path should I pursue?" "How can our limited budget get us to the end of the month?""How can I help my aging parents?" and, yes,"Should I marry the person I am currently dating?" We have hope that the guidance oftheSpirit will help us to make choices that will lead to happiness and comfort for ourselves and those welove.<br><br>Sometimes inspiration from the Holy Ghost comes in unmistakable ways. On this topic, President Heber J. Grant said:<br><br><i>The Lord gives to many of us the still, small voice of revelation. It comes as vividly and strongly as though it were with a great sound. It comes to each man, according to his needs and faithfulness, for guidance in matters that pertain to his own life.</i> ["The 'Still Small Voice,'" <i>Improvement Era,</i> December 1938, 712; also in <i>GS,</i> 30]<br><br>My observation is that obvious and immediate guidance from the Spirit comes when there is a pressing need, such as our own safety, or if there will be a significant impact on other people. These types of promptings are great gifts from God.<br><br>Because we as Latter-day Saints have heard so many stories in which the answers come easily and vividly, we tend to expect this type of manifestation of the Spirit when making all of our important decisions, and we may feel frustrated or even unworthy when we don't receive it. However, it is my observation that for every story of an individual receiving a clear and direct answer, there is at least one story of someone who has struggled to receive such clear direction. Sometimes, indeed, such struggling can be caused by unworthiness. But I think we need to more carefully consider the role of the Spirit in our lives and to better recognize His influence. Let me try to illustrate my point with a personal experience.<br><br>At the end of my undergraduate education, Imade a relatively simple decision to extend my education for another year here at BYU to complete a master's degree. Then, as I considered opportunities for doctoral studies, I found the decisions to be very difficult: How would this degree influence my career? Was it the correct path for my eventual family? Would I enjoy the education and resulting career? What school should I choose?<br><br>I sought the guidance of the Spirit and hoped for a clear answer to my prayers. As part of this process, I educated myself regarding the different options and solicited advice from the faculty here. But obvious guidance from the Spirit never came. I wondered if I had failed to seek guidance with sincerity or if I had somehow offended the Spirit and was not deserving of the answers I sought. Armed, however, with information and advice, I made the best decision I could.<br><br>Now, the benefit of time passed allows me to see that I made the correct decision so many years ago. I have no doubt that I received the promised guidance of the Spirit without even recognizing it. Life has taught me that in these types of decisions, as we collect and evaluate information, the Spirit works right by our side, helping us to sift and prioritize the information that is critical in making the appropriate decision. He helps us realize which factors and considerations are most important. He quickens our minds and enhances our own reasoning. While we often don't recognize this enhancement we enjoy, it is clear that we are, in fact, partners with the Spirit in this decision-making process.<br><br>Remember that the Lord told Oliver Cowdery that he must first "study it out in [his] mind" (D&amp;amp;C 9:8) and that the Lord would "tell [him] in [his] mind and in [his] heart, by the Holy Ghost" (D&amp;amp;C 8:2). Sometimes, our inclination is to think that we do all the up-front work and then seek the Spirit to confirm our decision. This is consistent with the message we give to those investigating the Church that they should first study the Book of Mormon and then pray to know of its truthfulness. However, we all know that the Spirit will testify of the truth <i>while</i> they are reading the Book of Mormon, that they can gain a testimony <i>while</i> listening to truth, and that subsequent prayer only confirms that witness. Why then do we dismiss the quickening of the mind and reasoning enabled by the Holy Ghost that occurs <i>while</i> we are making life's important decisions?<br><br>This important partnership with the Spirit ispart of the great plan of God. The Lord tells us in the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;</i><br><br><i>For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 58:27–28]<br><br>This agency, this power within us, is something that we must exercise. In our zeal to return to live with our Father in Heaven, I fear that we sometimes lose sight of the fact that our ultimate goal is higher: we are to become like Him. We are expected to use our intellects and our abilities to their fullest extent, for that is how in this life we develop as much as possible our Godlike attributes. The Spirit's job is to make up the vast difference between our abilities and the abilities we need to make correct decisions. But were the Spirit to dictate all of our actions by providing direct answers to all of our questions, He would rob us of the practice we so desperately need if we are to develop as the plan of salvation requires.<br><br>My advice, and my encouragement, is that you live worthily and seek the guidance of the Spirit while working hard to make life's decisions after careful consideration of the relevant issues. Then be confident that the Spirit is working in partnership with you, even if the final result is not as dramatic as you had originally hoped. Often the final witness comes only as a quiet understanding that you have deliberated to the best of your abilities and are ready to move forward with faith. Then, give glory and thanks to God both for the opportunity to develop your Godlike attributes and for the partnership with the Spirit that compensates for your shortcomings imposed by mortality and imperfection.<br><h2><b>Promptings for Spiritual Progression</b></h2><br>Our understanding and recognition of this partnership we have with the Spirit can be enhanced and perfected if we pay stricter attention to a more important function of the Spirit. I love section 21 of the Doctrine and Covenants. It documents a revelation received by the Prophet Joseph Smith during the meeting called to organize the Church. In this revelation, the Lord said regarding the Prophet:<br><br><i>For his word ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth, in all patience and faith.</i><br><br><i>For by doing these things the gates of hell shall not prevail against you; yea, and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before you, and cause the heavens to shake for your good, and his name's glory.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 21:5–6]<br><br>For me, the imagery of this verse is that of a ship moving along its course with the bow dispersing the water to help the ship pass smoothly along its way. I can imagine the powers of darkness trying to impede our path of spiritual progression and the guidance of the Spirit helping us to follow the prophet's words such that these powers of darkness are dispersed from before us. And consider that following the prophet's words is equivalent to following the Savior, for He has said that His words "shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same" (D&amp;amp;C 1:38).<br><br>How is it that the Spirit helps us in following the words of the prophet and thereby in following the Savior? Consider the teachings of the Savior to the Nephites as He visited them after His resurrection: "Now this is the commandment: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and be baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day" (3 Nephi 27:20).<br><br>The idea that the Holy Ghost sanctifies us is a familiar teaching, something that we learn early in our study of the gospel. The gift of the Holy Ghost is the baptism by fire (see 2 Nephi 31:13–14) that we understand to be a cleansing process. But what is it that is cleansed? How does this cleansing manifest itself in our daily lives? How does it relate to the remission of sins promised as a result of repentance and our satisfaction of baptismal covenants?<br><br>This is not a complicated doctrine, but it is one that is crucial to understand as we pursue our goal to become like our Father. Let me address this by means of a familiar scriptural story. Recall that after their own miraculous conversion, Ammon and the other sons of King Mosiah left home to minister among the Lamanites. Ammon traveled to the land of Ishmael, representing a part of the Lamanite kingdom ruled by King Lamoni, whose father was the king over all the Lamanites. After some pretty impressive missionary work, Ammon had the opportunity to teach Lamoni and his household the gospel, and everyone (except for a woman who had already secretly been converted) received a miraculous conversion experience. These converted individuals later testified to the people in the land (see Alma 17–19). A scripture tells us that "they did all declare unto the people the selfsame thing--that their hearts had been changed; that they had no more desire to do evil" (Alma 19:33).<br><br>Does this sound like sanctification to you? As we previously discussed, we all have agency, which is the power to change our behavior. We have the ability to cease committing sin. However, simply abandoning sin is inadequate, as we still have the desire to continue our former behavior. The influence of the Spirit is able to change our very hearts so that we no longer even <i>desire</i> to commit sin. The purging by the refiner's fire often used to describe the cleansing process enabled by the Spirit is the purging of the unrighteous desires from our heart. Neil A. Maxwell taught:<br><br><i>Fortunately for us, our loving Lord will work with us, "even if [we] can [do] no more than desire to believe," providing we will "let this desire work in [us]" (Alma 32:27). Therefore, declared President Joseph F. Smith, "the education then of our desires is one of far-reaching importance to our happiness in life" (</i>Gospel Doctrine,<i> 5th ed. [1939], 297). Such education can lead to sanctification until, said President Brigham Young, "holy desires produce corresponding outward works" (in</i> Journal of Discourses, <i>6:170).</i> <i>Only by educating and training our desires can they become our allies instead of our enemies!</i> ["According to the Desire of [Our] Hearts," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1996, 22]<br><br>I love this imagery of "the education ... of our desires" as something that leads to sanctification until holy desires produce good works. This is the single most important function of the Holy Ghost, as this is what enables us to return to God's presence and become like Him.<br><h2><b>The Role of Sacrifice</b></h2><br>What is our role in enabling the Spirit to work this miracle in our lives? Remember our discussion revealing that following the prophet and therefore following the Savior disperses the powers of darkness from before us? There is a simple scriptural story that brings this concept to life.<br><br>A young man came to Jesus during His mortal ministry and asked Him what he needed to do to obtain eternal life. Jesus quoted several basic commandments, and the young man simply answered that he had kept these commandments since he was a child. Perhaps he therefore felt confident when he asked Jesus the question "What lack I yet?" (Matthew 19:20). He obviously was not prepared for the answer that Jesus gave him: "Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me" (Matthew 19:21).<br><br>Unfortunately, the young man could not comply. It is easy for us to condemn the young man as being too attached to his material possessions. But this story is not about the love of money and things. This story is about loving something so much that it keeps us from following the Savior. In this context, we all have great possessions, and many of us are guilty of the behavior displayed by this young man. Even Peter, who returned to his fishing after the Savior's crucifixion, was asked about those fish by the resurrected Lord: "Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?" (John 21:15).<br><br>Consider again our story about the sons of Mosiah. Lamoni's father, king over all the Lamanites, had the opportunity to observe Ammon with his son, and as a result he desired to learn the gospel. As Aaron, Ammon's brother, taught the king about the gospel, the king indicated that he would give away his entire kingdom to "have this eternal life," "be born of God," and have "this wicked spirit rooted out of [his] breast, and receive [the] Spirit" (Alma 22:15). But giving up his kingdom was not required. Rather, the king soon realized a different sacrifice was warranted, and as he prayed he said to God: "Wilt thou make thyself known unto me, and I will give away all my sins to know thee" (Alma 22:18).<br><br>One summer during my own college years, I worked at a job that required me to commute about 15 miles each way. To economize, I carpooled with a young man who was a devout born-again Christian. I came to love this man's devotion in the cause of Christ, and in time he revealed to me that he had once been a very accomplished figure skater. When I asked him why he no longer engaged in the sport, he told me that he felt he was doing it for his own glory rather than for the glory of God. I could not help but be impressed by his willingness to give up what he loved because he felt it was keeping him from following the Savior.<br><br>By using our agency to change our behavior, we empower the Spirit to change our hearts. We must truthfully identify those things currently keeping us from following the Savior as fully as we should and, unlike the young rich man, be willing to put those things on the altar of sacrifice. Then the Spirit can educate our desires, making it so that we no longer desire to do evil, which is the sanctification we seek.<br><br>My mission president was a man who knew the scriptures and used them to powerfully teach. I can still recall his words as he would use scriptures to clearly and simply explain doctrines that I had previously thought to be complicated and confusing. Recently I attended a reunion for missionaries who had served under this man. As he took the podium at the end of the evening, he delivered a sermon that demonstrated that his power and ability had only increased in his life. I was struck by his words, which went something like, "There are many of you in this room who are living in such a way that you do not enjoy the companionship of the Spirit. Whatever you are doing that is not in harmony with the commandments, stop it now."<br><br>This message is powerful. Sometimes we rationalize our continuation of inappropriate thoughts, words, and deeds, saying that we are not ready to change now but will certainly improve in the future. My plea is, to use the words of my mission president, that you "stop it now." My invitation is that you leave today with a resolve in your heart to identify some sinful behaviors that you can--today--sacrifice and come follow the Savior.<br><h2><b>The Impact of Action</b></h2><br>There is a remarkable outcome of this process working in our lives. Do you remember the story of Enos in the Book of Mormon? Enos tells us that while he was hunting in the forest, he remembered the teachings of his father, Jacob, about eternal life, and therefore his soul "hungered" (Enos 1:4). What a great word to describe his desire to change or, to connect with my remarks today, to give up those things keeping him from following the Savior. He knelt down and prayed all day and into the night. The culmination of this process was a voice coming to him, telling him that his sins had been forgiven (see Enos 1:2–5). Clearly Enos underwent the change of heart we have been discussing today.<br><br>I am struck, however, by what happened next. After Enos received a witness of the principles of the Atonement through this interchange with the voice of the Lord, the scripture tells us that he "began to feel a desire for the welfare of [his] brethren" (Enos 1:9), and therefore he started to pray for them. After receiving additional guidance from the voice of the Lord, Enos then tells us that he started topray for the Lamanites (see Enos 1:11).<br><br>No longer desiring to do evil, which is a key indicator of the change of heart wrought by the Spirit, goes hand in hand with having a concern for the welfare of others. Enos is not alone in undergoing this type of transformation. Alma the Elder, Alma the Younger, the sons of Mosiah, Peter and Paul of the New Testament, and many other scriptural figures demonstrate the same change in their lives. Our modern prophets, apostles, and general Church leaders, all of whom clearly have experienced a change of heart in their lives, spend their time in our service, saddened by the thought that any of us should be lost due to wickedness.<br><br>More generally, the scriptures are full of stories of prophets and other examples of faith receiving clear and distinct guidance from the Spirit as those individuals strove to be instruments in God's hands to bless the lives of others. If you would like more frequent and more impactful direct encounters with the Spirit, focus on how you can serve those around you. Pray each day that the Spirit will guide you to those who need your help. As you study sacred words, ponder on ways in which you can apply the principles you learn to serve those around you. This simple formula will bring the Spirit into your lives in new, direct, and powerful ways.<br><br>I encourage you to ask yourself these questions: Are you the one trying to beat everyone else to the front of the long line at the grocery store, or are you instead the one helping the mother with small children who is struggling to balance her cart and her kids? Are you too busy with your own problems to listen to a roommate's or spouse's challenges, or are you the trusted confidant and counselor? Do you home or visit teach to satisfy a requirement, or are you finding meaningful ways to serve the families or individuals you visit? Do you seek Church callings that give high visibility, or are you striving to bless others' lives no matter where you are called to serve?<br><br>Brothers and sisters, we have covered a lot of ground today. Remember these words:<br><br><i>Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;</i><br><br><i>For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 58:27–28]<br><br>This is the path we must pursue if we are to become like our Father in Heaven. If there are things keeping you from following the Savior, stop them now, and seek to bless the lives of those around you. Through this process you will find the Spirit working a great change in your heart, and your desires will center on serving God by serving your fellowman. Your familiarity with the Spirit will become so exercised that when you need His help in making decisions for your own well-being, you will immediately recognize those thoughts and promptings--that partnership--that will assist you through your decision-making process. Indeed, you will find that the promptings are increasingly clear and unmistakable, even if the nature of these promptings is not dramatic.<br><br>On this path of progression, never forget the beautiful promise of the Master given in D&amp;amp;C 121: "Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God" (D&amp;amp;C 121:45).<br><br>This confidence before God is what I hope for myself, my family, and each of you. I hope that you will seek these blessings of the Spirit more fully in your lives, and I testify of the power it will bring.<br><br><i>Michael A.

<h1>ope, and Charity: The Most Important Three Things In the World</h1>
<br>
<br>
I wish to thank President Samuelson, Academic Vice President Tanner, and Advancement Vice President Worthen for the opportunity to speak today. I am grateful for these devotionals and the occasion they give us to explore what it means to be a community of faith as well as a community of reason. I want to express my gratitude for the beautiful music and to Megan Grant and Suzanne Disparte for their prayers. They are two of my research assistants who prop me up on a daily basis; so it is entirely fitting that they do the same thing here. I want to also acknowledge my father and stepmother; my wife, Deirdre; and my three children, Elliot, Sophelia, and Ella. They are missing school to be here, so I know I have a grateful audience of at least three.<br><br>As I prepared to speak with you today, I actually worked through three different topics, each more personal than the last, and I hope you will forgive me as I speak from the heart about some aspects of my own journey of faith.<br><br>I traveled in my mind's eye back to my student days. At Oxford University I attended a series of lectures in which a famous and fashionable professor asserted confidently that the study of ancient Greek philosophy was one of the three best things in life. With a sly smile and an arched eyebrow, he did not tell us out loud what he thought the other two were.<br><br>But his assertion left me wondering: What are the most important three things in the world? Later, during my personal scripture study, I searched the Topical Guide for inspiration and was led to Paul's famous formulation in 1 Corinthians:<br><br><i>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.</i><br><br><i>And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. . . .</i><br><br><i>And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>At the very end of the Book of Mormon, after completing his abridgement of the Jaredite record, the prophet Moroni is surprised to find that he is not dead yet.<sup>2</sup> Fortunately, he catches a second wind and recounts a few of his father's teachings, including Mormon's powerful discourse on faith, hope, and charity.<sup>3</sup> And then, in Moroni 10, the last chapter of the Book of Mormon, Moroni returns to this theme as he offers his final exhortations. (By my count, in that chapter alone he uses the words <i>exhortation</i> or <i>exhort</i> nine times.) Moroni says:<br><br><i>And I would exhort you, my beloved brethren, that ye remember that every good gift cometh of Christ. . . . </i><br><br><i>Wherefore, there must be faith; and if there must be faith there must also be hope; and if there must be hope there must also be charity.</i><br><br><i>And except ye have charity ye can in nowise be saved in the kingdom of God; neither can ye be saved in the kingdom of God if ye have not faith; neither can ye if ye have no hope.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>Today I would like to spend our time together talking about faith, hope, and charity.<br><br>These are not simply three good things on a list. In a certain sense, they are the most important three things in the world. They are the foundational Christian virtues. Each is a trait of character to be cultivated and developed. Each is a set of attitudes and beliefs to guide thought and action. Each is a choice. Each is a gift from God.<br><br>Faith, hope, and charity may be likened to the three legs of a stool. As a boy visiting my grandmother's farm, I was impressed with the three-legged stool used for milking cows. Just as the stool's three legs enabled it to rest firmly on uneven ground, if we are grounded in faith, hope, and charity, we too will be on solid footing, even when the ground beneath us is rough or bumpy. Just as a one- or two-legged stool will teeter precariously, we too will be vulnerable to toppling over if we neglect any of these three virtues.<br><br>In my study of this topic, I've noticed several things. First, faith, hope, and charity aremutually reinforcing. An increase in one tends to result in an increase in the others. Ifwe are feeling weak with respect to one, wecan gather strength by focusing on the other two.<br><br>There is also a temporal dimension to the relationship. Faith is rooted in the past--in Christ's death and resurrection and in His Atonement for our sins. Hope is focused on the future--in the promise that through Christ's Atonement and by the covenants we make and keep, we can return to the presence of our Father in Heaven. And charity is enacted in the present--because it is only here and now that we can really love.<br><br>There is also a dimension of progression and culmination: faith and hope lead to charity, and it is charity--Christ's love for us--that never fails.<sup>5</sup> If we desire to develop and be endowed with this Christlike love, it will be by traveling the road of faith and hope.<br><h2><b>I. Faith</b></h2><br>First, a few words about faith.<br><br>As a freshman at Georgetown University, I took a required course, The Problem of God, from a wonderful professor, Dr. John F. Haught. This Catholic theologian became one of my most influential teachers and mentors.<br><br>One day toward the end of fall semester, Dr. Haught introduced theologian Paul Ricoeur's concept of the three stages of religious faith.<sup>6</sup><br><br>The first stage, childlike faith, may be likened to the clear, unimpeded view that one enjoys standing atop a tall mountain.<sup>7</sup> As children, our faith is simple and uncritical, and we can see clearly in every direction. There is something quite beautiful about this stage of faith. To me it is exemplified by hearing a chorus of Primary children sing "I Know My Father Lives."<sup>8</sup><br><br>The second stage Ricoeur calls the desert of criticism. At some point, often during adolescence, we descend from the mountain of childlike faith and enter the critical world. We might label this world "high school" or, better yet, "college." Here we find that others do not share our faith. In fact, some openly disparage what we hold dear. We learn that the very idea of faith is thought by many to be childish or delusional. We may become skeptical, perhaps even cynical.<br><br>The desert of criticism is akin to being in the midst of a blinding sandstorm, where you are forced to lean into the wind and take one step at a time without a clear view of where you are going. Walking by faith becomes difficult. Some of our former beliefs cannot survive the desert of criticism.<br><br>Ricoeur did not malign the desert of criticism, for some childish beliefs are incorrect and should be abandoned. As the Apostle Paul says in his discourse on faith, hope, and charity, "When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when Ibecame a man, I put away childish things."<sup>9</sup><br><br>Furthermore, it is only in coming down from the mountain that we are able to enter into the world and engage others who are different from us. To a great extent this is where life is lived and where we can make a difference in the world. Some people never leave the desert of criticism, and in time the memory of their childlike faith may dim. After prolonged exposure to the desert of criticism, some even lose their faith altogether. Ricoeur maintained that once one has entered the desert of criticism, it is not possible to return to the mountain of childlike faith. It is a little like leaving Eden. Something has been lost; life and faith can never be quite so simple again.<sup>10</sup><br><br>But he held out the possibility of a third stage of religious faith. On the other side of the desert of criticism lies another mountain, not as tall as the mountain of childlike faith, with views that are not quite as clear and unobstructed. But we can, as Dr. Haught explained it, remove ourselves periodically from the desert of criticism and ascend this somewhat less majestic mountain. Ricoeur calls this possibility of a second faith "postcritical" naveté or a "second naveté."<sup>11</sup><br><br>Here the truths and realities of our childlike faith can be reaffirmed or revised. Although the view is not completely unimpeded, and the storms of the desert of criticism remain in view, and some of our childish beliefs may be left behind, we can emerge from the storm and reaffirm our faith. Our faith will not be as simple as it once was, but it need not be lost. In fact, I believe our faith may become more powerful than before, for it will have weathered and survived the assaults of the desert ofcriticism.<br><br>To me, postcritical naveté is a state in which both our hearts and our minds are open and we remain willing to experience childlike spiritual wonder; it is a place where we remain open to the promptings of the Holy Spirit. As Paul puts it, "Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be yechildren, but in understanding be men."<sup>12</sup><br><br>My father told me about an experience he had when he was roughly the age of most of you. As a young adult he was, in a sense, in the desert of criticism and found himself questioning his faith and the Church. One day he took out a pad of paper and made a list of his criticisms and doubts. He put the list in a drawer and forgot about it. Years later he found it again, and he was surprised that nearly every concern had been answered in his mind and in his heart. He reflected upon how different his life, and the lives of his posterity, would have been if he had followed his questions and concerns out of the Church.<br><br>One of my favorite stories that illustrates what faith and trust mean is the account of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. You recall the story. King Nebuchadnezzar commanded all his subjects to worship a golden image, and these three young men boldly refused. They were condemned to death by fire. The furnace was heated to seven times its normal strength and was so hot that the guards around it were consumed by the flames. As the three young men walked out of the fiery furnace, not a hair of their heads was singed, their coats were not burned, and they didn't even smell like smoke.<sup>13</sup> That's impressive.<br><br>But to me there is another aspect to the story that is even more impressive. When Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego addressed King Nebuchadnezzar before being thrown into the fire, they declared:<br><br><i>Our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.</i><br><br>But if not, <i>be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>The words that impress me are "but if not." I understand Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego to be saying that even if God, for His own reasons, does not intervene to save them, they will not question or doubt His power and goodness. Their trust in God is unequivocal.<sup>15</sup><br><br>Trust like that is not easy. Faith is not the power to bend God's will to ours, but rather the power to align our will with that of Heavenly Father.<br><br>God is mighty to save, but sometimes He does not intervene in the affairs of men. He allows mind-boggling evil and suffering in the world. He allows us to hurt each other in unimaginable ways. To me, more impressive than the fact that God could save Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego was that they could trust God, whatever the physical outcome of their being thrown into the fire.<sup>16</sup><br><br>In my experience, sometimes God gives us direction that is unmistakable and clear. But the answers to our prayers do not always come in the time frame and way we expect.<br><br>Perhaps you will indulge me another personal story. I had the dream of becoming a law professor even before I went to law school. In an abundance of caution, I applied to 10 schools and found myself in a fortunate situation, like you have, with a number of good choices.<br><br>I knew where I wanted to attend, but I decided to ask Heavenly Father. I prayed and pondered without receiving an answer. As the days turned to weeks, I'm sorry to say I grew impatient, annoyed, and perhaps even angry. "If I'm willing to do your will," I complained, "you could at least have the common courtesy to tell me what your will is."<br><br>After weeks had passed, I decided to make a more serious attempt. I climbed on my bicycle and rode to a quiet place beside a small river a few miles out of town. I spent the day on my knees with my scriptures and a notebook. Finally, as the shadows grew long, I gave up in frustration. I was pounding the pedals on my bicycle as I rode home. Gradually I calmed, and my cadence slowed. A thought entered my mind, at first faint, and then increasingly distinct: "Honor your priesthood and remember your covenants." I repeated this in my mind with the revolution of the bicycle pedals: "Honor your priesthood, remember your covenants. Honor your priesthood, remember your covenants."<br><br>I stopped my bike, looked up to heaven, and exclaimed, perhaps audibly, "You don't care where I go to law school! You want me to honor my priesthood and keep my covenants." As I spoke these words, I was flooded with the classic confirmation of the Holy Spirit, a combination of a shiver down my spine and a burning in my chest that was so strong I could hardly stand it.<br><br>So I went to the law school of my choice. During my years there, when I was tempted to think too much of myself or to be too caught up in the cares and preoccupations with which I was surrounded, I thought often, "Brett, honor your priesthood and remember your covenants." It was precisely the message I needed to keep me on track during those three years of law school. My prayers had been answered in a deeply meaningful--but entirely unexpected--way.<br><br>I have had the opposite experience as well, in which I was directed to a particular place. On those occasions, too, the answer was sometimes quite different than I expected.<br><h2><b>II. Hope</b></h2><br>A few words about hope. Hope is not just a positive attitude, a sunny disposition, or looking on the bright side of life. Hope is rooted in Jesus Christ and the prospect of being with Him back in the presence of God. Deep down, it is a surrender and a trust in God and His promises--that He, and they, are real. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego had hope, but not just that they would survive the fiery furnace. They also had confidence in God's plan.<br><br>Hope is neither ethereal nor wispy; it is an anchor for the soul. Hope is focused on the future and gives us the disciple's perspective that the current state of affairs will not last. Hope is not simply the truism "This too shall pass," helpful though that truism is.<sup>17</sup> Rather, hope is a quiet confidence about what shall come to pass--that Christ is mighty to save and that His grace is sufficient for us.<br><br>Perhaps the reason I am so drawn to the concepts of faith, hope, and charity is that even though I work hard and am reasonably diligent, sometimes I get discouraged or frustrated with my own limitations. For me there is comfort in the concept of hope, understood as a quiet confidence and belief that my best will be good enough and that Jesus Christ is there to carry me the rest of the way.<br><br>Maybe because I am a lawyer, one of my favorite descriptions of the Savior is that He is our Advocate. Both John and Mormon describe Jesus Christ as our Advocate with the Father.<sup>18</sup> And in the Doctrine and Covenants we read:<br><br><i>Listen to him who is the advocate with the Father, who is pleading your cause before him--</i><br><br><i>Saying: Father, behold the sufferings and death of him who did no sin, in whom thou wast well pleased. . . .</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, Father, spare these my brethren that believe on my name, that they may come unto me and have everlasting life.</i><sup>19</sup><br><br>Perhaps less familiar is the description of Satan, who is not our advocate but is rather our accuser. Revelations 12:10 says:<br><br><i>And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.</i><br><br>Isn't this description of Satan interesting? He accuses us before God both night and day. Lucifer is relentless in his desire to accuse and convict us before God.<sup>20</sup><br><br>In our own lives we often hear voices that tell us that we are not good enough and that we are unworthy or even unredeemable. Sometimes, and most dangerously, these voices come from within our own heads and hearts. I believe that these voices, external and internal, are often tools and messages of the adversary. If he can convince us that we are failures, or if he can persuade us that we are good for nothing, unloved, or unlovable, then he is succeeding in accomplishing his work and his glory, to bring to pass the death and eternal damnation of mankind.<sup>21</sup><br><br>Which voice will we heed--that of the Savior, whose message is that even when we stray or fail, His hand is outstretched still,<sup>22</sup> or that of Satan, whose aim is to make us miserable like unto himself?<sup>23</sup><br><br>Not only is the Savior our Advocate with theFather, pleading <i>for us,</i> but Jesus also pleads <i>with us </i>to keep His commandments so that we may enjoy the complete blessings of His Atonement:<br><br><i>Hearken, O ye people of my church, to whom the kingdom has been given; hearken ye and give ear. . . .</i><br><br><i>Listen to him who is the advocate with the Father, who is pleading your cause before him. . . .</i><br><br><i>Hearken, O ye people of my church, and ye elders listen together, and hear my voice while it is called today, and harden not your hearts.</i><sup>24</sup><br><br>For example, the passage in D&amp;amp;C 45 we just read, about Christ being our Advocate pleading <i>for us,</i> is bookended by Jesus pleading <i>with us</i> to hearken, give ear, hear His voice, and harden not our hearts.<sup>25</sup><br><h2><b>III. Charity</b></h2><br>Finally, charity. The importance of charity can scarcely be overstated. The Apostle Paul calls charity the greatest of all things<sup>26</sup> and says that without it we are nothing.<sup>27</sup> Mormon urges us to "cleave unto charity,"<sup>28</sup> and the Doctrine and Covenants instructs us to clothe ourselves in it.<sup>29</sup> Paul mentions charity 75 times and calls it "the end of the commandment,"<sup>30</sup> and John mentions it 30 times.<sup>31</sup> Amulek puts it starkly: "If ye do not remember to be charitable, ye are as dross, which the refiners do cast out, (it being of no worth) and is trodden under foot of men."<sup>32</sup><br><br>Perhaps picking up on the concept of the three degrees of glory, I like to think of three degrees of charity. The first involves how we listen, the second how we give, and the third how we love.<br><br><i>Charity in Listening</i><br><br>The first degree of charity involves the way we listen to and seek to understand others. Charity in this sense is often associated with being fair-minded and giving others the benefit of the doubt.<sup>33</sup><br><br>This sense of charity is captured in <i>The Oxford English Dictionary</i>'s definition of <i>charitable</i> as "inclined to think no evil of others, to put the most favourable construction on their actions."<sup>34</sup> This definition echoes Paul, who declares that charity "thinketh no evil."<sup>35</sup><br><br>The philosopher Eugene Garver has written thoughtfully about what it means to listen and understand with charity:<br><br><i>Discourse is always incomplete and always requires interpretation, filling in missing premises, understanding ambiguities, etc. Our rational reconstructions depend on charity because we are inevitably making choices in understanding another.</i><sup>36</sup><br><br>In striving to become charitable listeners, we may gain an increased appreciation for Mormon's observation that an essential component of charity is being "meek and lowly in heart."<sup>37</sup> It takes a certain measure of humility to strive to understand others rather than to construe them in a way that serves our purposes.<br><br>Consider Mormon's description of charity while focusing specifically on seeking to become a charitable listener:<br><br><i>And charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth.</i><sup>38</sup><br><br>This is an impressive road map of how we should listen to one another.<br><br><i>Charity in Giving</i><br><br>The second degree of charity involves the way we give to and seek to serve others. Charity in this sense is often associated with almsgiving<i>, </i>which can easily lead to a distorted understanding of what charity really means. The British have a phrase, "as cold as charity," which they use to describe the heart and attitude of charity given in a way that is condescending or self-righteous.<br><br>When we act with genuine charity, we seek to lift others up or to give them a boost, perhaps while we stay below.<sup>39</sup><br><br><i>Charity in Loving</i><br><br>The third degree of charity involves the way we care for and love others. Charity in this sense is celestial.<br><br>Perhaps the most moving definition of charity is found in Moroni. The prophet Mormon declared, "Charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him."<sup>40</sup><br><br>There seems to be a progression from the easier to the more difficult among the three degrees of charity. We cannot hope to have genuine charity if we are not charitable as listeners and givers. Not surprisingly, cultivating the "pure love of Christ" involves taking steps. We do not simply develop such love instantly; for most of us, it will be a lifelong process. Ultimately, it is a gift of God.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>In conclusion, I stand with Paul in declaring the centrality of faith, hope, and charity. In saying this, I am constrained to acknowledge that we often find most appealing those ideals that we recognize we fall short of ourselves. This is certainly true in this case with me.<br><br>Nevertheless, I do have faith. God is our Father and we are His children, with all that implies. I pray that the wind and dust in the desert of criticism will not blind us to the truths of the gospel and that we may seek and find our own postcritical naveté--a place where we can sing with wholehearted childlike amazement (as we have this morning):<br><br><i>Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee,</i><br><br><i>How great thou art! How great thou art!</i><sup>41</sup><br><br>I testify that Jesus Christ is the Savior and Redeemer of the world, and of you and even of me, and that He is mighty to save!<sup>42</sup><br><br>This faith gives me hope that Christ's Atonement is sufficient for us--for you and for me. I have hope that through the principles and ordinances of the gospel and by making and keeping covenants, we will be saved as "children of God: and if children, then heirs; ... joint-heirs with Christ."<sup>43</sup> I am grateful that our Savior is our Advocate with the Father, pleading <i>for</i> us, and also pleading <i>with</i> us, to come unto Him.<br><br>I testify that charity--Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ's pure love for us--is real. I pray that we may be blessed with a more abundant measure of charity in accordance with the work of our hands and the desires of our hearts.<br><br>Finally, I am grateful that "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."<sup>44</sup> In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Brett G. Scharffs was a BYU professor of law when this devotional address was given on 12 May 2009.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. 1 Corinthians 13:1–2, 13.<br><br>2. See Moroni 1:4.<br><br>3. See Moroni 7:20–48 (verses 20–39 discuss faith, 40–43 hope, and 44–48 charity).<br><br>4. Moroni 10:18, 20–21.<br><br>5. See 1 Corinthians 13:8.<br><br>6.

Haught, <i>The Cosmic Adventure: Science, Religion and the Quest for Purpose</i> (New York: Paulist Press, 1984), 94–95.<br><br>7.

I express my gratitude to Brent Bowles for helping me appreciate this aspect of this story. See Dennis E. Simmons, "But If Not ...," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2004, 73–75.<br><br>16. Many years ago I heard a story about a pioneer couple, and it deeply impressed me. They had joined the Church and, with their infant child, made the difficult trek to Utah. Their journey was treacherous, and along the way their only child died. Husband and wife were heartbroken, and neither would ever be the same again. But their responses to this tragedy were very different. The husband became hard, bitter, and angry with God and the Church, and he developed a heart of stone. His wife, on the other hand, became more empathetic to the suffering of others and developed a deep spirituality and trust in Heavenly Father. Her heart became tender and soft.<br><br>Perhaps this story made such an impression on me because I recognized in myself the capacity to respond to life in both of these ways. When confronted with disappointment or difficulty, I can become withdrawn and distant, I can turn inward, and I can feel my heart harden. But I have also taken the other road--perhaps the road less traveled--in which I respond with a softening of my heart. To me, this story represents the very different reactions we can have to the hard realities of life: we can remain in the desert of criticism, or we can seek a deeper faith--our own postcritical naveté.<br><br>17. In an address to the Wisconsin State Agricultural Society in 1859, Abraham Lincoln observed, "It is said an Eastern monarch once charged his wise men to invent him a sentence, to be ever in view, and which should be true and appropriate in all times and situations. They presented him the words: '<i>And this, too, shall pass away.</i>' How much it expresses! How chastening in the hour of pride!--how consoling in the depths of affliction!" (Address before the Wisconsin State Agricultural Society, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 30 September 1859; in <i>The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln</i>, ed. Roy P. Basler [New Brunswick, New Jersey: Rutgers University Press, 1953], 3:481–82).<br><br>18. See 1 John 2:1–2 and Moroni 7:28.<br><br>19. D&amp;amp;C 45:3–5<br><br>20. I express gratitude to Louis Pope for drawing my attention to the distinction between Jesus Christ the Advocate and Lucifer the accuser.<br><br>21. Compare Moses 1:39 with Moses 4:3–4.<br><br>22. See 2 Nephi 1:14–15 and Jacob 6:5.<br><br>23. See 2 Nephi 2:27.<br><br>24. D&amp;amp;C 45:1, 3, 6.<br><br>25. D&amp;amp;C 45:1 begins, "Hearken, O ye people of my church, to whom the kingdom has been given; hearken ye and give ear to him who laid the foundation of the earth." And in verse six, the verse following the passage about Jesus pleading our cause, Christ again pleads with us: "Hearken, O ye people of my church, and ye elders listen together, and hear my voice while it is called today, and harden not your hearts." We see something similar in Moroni's account of his father Mormon's words, in which Mormon pleads with us to "cleave unto every good thing" (Moroni 7:28) and teaches that Christ has said, "Repent all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me, and be baptized in my name, and have faith in me, that ye may be saved" (Moroni 7:34). The passage in 1 John describing Jesus as our Advocate with the Father is also followed with an admonition to keep the commandments (see 1 John 2:3–5).<br><br>26. See 1 Corinthians 13:13; see also Moroni 7:46.<br><br>27. See 1 Corinthians 13:2; see also Moroni 7:46.<br><br>28. Moroni 7:46.<br><br>29. See D&amp;amp;C 88:125.<br><br>30. 1 Timothy 1:5.<br><br>31. See, for example, 1 John 4:8; see also Ether 12:34.<br><br>32. Alma 34:29.<br><br>33. When listening with charity, we are not primarily concerned with ourselves and planning our response, but with seeking genuinely to understand. Being a generous listener reduces the distance between oneself and others.<br><br>34. <i>The Oxford English Dictionary,</i> s.v. "charitable." A related definition of <i>charity</i> in <i>The Oxford English Dictionary</i> is "A disposition to judge leniently and hopefully of the character, aims, and destinies of others, to make allowance for their apparent faults and shortcomings; large-heartedness. (But often it amounts barely to fair-mindedness towards people disapproved of or disliked, this being appraised as a magnanimous virtue.)" This sense is summed up as "fairness; equity" (s.v. "charity"). <i>Cruden's Dictionary of Bible Terms</i> includes this dimension of charity in its expansive definition of the term. "A person endued [with charity] does not interpret doubtful things to the worst sense, but the best; is sorry for the sins of others, but rejoices when any one does well, and is apt to bear with their failings and infirmities" (ed. Alexander Cruden [Grand Rapids, Michigan: Baker Book House: 1958], s.v. "charity").<br><br>35. 1 Corinthians 13:5.<br><br>36. Eugene Garver, "Why Should Anybody Listen? The Rhetoric of Religious Argument in Democracy," <i>Wake Forest Law Review </i>36, no.2 (2001): 378. Garver continues, "Like friendship, being trustworthy involves complicated relations between speaker and hearer" ("Why Should Anybody Listen?" 378). Thus, listening with charity involves not just the skillful use of techniques; rather it reflects a certain type of disposition or character. Indeed, the techniques may vary. For example, sometimes charity requires looking beyond the words spoken, while sometimes it requires taking words at face value. But the underlying attitude of the charitable listener will remain constant. Listening with charity will always involve generosity, trust, good faith, and being large-hearted and fair-minded.<br><br>37. Moroni 7:44.<br><br>38. Moroni 7:45.<br><br>39. It may be that because the modern ear associates the word <i>charity</i> with <i>almsgiving,</i> and because such giving often magnifies rather than reduces the differences between ourselves and others, that most modern translations of the New Testament render the Greek word <i>agape</i> as <i>love</i> rather than <i>charity</i> in order to avoid the minimalist, even negative, associations of <i>charity. The Encyclopedia Americana</i> notes, however, that "in the Middle Ages the Latin word <i>caritas,</i> from which charity is derived, was filled with the richest meanings of self-denial and self-sacrifice for the sake of others. It was only in the post-Reformation period that charity became identified with almsgiving. To the Reformers, giving alms was a pretended means of winning merit, and this led to the rejection of 'charity' in Biblical texts and hence in general religious usage among Protestants." Nevertheless, <i>The Encyclopedia Americana</i> continues, "the word is too rich in meaning to be abandoned: pure charity is the noblest of virtues" (International edition, s.v."charity").<br><br>40. Moroni 7:47. The LDS Bible Dictionary defines <i>charity</i> as "the highest, noblest, strongest kind of love, not merely affection; the pure love of Christ" (s.v. "charity," 632). To his disciples, Jesus said, "A new commandment Igive unto you, That ye love one another; as Ihave loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another" (John 13:34–35).<br><br>41. "How Great Thou Art," <i>Hymns, </i>1985, no.86.<br><br>42.

<h1> Making The Lord’s Way - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning, brothers and sisters. It's wonderful to be on this beautiful campus with you today. I thank President Samuelson for this opportunity, and I thank each of you for the great spirit you bring to this devotional this morning.<br><br>Today I'd like to consider one of the most basic tenets of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ--that of <i>agency</i>. Elder Richard G. Scott called agency "a <i>vital element</i> in our Father in Heaven's plan of happiness."<sup>1</sup> And Elder Robert D. Hales said, "Our use of agency determines who we are and what we will be."<sup>2</sup><br><br>While agency is a powerful, eternal principle, our approach to decision making can be considered its mortal embodiment. Agency, theability to make our own decisions, is a great blessing bestowed by a loving Heavenly Father on all His sons and daughters. In 2Nephi we read:<br><br><i>Therefore, cheer up your hearts, and remember that ye are free to act for yourselves--to choose the way of everlasting death or the way of eternal life.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>Choice is inevitably accompanied by opposing forces. Opposition is, in fact, the veryessence of choice. Today I'd like to focus my remarks on some of the principles and processes of righteous decision making.<br><h2><b>"The Valley of Decision"</b></h2><br>In the last chapter of Joel in the Old Testament, we read of a place called "the valley of decision,"<sup>4</sup> a place where multitudes of people will be gathered to prepare for and await the Lord's Second Coming. I like the powerful imagery of the phrase "the valley of decision" because Isee it as analogous to the young adult stage of life--the current stage oflife of the majority of you in this audience.<br><br>Most of you have already made the wise decision to further your education, but you may now be choosing what to study, what classes to take, and what career path to pursue. You may have had your roommates assigned to you, but you have the choice of whom to spend time with and how to spend your time. Hopefully you young men are considering serving a mission, or, if you have already served, you are choosing to maintain the righteous habits you acquired on your mission. And I suspect more than a few of you are deciding whom to date and even whom to marry and when. The list of decisions you each face goes on and on.<br><br>At this busy intersection of adolescence and adulthood, you are experiencing one of the highest per-diem decision rates you will ever face in mortality! If you learn to make decisions according to the Lord's process, you will form one of the habits most critical to both your earthly and your eternal success.<br><h2><b>The Process of Making Decisions</b></h2><br>Let's for a moment reflect on the most basic elements of the decision-making process. When we are presented with a choice, our perspective and our attitude combine to largely determine the course of action we will pursue--or, in other words, the decision we will make.<br><br>Now, for discussion's sake, let's simplify our decision-making processes into two broad categories: making decisions the Lord's way versus making decisions the world's way.<br><br>We'll begin with a closer examination of the world's way. Let's use the example of choosing a career path as our choice or decision to be made and assume two possible outcomes, option A and option B.<br><br>The world's perspective on such a significant decision would certainly consider financial ramifications, potential for prestige and power, and ease of acquisition. And a worldly attitude might include such things as self-centeredness, a sense of entitlement, and even political correctness as major factors in choosing between options A or B.<br><br>Working together, the influences of perspective and attitude will largely determine the decision we make or, in this example, which career path we choose. The result of following the world's process of decision making in selecting a career would greatly favor certain professions over others.<br><br>In contrast, let's now take a closer look at making decisions the Lord's way. We'll begin with the same choice of which career path to follow, but, since we know that all things are spiritual to the Lord,<sup>5</sup> we'll consider a spiritual perspective and a spiritual attitude inthisprocess.<br><br>A spiritual perspective would, first and foremost, consider eternity, it would be rooted in gospel principles, and it would allow for a quality journey. And a spiritual attitude would be infused with humility, gratitude, and faith. For example, opportunities to provide service to others, to strengthen one's family, and to spend meaningful time in Church callings would all be considered in the Lord's process. When a spiritual perspective and a spiritual attitude are factored into a major decision, such as the choice of a career, the resulting action might well be quite different than that resulting from following a worldly decision-making process.<br><br>Now, let's superimpose one of my favorite scriptures over this decision-making process. Proverbs 3:5–6 reads:<br><br><i>Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</i><br><br><i>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</i><br><br>Using this scripture, we can subtitle the world's approach to decision making "leaning to thine own understanding." Our own understanding is imperfect. We cannot see the future, nor can we see our ultimate potential, but when we follow the world's process, we rely on that understanding anyway.<br><br>Similarly, using this scripture, we can subtitle the Lord's approach to decision making "trusting in the Lord." The Lord does see the future, and only He knows our divine potential--thus this approach requires trusting the Lord. C. S. Lewis described this great truth when he likened our lives to a house undergoing renovations:<br><br><i>At first, perhaps,</i> <i>you</i> <i>can understand what</i> [God] <i>is doing. He is getting the drains right and stopping the leaks in the roof. . . . But presently He starts knocking the house about in a way that . . . does not seem to make sense. . . . He is building quite a different house from the one</i> <i>you</i> <i>thought of. . . . You</i> <i>thought you</i> <i>were going to be made into a decent little cottage: but He is building a palace.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>Therein lies the key reason we need to make decisions by following the Lord's process: He is building a palace far beyond our wildest plans. Mormon summarized the difference between making decisions in the world's way versus the Lord's way when he noted:<br><br><i>And thus we can behold how false, and also the unsteadiness of the hearts of the children of men; yea, we can see that the Lord in his great infinite goodness doth bless and prosper those who put their trust in him.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>Left to our own understanding, we are unintentionally false and unsteady. But through trusting in the Lord with humility, gratitude, and faith, we are blessed and we prosper. If we trust in the Lord and acknowledge Him, not only will He "direct [our] paths," but He will also ensure that "then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble,"<sup>8</sup> and that "her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace."<sup>9</sup><br><h2><b>Scriptural Examples of Righteous DecisionMaking</b></h2><br>The scriptures are filled with examples of wise men and women trusting in the Lord and following His process of decision making. Keeping in mind those three important components of a righteous spiritual attitude--humility, gratitude, and faith--let's take a closer look at some of those examples.<br><br>In Genesis we read the amazing story of Joseph of Egypt, whom the Lord prospered because of his righteousness.<sup>10</sup> In spite of being sold into slavery by his own flesh and blood, Joseph trusted in the Lord. He did not follow the world's process of decision making; rather, he remained fully committed to making decisions in the Lord's way. For example, when repeatedly presented with seductive choices by Potipher's wife, he retained a spiritual perspective and attitude.<br><br>And when he interpreted the butler's and baker's dreams in prison, Joseph humbly stated that "interpretations belong to God"<sup>11</sup> rather than taking the credit for himself. Later, after several more years of separation from his family, Joseph gratefully rejoiced that God "hath made me forget all my toil"<sup>12</sup> and "hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction."<sup>13</sup> Joseph retained his great faith throughout his epic ordeal. When finally reunited with his starving family, he acknowledged the Lord's hand, saying, "God did send me before you to preserve life."<sup>14</sup> What an excellent example of trusting in the Lord and maintaining a consistently spiritual perspective and attitude.<br><br>In addition to Joseph, consider the stories of Ruth, Job, Esther, Nephi, and so many others; these courageous men and women trusted in the Lord with humility, gratitude, and faith. Faced with life-altering circumstances and decisions, they chose to trust in the Lord rather than lean unto their own understanding. By so doing, they were blessed with safety and peace, just as we will be.<br><br>Following the Lord's process of decision making results in consistently and powerfully righteous decisions. And that pattern of righteous decision making in turn develops our character. Elder Scott explained the relationship between making decisions the Lord's way and forming righteous character. He said:<br><br><i>Character is woven quietly from the threads of hundreds of correct decisions (like practice sessions). When strengthened by obedience and worthy acts, correct decisions form a fabric of character that brings victory in time of great need. </i><br><br><i>Righteous character provides the foundation of spiritual strength that enables you to make difficult, extremely important decisions correctly when they seem overpowering.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>Building our character is certainly part of the Lord's process of building us into a palace. Trusting in the Lord actually becomes an upward spiral: when we trust in the Lord, our faith and character are strengthened, and the stronger our character and the deeper our faith, the better we are able to trust in the Lord, and so on, which all results in better decision making.<br><br>This was certainly the case with Nephi in the opening scenes of the Book of Mormon. From the very first verse, we have evidence of Nephi's righteous spiritual attitude and of his humility, gratitude, and faith: "I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, . . . having seen many afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days."<sup>16</sup><br><br>In the following pages, Nephi is faced with many critical decisions: Should he follow his father in fleeing Jerusalem? Should he believe his father's prophecies of the imminent destruction of the Jews? We know he had "great desires to know of the mysteries of God." In other words, he had a desire to know God's will for him, and that desire led to action--he "did cry unto the Lord,"<sup>17</sup> and the Lord visited him, softening his heart and teaching him to believe the words of his father.<br><br>This proved to be an important character-building exercise because an even tougher decision lay directly ahead: should Nephi follow his father's counsel to return to Jerusalem to obtain the brass plates in spite of the inherent dangers and his brothers' unwillingness? We probably all know Nephi's faith-filled reply by heart:<br><br><i>I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>Elder Scott described this type of motivating faith as follows:<br><br><i>Motivating faith is centered in trust in the Lord and in His willingness to answer your needs. . . . The consistent, willing exercise of faith increases your confidence and ability to employ the power of faith.</i><sup>19</sup><br><br>Again we see the upward spiral that results from having a spiritual perspective: the stronger our faith, the more we are able to trust in the Lord, and the better the decisions we will make.<br><br>The scriptures and the lives and experiences of modern-day prophets are filled with excellent examples of making decisions the Lord's way. I urge you to study the scriptures with a focus on searching these out. The lessons we learn from the scriptures will strengthen us and fortify our determination to seek the Lord's will in our own lives as well.<br><h2><b>A Personal Example</b></h2><br>I am very fortunate to have had opportunities at your age to improve my decision-making abilities. It may surprise you to learn that I struggled with the decision of whether or not to serve a mission. I was young for my grade, so all my friends left on their missions nearly a full year before I was eligible to go. By that time I was quite comfortable in my studies, and I was dating a young woman whom I thought was "just right." I was a novice at trusting the Lord. I will be forever grateful for the wise counsel of my father and bishop at that critical crossroads. Their loving guidance helped me see the inadequacy of leaning on my own understanding, and I began the upward spiral of trusting the Lord.<br><br>By the time I met Margaret following my mission to Scotland, I had added depth and breadth to my spiritual attitude and spiritual perspective. Experience had made trusting in the Lord much easier for me, and I knew right away the correct answers to the questions "Whom should I marry and when?"<br><br>Together Margaret and I have made following the Lord's process for decision making a habit. I testify to you that one of the great blessings of forming this habit as a young adult is that in later years, the Lord will know He can trust you to respond to the directions of His Spirit.<br><br>Not all decisions are anticipated the way choosing what to study or whom to date might be. We aren't necessarily given a road map of the hard choices that we will encounter. Margaret and I came upon just such a decision a few years ago--one that required great trust in the Lord and great faith in responding to the directions of His Spirit.<br><br>Before leaving to preside over the England London Mission in the summer of 2000, we prayerfully decided to sell our family home and retire from my career. However, three years later, near the end of our mission, we felt strong promptings to change our plans and return to Boston. Due to our earlier decision, we needed to find a place to live.<br><br>After an extensive search we purchased a small home that was just right for the two of us located about a mile from where we had lived for over 20 years. We moved in and immediately went to work renovating and improving it like we had done to prior homes several times before. For the next eight months we lived there comfortably.<br><br>Then, one Sunday afternoon, I received a strong impression from the Spirit that we needed to move. I was shocked by this prompting. Another move was not in our plans, and it made absolutely no sense. Yet I knew I had been told that we needed to move.<br><br>Later that day I drove down the street we had lived on for so many years before our mission. I hadn't been on that street in nearly four years--not since we had sold our home there. But as I followed the gentle guidance of the Spirit, I noticed a nice home across the street from the home we had raised our family in. It had a "for sale" sign out in front. The thought quickly crossed my mind, "I wonder if that is the house the Lord wants us to buy."<br><br>For two weeks I pondered the clear impression I'd had, wondering why we needed to move. Unable to make sense of it, but trusting in the Lord with humility, gratitude, and faith, I concluded I just needed to act upon the prompting, and so I finally told Margaret what had happened. She, too, was shocked, but we both felt we should do as the Spirit had prompted, so we put our home on the market and prepared to move.<br><br>After a few days of house hunting, we knew that the house across the street from our previous home was indeed the one we should buy. Now, if you knew the Boston housing market, especially at that time, you would have known as I did that this was not likely to be a wise financial decision! We had been in our other home for less than a year, and now we were selling it and buying a home larger than we needed, but we felt strongly prompted that it was what the Lord wanted us to do. We were grateful for the Lord's guidance, even though we did not understand it.<br><br>The day after we moved, Margaret walked next door to visit Barbara, the elderly neighbor she had been acquainted with when we had lived on this street before. She knew Barbara had been raised in the Church but had become inactive when she went away to college. She hadn't been back to church in over 60 years, and in all the years we had been neighbors previously, Barbara had seemed uninterested in the gospel. When Margaret entered Barbara's kitchen that morning, Barbara threw her arms around Margaret and immediately began telling her about her 40-year-old daughter, Karen. Karen was dying of stomach cancer, and she and her husband were now living with Barbara so Barbara could help with Karen's care. Before Margaret could even think, the words came out of her mouth: "Barbara, do you think that Karen would like a priesthood blessing?" Without hesitating Barbara said, "Yes, I know that she would."<br><br>The next day a close friend from the ward joined me, and we gave Karen a priesthood blessing. It was then that Margaret and I began to understand why the Lord needed us to buy the house next door to Barbara and her daughter, Karen. Living a mile away would not have been sufficient for what the Lord needed us to do. Our trust in the Lord had created an amazing opportunity and blessing for us.<br><br>Within a week, we started sharing the gospel with Karen. We visited with her almost daily, teaching her and comforting her and her mother in any way we could. Karen started attending Church with us and loved the people in the ward and everything she was learning. She felt like she was coming home! Within a couple of months she was baptized.<br><br>Karen said that the day she was baptized was the happiest day of her life. Even though she only lived three months after her baptism, she felt such great joy and happiness and peace from the Lord. Even in her pain and misery, she felt the Lord's arms around her as she neared the end of mortality. Those last few months of her life were truly a gift from the Lord.<br><br>We felt a little like Joseph of Egypt, trusting in the Lord though we didn't completely understand His plan. We didn't save an entire region from physical starvation, but, with His help, we did help feed a small family struggling with spiritual hunger at a critical time in their lives. That experience provided a capstone to all we had previously learned of trusting in the Lord.<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell summarized beautifully the blessings of habitually trusting in the Lord:<br><br><i>Your personal possibilities, not for status and position but for service to God and mankind, are immense, if you will but trust the Lord to lead you from what you are to what you have the power to become. . . . </i><br><br><i>. . . If you are righteous, his purposes will be served.</i><sup>20</sup><br><br>Remember, each of us can choose to trust in the Lord, letting Him develop us into a palace rather than settling to become a cottage. And what better time to commit to developing the habit of following the Lord's process of decision making and learning to trust in Him than during this critical period of young adulthood, full of frequent and significant decision-making opportunities. If we can shift from the world's way of making decisions to the Lord's way, our paths will be safe and peaceful and our destination divine.<br><br>I testify that the Lord's promise is sure:<br><br><i>Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</i><br><br><i>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</i><br><br>Rather than focusing on ease and prestige, may we concentrate on eternal considerations as we make life's daily decisions. I pray that we will be able to replace feelings of self-centeredness, entitlement, and political correctness with an attitude of humility, gratitude, and faith through righteous obedience to God's commandments. Like Saul on the road to Damascus, may we ask, "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?"<sup>21</sup><br><br>I have a deep and abiding testimony, brothers and sisters, of the sanctity of agency. Our free will is literally the only thing that is truly ours; therefore, the ultimate consecration is in yielding ourselves to God.<sup>22</sup> I pray that as we seek to know the Lord's will for us and as we humbly and gratefully make decisions in His way, we will feel strengthened and enhanced, faithfully contributing to the building up of His kingdom, and that we will enjoy His promised peace in the process. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Steven C. Wheelwright was president of BYU–Hawaii when this devotional address was given on 26 May 2009.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. Richard G.

<h1>e of Becoming - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I'm very humbled to be here today. First, I would like to say how much BYU means to my family and me. My father's formal education only went through the eighth grade. But he knew how much education meant--four of his six children graduated from BYU, and two of our children also have degrees here, as well as a son-in-law and daughter-in-law. Having been born and raised in Provo, I have always loved this campus and the events that take place here that have been part of my life. As a young man I never imagined having the opportunity to finish my working career at BYU. However, after being here for the past 25 years, my feelings are even deeper for everything Brigham Young University represents. Words aren't strong enough to express my gratitude to a man named Bill Hays for inviting me to be on this campus and to those whom I've had the opportunity to work with since.<br><br>I have chosen to speak today on the cycle of becoming, which describes our progress in this life and, eventually, the kingdom that we'll choose--one that our Father in Heaven has prepared for us. The three parts of the cycle are learning or knowledge; doing or, in some cases, not doing; and becoming.<br><br>We've been taught that at some point in our premortal lives, our Father in Heaven presented a plan that would make it possible for us to move beyond what we had become. It seems that the cycle, or some parts of it, had included us having knowledge of our Father in Heaven's plan and our relationship with our Elder Brother as our Savior. We had done the things necessary to prepare us to move to the next stage--becoming mortal. Faith would have been part of the decision-making process in that premortal life. The things we would experience in mortality had to be accepted on faith. Most important of all, we had to accept the fact that once we left God's presence, we could not return without the help of the Savior. Our faith had to also be centered in Jesus Christ and His ability to take us back to our Father in Heaven's kingdom.<br><h2><b>Knowledge</b></h2><br>Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on how you look at it) when we came to earth, the knowledge part of the cycle got erased, and we had to start that part over. The Bible Dictonary defines <i>knowledge</i> as follows:<br><br><i>One of the attributes of God (Isa. 46:9–10; Acts 15:18; 2 Ne. 9:20). Knowledge of divine and spiritual things is absolutely essential for one's salvation; hence the gospel is to be taught to every soul. "How shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?" (Rom. 10:14). Knowledge is not obtained all at once, even by revelation, but line upon line, precept upon precept (Isa. 28:9–10).</i> [Bible Dictionary, s.v. "knowledge," 721]<br><br>President Boyd K. Packer said the following about this process:<br><br><i>Things that grow slowly live longer. You will find that you will acquire the gospel "line upon line, precept upon precept" (2 Ne. 28:30; D&amp;amp;C 98:12; 128:21; see also Isa. 28:10,</i> <i>13). You may grow more slowly in mind and spirit, but you will learn and your learning will stay with you</i>." ["Some Things Every Missionary Should Know,"<i> Seminar for New Mission Presidents--</i>2002 (26 June), 6]<br><br>The Bible Dictionary continues:<br><br><i>The scriptures, and also living prophets, are given so that the people might have knowledge of things of God and "know how to worship, and know what you worship" (cf. D&amp;amp;C 93:19). Knowledge is one of the endowments of the Holy Ghost (John 14:26; 16:13; D&amp;amp;C 34:10; 121: 26–33) and one of the gifts of the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:8; Moro. 10:10; D&amp;amp;C 46:18).</i><br><br>President Packer also said:<br><br><i>The basic foundation of knowledge and testimony never changes--the testimony that God the Father lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that the Holy Ghost inspires us, that there has been a restoration, that the fulness of the gospel and the same organization that existed in the primitive church have been revealed to us. Those things are taught everywhere and always--in our classes, the scriptures, the handbooks and the manuals--in everything we do.</i><br><br><i>The fundamental doctrine and instructions on the organization of the Church are likewise found in the scriptures. In addition, there is another source of knowledge relating to what makes the Church work: We learn from experience and observation.</i> ["The Unwritten Order of Things," BYU devotional address, 15 October 1996]<br><br>At the same time we're working on the knowledge part of our eternal cycle, we have this cycle within a cycle going on in which we are trying to get educated through "experience and observation," as President Packer described, so that we can have the knowledge base to do things that will fulfill temporal needs and aspirations. Your academic knowledge will allow you to become, hopefully, engineers, doctors, nurses, lawyers, teachers, counselors, artists, etc. I can tell you as a parent that through your educational experience, regardless of what avenue you pursue, one of the things that your parents want you to become is employed.<br><br>This cycle of learning, doing, and becoming is literally going on in some micro or miniature form every day of our lives. That's how we've become who we are today. The question then becomes "Are we where we're supposed to be in becoming who we told our Heavenly Parents we would become?"<br><br>That's somewhat easier to measure from a temporal perspective than it is from a spiritual. From an academic perspective, you know where you are in school and how much you have left to do before you can graduate. There are systems put in place to help you measure your progress in entering whatever professional career you're pursuing. One purpose of academics is to assist you in gaining positions in this life that will allow you to provide for yourself and your family.<br><h2><b>Doing and Not Doing</b></h2><br>The second part of the cycle, in an ideal situation, would be the wise use of our knowledge by doing things that keep us moving along life's path both temporally and spiritually. This is often the tough part. In our premortal lives I would think that our knowledge was more complete, but there were certain things we couldn't do without a mortal body. In this life, with our somewhat limited knowledge, we often reach a point where we must make choices to do or not do things that meet immediate and long-term wants or needs. These choices, and what we do with them, shape our lives and define who we are and who we will become. Many of us know by firsthand experience that it's not always easy to do the right thing every time.<br><br>To illustrate this, here are two stories of young men in different centuries who answered a call from a prophet. The first happened in 1856. Most of you have heard this story about the last of the handcart companies coming west. The Martin and Willie group was in desperate trouble because of a late start and an early winter. President Brigham Young put out a call in general conference for men to gather their wagons, supplies, and teams and go and rescue these people. As part of those that left, three young men, all 18 years old, answered the call.<br><br><i>Three eighteen-year-old boys belonging to the relief party came to the rescue and to the astonishment of all who saw, carried nearly every member of that ill-fated handcart company across the snowbound stream. The strain was so terrible, and the exposure so great, that in later years all the boys died from the effects of it. When President Brigham Young heard of this heroic act, he wept like a child, and later declared publicly, "That act alone will ensure C. Allen Huntington, George W. Grant and David P. Kimball an everlasting salvation in the Celestial Kingdom of God, worlds without end.</i>" [Solomon F. Kimball, "Belated Emigrants of 1856," <i>Improvement Era,</i> February 1914; also in LeRoy R. Hafen and Ann W. Hafen, <i>Handcarts to Zion</i> (Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, 1960), 132–33]<br><br>Now, fast forward to several years ago and consider three young men who also answered a call from the prophet at approximately the same age of 19 years and came to the Missionary Training Center as missionaries. For some reason they couldn't quite grasp why they were there and immediately started having problems. As their branch president, Ireceived reports that they were causing problems in their classes and doing other inappropriate things. Although they were companions, I met with each of them individually, discussed these problems, and challenged them to remember who they were and who they represented and, if nothing else, to simply look at the Savior's name on their badges on a regular basis as a reminder. A week later I received a report that things had not improved. So on a Sunday I met with them again and went over what was and wasn't appropriate. That same day they went back to their room and played what turned out to be a very inappropriate prank on another missionary, which led to more serious consequences. At this point, the decision from Church headquarters in Salt Lake City was that they apparently were not ready to be representatives of the Church and needed to go home.<br><br>In both cases, three young men had answered a call, but each set chose to take different routes. What was the difference? Two of the words that come to mind are <i>agency</i> and <i>perspective.</i> I'm guessing that each of us can find examples in our own lives in which opportunities have been given us, and, in looking back, we can see either that we utilized them and growth took place or that we missed out and paid the price for not following our conscience.<br><br>In my own case, on an even more personal note, a few years ago I was preparing some rooms in our house to be painted. I was going through the living room patching nail holes. There was a dent in the ceiling above the entryway. That house had a split entry, so the ceiling was a floor and a half from the entry landing. I got my six-foot ladder and put it on the landing, assuming that it would be high enough. I took my perfatape mud and putty knife and climbed up the ladder. When I reached the top platform, I read printed on the ladder "This is not a step." Now, I was sure that did not apply to me, and I climbed up. (You know where this is going, don't you?) I stood on top of the ladder and reached as far as I could, fully extended. Just as I filled the hole with the first pass of the putty knife, the ladder tipped and I crashed to the floor--not the landing, but the basement floor. Now, the ladder is six feet tall, and I'm over six feet tall. There are some five steps to the basement, so my head was more than 16 feet from the basement floor.<br><br>When I crashed, Linda and our daughter rushed to see what had happened. I was lying there, not able to breathe because the wind had been knocked out of me. They kept asking if Iwas all right. Finally I caught my breath and told them I thought I was okay. I was hurting but could get up. They insisted I go to the emergency room. When the doctors checked me, they found that I had two cracked vertebrae, a cracked rib, and some bruises. Other than that I was okay. I knew I had been blessed because I could have broken my neck or my back.<br><br>When my wife called one of our daughters that evening to tell her about the accident, she repeated it for our granddaughter, and my granddaughter said, "Tell grandpa what he always told his kids when they were growing up." My wife said, "What's that?" She said, "When you've got a dumb head, the whole body suffers." She was absolutely right, and my words came back to me because my whole body was suffering.<br><br>Maybe you can think of dumb things that have happened in your lives that may or may not have led to your whole physical body suffering. But is our spiritual body suffering because of poor choices, missed opportunities, and unrepented transgressions?<br><br>We often know more than we choose to do. As we mature, our goal should be to find wisdom in the application of the knowledge we are gaining along the way. The proper use of our knowledge is how we demonstrate wisdom. Making choices that lead to doing things that keep us on the eternal path to becoming what our Heavenly Father wants us to become must be part of our daily quest. Marion G. Romney said:<br><br><i>Since knowledge is </i>[according to Webster's dictionary]<i> an "acquaintance with, or clear perception of, facts"; and "wisdom is the capacity of judging soundly and dealing broadly with facts; especially in their practical" application "to life and conduct," it follows that wisdom ... is nevertheless a product of, and is dependent upon knowledge.</i><br><br><i>... Thus, as God's perfect wisdom is a product of His knowledge of all things, so man's wisdom is dependent upon his knowledge</i>. ["<a href="https://www.lds.org/liahona/1983/10/converting-knowledge-into-wisdom?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Converting Knowledge into Wisdom</a>," <i>Ensign, </i>July 1983, 5]<br><br>As we consider our daily wants and needs as mentioned earlier, we must find ways to be guided along the right path. On the one hand, we're told, "It is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant; wherefore he receiveth no reward." (D&amp;amp;C 58:26). On the other hand, we need help in keeping an eternal perspective. How do we get and keep this eternal perspective? It starts with the basic things we hear on a regular basis. Daily prayer and scripture study are absolute musts. In my various ecclesiastical callings, I've never worked with anyone who had lost their testimony or fallen away while they were praying and studying the scriptures on a daily basis.<br><br>At the MTC we often discussed doing things that lead to becoming a true disciple of Jesus Christ. My approach in teaching that was one Icalled "living above the line." I would explain that there is a gumption trap some fall into regarding minimums and maximums in life. You as students are very familiar with it. When you begin a class, your professor explains what the requirements are to pass and what level of performance you'll need to earn each grade. In many cases the grade that you decide you want or need as defined by the professor represents the minimum you can do. If that's your main focus or objective for the class, then that minimum level becomes your maximum effort.<br><br>I would challenge the missionaries to not get caught up in the minimum and maximum lines. As a true disciple of the Savior, you wouldn't have to be reminded about the rules in the little white missionary handbook. You wouldn't need to be reminded to get up at a certain time, to pray and study each day, and to seek the Spirit for guidance. You wouldn't even need to be reminded to be nice to your companion. All of those things would be the natural consequences of becoming a disciple of Christ. Access to the Spirit is much more available "above the line." Your life can then leave the daily checklists of things you cannot do and things you should be doing and move into the realm of doing the "right" thing.<br><br>In referring to these basic commandments, Elder Neal A. Maxwell described the "thou shalt not" commandments as the "misery prevention" ones (my title for those would be the "dumb head, body suffers" commandments):<br><br><i>Then the major focus falls upon the "thou shalt" commandments. It is the keeping of the "thou shalt" commandments that brings even greater happiness.</i> ["<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/neal-a-maxwell_pathway-discipleship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Pathway of Discipleship</a>," BYU devotional, 4 January 1998]<br><br>Your efforts will be blessed in your schooling, your work, your activities, and, most importantly, your relationships with those around you and, ultimately, the Savior Jesus Christ andyour Father in Heaven.<br><br>When our son was 11 years old, I was serving in a bishopric. There was an annual hike taking place with many of the Scouting age Young Men and some Young Women in this area called the 50/20 that was established, I think, to help with some of the Scouting program's hiking requirements. It was held in the fall, and the idea was that you would hike 50 miles in under 20 hours. It started at the This Is the Place Monument on the east side of Salt Lake City and traveled south to Provo, finishing at a park on Fifth West and Center Street.<br><br>Many of the Young Men in our ward had participated the year before and were going to do it again. I asked my son if he would like to try it, even though I thought that at 11 years old, he might not be ready. He said he wanted to go. I talked with others who had done it and was told that it was critical to bring fluids and nourishment and to take care of your feet with adequate padding, changes of socks, and good shoes. The hike started at six in the evening and went throughout the night so that there was less traffic on the roads.<br><br>The first half of the hike went pretty well, except for the fact that I couldn't get him to drink and eat enough. Several hours after midnight we reached the top of the Point of the Mountain, approximately halfway. He was pretty tired and worn out. There are many that only make it halfway, so I told him we could make that the end of our hike and just go home. As he watched some of the older boys arrive after us and could see that they were every bit as tired as he was, he realized that they were not quitting. So after some hot chocolate and nourishment, I asked him what he wanted to do. He said, "Let's keep going." Iasked him if he was sure, knowing that he had never even stayed up all night, let alone hiked that far. He said, "Yes."<br><br>We made it down the south side of the point of the mountain, and it was obvious he was tiring very quickly. As we walked the old highway through Lehi in the darkest part of the night, I looked down and saw that tears were running down his cheeks and that he was just barely moving his feet. I asked him if he wanted to quit and go home. He wouldn't answer. Knowing he's as stubborn as his father, I just put my arm around his shoulders and walked in silence for a while.<br><br>Then I said, "Jason, I can make you a promise. This is the hardest part of the hike. It's the darkest part of the night, and your body knows you should be in bed. But here's what I've learned after working some graveyard shifts. If you want to keep going, there's a fast-food place down the road. We will stop there and have a hot breakfast. About that time the sun should be coming up. There's something about the sun coming up after being up all night that gives us new life. I promise you that the hot breakfast and the sun coming up will give you new energy to finish the hike if you want to."<br><br>No answer. He just kept shuffling along. When we got to the drive-in, we ordered breakfast. After we ate and noticed the sun coming up, I said, "How do you feel?"<br><br>He said, "Let's go, Dad." We took off, and Icould hardly keep up with him. We finished in just under 18 hours. The next year, when the opportunity came again, he signed up, knowing he could do it. It was every bit as hard, but he knew what to expect.<br><br>I've thought back on our experience many times since. My hope at the time was that he would also look back on that when things got tough, particularly on his mission or at other times, and know that the sun will eventually come up, new life will be given, and you'll get where you need to go if you'll keep going.<br><br>We all have times when it seems like the night will never end. It's dark all around, and we don't know for sure how far we have yet to go. Those are the times that we can feel the Savior walking beside us with His loving arm around our shoulder, encouraging us to keep going.<br><br>President Dieter F. Uchtdorf said this in our recent April conference:<br><br><i>Discipleship is a journey. We need the refining lessons of the journey to craft our character and purify our hearts. By patiently walking in the path of discipleship, we demonstrate to ourselves the measure of our faith and our willingness to accept God's will rather than ours.</i> ["<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2009/05/the-way-of-the-disciple?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Way of the Disciple</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2009, 76]<br><br>What if we're not as far along the path of discipleship as we think we should be or if we've gotten off the path and now feel we can't become who we're supposed to be? Maybe we've disappointed ourselves or those who love us. Before we came to earth we knew with a surety that the Savior would take care of all of our shortcomings. Now we can find that same assurance through the process of becoming. It doesn't matter where we are--it only matters that we are moving along the path and making our best effort. Again, this is a step-by-step process and a lifelong journey.<br><br>Daily scripture study and prayer to find out your Heavenly Father's will for your life will lead to a softer heart that can be influenced by the Spirit. That Spirit will prompt us to repent of those things holding us back from becoming and progressing. What a great blessing we have every week to be able to take a broken heart and contrite spirit to sacrament meeting. Partake of the sacrament worthily and you will be as clean as if you were just baptized, and you will be under the influence of the Spirit for the next thing you need to learn and do. Be worthy for the companionship of the Holy Ghost. Life can be challenging enough by itself. Don't try to go it alone.<br><br>Now, where can we go to learn about this cycle in the most profound way? In our most recent general conference, we were reminded several times of the importance of finding ways to get to the temple on a regular basis--not just to attend but also to engage in actual temple worship.<br><br>This is where we can go and, by performing work for others, be taught all that we need to know regarding who we are. Elder Russell M. Nelson said this about the temple:<br><br><i>Each temple is a house of learning. There we are taught in the Master's way. His way differs from modes of others. His way is ancient and rich with symbolism. We can learn much by pondering the reality for which each symbol stands. Teachings of the temple are beautifully simple and simply beautiful. They are understood by the humble, yet they can excite the intellect of the brightest minds.</i> ["<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2001/05/personal-preparation-for-temple-blessings?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Personal Preparation for Temple Blessings</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2001, 33]<br><br>Because temples are nearby for many of us, we need to find ways to get there as often as we can. We need to take the opportunity to experience all of the ordinances by rotating our temple experience and, as Elder Richard G. Scott said in our last general conference, by "listen[ing] carefully to the presentation of each element of the ordinance with an open mind and heart" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/liahona/2009/05/temple-worship-the-source-of-strength-and-power-in-times-of-need.p1?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Temple Worship: The Source of Strength and Power in Times of Need</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2009, 43).<br><br>In D&amp;amp;C 109, we read the Kirtland Temple dedicatory prayer and learn some of the blessings of temple attendance:<br><br><i>And that they may grow up in thee, and receive a fulness of the Holy Ghost, and be organized according to thy laws, and be prepared to obtain every needful thing;...</i><br><br><i>And when thy people transgress, any of them, they may speedily repent and return unto thee, and find favor in thy sight, and be restored to the blessings which thou hast ordained to be poured out upon those who shall reverence thee in thy house.</i><br><br><i>And we ask thee, Holy Father, that thy servants may go forth from this house armed with thy power, and that thy name may be upon them, and thy glory be round about them, and thine angels have charge over them.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 109:15, 21–22]<br><h2><b>Becoming</b></h2><br>In conclusion, the final part of the cycle is that of becoming. Regarding the temporal or vocational stage of our lives, Elder Russell M. Nelson referred to this concept of becoming when he spoke at BYU's commencement exercises on April 23, 2009. He called a chosen occupation<br><br><i>only a </i>means<i> to an end; it is not an end in itself</i>.<br><br><i>The end for which each of you should strive is to be the person that you can become--the person that God wants you to be. The day will come when your professional career will end. ... The career that you will have labored so hard to achieve--the work that will have supported you and your family--will one day be behind you.</i><br><br><i>Then you will have learned this great lesson: Much more important than what you have done for a living is what kind of a person you have become....</i><br><br><i>Keep learning and keep preparing for your ultimate graduation day. From time to time ask yourself these questions: Am I ready to meet my Maker? Am I worthy of all the blessings He has in store for His faithful children? Have I received my endowment and sealing ordinances of the temple? Have I remained faithful to my covenants? Have I qualified for the greatest of all God's blessings--the blessing of eternal life? </i>["<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/russell-m-nelson_neither-trust-arm-flesh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neither Trust in the Arm of Flesh</a>," BYU commencement address, 23 April 2009; emphasis in original]<br><br>I believe that no matter how busy our lives get, we will be given the opportunity and time to do what is expected of us if we stay focused on the little things. Each of us have a gift or gifts given to us for the specific purpose of doing the things we're supposed to in order to become who our Father in Heaven wants us to become. Find your gifts and use them to bless others.<br><br>We ought to have and will have challenges. They will be the building blocks for your future life and the person you are becoming.<br><br>It is my prayer that each of us can find true knowledge as revealed by the Holy Ghost through proper efforts of prayer, study, and temple worship. I pray also that we may find answers to our prayers by Heavenly Father revealing to us who we really are and, just as importantly whose we really are. I pray that we might find joy in our journey toward discipleship, that we might each day move toward our goal of becoming more Christlike by fulfilling our temple covenants, and that we will approach each day with thanksgiving for opportunities to do the right things and know that our Father in Heaven will continue to bless us in our efforts.<br><br>Elder Maxwell said:<br><br><i>If we can get that witness for ourselves that we are his and that he loves us, then we can cope with and endure well whatever comes in the varied tactical situations of life. </i>["The Pathway of Discipleship"]<br><br>I know the gospel is true. I love my Father in Heaven and His Son, Jesus Christ. I know that through the Atonement we can fulfill Heavenly Father's plan to gain eternal life and become all that He has promised we can become, and I so testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>E.

<h1>of Pride and Glory from the Doctrine and Covenants - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am both grateful and humbled to be with you today. It is often the case in Church assignments that the one who is called to serve is not the most qualified; rather, those with a need for growth or insight are given the task. I have been greatly blessed by my preparations--blessed in more ways than I could begin to share in the time allotted. I pray that through the influence of the Holy Ghost you may benefit from what I have learned and that we may all be edified together this morning.<br><br>In my preparations I have felt guided to focus my comments on the theme "Lessons of Pride and Glory from the Doctrine and Covenants." I should clarify at first that this is not intended to be a pep talk about worldly notions of fame and glory or honor and glory. Pride is a sin--the universal sin, as described by President Ezra Taft Benson in his seminal conference address of April 1989 (see "Beware of Pride," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1989, 4–7). I have personally come to believe that pride is Satan's great counterfeit for glory. As with so many other principles and potential heavenly rewards, Lucifer seeks to deceive us by offering a lesser compromise that may for a moment bring gratification but ultimately leads to remorse and sorrow.<br><br>And as for defining glory, we may ask ourselves: What is glory? What is the eternal nature of glory? Why is it mentioned so frequently in the scriptures? Why is it correct and even essential that we aspire to glory, while the very notion of righteous pride is a grievous sin? What are the potential dangers of confusing the two?<br><br>Within the Church we refer often to the concept of glory. We speak of the three degrees of glory as described in section 76 of the Doctrine and Covenants. In President Joseph F. Smith's vision of the spirit world, he noted among those assembled to greet the resurrected Lord the presence of "our glorious Mother Eve" (D&amp;amp;C 138:3839). Many of the hymns that Christians sing invoke glory to God, suggesting a form of praise. In many scriptural passages we are admonished to live with an eye single to the glory of God. Earlier versions of the BYU logo even prominently displayed the scriptural phrase "the glory of God is intelligence" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36), as if to imply a mantra for our pursuit of truth at the university.<br><br>I recall from when I was a teenager and young adult that President Spencer W. Kimball often began his remarks in Church meetings by stating what a glorious occasion it was to be gathered together. I confess that as a teenager I failed to grasp what was so glorious about all those Church meetings, but President Kimball's enthusiasm and insistence that the occasions were glorious always left an impression in my mind.<br><br>My point is that we tend to think of glory only in abstract terms without giving careful thought to its full significance. In my personal study of the Doctrine and Covenants, the principles and narratives associated with glory have always commanded my attention. The word seems to jump off the page each instance it appears, inviting me to ponder its meaning.<br><br>Before exploring specific passages, I feel impressed to declare my sincere witness and testimony that the voice that speaks to us from the Doctrine and Covenants is that of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. As latter-day prophets past and present have boldly declared, Jesus Christ is the true source of leadership and guidance for the Church. This witness from the Holy Ghost burns so brightly and clearly in my heart that I cannot read the text from any other perspective. I love the Doctrine and Covenants. I find it fascinating that so many of the revelations recorded in this volume of scripture were personal blessings given to early members of the Church who were seeking the Lord's guidance. I believe these highly personal instructions are meant to be applicable in each of our lives today as we struggle with similar challenges and questions. I believe that only when we come to hear the voice of Christ speaking to us personally is the true significance of each passage manifest.<br><br>In exploring the lessons of glory and its antithesis, pride, I have organized my comments in three phases. First, let's review a couple of well-known scriptural definitions of glory familiar to even beginning students of the gospel. Second, I would like to focus in detail on references to glory found in relation to the establishment of Zion in Jackson County, Missouri. Finally, we will look closely at a few passages from the Doctrine and Covenants that point to a more important and eternal significance of glory.<br><br>First, the review: LDS scriptures offer unique and profound explanations of God's glory that are not found in the Bible. In the book of Moses in the Pearl of Great Price, God reveals that His work is devoted to furthering the progression of His children. In language that recalls our opening hymn today, God spoke to Moses, saying:<br><br><i>The heavens, they are many, and they cannot be numbered unto man; but they are numbered unto me, for they are mine.</i><br><br><i>And as one earth shall pass away, and the heavens thereof even so shall another come; and there is no end to my works, neither to my words.</i><br><br><i>For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.</i> [Moses 1:37–39]<br><br>I have already referred to D&amp;amp;C 93:36, in which the simple yet sublime truth is declared, "The glory of God is intelligence, or in other words, light and truth." Here the concept of glory is linked to principles of knowledge and understanding. This passage offers unique insight into the nature and character of God. Gone is the sectarian notion that God's glory is based primarily on the splendor of His abode.<br><br>The interrelationship of glory, intelligence, light, and truth is further illuminated in the same section. In it we learn that Christ through His obedience has obtained a fulness of the glory of the Father. As Christ is our model in all things--we learn that we too, through obedience to the commandments, may eventually receive the same fullness:<br><br><i>I give unto you these sayings that you may understand and know how to worship, and know what you worship, that you may come unto the Father in my name, and in due time receive of his fulness.</i><br><br><i>For if you keep my commandments you shall receive of his fulness, and be glorified in me as I am in the Father.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 93:19–20]<br><br>This reference to receiving a fulness of the Father recalls similar scriptures in which the fulness of the Father is tied to a fulness of joy. Speaking to the Three Nephites--disciples given the blessing to linger on earth until His Second Coming--Christ offered this promise and insight:<br><br><i>Ye shall have fulness of joy; and ye shall sit down in the kingdom of my Father; yea, your joy shall be full, even as the Father hath given me fulness of joy; and ye shall be even as I am, and I am even as the Father; and the Father and I are one.</i> [3 Nephi 28:10]<br><br>In section 93 our understanding of glory is further enlarged to embrace knowledge as an essential foundation. Just as the glory of God is intelligence and intelligence is light and truth, we also learn that truth is knowledge, "the knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come" (D&amp;amp;C 93:24).<br><br>Speaking of the advancement of Zion, the Lord closes section 93 with an admonition of learning:<br><br><i>And, verily I say unto you, that it is my will that you should ... obtain a knowledge of history, and of countries, and of kingdoms, of laws of God and man, and all this for the salvation of Zion.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 93:53]<br><br>Joseph Smith was faithful to the Lord's commandment to obtain knowledge. Although he and other members of the early Church were burdened with enormous tasks of translating and publishing scripture, preaching the gospel, building temples, settling cities, and more while enduring bitter persecutions, Joseph still made time to establish a School of the Prophets and even became a serious student of Hebrew. In comparison, how fortunate we are to attend this university and pursue knowledge in circumstances comparatively free of distraction. How glorious, in a way, is our opportunity for learning.<br><br>With that brief review, let's now move to our second subtopic: an examination of promised glory as the early Church endeavored to establish Zion, or the New Jerusalem.<br><br>Reference to the New Jerusalem appears in the Doctrine and Covenants as early as section 45, given in March 1831. Section 57 begins with a pronouncement that, in its day (July 1831), must have been stunning and that today is still quite astounding:<br><br><i>Hearken, O ye elders of my church, ... who have assembled yourselves together ... in this land, which is the land of Missouri, which is the land which I have appointed and consecrated for the gathering of the saints.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, this is the land of promise, and the place for the city of Zion.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 57:1–2]<br><br>In the following revelation in section 58, the Lord, speaking of the gathering to Jackson County, offered those who had been called there the following promise of glory and a caution of foreseen tribulations:<br><br><i>Ye cannot behold with your natural eyes, for the present time, the design of your God concerning those things which shall come hereafter, and the glory which shall follow after much tribulation.</i><br><br><i>For after much tribulation come the blessings. Wherefore the day cometh that ye shall be crowned with much glory; the hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 58:3–4]<br><br>The Lord begins section 59, "Behold, blessed, saith the Lord, are they who have come up unto this land with an eye single to my glory" (D&amp;amp;C 59:1).<br><br>Please keep these promises in mind, especially those in section 58, which I will refer to again later.<br><br>The stage had been set and remarkable promises offered. Those living the experience of this period must have felt enormous anticipation and hope that Christ would soon return to the temple they would build in the New Jerusalem. From March 1831 to October 1838, Joseph Smith received the revelations that are now sections 45 through 124 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Careful examination shows that all of these instructions concerning Zion, which we now interpolate to the present day, are in fact specific references to the early Church members' attempts to settle in Missouri. In other words, as we study the Doctrine and Covenants today, we generally consider references to Zion as intended for the Church today.<br><br>This is appropriate, as Nephi taught that we may liken the scriptures to ourselves (see 1 Nephi 19:23) as we are still endeavoring to establish Zion. In the original context of these revelations, however, <i>Zion</i> referred specifically to the efforts to settle in Independence, Missouri, as opposed to the stake of Zion in Kirtland, Ohio. During this period Joseph Smith remained primarily in Kirtland, where he received instruction concerning his work translating the Bible and the building of the Kirtland Temple. Other revelations are directed to the Saints in Missouri, located about 800 miles away.<br><br>In order to better understand the efforts to obtain glory in Zion, let's take a focused look at a section of the Doctrine and Covenants that at first reading might appear insignificant. I refer to section 62, a revelation received in the context of a chance meeting along the road between Independence and Kirtland. In mid-August 1831 Joseph Smith was returning to Kirtland from Independence when he encountered a group of elders en route to Missouri after having preached the gospel in the surrounding regions. The two groups paused briefly as they crossed paths. In the revelation, the elders who had been preaching were blessed for the testimonies they had borne. They were told that the angels rejoiced over their testimonies and that their sins were forgiven. They were then admonished to continue to gather in Zion and promised the Lord's blessings if they remained faithful.<br><br>The revelation closes with some personal instruction that might seem irrelevant today, but I believe it actually contains a priceless lesson, one which will help us better understand the nature of glory and how to distinguish glory from pride.<br><br>As with so many other revelations, this counsel appears to have been given in response to a specific request, one that is easy to imagine as we envision these elders who, on a hot and humid mid-August day, were probably walking along a dusty road:<br><br><i>I, the Lord, am willing, if any among you desire to ride upon horses, or upon mules, or in chariots, he shall receive this blessing, if he receive it from the hand of the Lord, with a thankful heart in all things.</i><br><br><i>These things remain with you to do according to judgment and the directions of the Spirit.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 62:7–8]<br><br>What do horses, mules, and chariots have to do with glory? Why would a revelation given during a chance meeting along the roadside be preserved for our instruction today? Here is the lesson that I believe is still crucial. The Lord desires to bless us in all our efforts to build His kingdom. If we have need of tools, resources, or some advantage in our stewardships, the Lord is eager to grant us our needs and desires. But the Lord does not offer a solution without any effort on our part. First, we must have faith; second, we must receive such blessings from the hand of the Lord with a thankful heart; and, finally, the task remains with us, and we must use judgment as directed by the Spirit. I will come back to this lesson in aminute.<br><br>Unfortunately, time will allow only a cursory examination of the promised glory of Zion. Due to a variety of complications, including human frailties and intense persecutions, by 1838 repeated efforts to establish Zion in Missouri had all failed. The exterminating order issued by Governor Lilburn Boggs in October 1838, the Haun's Mill Massacre shortly thereafter, and the incarceration of Joseph Smith and other Church leaders in Liberty Jail left the Saints no alternative. The next place of gathering would become Nauvoo, Illinois. It is difficult to imagine, but we should try to understand how devastating and discouraging this setback must have been for the early members of the Church. Almost everyone involved probably lost much of their life's wealth and possessions. How chastened they must have felt when they realized that the establishment of the New Jerusalem would be postponed.<br><br>As I ponder the evolution of events that has brought the Church to its present situation--from Missouri to Nauvoo, the migration to Utah, and eventually to the current worldwide expansion--I often wonder how those who lost the vision of Zion in Missouri and the promised glory of section 58 would judge us today. Would they look at our prosperity and feel that after the forewarned trials and tribulations, Zion has finally been redeemed? If they could walk with us here on this beautiful campus, if they could visit all the Church facilities and the holy temples found in many lands throughout the world, if they could visit our spacious and finely appointed homes, what would they think of our circumstances? If they could behold modern transportation and technology and how these have facilitated the growth of the Church and advanced its mission, would they feel that we have arrived at the promised glory they were not permitted obtain?<br><br>I can only imagine that the early Saints would have been amazed if in their time they could have seen how far we have come today. Still, I do not know if all that we enjoy today constitutes a full realization of the promised glory of section 58.<br><br>Remember how I opened my address today: I argued that pride is a counterfeit and deception for glory. I worry that we as a people can mistake worldly wealth and advantage for glory when, in fact, these are shallow illusions that can cause us to miss the mark. A decade has passed since President Benson's discourse on pride, yet his warning is still urgently relevant. As President Benson noted, the Lord warned us in the Doctrine and Covenants to "beware of pride, lest ye become as the Nephites of old" (D&amp;amp;C 38:39). An entire sermon might be devoted to an analysis of the pride of the Nephites in the Book of Mormon. Suffice it to say that the nature of their cyclical problem was an inability to prosper and grow wealthy as to the things of the world without becoming distracted and losing sight of God's greater blessings. Their wealth became a self-serving preoccupation leading to hypocrisy and contention. President Benson taught:<br><br><i>The central feature of pride is enmity--enmity toward God and enmity toward our fellowmen. </i>Enmity<i> means "hatred toward, hostility to, or a state of opposition." It is the power by which Satan wishes to reign over us.</i> ["Beware of Pride," 4]<br><br>Let's return to Joseph and the elders as they met by chance on that hot and dusty road between Independence and Kirtland. Remember the lesson: the Lord does truly desire to bless us. I personally believe that when it comes to the establishment of Zion or the building of His kingdom here on earth, He delights in providing us our righteous desires when we ask in faith, are grateful, and seek the guidance of the Spirit in performing our labors. I believe this is one process by which an earthly and temporal measure of glory is realized; indeed, this is part of the process that has enabled us to reach our current situation. When we seek the Lord's counsel and assistance to do His will, He can and does bring to pass remarkable accomplishments. But there is a fine line between glory and pride. When we place our own personal vanity and greed before the will of the Lord, we confuse glory with pride and fall into the trap that plagued the Nephites of old. Confusing personal ambitions with the Lord's designs for His kingdom can also lead to the enmity that President Benson warned against.<br><br>Let's now move on to the third phase in our consideration of glory. Of all the references to glory in the Doctrine and Covenants, two attract my attention with special strength and persistence. After chastising some in the Church for irreverent use of His name, the Lord declared, "These things remain to overcome through patience, that such may receive a more exceeding and eternal wait of glory" (D&amp;amp;C 63:66). In this reference the Lord does not elaborate. We are left to ponder what eternal nature of glory is reserved for the faithful and repentant.<br><br>A similar description is found in section 132, a major revelation on the new and everlasting covenant of eternal marriage. In describing the state of those who marry for eternity as opposed to those who are married by an earthly contract, the Lord declared, "[these] are worthy of a far more, and an exceeding, and an eternal weight of glory" (D&amp;amp;C 132:16). Could this be the glory spoken of in section 58? "Ye cannot behold with your natural eyes, for the present time ... the glory which shall follow after much tribulation" (D&amp;amp;C 58:3). In D&amp;amp;C 132:19, the Lord gives a glimpse into this eternal nature of glory. Again referring to the righteous who marry in the new and everlasting covenant, the Lord reveals the following concerning their state in the world to come:<br><br><i>And they shall pass by the angels, and the gods, which are set there, to their exaltation and glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon their heads, which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation ofthe seeds forever and ever.</i><br><br>The fulness mentioned here probably refers to the fulness of the Father's glory, knowledge, and joy discussed earlier. As we ourselves are spiritual children of our Heavenly Parents, we understand the continuation of the seeds to be the eternal binding of family relations and the eventual capacity to bear spirit children of our own. While the full extent of these blessings is beyond our present comprehension, I believe there are great lessons to be learned when we begin to link the importance of families with our quest and expectations for glory. Our priorities in life can become clear and, by treasuring our families, we can taste a measure of heavenly glory here on earth. On the other hand, if we equate our quest for glory to temporal and worldly measures of wealth, possessions, power, and influence, you can see how easy it to be deceived and to fall into traps of pride and hypocrisy.<br><br>I conclude by sharing a recent experience I had with a young family that I home teach. Let me introduce the family of Corom and Jennifer Hughes. Corom and Jennifer have three lovely young daughters: Koula, Marsalina, and Sophia. Corom and Jen are the salt of the earth. They live humbly in a basement apartment, yet they constantly reach out to others in service and sharing. Neighbors in the ward are often invited to share Sunday dinners at their home. On a recent occasion I brought along some cookies to contribute to the meal. Their oldest daughter, Koula, age three, loves to eat--she takes her food very seriously and relishes every bite. When the time came to set out the cookies, Koula was full of excitement. I will never forget the expression on her face of absolute joy and eager anticipation as she reached across the table for one of the cookies.<br><br>Wise and responsible parents that Corom and Jen are, and being cautious about sugar intake, Koula's father intercepted the large cookie she had selected and proceeded to break it in half. In the same way that I will never forget Koula's excited anticipation, I will never forget the instant change in her countenance at receiving only half the cookie she had hoped for. Those with toddlers of their own are all too familiar with the scene that followed. Koula's fleeting joy quickly dissipated into protests of anger and uncontrollable tears.<br><br>We are all familiar with moments like this. There was an awkward silence and despondence in Corom's face as he looked at me with a sense of apology as if to say, "Well, isn't this just glorious?" The moment was too much to resist--I looked at him and said, "Corom, you are the man, you have family!" Corom is ahumble and unassuming person. He is working hard to establish a career. He even commutes to Eastern Washington University every week in order to complete a master's degree and improve his employment options. Given the awkwardness of the moment, it was easy to understand that he seemed a little discouraged about his situation. I did my best to reassure him that the worldly advantages he may lack at present matter little in the eternal designs of our Heavenly Father. Many worldly enticements can even be dangerous counterfeits for the true treasures of glory to be found in our simple, sometimes problematic, and always imperfect family relations.<br><br>I close with my witness of God's love for all of His children. How wonderful and joyful it is to know that Christ speaks to each of us personally through the revelations of the Doctrine and Covenants. I pray that our Savior's blessings will be with each of us as we aspire to return to His presence with our families and partake of His eternal and exceeding weight of glory and happiness. I ask this blessing humbly in the name of Jesus the Christ, amen.<br><br><i>David Day was the BYU Harold B.

<h1>Day Worship, Missionary Work, Talents</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning! It is a cherished privilege to share this time with you this morning. Thirty years of college teaching, 32 years of parenthood, 40 years of Church service, and 45 years of performing as a musician have convinced me that I am nothing. As to my own strength, I am weak, and I must depend fully upon the Lord if I am to succeed in accomplishing anything good. You recognize those are nearly the words of Ammon in the chapter 26 of the book of Alma (see verses 11–12). Moroni said something very similar:<br><br><em>And now I speak unto all the ends of the earth--that if the day cometh that the power and gifts of God shall be done away among you, it shall be because of unbelief.</em><br><br>And wo be unto the children of men if this be the case; for there shall be none that doeth good among you, no not one. For if there be one among you that doeth good, he shall work by the power and gifts of God. [Moroni 10:24–25]<br><br>I know that is true! Those of us who have been given the gift of the Holy Ghost will never achieve our full potential without His presence in our lives. In the words of the Savior Himself:<br><br><em>Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.</em><br><br>I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. [John 15:4–5]<br><br>I know I am completely dependent on the Lord, but despite my weaknesses and inadequacies and my mistakes and even failures, in His strength many good things have also been accomplished.<br><br>Early in my life, at age three, I began a string of experiences when I contracted polio that would always make me feel a keen sense of dependence on the Lord. This happened about six months before the vaccine was released that has now nearly eliminated this devastating disease in the United States. When we have the capacity to accomplish great good, there is always commensurate opposition and adversity to try to prevent us from fulfilling our potential. I have never begrudged having this challenge in my life because I think it has blessed me in my spiritual and musical development more than it could ever hinder me. I believe, too, that the Lord has used this adversity in my life to better prepare me for a world dominated by humanism. Humanists believe that man must succeed completely on his own abilities with no supernatural power to help. They believe in depending on themselves, not on the Lord. There is a terrifying scripture in the book of Helaman about that. In chapter 4, verse 13, Mormon describes the people of that time: "And because of . . . their boastings in their own strength, they were left in their own strength; therefore they did not prosper."<br><br>I needed and felt extra power from the Lord from early in my life. Because of the polio, I went through a series of surgical operations. Each time I faced one of these corrective procedures my father would give me a priesthood blessing. I remember one postsurgery follow-up visit when my doctor, Paul R. Milligan--a fine man not of our faith--commented, "Raymond, I always love to operate on you because everything we do works so well and you heal so quickly." I knew the source of that power. Through such experiences my faith developed, I recognized my clear dependence on the Lord, and I learned to pray.<br><br>I delight in an analogy offered by the late Truman G. Madsen some years ago:<br><br>Even at our best we are like the blind boy who walks with his friend. He does not believe, nor bluff, that he is self-sufficient. Instead, he responds to the slightest nudge. (If you would know the power of God, try, early in life, to become just this dependable in your dependence.) ["Christ and Prayer," Christ and the Inner Life, 2nd ed. (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1978), 16; see also Madsen, "Yearning Prayer," in Era of Youth: "Learn of Me," Improvement Era, June 1964, 545]<br><br>Also early in my life, from age eight I was blessed with opportunities for involvement and growth in my present field of study, music. Music has given me, by metaphor, gospel insights that have further helped me to learn my dependence on the Lord and the trust in Him that comes from that dependence.<br><br>I knew when I became a student of music at BYU that I would not be able to succeed without the blessings and extra help of the Lord, so I decided from the beginning that I would try to keep myself in a position to receive that help. I decided that meant that I must keep the Sabbath day holy by not studying and practicing on the Lord's day. I was also determined that I would keep first things first in my life by reading my scriptures daily, praying daily, attending the temple regularly, and serving faithfully in my callings and as a home teacher.<br><br>As a student here, I was inspired by the president of BYU at that time, Dallin H. Oaks, when he spoke at a devotional like this and shared with us his commitment to keep the Sabbath day holy while he was a law student in Chicago. Here are his words:<br><br>I had a personal experience that taught me for all time the importance of observing the Sabbath. As a Brigham Young University student, married with two small children to support, I had a job that required me to work on the Sabbath. Consequently, I did not enjoy the blessings of the Sabbath in full measure, despite my efforts always to attend at least one of my Sabbath meetings. When I left this campus to study at the University of Chicago, my mother reminded me that my father had never studied on the Sabbath during his professional training. She said to me very casually, "Son, if you want to enjoy that blessing you should arrange your activities so that you never study, so that you never do anything on the Sabbath except partake of the spiritual food that is available to you on the Lord's day."<br><br>I made up my mind at that time that I would observe the Sabbath faithfully so that I could qualify for the blessings of spiritual growth and the companionship of the Spirit that come from observing faithfully the Sabbath of our Lord. I testify to you that I realized those blessings in measurable ways on innumerable occasions. My concern for the Sabbath is to earn the blessings available to those who observe it, not to keep myself from sinning. My attitude is to look on the commandment of the Sabbath as a gift of my Heavenly Father to teach me what I should do if I want to enjoy his richest blessings. That is the attitude I encourage each of us to develop toward each of our Father in heaven's commandments.<br><br>We read this in Isaiah about the Sabbath, and I affirm to you its truth: "If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable; and shalt honor him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it" (Isaiah 58:13–14). ["T<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/dallin-h-oaks_blessing-commandments/">he Blessing of Commandments</a>," BYU devotional address, 10 September 1974]<br><br>The Lord also gave me encouragement in my own learning process about the Sabbath with many small miracles along the way. One remarkable experience I will share with you, hoping that it will encourage you in a similar approach in your life. I was taking that certain class that all majors have at least one of--the one that strikes fear into the heart of every student when even mentioned. We were preparing for the final exam and had been given a study page of terms and questions. At the encouragement of the teacher, we had formed study groups, farmed out research, and shared with each other. But on the day of the test, I still had not covered all the questions. We were told that we would be given two questions that we would write about for 30 minutes each, and one question that we would write about for an hour. Therefore, I needed to be prepared with an hour's worth of material for every question on the study list. The task was overwhelming!<br><br>The morning of the test came, and an hour and a half before the test I was on my knees pleading with the Lord for help to know how to best use that last hour and a half of study time. I told the Lord that I had kept first things first in my life according to my commitments and that I now really needed His help. As I prayed, I looked down the study list lying on the bed in front of me. I was impressed to study one particular question. Every other time I went by that question, I skipped it. Because it was just so big, I thought, "No one with a human bone in his body would ask that question." I similarly rationalized it again and went on past it. But as I finished the list, nothing else stood out to me. I started down the list again from the top, and when I came to that same question, it really hit me over the head.<br><br>"Ray, wake up! That's the question!" I said to myself. I spent the next hour and a half outlining an answer for that question and then fleshing out the outline from my class notes and from the textbook.<br><br>When I arrived at the test site, the teacher announced that he had changed his mind. There would be only one question on the test, and we would need to write two hours on the one question. Well, you can guess which question it was! I was so grateful for the Lord's guidance. I got a good grade on that test, and an hour and a half earlier I would have flunked it. I knew where that gift came from and why.<br><br>Similarly, I had much miraculous help when I kept my commitment to the Lord about the Sabbath day. When I returned from my mission, writing was not one of my strong points. I found it very difficult, and my freshman English class was all about writing compositions. For some reason they were always due at nine every Monday morning. There were numerous times when I was still struggling with it late Saturday night. It was so tempting to work on it on Sunday, but I did not. I would get up early Monday morning and go after it, and often it would just flow. It felt so different than it had on Saturday night. I usually got it done by nine, but occasionally I did not. When that was the case, I would go to class and it would turn out that many class members were not finished, and the teacher would grant us until Wednesday. Or the teacher would be sick, and I would get an automatic extension until Wednesday or some other intervention. I can testify to you that I was never penalized on my grades for keeping the Sabbath day holy. Now this would not have been the case if I was slacking off in my studies or failing in my spiritual obligations. I knew the Lord would not just do the work for me if I had not done my very best.<br><br>A few years later, in graduate school in Indiana, a fellow student came into my practice room just before spring break. He looked quite dejected. I said, "Gary, what's bothering you?" He was upset because he had decided to go to Florida with some friends for spring break, and that would mean he could not practice for a whole week.<br><br>I said, "Gary, lighten up, man! You will do better when you get back because of the break. It will be better than if you had stayed here the whole time working."<br><br>"You really think so?" he said.<br><br>"Yes! Why, I take a day off every week, and things always go better because of it."<br><br>He was incredulous, and we began comparing practice routines. He was practicing three hours during the day and two hours after dinner plus 12 hours each Sunday. I was practicing the three hours during the day, but often missed the two hours in the evening because I was working with the full-time missionaries, and I wasn't practicing at all on Sundays. This was a real testimony to me of the Lord's blessings in my practice because Gary and I were always in a friendly competition for the best playing opportunities, and I always seemed to stay just a little ahead of him in auditions and ensemble placement.<br><br>I have found the same holds true when it comes to professional work. I have never been able to justify that my particular talents and services were needed professionally on the Sabbath day. I am often invited by others to work on the Sabbath day, and it would be tempting if I didn't know that depending on the Lord yields much greater benefits than Sabbath employment. This was a learning curve for me, however, and I still remember one of my early experiences with this.<br><br>I was a student here at BYU and getting calls to play professionally, usually in Salt Lake City. This particular call, though, was to play in Boise for the Buddy Morrow Orchestra. It was very tempting because I was two months behind on rent and had no money for food. This job would have paid both months' rent and put me back on my feet with some food, but it was on Saturday and Sunday. I was still trying to develop the faith and trust to really depend on the Lord in these kinds of situations, so I didn't have a pat answer ready. I said to the caller, "Let me check on those dates, and I will call you back within half an hour." I went immediately to my knees to check on the dates, and I knew what I must do. I called him back and said, "I'm sorry, but I have another commitment on that weekend." I did not explain to him that it was my commitment to the Lord to keep His day holy, but, as I hung up, I felt the confirming burning of the Spirit in my heart and knew that the Lord would take care of me somehow. It doesn't always happen so soon, but it was less than 24 hours later when another call came, this time to play for the Shrine Circus in Salt Lake. It was for the same weekend, but it was on Friday and Saturday. I made $25 more than I would have in Boise, and I was glad I was in my meetings that Sunday when I was called into the elders quorum presidency.<br><br>It doesn't seem logical that if I turn down work, I will make more money, and if I study one day less in a week, I will get better grades. Similarly, it does not seem logical that if I pay my tithing I can really do more with only 90 percent of my income. But that's because part of the equation is missing. It isn't really that I can do more with 90 percent than 100 percent. Rather, it is that 90 percent plus the Lord's blessings equals more than 100 percent. It is so with all things in life for those who recognize their dependence on the Lord and put Him first in their lives and trust Him to fulfill His scriptural promises. I love President Ezra Taft Benson's teachings about this:<br><br>Men and women who turn their lives over to God will discover that He can make a lot more out of their lives than they can. He will deepen their joys, expand their vision, quicken their minds, strengthen their muscles, lift their spirits, multiply their blessings, increase their opportunities, comfort their souls, raise up friends, and pour out peace. Whoever will lose his life in the service of God will find eternal life. [TETB, 361]<br><br>I know that is true!<br><br>When we learn these principles, then it is logical for us to consecrate all of our talents and efforts toward serving the Lord and building His kingdom. Consecration says, "I will do what is right now and trust the Lord for the outcome." Whereas aspiration says, "I must do whatever it takes to control the outcome." If we aspire enough to certain goals and are willing to pay any price, we can accomplish those things. But sometimes the price is too high. (We may lose our integrity or ultimately even our soul.) And sometimes the things we have aspired to accomplish turn out not to be a blessing to us. But if we consecrate our preparations unto the Lord and leave the outcome in His hands, the outcome will always be a blessing to us. He can control the outcome much better than we can ourselves.<br><br>Learning to use our talents to build the kingdom started for me with my full-time mission. I put off going at first because I was serious about my music, and I wasn't sure I could put down my instruments for two years and then become competitive in my field ever again. It became an issue of faith and trust that if I consecrated those two years to the Lord, He would help me when I came back. Such has indeed been the case. I know that when we put the Lord first, then the blessings of support come when we need them.<br><br>Some years ago I attended a conference of the International Association for Jazz Education in Atlanta, Georgia. One of the presentations was by Kirk Whalum, a great tenor saxophonist and recording artist known in Los Angeles as "Mr. Soul." The title of his clinic was "How to Become the In-Demand Recording Session Player." He started out by clarifying that the most important thing in becoming this in-demand session player was one's motive. He said to that audience that if their goal was to see their names up in lights on the marquee and to go into Tower Records and see all their CDs filed behind their name cards, then there never was a better time than right then to just quit playing. He explained that that motive would never be strong enough to carry one through all that would be necessary.<br><br>Then he said, "I will tell you what your motive should be. God gave you your talent, and it is your job to hone it and then give it back in service to His other children."<br><br>I was thrilled to hear the gospel taught so clearly at an international assembly of jazz musicians. This principle does not just apply to musical talents. All of you have many talents of many kinds that have been given to you so you can serve more deeply.<br><br>Brigham Young, prophet and founder of this university, taught, "Our education should be such as to improve our minds and fit us for increased usefulness; to make us of greater service to the human family" (JD 14:83). The prophet Jacob in the Book of Mormon shed further light on this principle when he taught:<br><br>But before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God.<br><br>And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to do good--to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted. [Jacob 2:18–19]<br><br>This applies not only to seeking riches but also to developing our talents and honing our intellects. When we seek first a hope in Christ, then the blessings will come in developing our talents, and we will seek to develop those talents so we can be of service.<br><br>Many of my students are surprised to find out that when I was making decisions about my career, I never thought about how much money I would make or what was in it for me. That is not how we thought about it back then. My concern was, "What are my talents and how can I best develop them so I can make the greatest contribution of which I am capable in the Church and in society." I sometimes wonder how Brigham Young would feel about the prevalent focus in our studies here on the campus today on how much money we can make: "What's in it for me?"<br><br>It really is not about "me." We enter to learn so we can go forth to serve. I have had to learn that in the performance arena. When we perform in front of others, it is natural to experience what is often termed "stage fright." This can happen whether we perform a musical number, give a sacrament meeting talk, play on the football field, or participate in any other similar performance opportunity. Why do we get so frightened? If I could be so blunt, it is because we are too focused on ourselves. Our performance becomes self-centered: "I wonder if they like what I am doing?" "I wonder if they are impressed?" "I wonder if they noticed the mistake I made?" I, I, I. Those thoughts are all about me. I have spent significant time in my life trying to learn to be others-centered in my performance, as I know the Savior would be. Is He not our Exemplar in this area too? If He were performing my part tonight, He would play with a confidence born of humility--that is, knowing the true source of all power. He would play with compassion and love. He would serve and build and lift with His performance.<br><br>For years I have spent time before an important performance reading the scriptures--such as Alma 26 and John 15, as previously mentioned--and pondering and praying to have a private victory over any conflicting motives so that I could align myself with my Heavenly Father's purposes and have the Holy Ghost to make me adequate to the situation. I often feel inadequate. This is simply because I am inadequate. But in His strength, I can do all things! I can be an instrument in His hands to bless and lift others. When I perform in this manner with the aid of the Holy Ghost, I can play beyond my natural abilities. As Moroni put it, "If there be one among you that doeth good, he shall work by the power and gifts of God" (Moroni 10:25). Moroni also told us, "And Christ hath said: If ye will have faith in me ye shall have power to do whatsoever thing is expedient in me" (Moroni 7:33).<br><br>As a jazz musician, when I perform, I am an improviser. That means that I am responding to the very moment and making up what I am playing right on the spot. One improvisation scripture is found in the Doctrine and Covenants, section 84, verse 85:<br><br>Neither take ye thought beforehand what ye shall say; but treasure up in your minds continually the words of life, and it shall be given you in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto every man.<br><br>At first glance that sounds like the Lord is telling us not to worry about preparing what we will say--to just wing it and it will all work out. We don't need to prepare anything. That, of course, is not what He is saying. Rather, we are to prepare continually, and then the Spirit can bring out of us that which is needed for the very moment, that which is needed to bless another or to bless others. I cannot improvise a jazz solo without any present preparation if I have not been preparing for it all my life. This is exactly how the Lord would like us to do missionary work these days. When I was a missionary, we had to memorize every word of the discussions "word perfect." But now the Lord wants us to move to the next level and know the gospel and the scriptures so well that the Spirit can bring out what is needed for the very moment. This has always been the scriptural standard for teaching the gospel whether in missionary work or home teaching or family home evening. But now the Lord is asking us to actually grow into that standard. Of course this is also the standard for a jazz musician--to be so prepared that he can improvise to bless and lift others in their lives.<br><br>At the time of Joseph Smith--and still today--Christendom in general has taught that the Creation of the world was like a magic trick. God said, "Abracadabra," and then poof, the world sprang into existence, so to speak. Joseph Smith taught us that it did not happen that way; rather, God took existing materials (which, by the way, cannot be created or made but are coeternal with God) and organized them into a new form. Here are Brother Joseph's words:<br><br>The word create came from the [Hebrew] word baurau, which does not mean to create out of nothing; it means to organize; the same as a man would organize materials and build a ship. Hence, we infer that God had materials to organize the world out of chaos--chaotic matter. [Teachings, 350–51; also HC 6:308]<br><br>If that is the creative process for God, I don't think that we are going to improve on that definition of creativity. Many of us are trying to pursue studies in creative fields. In the visual arts, we are trying to organize color and shape and line as they exist in space. In music we are organizing sound colors, both vertical and horizontal, as they exist in time--and then similarly with the many other fields of creative endeavor. We are then in the process of mastering control over those materials so that we can organize them in such an expressive way that we become a blessing to others. As President Boyd K. Packer said it, "Because of what [artists] do, we are able to feel and learn very quickly . . . some spiritual things that we would otherwise learn very slowly" ("The Arts and the Spirit of the Lord," BYU fireside address, 1 February 1976). That is our privilege and responsibility as creative people. Again, it is not about "me" or "us." It is about depending on the Lord to bring out of us what will be a blessing to others and build His kingdom.<br><br>I count it a great blessing to be able to use my professional talents to serve the Lord. It has been such a wonderful blessing for me to be able to tour internationally with Synthesis and use the music that I love so much to do missionary work. We don't actively proselyte when we tour so much as we try to create goodwill and make friends for the Church. Believe it or not, the Lord is able to do this with a jazz band as His vehicle. When people see these clean-cut, wholesome-looking young people playing so well, there is something miraculous that takes place. Often people will come to the stage after the concert and ask, "What is it that is different about this band? There is something different that comes from the stage than from any other group I have heard. It's like there is some kind of love or something that emanates from the stage." They don't know how to say, "I'm feeling the Spirit," but they are touched and want to know what is behind that.<br><br>We always try to make sure the people know who we are and who sponsors our trip to their country. After introducing and thanking local sponsors, I add that we come from Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, in the United States and that our university is owned and operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I also tell them that without the Church's sponsorship, we could not be there. I then pause and say, "Yes, you are right. You are looking at a whole stage full of Mormons. But don't be alarmed, we are pretty nice people when you get to know us."<br><br>I like to tease them a little. I add, "You have probably seen these fellows walking or riding bicycles, you know, with the white shirts and ties and name tags. Maybe they have even knocked at your door before."<br><br>There are always smiles and a few knowing nods. You have to realize that by this time, late in the concert, they are in love with the band. So when I say, "All these guys on the stage with me have been those guys," there is always a buzz in the audience. I introduce some of the band members and tell where they served on their missions. This seems to help break down fear and prejudice.<br><br>After one concert in Durham, England, a fellow from the audience came up and talked to Stan Taylor, our tour leader, and said, "If those guys knock at my door, I'm going to let them in."<br><br>The real key to serving with our talents is to have the Spirit with us. When I was a missionary, I read at the top of the second page in my mission handbook: "The Key to Spirituality." (This was before the mission handbook was standardized, and the handbook would have been unique to my mission.) It said, "Arise at six each morning and pray intently, hungering and thirsting for the influence of the Spirit to fill your body, until it does." Of course, the time of rising is negotiable; that was just our mission rule. When I was out five weeks, I was called to train a new missionary, and I really felt my inadequacy. It was the blind leading the blind. I decided I must have the Spirit if I was to succeed, so I started applying this Key to Spirituality. I had prayed for the Spirit before, but never until the Spirit. It was difficult at first. I tried to repent and humble myself and struggle in prayer until I felt the Spirit. I had already had experiences in the first weeks of my mission that had shown me the difference between working with the "power and gifts of God" and working with the power and gifts of Ray Smith. The difference was stark, and I knew that it was hardly worth walking out the door to do the work if I did not have the Spirit with me. I learned that I really could feel the Spirit on a daily basis. It became the norm for the rest of my mission.<br><br>When I left my mission to come home, I realized that I needed the Spirit just as much at home as I did in the mission field. I decided to continue the practice of praying daily until I felt the Spirit. I am still doing it today. After returning home, I found a quote from Truman G. Madsen: "Happy is the youth who prays for, and then until, and finally with, this subtle flame" ("Christ and Prayer," 17). I have experienced the power of that idea.<br><br>This daily maintenance of our spirits is something that has a strong metaphor in music. If I miss days of practice, my performance will lack that edge of excellence that I would have had if I was paying the daily price. No matter how well or how much I practice one day, I must repeat it the next day. Professional calls sometimes come at the last minute or with very short notice. I must always be prepared for those calls, and I must always have a good reed and have my instrument in good working order. Our daily scripture study and prayer and daily obedience will make of us sharp instruments that can respond to every opportunity for service, even on short notice. Just as in practicing music we repeat things over and over until they become easier and more natural for us, we must repeat prayer and scripture study and church and temple attendance over and over until they become natural to us and we become really good at them. It takes perseverance and patience whether we are practicing our discipline or practicing spiritual things.<br><br>One of the things I am always on the line for when I perform or record musically is to play in tune with the other players. When I think about how critical it is to my professional success to always be in tune, it makes me realize how much I should always pay attention to being in tune with my Father in Heaven so I can best serve Him in my spiritual performance. This is a vastly more important performance than the ones on the concert hall stage or in the recording studio.<br><br>Well, thank you for letting me share these thoughts with you this morning. A lifetime of service in the Church and of service as a musician has taught me that I am completely and utterly dependent on the Lord for my success. That is because it is not about me. There is a much bigger cause. The Lord has said, "For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). And I echo with Alma, "Yea, and this is my glory, that perhaps I may be an instrument in the hands of God to bring some soul to repentance; and this is my joy" (Alma 29:9).<br><br>I testify that the greatest joy comes from bringing souls to our Father. We can do this through our professional work and our spiritual work. But we cannot do it alone or on our own power. As we depend on the Lord and trust Him, we will be empowered to bless the lives of others and to help build the kingdom of God and redeem Zion. That will be our greatest privilege and our greatest joy.<br><br>I testify that this is true. I testify that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ. He is our great Exemplar and our great strength.<br><br>I so testify, with love and warmest wishes for each of you, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><em>C.

<h1>e, Temptation, Faith, Purpose of Life</h1>
<br>
<br>
My brothers and sisters, it is an honor and a privilege to be here with you today.<br><br>Some years ago I taught third grade in Gilbert, Arizona, with a woman who had just moved there from Indiana. Every year just before Memorial Day she would hang black-and-white-checkered flags from the ceiling of her classroom and would create for her students thematic studies focused on the Indianapolis 500 car race. All of her excitement piqued my interest in race car driving and the Indy 500. To be honest, much of my curiosity came from the concept of driving in a circle for 500 miles.<br><h2><b>The Race</b></h2><br>The first Indy race was in 1911, and the competition has continued to grow into the event that it is today. Regardless of the weather or other conditions, the race has taken place every year except during World Wars I and II, when the track was used as a landing runway for U.S. aircraft. Drivers who participate in this race have to qualify for one of the limited number of prestigious spots available by proving they have the knowledge, skills, experience, and resources that will allow them to win the race. The motivation for participating in the Indy 500 is not only a love of racing but also the multimillion dollar prize that goes to the winner.<br><br>If you have ever watched even part of one of these races, you know that the drivers go at breakneck speeds of over 200 miles an hour around the track, weaving in and out of the other cars, cutting some off to get ahead in the race, and often skimming the wall to pass the competition. This is a dangerous sport not only for the drivers but also for the support teams and spectators. Great precautions have been taken to reduce the risks to those participating in and watching the race, yet over 40 drivers, 20 crewmembers, and 10 spectators have been killed since the first Indy 500.<br><br>Although it first seemed to me that the cars were just driving around in circles and going nowhere, I now realize that for the drivers who have qualified for the race, it is a carefully planned and calculated effort to be the first to safely cross the finish line.<br><h2><b>Life's Race</b></h2><br>I'd like to compare the Indy 500 to our lives. We go through life and its various experiences--many joyful and some challenging--at a rapid pace. Our race began in the pre-earth life when we were introduced to and chose to be a part of Heavenly Father's great plan of happiness. We qualified for the race in the grand councils of heaven when we stood with the Savior and chose agency and righteousness. Having qualified, we came into this life prepared with everything we needed tosucceed.<br><br>Regardless of the conditions, our task is to participate in the race, safely cross the finish line, and receive the grand prize. Our motivation is the priceless prize designated for finishers of the race--that of eternal life. An important part of the race of life is that the Creator of the plan knows who we are and has given us the necessary conditions and tools for successfully completing our race. Additionally, He has promised to guide us on our path. Isn't it wonderful to know that Heavenly Father loves us and knows us individually?<br><br>We are promised in 1 Nephi 9:6 that "the Lord knoweth all things from the beginning; wherefore, he prepareth a way to accomplish all his works among the children of men; for behold, he hath all power unto the fulfilling of all his words." Knowing this, we are ready for our race.<br><h2><b>Flags</b></h2><br>During the Indy 500, race officials and pit crews have the job of tending the track, monitoring the conditions, clearing debris, and keeping the drivers apprised of the various conditions of the track, possible obstructions, or potential dangers. The way race officials communicate to the drivers is through the use of flags. Some of these flags have been standardized to mean the same thing to all drivers, while others are unique to a particular driver and his team. It is up to the driver to know what the signals mean and to heed the communication in order to race safely and effectively.<br><br>For example, the green flag signals the beginning of the race, the yellow flag cautions drivers to slow down due to hazards on the track, and the yellow-and-red-striped flag warns drivers that there is something on the track that could reduce grip or cause a car to lose control. The red flag tells drivers that conditions are too unsafe to continue the race and that the car must stop. The white flag signals to the driver that there is one lap remaining in the race, and the waving of the black-and-white-checkered flag signals the driver that the scheduled distance has been met and the race is over. All the racers understand these flags.<br><br>Individualized flags are used to communicate important messages with one driver at a time. For example, the black flag summons a car into the pits due to a mechanical problem or because the driver has disobeyed a rule. Each crew also has special flags that are used tocommunicate specific messages to their driver.<br><br>On the racetrack, anything that takes the driver off the course, slows him down, or distracts him from moving toward the finish line is a pitfall. The objective during the race is to avoid as many of these pitfalls as possible. Oil on the track, gravel, encounters with other drivers, going too fast or too slow, and mechanical malfunctions all increase the risk of the driver being harmed, taken off the course, ornot making it to the finish line.<br><br>In life we are all on a risky course, and at times we don't have the experience or perspective to see the pitfalls on the track ahead of us. As on a raceway, individuals who know the course well provide signals that help us understand the conditions we are facing so we can respond appropriately to them. Communication from the Lord comes in many forms as He warns us of pitfalls and dangers and tells us of joys and blessings that we can experience as we proceed through life. He also reminds us of the goals we are working toward and encourages us in our journey.<br><h2><b>Flags of Warning</b></h2><br>In our race, the road conditions aren't always apparent to us and, on our own, we may not always perceive threats to our progress. Thankfully, the Lord warns us about pitfalls globally through His prophets, scriptures, and doctrine. But He also warns us individually through the quiet promptings of the Spirit to let us know how to adjust our journey. He has also given us a pit crew, so to speak, who help us avoid possible hazards on our course. Consider some of the pitfalls our crew has recently warned us about.<br><br>Inspired leaders have warned of the importance of protecting our bodies, minds, and spirits from those influences that would harm us or diminish our ability to stay on course. Just as the race car driver wears a sturdy helmet and clothing appropriate for his task, we are admonished to gird ourselves in the whole armor of God in our dress, in our thoughts, and in our actions.<br><br>Another pitfall that we have been warned of is the influence of the media and technology in our lives. Like all powerful things, these can influence us both positively and negatively. The reason media present potential hazards is that their messages can distort, alter, block out, or supersede the more eternal and important messages from a loving Heavenly Father. The media directly attack our sense of direction, our purpose, and our sense of who we are. We need to know that what is largely represented in the media isn't reality in an eternal sense. Studying the scriptures, doing temple work, developing relationships with family and friends, participating in physical activities, and rendering service are some of the things that we have been counseled to do in the plan the Lord has created for us. Oftentimes we allow the media to have greater and greater influence in our lives, leaving us little time to attend to more meaningful activities that keep us moving in the direction of the finish line. How much time do you spend studying the scriptures, praying, and listening to the word of the Lord in comparison to the time you spend texting, e-mailing, blogging, and listening to the messages of the media?<br><br>In April 2009 general conference, Elder Robert D. Hales addressed another pitfall--the danger of debt. He counseled us all to learn to live "joyfully ... within our means, [to be] content with what we have, [avoid] excessive debt, and diligently [save] and [prepare] for rainy-day emergencies" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/04/becoming-provident-providers-temporally-and-spiritually?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Becoming Provident Providers Temporally and Spiritually</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2009, 8). You may say to yourself, "Hey, I'll think about that when I am out of school or married or have an income." But the flag of warning is for all to heed now. Each of us must be careful to live within our means and even put a little away for emergencies. Current economic conditions show the wisdom in this counsel. Heeding this flag of warning not only protects us from hazards but also blesses us in ways that we cannot predict or imagine.<br><br>In that same conference, other Church leaders reminded us of the importance of attending the temple, honoring our covenants, serving others, learning from the past, exercising faith, trusting in the Lord, and following other important guides that will help us. As we heed the warnings and guidelines of the prophet and our leaders, we can avoid those things that would stand in the way of our goal of reaching the finish line.<br><h2><b>Refueling Our Faith</b></h2><br>In the Indy 500, there are times when the officials or the driver's team recognize that both the car and driver need to be recharged and refueled. These pit stops are essential to ensuring that the car's engine is running efficiently, the tires have enough tread to be safe, fluid levels are full, and the driver is able to continue the race. In our lives we also have occasions when we need to take time out to refuel, repair, recharge, and realign our testimonies so we can better steer our course. Church leaders, the scriptures, caring family members, the Holy Ghost, and patriarchal blessings all provide substance and vision to keep us moving toward the finish line.<br><br>In the most recent general conference, President Thomas S. Monson taught us how to focus on the road beyond a possible pitfall. He spoke of all there is in the world today to be depressed about--financial downturns, social and moral decline, wars, natural disasters, and personal hardships. He admonished us, however, not to dwell on the negative in the world and rather to focus on the blessings we have as members of the Church. He encouraged us as he closed his remarks, "My beloved brothers and sisters, fear not. Be of good cheer. The future is as bright as your faith" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/04/be-of-good-cheer?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Be of Good Cheer</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2009, 92).<br><br>When we are struggling on our raceway or when we need extra encouragement to keep going, the Lord often allows us to have experiences that help us to know that He is aware of us and helping us along. As only a loving Father can, He also provides individualized communication to us through answers to prayer. These messages are often very personal and direct.<br><br>In the fall of 2000 I had an assignment to attend a series of meetings at BYU–Hawaii. Ihad my last chemotherapy treatment the morning I was to fly out of Salt Lake City. After I left the clinic, I went directly to the airport. Bythe time I arrived at the Los Angeles airport, I was feeling very ill. I checked my luggage, and by the time I got to my departure gate, I was absolutely miserable. As I sat down, leaning against the wall, I thought about the coach seats in the plane and how tight it would be with people on both sides of me. I felt even sicker as I contemplated the four- or five-hour flight. I silently thought, "Heavenly Father, would it be so bad if I was in first class today?" The thought came and left.<br><br>Almost immediately the woman at the check-in counter came over to me and asked my name. Finding out that I was indeed Lynnette Erickson, she asked if I would be willing to be bumped to the next flight to allow a family to fly together. Apparently the flight was overbooked and the plane was filled to capacity. By this time I felt so bad that I didn't care if I ever got to Hawaii, so I said yes. The arrangements were made, and the plane left the gate. Not ten minutes later the same woman came back with my new tickets and, to my surprise, informed me that the next plane would be leaving in just 30 minutes. As she was leaving, she turned back to me and asked, "By the way, do you mind if you are in seat A1?" A1, of course, was in the first-class section of the plane. While some may say that this was a coincidence, in my mind this was nothing short of a miracle, and I knew that Heavenly Father was aware of me and my needs.<br><br>Elder David A. Bednar referred to these individualized answers to our prayers as "tender mercies" in our lives:<br><br><i>The Lord's tender mercies are the very personal and individualized blessings, strength, protection, assurances, guidance, loving-kindnesses, consolation, support, and spiritual gifts which we receive from and because of and through the Lord Jesus Christ....</i><br><br><i>... The Lord's tender mercies do not occur randomly or merely by coincidence....</i><br><br><i>We should not underestimate or overlook the power of the Lord's tender mercies.</i> ["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2005/04/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Tender Mercies of the Lord</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2005, 99–100]<br><br>What do these tender mercies look like in your life? How does the Lord answer your personal prayers? How does He affirm to you that you are on course? The answers to these questions are for you to ponder and then, as President Henry B. Eyring instructed, to recognize how the Lord communicates His tender mercies to us and to remember them (see "<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">O Remember, Remember</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2007, 66–69).<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball reaffirmed that God not only knows us and watches over us but He also often sends others to deliver His message to us (see "<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1974/12/small-acts-of-service?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Small Acts of Service</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> December 1974, 2–7). These members of our racing team include priesthood leaders who are aware of our needs and act upon spiritual promptings.<br><br>My daughter competed for a prestigious award in her senior year of high school that required several months of intense preparation and hard work. After passing several stages of competition, she reached the point of being one of 15 finalists for the award. It was a stressful time for her, and she was concerned about being able to demonstrate her abilities and talents. One Sunday morning before Church, our stake president made a point of congratulating her on her achievement. Then he took her hand, looked her squarely in the eyes, and said, "No matter what happens, <i>we</i> know who you are." To my daughter, and to all of us, that was a crowning point. Yes, she knew what she had put into preparing for the award and also what she had gained from it. Unlike the Indy 500, the final burst of speed was not the measure of her success. No matter what the judges decided in their assessment, she was a winner, and those who loved her, including the Lord, recognized her accomplishments.<br><br>One of the Lord's most powerful ways to relay messages to us is through the Holy Ghost. If we have prepared ourselves to receive and follow His communications, we can more successfully avoid the dangers along our course, and we will feel the peace and joy of the journey during the race. Messages from the Holy Ghost are quiet and still. Therefore, we must be willing to tune out the world and continually listen for and to his promptings. In his devotional speech here at BYU in January 2007, Elder Boyd K. Packer admonished:<br><br><i>You live in an interesting generation where trials will be constant in your life. Learn to follow the promptings of the Holy Ghost. It is to be a shield and a protection and a teacher for you. </i>["<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/boyd-k-packer_lehis-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lehi's Dream and You</a>," BYU devotional address, 16January 2007]<br><br>When we are looking for direction, guidance, and encouragement in our lives, reading and pondering the scriptures allows us to know the will of the Lord for us. In 2 Nephi 32:3 we are encouraged to "feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do." As we read the words of those who have traveled the course before us, we find courage and strength to learn from them and finish the race.<br><br>Our patriarchal blessings also provide warnings and guidance tailored to our specific needs. Elder Richard D. Allred said:<br><br><i>These blessings are inspired and are personal revelations to the recipient. Patriarchal blessings area guideline or similar to a road map that indicates the paths that may be traveled and destinations that may be reached if we stay within those paths. They may bring comfort and joy and encouragement when we have need to look, to listen, and to feel of the contents of these blessings so that we may go forward on life's journey, not alone, but with the accompanying Spirit of our Father in Heaven.</i> ["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1997/10/the-lord-blesses-his-children-through-patriarchal-blessings?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Lord Blesses His Children Through Patriarchal Blessings</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1997, 28]<br><h2><b>Finishing the Race</b></h2><br>What a blessing it is to recognize that the Lord has a plan for us and that He always has and will continue to guide, warn, and encourage us on our course. We have the guides and the tools to get us there. But let's be realistic. This race isn't easy--it is grueling. The Indy 500 is 200 times around the arena, and it is dangerous! Our race has eternal significance. It is our test, and the course isn't flat, nor is it straight. Trials will come and life will be challenging, but we need to know and remember Heavenly Father is there, and we must have faith that the flags and guides that He has prepared will help us achieve our ultimate goal.<br><br>In our race to the finish line, we need to anticipate and be ready for unexpected events that may hamper us on our course and detour us from our goal. Sometimes we don't anticipate that life doesn't always go as we dreamed or planned. When this happens, we may be tempted to think that Heavenly Father has forsaken us and reject the flags and guides that have been provided. We cannot think this way--we must stay in the race and keep our focus on the finish line. Elder Dallin H. Oaks gently reminded us that:<br><br><i>Many important things will occur in our lives that we have not planned, and not all of them will be welcome. ... Even our most righteous desires may elude us, or come in different ways or at different times than we have sought to plan.</i> ["<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/dallin-h-oaks_timing/">Timing</a>," BYU devotional address, 29 January 2002]<br><br>Like each of you, I have had my share of unexpected detours in my race. I had planned on marrying shortly after college, having 24children, and being a stay-at-home mom. Instead I married at an older age and only for a very short time, have only one child, and am a woman with a profession. My life wasn't how I had planned or even imagined it, but I have been richly blessed with perspective and patience, understanding of the Lord's timing, and a lovely daughter who is my friend. The lesson here is to keep going, keep building the kingdom, keep improving yourself, stay worthy of His blessings and His love, and stay on the course!<br><br>Remember, His timetable doesn't always look like ours. Disappointments will happen--you can count on it. But if you keep yourself focused on the finish line and what is really important, your disappointments will eventually fade. Elder Quentin L. Cook encouraged us when he said, "Even though our journey may be fraught with tribulation, the destination is truly glorious" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/04/our-fathers-plan-big-enough-for-all-his-children?lang=eng">Our Father's Plan--BigEnough for All His Children</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> May2009, 37).<br><br>Sometimes we might think of trials as pitfalls when, in fact, they may be the very things that help us stay on course. President Eyring taught us that none of us is exempt from trials and challenges. He helps us to understand that "we all must deal with adversity" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/04/adversity?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adversity</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2009, 23), and that even though trials aren't something we seek after, they are times when we can exercise our faith and grow from the experiences. He also taught us that we have to learn to get through the trials, that there are lessons to be learned, and that we can't bypass or skip certain parts of the race because they are unpleasant. During these times we need to pray like Nephi for our strength to be increased to get through and to learn the needed lessons the trial affords.<br><br>Knowing that our destination is the greatest gift that we can receive, we must be faithful and press on in order to achieve our goal. President Dieter F. Uchtdorf urged us to remember that the gospel of Jesus Christ is the answer to our problems and challenges and that we must continue faithful:<br><br><i>Brothers and sisters, we have to stay with it. We don't acquire eternal life in a sprint--this is a race of endurance. We have to apply and reapply the divine gospel principles. Day after day we need to make them part of our normal life.</i> ["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/04/the-way-of-the-disciple?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Way of the Disciple</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2009, 76]<br><br>I live in a community where many of my dear friends are dealing with physical challenges of varying types and degrees--the kind of trials that most of us may eventually have to accept as we progress into the twilight of our lives. I am impressed and humbled to observe that in spite of their challenges, they continue constant in their race along the course, always focused on the finish line. These experienced ones have the wisdom to know "that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong" (Ecclesiastes 9:11). My seasoned senior friends and neighbors are noble examples of those who continue fighting a good fight, pressing forward to finish their course, and keeping the faith (see 2 Timothy 4:7).<br><br>In the history of the Indy 500, there has only been one winner each year. Fortunately that isn't true in the race of life. In our race, the winners' circle is not limited to just one person; in fact, the circle will expand to encompass all those who finish the race. My brothers and sisters, my testimony to you today is that our Heavenly Father has a perfect plan for us. His plan is for all of us to live eternally with Him. We have qualified for the race of this earth life and, though the race course may at times be rough and obstacles may get in our way, we each must navigate our own course successfully. It is up to us to exercise our faith, follow the flags and warnings that He provides, and keep moving toward the finish line. Keep moving, brothers and sisters. Watch for the flags along the way. If you heed their messages of warning and encouragement and apply them in your lives, you will cross the finish line--you will achieve the prize. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Lynnette B.

<h1>ruth, and Grace: Three Interrelated Principles Necessary for Exaltation - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I have found over the years that as I read the scriptures closely, some are baffling. Some I have read over and over, and I still don't understand what they are saying. However, studying, pondering, praying, and meditating has, on occasion, brought insight and understanding. For example, two scriptures I initially found quite baffling were verses 6 and 7 of section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Speaking of the Savior, the scriptures state that "he descended below all things . . . that he might be in all and through all things, the light of truth; which truth shineth." That seems to say that Jesus' descent below all things allowed Him to illuminate the truth; however, the second phrase doesn't seem to make sense. Just how does truth <i>shine?</i> In another scripture, D&amp;amp;C 93:42, the Lord castigates Frederick G. Williams for "not [having] taught [his] children light and truth." I feel comfortable teaching my children truth, but how do I teach them light?<br><br>What is light, anyway? When I took an astronomy class my sophomore year here, Ilearned that light has the properties of a particle and a wave but was not technically either. Instead, it was a wavicle. I have no idea what that is; therefore, I'm even more baffled as to what exactly I am to teach to my children or why it should matter.<br><br>It was in my junior year here that I ran into the above scriptures and first pondered them. I must confess that I simply could not get my mind around them. Then one day some years later, understanding came.<br><br>I was one of a number of Church Educational System faculty to make presentations in a weeklong symposium held in Tempe, Arizona. That particular day I had gone to a nearby Laundromat to do some much-needed washing. As I was waiting for my clothes to dry, I read Doctrine and Covenants 93. Once again I was brought up against light and truth, but this time something happened. A number of scriptures slotted themselves into place and I understood. It is this understanding that I have chosen to share with you today.<br><br>We begin with a scripture well known to those who attend BYU: "The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36). Quite frankly, that one also baffled me, but I liked the idea of God having glory.<br><h2><b>The Glory of God</b></h2><br>The concept of glory is very prominent in the scriptures, especially as something bestowed on the faithful as part of their final reward. But what is glory? A modern dictionary gives us definitions such as "praise, honor, or distinction, . . . renown."<sup>1</sup> Over the centuries many Christian theologians such as Milton, Johnson, Thomas Aquinas, and C. S. Lewis have felt that this was the sense of the scriptural use. Specifically, <i>glory</i> denoted appreciation or approval from God. Thus the glory of God was the favor and respect He granted those who met with His divine approbation.<br><br>The definition given in section 93 does not quite fit such a definition, at least so far as the glory associated with God is concerned. His glory, as defined under inspiration, is something associated with His very nature, not just something He bestows upon others. For example, Moses not only shared in the glory of God but also saw it. The account in Moses 1:2 states, "And he saw God face to face, and he talked with him, and the glory of God was upon Moses; therefore Moses could endure his presence." There is no doubt that Moses was under God's favor, but this revelation shows that God's glory was a capacitating agent that made it possible for Moses to bear God's actual presence. That, however, was not all. Through that power, Moses was endowed with sufficient intellect to understand to a degree the nature of God's work. The Lord stated that He would show Moses the workmanship of His hands, "but not all, for my works are without end, and also my words, for they never cease" (Moses 1:4). He then explained why He would not show Moses all His works: "No man can behold all my works," He said, "except he behold all my glory; . . . and afterwards remain in the flesh on the earth" (Moses 1:5). This scripture suggests that it is God's glory that gives him the capacity to be all-seeing. Further, the ability to behold all that glory would require such a change in the basic constitution of a person that he would be more than mortal.<br><h2><b>Light as an Aspect of Glory</b></h2><br>A modern dictionary gives as a secondary definition of <i>glory</i> "a ring or spot of light."<sup>2</sup> Here, glory is associated with radiance. The dictionary gives one the feeling that such association is very limited. That, however, is not the case in a dictionary available to Joseph Smith. According to that dictionary, glory is first and foremost "brightness" and "splendor."<sup>3</sup> Only in a secondary sense is it defined as "fame" or "praise." The 1828 dictionary notes that, in a scriptural sense, glory is a manifestation of the presence of God.<sup>4</sup> This meaning accords much better with Joseph Smith's use of the term. For example, while recounting his First Vision, he wrote:<br><br><i>I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me.</i><br><br><i>. . . I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description.</i> [JS--H 1:16–17]<br><br>Writing of this experience on another occasion, he stated, "I was enwrapped in a heavenly vision, and saw two glorious personages, who exactly resembled each other in features and likeness, surrounded with a brilliant light which eclipsed the sun at noon day."<sup>5</sup> In these passages, glory is directly associated with radiance. This association fits nicely with the idea expressed in D&amp;amp;C 93 that light is a constituent part of glory.<br><br>To ancient Israel, one of the important aspects of God was His ability to display His power through the manifestation of burning light. Indeed, Israel stood in awe because of the display of a brilliance like a devouring inferno on the top of Sinai (see Exodus 24:17). Moses proclaimed, "The Lord thy God is a consuming fire" (Deuteronomy 4:24). His presence was manifest on more than one occasion by a pillar of fire, which gave light to Israel but vexed the Egyptians (see Exodus 13:21; 14:24). The cloud of His glory dwelt upon the tabernacle while its radiance filled the court (see Exodus 40:34). Such a phenomenon belongs not only to the past but also to the future. The Lord has promised Saints that<br><br><i>this generation shall not all pass away until an house shall be built unto the Lord, and a cloud shall rest upon it, which cloud shall be even the glory of the Lord, which shall fill the house. </i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:5]<br><br>Like Moses, Joseph Smith knew well the glory associated with the presence of the Lord. Of His appearance in the Kirtland Temple, Joseph Smith reported, "His eyes were as a flame of fire; . . . his countenance shone above the brightness of the sun" (D&amp;amp;C 110:3). When He comes the second time, we are told that He will be "clothed in the brightness of his glory" (D&amp;amp;C 65:5). These are only a few of many references suggesting that light--or radiance--is an important aspect of glory.<br><h2><b>Light and the Process of Salvation</b></h2><br>But I have to ask again, what is light? A careful look at the way the term is used in the scriptures suggests that it is more than mere luminosity. We get a glimpse of the breadth of meaning ascribed to the word when the Lord stated, "The light which shineth, which giveth you light, is through him who enlighteneth your eyes, which is the same light that quickeneth your understandings" (D&amp;amp;C 88:11). This phrase defines light not only as something that makes vision possible but also as that force that activates and stimulates the intellect. Further, scripture tells us that light "is in all things," gives "life to all things," and "is the law by which all things are governed" (D&amp;amp;C 88:13). Thus a more full definition would make light an ever-present, life- and law-inducing power that manifests itself, among other ways, as natural light, intellectual activity, and the living energy in all things. The scriptures declare that this "light proceedeth forth from the presence of God to fill the immensity of space" and that it is "the power of God who sitteth upon his throne, who is in the bosom of eternity, who is in the midst of all things" (D&amp;amp;C 88:12–13).<br><br>To rephrase for emphasis, these scriptures suggest that the term <i>light</i> is used to describe an aspect of God's power that radiates out from Him, expanding with His work and will, enlightening, organizing, capacitating, and quickening as it does. Perhaps the best definition would be living and capacitating energy. This idea is expressed in the scripture that states, "That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day" (D&amp;amp;C 50:24). This scripture suggests that the continual reception of this living energy endows one with ability--one ability of which is to draw ever closer to perfection. Thus, the Lord states:<br><br><i>And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 88:67]<br><br>As one increases in light he increases in ability until he is able to comprehend all things.<br><h2><b>The Relationship Between Light and Truth</b></h2><br>One is not, however, glorified in light--or, as here defined, in power or energy. Exaltation is contingent upon the reception of the other, all-important element of which glory is composed, namely, truth. Section 93 teaches us, "He that keepeth [God's] commandments receiveth truth and light, until he is glorified in truth and knoweth all things" (D&amp;amp;C 93:28). The glorifying principle is truth. Defining truth, the scripture states that it is "knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come" (D&amp;amp;C 93:24).<sup>6</sup> In other words, truth is knowledge of what a Latter-day Saint hymn proclaims as "the sum of existence."<sup>7</sup> Truth defined in this way is always associated with light because truth can only be acquired through the power or the capacitating force of light. Without the faculty created by light, a fulness of truth could never be gained.<br><br>For example, if my spiritual mind is pint-sized, I can only hold a pint of truth. If God is to give me more, the capacity of my mind must be expanded. Light does the expansion. It enlarges, as it were, my mind. Thus if God wants to give me a quart of truth, He sends the light that enlarges my capacity and, thus, makes it possible for me to receive the larger endowment of truth.<br><h2><b>The Relationship Between Light, Truth, andObedience</b></h2><br>God does not give higher truths to just anyone. Indeed, the acquisition of both light and truth is dependent on obedience. Explaining the need and the reason for obedience, the Lord stated, "You shall live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God" (D&amp;amp;C 84:44). The explanation is simply this: If you want to have quality of life, you must be obedient. Again, the Lord explains why: "For the word of the Lord is truth, and whatsoever is truth is light, and whatsoever is light is Spirit, even the Spirit of Jesus Christ" (D&amp;amp;C 84:45). The factors of bringing quality of life--light and truth--are equated with the Spirit of Christ. And because He alone controls their dissemination through the bestowal of His Spirit, He can stipulate the means by which they are granted. Thus obedience to His will is absolutely requisite for those who would gainlife.<br><br>According to Doctrine and Covenants 131:7–8, "all spirit is matter." If this includes the Spirit of Christ, then its bestowal upon an individual is an impartation of actual celestial substance--actual elements of spirit producing higher power, higher capacity, higher life. The result of its infusion would be spiritual and intellectual capacitation, which would allow the individual to progress to the point that he could enjoy eternal life.<br><br>But the capacitating force of light would have to precede the possession of this celestial substance. The scripture continues:<br><br><i>And the Spirit giveth light to every man that cometh into the world; and the Spirit enlighteneth</i> [I take this to mean "gives truth to"] <i>every man through the world, that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit.</i><br><br><i>And every one that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit cometh unto God, even the Father.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 84:46–47]<br><br>Light (the capacitating power) and enlightenment (or truth) are received by acquisition of celestial element through the Spirit of Christ to those who obey the word. But first comes obedience to the word, then light, and finally truth.<br><br>Thus, all--word, light, truth, spirit--become united. They are inseparably welded together so that a person cannot be touched by one without being touched by all. Accordingly, the scripture states, "My voice is Spirit; my Spirit is truth; truth abideth and hath no end; and if it be in you it shall abound" (D&amp;amp;C 88:66). As noted already, that body which is filled with light--the power of God--can comprehend all things, namely, all truth.<br><br>For emphasis, let me say again that truth is the basis of glorification. Section 93 helps us understand why. In verse 30 we read, "All truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it, to act for itself, as all intelligence also; otherwise there is no existence." The very essence of existence is the ability of truth and intelligence to act for themselves. But here we find another baffling scripture. How can truth--which has been defined earlier as knowledge--act? It would be more comprehensible if the scripture stated that truth impels or causes righteous action. But that is not what the phrase states. And what does the scripture mean by "all truth"? Does it mean all kinds of truth? Can there be more than one kind of truth?<br><br>Understanding comes from the latter part of verse 30, which states that "all intelligence" is free to act for itself. As noted above, intelligence is equated with the glory of God--i.e., light and truth. But intelligence here is equated with a specific spiritual substance. Verse 29 of section 93 states that "intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be,"<sup>8</sup> and that this eternal material is the substance from which humankind's spirit is made.<br><br>Thus intelligence has two scriptural definitions. One is an abstraction designated as"light and truth," conveying the idea of mental acuity by which existence is cognized. The other is more concrete. It designates the central spiritual substance of being that is called "the light of truth." The context of verse 30 suggests that intelligence in this instance should be understood in the latter sense. Thus all intelligence--that is, humankind from spirit birth through resurrection--is free to act within the bounds in which God has placed it.<br><br>If <i>intelligence</i> has two definitions, so may truth. The Lord says all truth is independent in the sphere in which He has placed it. If truth is the knowledge of the sum of existence, then "all truth" would seem to define existence itself.<sup>9</sup> Thus all existence (or all things that exist--that is, truth) has a measure of independence in which it is free to act. Of this totality, that portion designated as intelligence and associated expressly with humankind is also free to act. Because it is a portion of the whole of reality, it is designated as the spirit part of truth.<br><br>To sum up this portion, "all intelligence" identifies a component of the spirit aspect of existence. The phrase "all truth" defines the whole of that existence. The condition for glorification is cognition of that whole. Cognition comes only with obedience and the acquisition of light, which allows truth to follow as the capstone and seal. Thus one is glorified in truth.<br><br>Note that God is the One who sets the bounds and conditions that make cognition possible. He has determined that man will be glorified only as he receives truth. But man can receive a fulness of truth only as he receives a fulness of light. Emphasizing this point are the verses that state:<br><br><i>Behold, here is the agency of man, and here is the condemnation of man; because that which was from the beginning is plainly manifest unto them </i>[i.e., truth],<i> and they receive not the light </i>[or capacitating power].<br><br><i>And every man whose spirit receiveth not the light is under condemnation.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 93:31–32]<br><br>Intelligence is free to choose or reject light. When it willfully rejects light, it also rejects truth, and condemnation follows.<br><h2><b>Christ as the Source of Light and Truth</b></h2><br>But what is the process by which mortals receive the glory of Christ? The Savior has answered, "I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me" (John 14:6). He here emphasizes that the only way to eternal life is through Him, and He explains the reason, stating that He will appoint nothing unto man "except it be by law, even as I and my Father ordained unto you, before the world was." Going on, He states, "Iam the Lord thy God; and I give unto you this commandment--that no man shall come unto the Father but by me or by my word, which is my law, saith the Lord" (D&amp;amp;C 132:11–12).<br><br>Here we see the central place that the word of Christ plays in the process of salvation. Man can only come to know God through the word of the Lord. But we have already seen that His "word" is equated with Spirit, light, and truth. Therefore, the reception of the word is the reception of light and truth. The Savior's objective is to bring obedient souls to a fulness of glory. He knows how, for He followed the way set down by the Father. And if man receives glory, it will be in the same way through which Christ received it.<br><br>God's glory consists in a fulness of light and truth. Christ was glorified as He, too, came to possess a fulness of light and truth. It did not happen all at once. Section 93 states:<br><br><i>And I, John, saw that he received not of the fulness at the first, but received grace for grace;</i><br><br><i>And he received not of the fulness at first, but continued from grace to grace, until he received a fulness.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 93:12–13]<br><h2><b>The Role of Grace</b></h2><br>The role played by grace in the process through which the Lord received a fulness of the glory of the Father was twofold: "He received ... grace for grace" and He "continued from grace to grace." But what does it mean to receive grace for grace and to go from grace to grace? The answer lies in the very nature of grace. The word denotes favor, kindness, and goodwill. Out of this comes the theological definition "the free unmerited love and favor of God" that brings divine assistance to His chosen ones.<sup>10</sup> The key expressions here are love and favor that motivates the Father to assist His children. To receive grace for grace is to receive assistance on the condition of giving assistance. But not just any kind of assistance will do. What transforms assistance into grace is the kindness and favor felt by the giver that is extended to the receiver when such service may not even be deserved.<br><br>But grace does not have to be given without condition. Indeed, an important aspect of the word is reciprocity. The scripture states specifically that man receives "grace for grace" (D&amp;amp;C 93:20). Thus the extension of favor is meant to obligate the recipient so that she or he will extend the same. As they meet this condition, more grace is extended to them, which further obligates them to greater assistance to others.<br><br>Apparently it was necessary for the Lord to grow through this process. In order to do so, He first received grace, or divine assistance, from the Father. This grace He extended to His brethren. As He did so, He received even more grace. The process continued until He eventually received a fulness of the glory of the Father--or all light and truth. The implication of this process is interesting: in a very real way, Christ Himself was saved by grace.<br><br>It is the same with us. The Lord promised, "If you keep my commandments you shall receive of his [God's] fullness, and be glorified in me as I am in the Father; therefore, I say unto you, you shall receive grace for grace" (D&amp;amp;C 93:20).<br><br>Thus to those who serve, the Lord gives grace. That is, He imparts to them light and truth--that is, capacity plus enlightenment.<br><h2><b>Summary</b></h2><br>An essential part of the glory of God is light--or living, life-giving energy. In the scriptural sense, light is a capacitating power through which the righteous are given the faculty to receive truth. Possession of truth is the condition of glorification. A fulness of truth--or the knowledge of the sum of existence--requires the acquisition of the fulness of light. The grace of God plays a direct part in the reception of light and truth. Grace expresses itself through impartation. That which is imparted is light. The agency of man is expressed in accepting or rejecting light. But he is not free to accept or reject grace. Grace comes to all men freely, as it is the unmerited favor that God holds for all His children. Grace allows light to flow unto each person. Thus light, through grace, is freely manifest unto all. When people reject light, they reject God's favor and cut themselves off from truth. Thus they stand under condemnation. When they accept grace by accepting the light, they are capacitated to receive truth. As they continue from grace to grace by giving grace for grace, they receive more light and truth until they are eventually glorified in truth.<br><br>It is my prayer that we may grow in light and truth as we extend loving service to others unto the perfect day. In Jesus' name, amen.<br><br><i>Richard D.

<h1>You Expect?: A Key to Personal Happiness - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, I am honored to be before you today in this devotional setting. I never imagined, as a BYU student in 1968, that in my future I would ever have something important enough to say that several hundred students would show up to hear me--unless, of course, they were getting course credit and Iwas taking roll! I appreciate the confidence others have shown in me by asking me to speak to you. Since I always start class with a joke or something humorous, I will do the same today to get you into a better mood and help me relax.<br><br>I was recently searching the want ads in the newspaper and found some interesting ones. As an editor, I generally read things carefully. Evidently some people do not edit their ads before publishing them. Here are some I found:<br><br>Illiterate? Write today for free help!<br><br>Dog for sale: Eats anything and is fond of children.<br><br>For sale: Antique desk suitable for lady with thick legs and large drawers.<br><br>Free puppies: Half cocker spaniel, half sneaky neighbor's dog.<br><br>Nice parachute! Never opened, used once.<br><br>Now to more serious matters. When I was a young boy, 13 years old, I was about to enter junior high school in Grand Junction, Colorado. I am the oldest of five boys and thus felt some pressure to accomplish great things and be a good example for my four younger brothers. I expected that junior high would be difficult. I wouldn't know all the kids, since in junior high we came from several different elementary schools. The thought of going from classroom to classroom made me wonder if I would get lost and look like a fool. I wondered: What if some of the teachers are mean? And I was most worried about how skinny I was at the time and about my new crop of pimples. (When you think about it, how does <i>anyone</i> survive junior high school?)<br><br>Most of all I worried that I would not compete well academically with the other students, as being a scholar was my goal. So I was a bundle of nerves that summer of 1962.<br><br>Fortunately I was blessed with a great mom who always seemed to be able to calm me down. Let me show you a photo of me making homemade fudge with my mother in 1953. The <i>Salt Lake Tribune</i> took the picture and published my mom's great no-cook fudge recipe. This is where I got my sweet tooth! As I was worrying about starting junior high, my mom calmed me down with one of the wisest, most caring, and rational statements a mom could make to her worrywart son.<br><br>She said, "Jeff, we don't care what your grades are. All we expect is that you do your best. If you do your best, we will be proud of you regardless of your grades."<br><br>With that statement my anxiety was cut in half, and I started looking forward to junior high. After all, I could not control my final GPA, but I could control how hard I tried. I couldn't control my intelligence, which was average--okay, maybe a little above average--how mean the teachers would be, how smart the other students would be, or even my final grade in any particular class. But control my levels of dedication and effort? I could do that!<br><br>Mom taught me the value of setting realistic expectations in life that day. She taught me that <i>process </i>or<i> effort</i> is more important and manageable than the <i>final outcome.</i> So for over a half century of living I have used her wise counsel in my life to accomplish much, get over my failures, keep perspective in all I do, and not beat myself up when I don't succeed the first time.<br><br>Thus my topic today is "What Do You Expect? A Key to Personal Happiness." My questions for you today are "What do you expect of yourself and of life?" and "How are your expectations influencing how happy you are day to day?"<br><br>Expectations are thoughts or beliefs we have about ourselves, our relationships, and what happens to us in life. They are crucial, as they are the standards or yardsticks by which we judge what happens to us and how satisfied or unsatisfied we are with ourselves and with life. I want to focus on two kinds of expectations today: what we expect of ourselves and what we expect of our relationships. I want to start with two kinds of thoughts or expectations we sometimes have of ourselves and of life that can get us into trouble. They can lead to depression, anxiety, and a sense of failure. Avoiding these expectations or thoughts we carry around in our heads can change our way of looking at the world and, ultimately, how we feel emotionally. They directly affect whether or not we are happy.<br><br>The two popular thinking errors we humans seem destined to make and that can cause us much misery in life were first scientifically identified by world-renowned psychologists Aaron Beck and David Burns, both cognitive-behavioral psychotherapists. They discovered 10 thinking errors or cognitive distortions that cause us emotional pain. These distortions are at the root of depression, anxiety, and poor self-esteem. I will focus on two especially common ones and on the related problem of perfectionism. They are:<br><ul><br> 	<li>All-or-nothing thinking</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Overgeneralization</li><br></ul><br>Theory and research over the last 50 years show that emotions or feelings are based not on the event or the world we perceive but rather on <i>how we interpret</i> events and the world. This is referred to as the cognitive therapy approach in psychology. Burns' important book is called <i>Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy.</i> It is from that source that I will quote.<br><br>Let me refer to a figure in Burns' book that shows the theory in a simplified manner. It shows "the relationship between the world andthe way you feel."<br><br>First, "world" is labeled as "a series of positive, neutral, and negative events."<br><br>Second, the label on "thoughts" says, "You interpret the events with a series of thoughts that continually flow through your mind. This is called your 'internal dialog'" (or self-talk).<br><br>The third and last label, found on "mood," says, "Your feelings are created by your <i>thoughts </i>and not the actual<i> events</i>. All experiences must be processed through your brain and given a conscious meaning <i>before </i>you experience any emotional response."<sup>1</sup><br><br>This model emphasizes that we don't usually just feel an emotion spontaneously; rather, we create our feelings from our thought processes. Depending on our thoughts, we experience certain feelings. This model has been widely supported by empirical research in the field of psychology, and Burns' approach is generally recognized as one of the most potent treatments in all of psychotherapy for the treatment of a wide variety of emotional disorders. Lest you think (or, shall we say, <i>expect</i>) that problems like depression and anxiety are uncommon, it is predicted that more than one in four of you will have one of these problems sometime during your life. Or you may know someone with these problems and be in a position to help.<br><br>Scriptural support for Beck and Burns' theory can be found in the following:<br><br>Proverbs 23:7: "For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he."<br><br>President Ezra Taft Benson emphasized: "Daily, constantly, we choose by our desires, our thoughts, and our actions whether we want to be blessed or cursed, happy or miserable."<sup>2</sup><br><br>Norman Vincent Peale exclaimed: "Change your thoughts and you will change your world."<sup>3</sup><br><br>Now let me demonstrate how these cognitive distortions, or unrealistic expectations of ourselves and of life, can harm our mental and relationship health. Let's first look at the problem of all-or-nothing thinking. This is also called "black-and-white thinking." When we do this, we think of life's events and people in extreme categories: black or white, righteous or unrighteous, good or bad. You may think, "Since I flunked that quiz, that means I'm a failure." Or, " Since she turned me down for a date, that proves I'm a loser." (This is also referred to as "catastrophizing.") These cognitions or thoughts will cause you to be depressed.<br><br>What if, instead, you got off the phone after being turned down for a date and said to yourself, "Wow! Too bad for her! She missed a chance to go out with the best-looking guy in Provo. That's her loss, not mine!" You would then feel less depressed. Of course you may also be exaggerating your own personal qualities!<br><br>The fact is, most of what happens to us cannot be thought of in black-and-white or all-or-nothing terms. No one is absolutely brilliant or totally stupid. People are not absolutely righteous or unrighteous. We are all just more or less so! The fact is, much of life is gray, not black or white.<br><br>Related to all-or-nothing thinking is the cognitive habit of overgeneralization. This happens when you arbitrarily conclude that something that happened to you once will occur over and over again. It is analogous to dropping a drop of black ink into a container of clear water; soon the whole container turns gray or black. It is exemplified in the earlier example of the young man who after being turned down by a prospective date decided hewas the world's biggest loser.<br><br>We use all-or-nothing thinking and overgeneralization in the service of another toxic habit called perfectionism. Perfectionism is defined as the obsessive and rigid desire or expectation that we must do things perfectly or life is not good. Sometimes we apply it to even trivial things like mopping a floor or straightening up our desk. (By the way, a clean desk is the sign of a sick mind!) If something is not done just right, perfectly, we consider ourselves failures. It is directly related to all-or-nothing thinking: Either I am a success or a failure. Either I'm perfect or imperfect. And I cannot stand not to be perfect! Average is not for me!<br><br>Perfectionism, or having unrealistic or irrational expectations about ourselves or about our relationships, is a chief cause of depression, anxiety, and obsessive-complusive disorders, as well as relationship problems. Perfectionism leads to procrastination, which leads eventually to paralysis. We call these the three Ps. A college student who was a client of mine several years ago related this story about his perfectionism:<br><br><i>I set such high standards for the projects I did for class that when I thought about even starting a project I would feel anxious and nauseated. That would lead me to procrastinate beginning the project or doing even one section of it. Eventually it led to me feeling paralyzed. I remember staring at the instructions from the professor, getting anxious, then waiting until the last minute to quickly do the project and turn it in the next day. My perfectionism led to me getting less-than-perfect grades on projects.</i><br><br>When I asked this young man to make a list of the advantages and disadvantages of his perfectionism, he came up with four advantages (e.g., he thought he did a better job when he was perfectionistic, although his grades did not show it). He then listed 17 disadvantages to perfectionism, some of them just discussed. He then started reconsidering the value of perfectionism in his life!<br><br>Even God does not expect us to be perfect in this life. It simply cannot be done. Norma Ashton, speaking to the BYU women, said:<br><br><i>Know that you don't have to be perfect. We aren't even expected to achieve perfection in this life, but rather to make steady progress toward it. We are masochists, sometimes, and I think we allow ourselves to succumb to the failed-diet syndrome--you overeat one time and think, "That's it. I've blown it. No reason to stay on the diet now." When we fall short of the mark we feel we've blown it, that we'll never be able to measure up to everything we're told to do. So, in effect, we give up. This thought pattern is a very clever and successful tool of the adversary. We must keep trying, but we must be able to forgive ourselves when we can't do it all. We can make do with our present and look forward.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>This suggests a more rational and productive way to think about life: Just do your best--like my mom said!<br><br>I like these quotes from other wise people:<br><br><i>Happy people do their part, do their best, then let go and let God do the rest. They do what they can within their circle of influence.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br><i>God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things Ican, and the wisdom to know the difference.</i><br><br>(This prayer has been successfully used in Alcoholics Anonymous for the past 70 years.)<br><br>These ideas suggest that <i>process </i>is more important than<i> outcome</i>. Burns suggests developing a process orientation to life: "This means you focus on processes rather than outcomes as a basis for evaluating things."<sup>6</sup> This more rational way of thinking emphasizes:<br><br>"The journey <i>is</i> the destination."<br><br>"Don't audit life. Show up and make the most of it now."<sup>7</sup><br><br>Let's apply this process idea to a common problem today: looking for a job. When you are applying for work, do not make it your aim to get the perfect job; instead, make it your aim to do your best to develop a great résumé, contact employers, and interview well. Most people who get a decent job do so after first receiving an average of 10 to 15 rejections. This is because the outcome of job hunting depends on many more factors than just you. The outcome depends on many factors outside your control. For example: How many other applicants are there? What are their qualifications? Who knows the boss' daughter? So, instead, focus on what you can control, and that's your effort. If you make a great effort each day, you should feel proud and satisfied. You will feel less depressed and discouraged than if you expect that landing a great job equals success. And you will eventually land a job. Maybe even a great one!<br><br>What should we do when we make mistakes? What should our expectations be then?<br><br>Burns quotes a student, Jennifer, as saying: "It's good to make mistakes because then we learn--in fact, we won't learn <i>unless</i> we make mistakes. No one can avoid making mistakes--and since it's going to happen in any case, we may as well accept it and learn from it."<sup>8</sup><br><br>Jennifer also said: "<i>We don't die</i> if we make mistakes!"<sup>9</sup><br><br>Focus instead on what you can learn from your mistakes. An example of this for me happened when I was in the U.S. Coast Guard being trained as an officer and a gentleman at Officer Candidate School in August 1974. The platoon leaders lined us up each day at 6 a.m. to inspect for dirt on our uniforms, wrinkles in our shirts, unshined shoes, and even lint on our black uniforms (white lint really showed up!). I got "gigged"--or punished--every time they found anything out of order, even something very minor. When you were gigged, you lost points on a chart, and if you lost enough points, they kicked you out of the program. During the first two weeks I lost 20 points and was getting discouraged. Then it occurred to me that instead of beating myself up over my mistakes, I should use them as learning experiences. After that, each time I got gigged, I wrote down a note to myself of what <i>not</i> to do the next time. Eventually I was passing inspection every week and not losing any points. Looking back, I know now that the platoon leaders were purposely finding any little mistake to nail us for just to see how we would react. There was no such thing as a perfect uniform after all. If we catastrophized and got angry or discouraged when we got gigged, their conclusion was that we certainly would not be able to handle stress well enough at sea to be leaders in the U.S. Coast Guard. And they were right.<br><br>In reality, the secret to happiness is to set modest, realistic goals and then accomplish them. Climbing mountains is important, but each of us has our own mountain to climb. And <i>we </i>decide what a successful climb is!<br><br>A good example of using this principle in my own life occurred in September 2008. My oldest son, Geoffrey; his wife, Kerstin; and their son, Cameron, invited me to hike to the top of Mount Timpanogos. Since coming to BYU 22 years ago, I have always wanted to do that--every time I looked up at that most beautiful mountain north of our campus. I agreed to go, but then discovered the hike was almost 12 miles round trip. And of course the first six miles were all uphill! And this was in the heat of the summer.<br><br>I was close to 60 years old at the time and not in very good physical shape. But I figured if I took it easy and drank a lot of water, I could make it. And Geoff and Kerstin were experienced backpackers, so I felt safe with them. Plus my other son Dillon agreed to take my 40-pound backpack most of the way up the trail for me.<br><br>We hiked for a whole day, and by the time we arrived about one mile from the summit and pitched camp, I found myself exhausted. I had been stopping for a breath about every 75 yards for the last hour. I saw the top of that beautiful mountain and thanked God that I was there! But I also realized that I did not have the physical stamina to go to the very top the next day, plus hike down six miles with a full backpack, most likely in the middle of a rainstorm that was forecast for the next day.<br><br>At that moment I changed my expectations! I wisely decided, "I have climbed my mountain! I have seen the top! I have survived a hike I was not sure I would survive!" I was joyous, but I had to fight off the normal protests from my son that I was only one mile from the summit and I might someday regret not going to the very top. I told him, "That's okay. You guys summit tomorrow. I have climbed my mountain!"<br><br>Now some of you may be thinking that I wimped out by changing my expectations in the middle of the hike. That's understandable. However, had I gone on, I might not have been here today making this speech. Little did I know at that time that the breathing problem I was suffering was due to two clogged arteries in my heart that were 95 percent closed--a problem that was not diagnosed and treated until just two months ago. Had I continued to the top of Timp that day, I might still be there--buried with a great view!<br><br>A funny thing happened later: my cardiologist, who did not know this story, told me after surgery in May: "You can pretty much exercise the way you were before, but don't go climbing Timp this weekend!"<br><br>But how does God feel about our lack of perfection? I like this quote: "God loves you because of who God <i>is,</i> not because of anything you did or didn't do."<sup>10</sup><br><br>What about the times when our expectations (even realistic ones) are not met? How do we best respond? My mom, the fountain of all knowledge, would say, "Count your blessings, it could be worse!" Perhaps she got this counsel from one of my favorite hymns. Let's look at the first verse:<br><br>"When upon life's billows you are tempest-tossed, When you are discouraged, thinking all is lost." All is lost? That is overgeneralization combined with catastrophizing! Help! All is lost! "Count your many blessings; name them one by one, And it will surprise you what the Lord has done."<sup>11</sup> This is the strategy I try to use when trouble or discouragement shows up in my life. The message here is to take perspective with all your problems. If we compare our blessings to our misfortunes, my guess is most of us would have many of the former and fewer of the latter.<br><br>It has been said, "Happy people count their blessings, while the miserable complain about theirs."<sup>12</sup> That's like complaining that you missed a call on your miniature computer attached to your ear, which is connected to a multimillion-dollar satellite circling the earth hundreds of miles away, thanks to the work of many talented scientists. This device is also referred to as your cell phone. It will even take pictures you can send instantly to your mom! What would the pioneers say if they heard this? By the way, how many of you are texting right now?<br><br>As President Monson said, "Everyone can be discontented if he ignores his blessings and looks only at his burdens."<sup>13</sup><br><br>What about unrealistic expectations about relationships? Here are a few that will get you into trouble. They are from my book for singles called <i>Should We Stay Together? </i>For those looking to get married here are a few:<br><br>"There is one and only one right person in the world for you to marry."<sup>14</sup> This is, of course, an example of all-or-nothing thinking. Fortunately for most of us there are several people in the world we could be happy with. Otherwise, why would people remarry after the death of a beloved spouse and be just as happy with the second spouse?<br><br>Another irrational belief or expectation is "Choosing someone to marry is a 'decision of the heart.'"<sup>15</sup> The fact is, if more people used their heads in the mate-selection process, the divorce rate might not be nearly so high.<br><br>Next, how about this myth: "Preparing for marriage 'just comes naturally.'"<sup>16</sup> This is called "the myth of naturalism"<sup>17</sup>--that it's just <i>natural t</i>o know what it takes to be happily married. You don't need to take a class! Why spend your tuition money on that? Everyone knows how to be happily married! We simply learn it naturally from our parents and TV! This is scary when you consider half of the parents in the United States and most on TV are divorced!<br><br>For the marrieds in the audience, here are a couple of marriage myths for you to consider from my second book, <i>The Great Marriage Tune-Up Book:</i><br><br>"If my spouse loves me, he [or she] should <i>instinctively </i>know what I want and need to be happy."<sup>18</sup> This is the ESP, or extra-sensory perception, myth--expecting our partner to be able to read our mind.<br><br>Another myth is "Marriage can fulfill all of my needs."<sup>19</sup> No, you still need a close relationship with God, good friends, family members, hobbies, and a golf or tennis game to be happy, even if you are married!<br><br>I hope you don't believe the myth that "couples should keep their problems to themselves and solve them alone."<sup>20</sup> Too many couples keep their problems to themselves until it is too late and the relationship is so dysfunctional that it is nearly impossible to repair, even in therapy. Most couples who divorce say they never went to marriage counseling or they waited too long to go. If they could speak to us now, their message to us would be "Reach out for help before it is toolate!"<br><br>In conclusion, today I have made a case for carefully considering your expectations and thoughts about life in order to be happier. I want to end my talk with two quotes related to expectations about life from two of my favorite people: President Gordon B. Hinckley and his wife, Sister Marjorie Pay Hinckley.<br><br>President Hinckley once quoted Jenkin Lloyd Jones, who said:<br><br><i>Anyone who imagines that bliss is normal is going to waste a lot of time running around shouting that he has been robbed.</i><br><br><i>Most putts don't drop. Most beef is tough. . . . Life is like an old-time rail journey--delays, sidetracks, smoke, dust, cinder and jolts, interspersed only occasionally by beautiful vistas and thrilling bursts of speed.</i><br><br><i>The trick is to thank the Lord for letting you have the ride.</i><sup>21</sup><br><br>My mom not only made great fudge, she also had a great sense of humor. Sister Hinckley, like my mom, also had a sense of humor. She said this: "The only way to get through life is to laugh your way through it. You either have to laugh or cry. I prefer to laugh. Crying gives me a headache."<sup>22</sup><br><br>It is my prayer that this message has not given you a headache but rather some ideas to consider in improving your own personal happiness. By being more aware and then more realistic in our expectations and thoughts about life and other people, we can become happier than we would otherwise by expecting life or others to change for us. I testify that my mom was right and that these principles are true, as Ihave tried to live them all my life. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Jeffry H.

<h1>Face Leadership: “As a Man Speaketh unto a Friend” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
When I arrived at BYU eight years ago, I was in my office organizing books and filing papers when I received a phone call informing me that there had been a glitch in payroll processing and that I would not be receiving a paycheck during the first two months of my employment. I said thank you, hung up the phone, and then started thinking about how to break the news to my wife, Jan. Within minutes there was a knock at my office door. It was Ned Hill, who was then dean of the Marriott School of Management, and he was paying me an unexpected visit.<br><br>I made a place for him to sit down as he explained that he had just been informed about the payroll glitch and that he wanted to know what he could do to help me. I could see the sincerity in his face and hear the concern in his voice. In one hand he was holding what appeared to be his personal checkbook. In the other hand he was holding a pen that was already clicked. After I assured him that the LeBaron family would be fine, he asked about our move to Utah, my plans for research and teaching, and so forth. We talked briefly, and then he left.<br><br>With his visit of five minutes, Dean Hill quickly won me over. Instead of calling me to <i>his</i> office, sending an e-mail, or delegating the matter, he had walked across the building to have a brief face-to-face conversation. Although the interaction was not long, I felt heard, understood, and valued.<br><br>Sometimes it seems that part of being a professor is complaining about university administration--at most universities that's the glue that holds the faculty together. But when Dean Hill talked to the faculty in the Marriott School, people listened receptively. When he gave new directions, people followed respectfully. When he invited people to contribute money to expand the Tanner Building so that the business school could grow, the faculty gladly opened their personal checkbooks, their pens already clicked.<br><br>Our new dean, Gary Cornia, also practices the power of face-to-face leadership. To have a conversation with Gary is to feel like you have a friend in the dean's office. That's what I want to talk about today--not the grand public speeches to large audiences that we usually associate with leadership, but rather the relatively private conversations whereby leaders change people and transform organizations.<br><h2><b>Face-to-Face Leadership</b></h2><br>For about 16 years I have been doing research on organizational behavior and leadership. My approach has been anthropological; in other words, rather than study people within the context of a laboratory, I study them within their natural environments. Using microphones and video cameras, I go into organizations in which people are working and leading, and I capture their behavior "in the wild" by making recordings that I can then analyze closely and carefully. For me, leadership is not an abstract notion but rather a rich description of what people actually do.<br><br>When I want to observe and assess a leader's effectiveness, my favorite times to look are at moments of transition. Like the green that grows in the cracks of a sidewalk, leadership usually springs to life between activities and at the edges of events. For example, when I videotape a board meeting, I usually start recording before anyone has entered the room, because I have found that sometimes the most important displays of leadership happen before the meeting actually begins. "Boundary moments,"<sup>1</sup> such as openings and closings of conversations or meetings, are especially revealing.<br><br>To illustrate, here's a transcript of the opening of a telephone conversation at work. Within seconds the participants display a close, friendly relationship. Read carefully--this boundary moment happens very fast:<br><br><i>Art: [He picks up]</i> Hello?<br><br><i>Bob:</i> Hey!<br><br><i>Art:</i> HEY!<br><br><i>Bob: Hey!</i><br><br><i>Art:</i> What's happening?<br><br><i>Bob:</i> Hey, buddy!<br><br><i>Art:</i> Is this my buddy?<br><br><i>Bob:</i> Hey, you ain't got no buddies!<br><br><i>Art:</i> What's happening?<br><br><i>Bob:</i> Hey!<br><br><i>Art:</i> HEY!<br><br><i>Bob:</i> Did uh--<br><br><i>Art:</i> You ready for Thanksgiving?<br><br><i>Bob:</i> Yes.<br><br><i>Art:</i> All right!<br><br>That took 12 seconds. But within those 12 seconds, Art and Bob do important work. When Art picks up the phone and says hello, he shows that he is available. When Bob says "Hey!" at line 2, he shows that he can recognize Art's voice. When Art repeats "HEY!" at line 3, he loudly and enthusiastically shows both recognition and high regard. Through the next 12 lines of their conversational play, such as their inane repetition of the words "hey" and "buddy," they quickly communicate at least four important messages:<br><br>I hear you.<br><br>I understand you.<br><br>I like you.<br><br>I can work with you.<br><br>Art does not assert his power over Bob. He does not invoke an organizational title. Instead, he engages with Bob to interactively instantiate a close, cooperative, and creative relationship, the sort of relationship that may help their organization to thrive.<br><br>In contrast, here's the transcript of an excerpt from the opening of a different conversation at a different organization. These are the words of Eric, the owner and CEO of a company, as he talks to his management team at the start of a two-hour meeting:<br><br><i>Eric:</i> Where <i>I'm</i> at, I have to look at the assets in each and every one of you. 'Cause, you know, I could get real caught up in the negatives of each and every one of you. I don't <i>do</i> that. Even with her I don't do it. She's valuable. She, you know, she--maybe she doesn't have the ability to <i>move</i> with the company. She's more stationary in what her thought is.<br><br>In a variety of ways, Eric asserts his power and position through what he says and how he says it. Through talk he occupies the conversational floor, delivering a monologue about the way things are rather than a dialogue that invites and includes the views of others. He separates himself from his managers by using the pronouns "I" and "you" instead of "we." And he elevates himself above his managers by depicting them as the objects of his scrutiny.<br><br>Because this was a face-to-face meeting rather than a telephone conversation, I was able to record what people were doing with their bodies during this boundary moment. If you were to watch the video footage of this moment, you would see that the owner of this company embodies what his talk describes. While occupying the conversational floor, he also dominates the meeting space as he distributes himself around and on the conference table. He places himself literally apart or separate from his managers, who cluster at the opposite end of the conference room. And he elevates himself--or at least his feet--above all others in the room. The coordination of his talk and spatial maneuvers constitute a strong display of organizational status and power.<br><br>I have shown you two excerpts that are extreme and contrasting. Please do not think that one form of leadership is correct while the other is wrong. Rather, these extremes represent two ends of a continuum along which leaders must reside moment to moment and day to day. Sometimes leaders need to foster close relationships of relative equality. Occasionally, strong displays of power and difference may be necessary. Usually leaders must achieve an appropriate balance according to the contingencies of their situation. That's the hard part.<br><br>Within the MBA program, I teach required courses on leadership using the best readings that I can find. Did you know that, on average, a new book about leadership is published every 20 minutes? Most of these books contain endless lists of dos and don'ts that have been abstracted from the situations that make them meaningful and relevant. I tell students that the best way to learn leadership is to work closely with a great leader and to carefully watch what he or she does across a variety of circumstances, because we tend to become like the people that we attend. If working closely with someone like that is not possible, then I encourage students to read the autobiographies and biographies of great leaders, because stories keep the lessons of leadership alive. If reading is not possible, then students might as well take my class.<br><h2><b>Face-to-Face Leadership of Joseph Smith</b></h2><br>Joseph Smith was a great leader. In his day, thousands of converts crossed the world in an effort to be near him. Today, thousands of missionaries cross the world in an effort to be like him. What did the leadership of Joseph Smith look and sound like moment to moment and day to day? Unfortunately, we don't have video recordings that we can analyze, but we do have the written accounts of those who were there. Their journals are like ethnographic field notes. For example, consider a few excerpts from the journals of early Saints whogathered at Nauvoo, Illinois:<br><br>In 1841, Heber C. Kimball arrived with more than 100 immigrating Saints. He recorded:<br><br><i>We landed in Nauvoo on the 1st of July and when we struck the dock I think there were about 300 Saints there to meet us, and a greater manifestation of love and gladness I never saw before. President Smith was the first one that caught us bythe hand.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>Robert Crookston arrived the next year in the fall of 1842:<br><br><i>As we approached the landing place to our great joy we saw the Prophet Joseph Smith there to welcome his people who had come so far. We were all so glad to see him and set our feet upon the promised land so to speak. It was the most thrilling experience of my life for I know that he was a Prophet of God</i>.<sup>3</sup><br><br>Thomas Steed crossed the Atlantic in 1844. He said:<br><br><i>The Prophet Joseph was at the pier. At first glance I could tell that it was him. . . . He came on board to shake hands and welcome us by many encouraging words, and express his thankfulness that we had arrived in safety.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>Christopher Layton, also a British convert, said:<br><br><i>There stood our Prophet on the banks of the river to welcome us! As he heartily grasped our hands, the fervently spoken words, "God bless you," sank deep into our hearts, giving us a feeling of peace such as we had never known before.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>Researchers look for patterns. Do you see the obvious patterns in these accounts? The Prophet understood, or at least practiced, the power of face-to-face leadership. Although terribly busy with the weight of the kingdom on his shoulders, he made other people's transitions his own boundary moments. Within seconds, his glance, his handshake, and the kind words he communicated sent these messages:<br><br>I see you.<br><br>I understand you.<br><br>I love you.<br><br>I want to work with you.<br><br>He powerfully embodied what his words described.<br><br>One of my favorite accounts of Joseph Smith's leadership comes from the journal of my own great-great-grandfather, Benjamin Franklin Johnson. At the age of 14, Benjamin moved to Kirtland, Ohio, with his family. Although his mother had joined the Church, his father was not interested and refused to allow Benjamin to be baptized. Based on his journal accounts, it seems that he was a shy teenager who sometimes stood on the periphery of meetings and activities. When the Kirtland Temple was dedicated, the Prophet went to a nearby schoolhouse, and he gave blessings to those who had worked on the temple. The process of giving blessings took three days! Benjamin was there, and he recorded this in his journal:<br><br><i>When on the last day of blessings, I was standing by the door in the crowded congregation, and oh! how I did yearn for a blessing! And as the last blessing, apparently, was given, the Prophet earnestly looked towards the door where I was standing, and he said to his brother Hyrum, "Go and see if there is not one more yet to be blessed." Brother Hyrum came to the door, and seeing me, put his hand upon my shoulder and asked me if I had not worked upon the Temple. I said, "No sir," but it seemed like passing a sentence upon my fondest hopes. He then asked if I had done nothing towards it. I then thought of the new gun I had earned and given as a donation, and of the brick I had helped to make. I said, "I did give often." "I thought," he said, "there was a blessing for you," and he almost carried me to the stand. The Prophet blessed me. . . . I felt then that the Lord had respect for my great desire.</i><br><br><i>Even to be the youngest and last to be blessed seemed to me a high privilege. When the Prophet had looked towards the door, I felt as though he would call for me, though I could not see how I had merited so high a privilege. But so it was, and my joy was full.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>After three days on his feet, I'm guessing that Joseph Smith was tired and maybe had a pain between his shoulders from keeping his hands constantly elevated. But when the boundary moment came--this time a closing rather than an opening--the Prophet attended to the silent prayer of a teenager standing at the back of the room near the door. How did Hyrum know where to go when Joseph said, "Go and see if there is not one more?" I think I know the answer. When transitions emerge within organizational settings, people literally look toward the leader for an embodied answer to the question "What are we going todo now?" Hyrum must have looked toward Joseph and seen that he was oriented in Benjamin's direction.<br><br>My great-great-grandfather lived a long and faithful life as a missionary, pioneer, and colonizer. Today he has thousands of descendents. Before his death in 1905, he stood in the Salt Lake Tabernacle and bore testimony of Joseph Smith as one of the last to have personally known him.<br><br>How did Joseph Smith become such a powerful leader capable of changing people and transforming a worldwide organization? One answer is that he worked closely with a great leader and carefully observed what He did across a variety of circumstances. When Joseph was 14 years old, he was also struggling at the periphery of religious activity, desperate and yearning for a blessing, and the Lord had respect for his great desire. With the First Vision, Joseph entered into an apprenticeship with the Lord and gradually became more like the leader that he attended.<br><br>Another answer is that Joseph read the scriptures, which contain the autobiographies and biographies of great leaders, including Jesus Christ. By continually studying and eventually translating sacred texts, the Prophet must have gleaned lessons of leadership from the various stories and situations that make those lessons meaningful and relevant. Consider, for example, the Book of Mormon account of Christ's visit to the Americas.<br><h2><b>Face-to-Face Leadership of Jesus Christ</b></h2><br>According to 3 Nephi 11, the resurrected Lord appeared to those who were gathered at the temple in the land of Bountiful. Beginning in verse 8, we read:<br><br><i>And it came to pass, . . . they cast their eyes up again towards heaven; and behold, they saw a Man descending out of heaven; and he was clothed in a white robe; and he came down and stood in the midst of them; and the eyes of the whole multitude were turned upon him, and they durst not open their mouths.</i><br><br>Many boundary moments involve the arrival of someone who others don't recognize or know. In the MBA program, students are taught to introduce themselves not just by saying their names but also by quickly telling their story so that others can know, appreciate, and remember them. The Lord does something like that in verses 9–11:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that he stretched forth his hand and spake unto the people, saying:</i><br><br><i>Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world.</i><br><br><i> And behold, I am the light and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world.</i><br><br>During the openings of social encounters and organizational events, participants must quickly negotiate their relationships, their way of being together, and who they are in relation to one another and the task at hand. In verses 12–15 we read one of the most sacred accounts of face-to-face leadership that has ever been recorded:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words the whole multitude fell to the earth; ...</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto them saying:</i><br><br><i>Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that the multitude went forth, and thrust their hands into his side, and did feel the prints of the nails in his hands and in his feet; and this they did do, going forth one by one until they had all gone forth, and did see with their eyes and did feel with their hands, and did know of asurety and did bear record.</i><br><br>The scriptures tell us that they <i>all</i> went forth, one by one, "about two thousand and five hundred souls" (3 Nephi 17:25). You do the math. If each person faced the Lord for only five seconds, the process lasted for about four hours. Here is another lesson about the importance of face-to-face leadership. Despite the investment of time and effort, the Lord briefly but unmistakably communicated with each individual:<br><br>I see you.<br><br>I understand you.<br><br>I love you.<br><br>I have died for you.<br><br>The risen Lord powerfully embodied what His words described.<br><br>The closing of the Savior's visit, recorded in 3 Nephi 17, is at least as powerful and sacred as the opening. In verses 4 and 5 we read:<br><br><i>But now I go unto the Father, and also to show myself unto the lost tribes of Israel. . . .</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that when Jesus had thus spoken, he cast his eyes round about again on the multitude, and beheld they were in tears, and did look steadfastly upon him as if they would ask him to tarry a little longer with them.</i><br><br>Not only did the Lord stay a little longer, but He also wept with them, blessed their children and their little ones, and taught them things too sacred to be recorded. For those of us who are preoccupied with time management, here is a lesson of leadership. Evidently, the God of the universe changed or delayed His schedule to answer the silent prayers of those who were yearning for a blessing. During this boundary moment, the Lord had respect for their great desires, confirming that our prayers are not a monologue about the inevitable but rather a dialogue that invites and includes us.<br><h2><b>Seeking the Face of the Lord</b></h2><br>Sometimes the glorious accounts of 3 Nephi seem far removed from our condition. Within organizations, including here at BYU, people too often feel lonely, isolated, and confused. Ironically this kind of alienation comes "not from a lack of communication but from a surplus of the wrong kind."<sup>7</sup> Our lives are awash with memos, e-mails, and instant messages. Sometimes these are helpful and efficient, but they are also flat and faceless--they're easily discarded, deleted, and ignored.<br><br>One of the oldest poems in the English language is preserved in the "Exeter Book." This book was written or copied in about AD 975. The poem itself may have been composed in about AD 500, approximately 1,500 years ago.<br><br>The poem is entitled "The Wanderer." The teller describes himself wandering alone; having lost his leader and his people in battle, he is now searching for a new home--a place of warmth and leadership. To the wanderer all weather is wintry and all landscapes are lonely. Here are a few excerpts from this poem, translated into modern English:<br><br><i>There is now none of the living to whom I dare clearly say my heart's thought. . . . </i><br><br><i>. . . After the time, in years long past, that I covered my </i>[leader]<i> in the darkness of earth; and thence downcast I crossed over the woven waves, winter-sad, yearning for a hall . . . where, far or near, I might find one who should know of my people or would comfort me friendless, receive me with gladness.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>In the final stanza of the poem, the narrative voice shifts to include all people, including us, suggesting that the wanderer's experience is universal. In other words, all of us are wanderers. Although we may wrap our bodies in many layers of comfort--clothes, blankets, carpets, roofs, and walls--we cannot escape the winters of this world. And although we may surround ourselves with other people at the office, the school, or the stadium, we remain fundamentally alone, even in a crowd.<br><br>Coincidentally, we have another text, also approximately 1,500 years old, that tells of a wanderer named Moroni, the son of Mormon, who witnessed the destruction of his people and spent many years wandering the landscape alone. He wrote: "I even remain alone to write the sad tale of the destruction of my people. But behold, they are gone, . . . for I am alone. My father hath been slain in battle, and all my kinsfolk, and I have not friends nor wither to go" (Mormon 8:3, 5). He also said, "Iwander whithersoever I can for the safety ofmine own life" (Moroni 1:3).<br><br>However, Moroni was not without a leader. He knew that God lives, and he had a living testimony of Jesus Christ, which he shared with us:<br><br><i>And then shall ye know that I have seen Jesus, and that he hath talked with me face to face, and that he told me in plain humility, even as a man telleth another in mine own language, concerning these things; . . .</i><br><br><i>And now, I would commend you to seek this Jesus of whom the prophets and apostles have written, that the grace of God the Father, and also the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost . . . may be and abide in you forever. </i>[Ether 12:39, 41]<br><br>Repeatedly in the scriptures the Lord asks us to seek His face through the words of prophets who have found His face. Some of us will take a little longer than others. The Brother of Jared did not see His face until he had first recognized and grasped the hand of the Lord in his life. Although loneliness may be our universal condition, face-to-face leadership is our eternal end. "For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known" (1Corinthians 13:12).<br><br>Brothers and sisters, I feel deep gratitude for the leadership of Joseph Smith and the Savior. I feel the truthfulness of the gospel. This is the stone cut out from the mountain without hands that is now going forward to fill the earth. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Curtis D.

<h1> and Know God, Faith</h1>
<br>
<br>
When Loni, who just gave the opening prayer, was younger, around eight years old, the two of us were spending some time together. At that time I had been home from my mission less than a year and was still in the missionary mode in some ways. That day I felt the need to help young Loni gain a greater love and understanding of the scriptures. So I began to tell her how answers to any problem or concern she might have could be found in the scriptures. I really thought I was doing a fantastic job with my little impromptu lesson, so I ended it by enthusiastically asking her if she had anything troubling her at the time so I could show her how the process worked. She thought for a moment and then said a bit shyly, "Well, I am having some trouble in math." Math. I was completely caught off guard by her response. Iwasn't expecting an answer like that at all, so it took me a second to think of a story that had numbers in it, and then off we went!<br><br>The scriptures really do have the answers to all questions or concerns--even math. One verse in particular has helped me numerous times in my life. It is found in section 101 of the Doctrine and Covenants. In verse 16 the Lord says: "Therefore, let your hearts be comforted concerning Zion; for all flesh is in mine hands; be still and know that I am God." I love this scripture, particularly the last part: "be still and know that I am God." Today I would like to talk about how being still helps us gain a better understanding of life's events and why things happen or don't happen and how that helps us know God. Situations can be hard because we want to know and understand. We ask, "Our way was great--why didn't it work out that way?" or "Why do bad things happen to good people?"<br><br>Maybe you didn't get into the major you wanted; maybe class isn't turning out how you thought; maybe a family member is sick. There are lots of disappointments in the world that may be hard to understand. Instead of stressing over them or blaming others, sometimes it is best to "be still," become humble, and put your trust in God that all is well.<br><br>Now, those who know me, I am sure, are laughing a bit, because I am certainly not the poster child for a stress-free attitude! This is something I have struggled with my whole life. I actually used to think I thrived on stress. Ithought I got my best work done under stress, so I actually piled it on. In addition, mypersonality is such that I also worry and stress over just about everything! The stress and worry caused me to become physically sick.<br><br>About a year ago I was talking to a friend who turned to me and simply said, "To worry is to lack faith." This struck me quite hard. Think about it; it makes sense. If we worry and try to put it all on our own shoulders, we are not trusting that the Lord is in control or that He understands the situation. I cannot tell you the number of times this counsel has helped me and calmed me when I didn't understand why events occurred--and in the process I think (at least hope) I have grown.<br><br>This past spring I was with a group of nursing students in the United Kingdom on a Study Abroad program where we were learning about the health care system. It was a wonderful trip, and like past Study Abroad programs that I have participated in, you do not expect everything to go exactly as planned. However, this trip seemed to bring on more challenges than usual. Now, in the nursing program classes are a bit different because we not only have our required classroom time but we also have a required number of hours that students must spend in a clinical setting such as a hospital or (for people like me, a public health nurse) in the community in a school or public health department.<br><br>In England we had partnered with a university that had arranged for us to be in the local hospital. After only about one and a half weeks into our clinical rotation, I was told that due to some changes in the visa rules and how they had interpreted them, we had to immediately stop going to the hospital. The news was shocking. We still had many hours we needed to complete in order to comply with the clinical hour requirement. More important, our main purpose in coming to England was to be involved in the health care system. What were we going to do? Well, we scrambled and prayed hard and were able to arrange alternative experiences for the students in other parts of the health care system besides that one hospital. In the end the students even acknowledged that the unexpected change in events had actually been a blessing in disguise because we were able to see a much broader view of the health care system and were exposed to so much more. A change that at first seemed devastating became a blessing because we changed our perspective.<br><br>I am grateful for the students and their positive attitudes during this trip. Numerous things didn't work out as planned on the trip. It got to the point that we would literally just laugh when the next scheduled event did not work. In many ways "be still and know that I am God" literally became our motto. Along with some wise counsel, a friend of one of the students shared, "It isn't what happens in life that matters but only how we react to it."<br><br>Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin further counseled us, "The way we react to adversity can be a major factor in how happy and successful we can be. . . . The simple secret is this: put your trust in the Lord, do your best, then leave the rest to Him" ("Come What May, and Love It,"<i> Ensign, </i>November 2008, 26, 28).<br><br>If we learn to be humble, look at things with a more eternal perspective, and put our trust in the Lord, all will be well. Realize that often the experiences we may be having are to help us. This does not mean we should sit back and do nothing! Agency and our personal choices definitely affect outcomes. We must do our part! Just remember to give up some of the control and put your trust in God.<br><br>Let me share a brief example from my own life. It occurred when I received my mission call. I actually had graduated with my degree in nursing when I was 21. So I left on my mission soon after I had graduated. I am a bit embarrassed to admit it now, but one of the reasons I went into nursing was because I really wanted to serve a welfare/humanitarian mission, and I thought a nursing degree would increase my chances to do this.<br><br>And it seemed my plan had worked. My original mission call was to be a mission nurse in Venezuela. However, while in the MTC we had difficulty obtaining visas to enter Venezuela. Some missionaries had been in the MTC an extra two months just waiting for their visas. Finally it was decided that our calls would be changed. Within a day my call was changed from Venezuela to Puerto Rico; and instead of being the mission nurse, I would be a proselyting missionary! That very evening Iwas on a plane heading to Puerto Rico.<br><br>I was in utter shock. Although not so much now, at the time I was incredibly and painfully shy. This shyness was the reason I wanted to serve a welfare/humanitarian mission and not a proselyting mission. Nursing was something I could do because it was helping and serving others. Talking to absolute strangers scared me to death. For several months after I got there, I secretly thought the whole thing was a mistake and that I would soon be going to Venezuela. No, it was not a mistake, and I served my entire mission in Puerto Rico.<br><br>With a lot of prayer I learned to strike up a conversation on just about anything. I learned to really trust the Lord. My Spanish was never as good as it should have been, and I am still not the most outgoing person in the world, but I can honestly say I did the best I could, and the events that transpired were what I needed to grow. The Lord knew this even if I didn't.<br><br>Now, this was many years ago, but, looking back, I can see that these experiences have changed and shaped my life in so many ways. First, although my original intentions of studying nursing seemed ill guided, I can see now that the Lord was directing me--just for reasons different than I thought. Nursing is part of my mission in life. Second, serving a proselyting mission really made me stretch much more than anything else would have, and I am so very grateful it did. Finally, this change from my plan brought me experiences I never could have imagined for myself.<br><br>I am a planner, and so I originally thought Iwould return from my mission, go back to New England, work a few years as a pediatric nurse, get married, and have a family. But the Lord had a different path for me. On my mission Ilearned how much I loved being out with the people. Also, upon my return I found that I wasn't enjoying hospital nursing--I missed being with the people in their own settings and focusing on empowering them to change themselves. An opportunity soon arose--because I had learned to speak Spanish--to work as a school nurse in a Spanish-speaking area in Utah. Then other experiences and opportunities to further my education occurred, and here I am back at BYU. I have had the opportunity to travel and learn about other countries and cultures, and that has greatly enriched my life. It has shown me that the world isn't as black and white as I saw it. Although at the time it occurred I couldn't understand why, looking back now I can see the Lord's hand guiding me. I am a far better person for these experiences than my plans would have made me. How little I knew!<br><br>C. S. Lewis captured these unexpected twists in life when he said:<br><br><i>Imagine yourself as a living house. God comes in to rebuild that house. At first, perhaps, you can understand what He is doing. He is getting the drains right and stopping the leaks in the roof and so on: you knew that those jobs needed doing and so you are not surprised. But presently He starts knocking the house about in a way that hurts abominably and does not seem to make sense. What on earth is He up to? The explanation is that He is building quite a different house from the one you thought of--throwing out a new wing here, putting on an extra floor there, running up towers, making courtyards. You thought you were going to be made into a decent little cottage: but He is building a palace.</i> [George MacDonald, cited in C. S. Lewis, <i>Mere Christianity</i> (New York: Macmillan, 1960), 160]<br><br>This reminds me of the beautiful folktale of the three trees. There were three trees on top of a mountain. The first tree wanted to become a chest to hold gold and the greatest treasures. The second tree wanted to become a ship to carry kings across oceans. The third tree wanted to grow to be the tallest tree so that when people looked heavenward, they thought of God.<br><br>One day woodcutters came and cut the three trees down. The first two trees were excited--their dreams would now come true.<br><br>The first tree was not made into a treasure chest but instead a feed box for animals. The second tree became a small fishing boat, carrying stinky fish all day. The third tree was made into lumber and put in a pile. "What happened?" they thought.<br><br>Time passed on, and the trees nearly forgot about their dreams. But then one night a new star appeared in the sky and a newborn babe was placed in the feedbox (or manger). The tree suddenly realized he was holding the greatest treasure in the world. It was better than he could have imagined.<br><br>A few years later the second tree, which was made into a boat, had a traveler fall asleep in it when a storm arose on the water. The man awoke, stood, and stretched his hand and said, "Peace." The storm stopped, and the second tree realized he was carrying the King of Kings.<br><br>Finally, one Friday morning the third tree was taken and fashioned into a cross upon which this same man was crucified. The tree felt ugly. But on Sunday the sun arose and the tree realized that God's love changed everything and that every time people thought of the third tree, they would think of God--and that was better than being the tallest tree.<br><br>Each tree had dreams, but the Lord saw their full potential, which brought a much greater reality. (See Angela Elwell Hunt, <i>The Tale of the Three Trees: A Traditional Folktale</i> [Colorado Springs, Colorado: Lion Publishing, 1989].)<br><br>In Psalm 46:10 the phrase "be still, and know that I am God" is used again. With the help of Dr. Dana M. Pike, professor of religious education, I learned that the Hebrew base that is translated as <i>still</i> in this text means "stop, cease your own human striving and watch the Lord do His work." Moses commanded the children of Israel as they fled from the Egyptians: "Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord" (Exodus 14:13). Then He parted the waters of the Red Sea. Remember, the children of Israel were frightened and complained that they wanted to return to Egypt. They lacked the faith that the Lord would really deliver them. Often we are so distracted by the things around us that we do not have the faith to believe the Lord can do anything, and so we complain.<br><br>After learning the Hebrew origin of <i>still,</i> Iwent to the basic dictionary to learn about the etymology of the English word <i>still</i> (a habit Ilearned from my father, an English major who loves the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>). <i>Still</i> actually comes from a base meaning "standing" or "immobile" (<i>Webster's New World Dictionary</i>).<br><br>Think about this. To me the Lord is saying, "Be immobile, be unwavering. Put your complete trust in the Lord and live."<br><br>Someone who did this very thing was Eric Liddell, who won a gold medal in the 1924 Olympics in Paris. His story surrounding these Olympic events, including his refusal to run on Sunday, is portrayed in the great movie <i>Chariots of Fire</i>. At the end of the movie there is a short sentence that indicates that after the Olympics, Eric went to China, where he died. That is true, but a large part of the story is missing.<br><br>After the Olympics, Eric became a missionary in China. He married and had three girls, the youngest of whom he never knew because before she was born, his wife and children left China due to events leading up to World War II. Eric and many others who stayed in China ended up in a Japanese internment camp. To me this is where Eric's life mission and trust in God became evident.<br><br>Camp life was tough--the prisoners were not given adequate food, and other restrictions were placed upon them. It was hard, as you can imagine. However, Eric, as he had his whole life, continued to live what he preached. He had come to know God; so where he was did not matter so much as how he acted.<br><br>He was assigned to teach science to the children who were also in the camp (Eric had graduated with a degree in science at the University of Edinburgh). They did not have the equipment to do the experiments, so he spent hours articulating and drawing out what would happen, making sure the children understood.<br><br>In addition, he oversaw sporting and recreational events. Children who were there in the camp remembered him always patching up hockey sticks using the sheets his wife had left him for his house. He was always serving others. He helped carry the coal for those who were older or disabled to ensure their stoves would continue to burn. He did not let the fact he was hungry, imprisoned, or away from his family stop him. He did die in the camp due to an inoperable brain tumor that had caused him great headaches. So he did all these things when not always comfortable himself.<br><br>The number of lives that he touched and shaped during this time is incredible. Scores of letters and tributes have been written by those who were in the camp with him. Yet the most touching tribute is one from his own daughter, who for years could not understand why her father had to be separated from his family. However, as she heard the tributes from the children he served, she realized the Lord knew her father was needed there to help those children who were also separated from their parents, and she knew how that felt. (See "Daily Encouragement Tuesday--Classical Testimonies . . . Eric Liddell; Finishing His Race!" Scotwise Blog, 14 August 2007; http://scotwise.blogspot.com/2007/08/daily-encouragement-tuesday-classical_14.html; see also Ellen W. Caughey, <i>Eric Liddell,</i> Heroes of the Faith series [Uhrichsville, Ohio: Barbour Publishing, 2000].)<br><br>At his funeral, the Reverend Arnold Bryson, a close friend of Eric, said, "What was the secret of his consecrated life and far-reaching influence? Absolute surrender to God's will" (Sally Magnusson, <i>The Flying Scotsman </i>[New York: Quartet Books, 1981], 174). Eric's last words were said to have been "complete surrender"--a motto he used often in his sermons. At Eric's funeral they also sang his favorite hymn. In fact, the afternoon of the day he died, among the things Eric had written on a scrap piece of paper was the first line of the hymn. That hymn is also fitting for today. Itwas "Be Still, My Soul."<br><br><i>Be still, my soul: The Lord is on thy side. . . .</i><br><br><i>Be still, my soul: Thy best, thy heav'nly Friend</i><br><br><i>Thru thorny ways leads to a joyful end.</i><br><br>[<i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 124]<br><br>"Be still and know that I am God."<br><br>As I was preparing this talk, I asked some of my nieces and nephews what they thought D&amp;amp;C 101:16 meant. My eight-year-old nephew said, "Stop and listen." My 11-year-old niece added, "Reverence." They hit on a key principle, one I really struggle with: to be still we first just need to stop, and then we must listen.<br><br>About a year ago I had new tires put on my car. I soon heard a new sound as I drove. It wasn't very loud and it wasn't consistent, so I assumed it was due to the road, which was under construction. However, the noise continued, and so I brought the car back to the garage. They assured me it was just the new tires. I was relieved to hear this and drove away again, ignoring the sound. Over time the noise seemed to get a bit louder, but I unconsciously just turned up the radio a bit more, ignored the noise, and went on my way.<br><br>Months later I was in Salt Lake City picking up several friends to go to a concert. As the first friend got into my car, she immediately heard the sound and asked what was wrong with my car. I replied that nothing was wrong--did she hear something? (That tells you how much I had tuned out the sound.) She heard it loud and clear, as did the others inthecar.<br><br>I brought my car to the garage the next day and was told the noise was due to an abnormal rubbing that had caused major damage. It was a dangerous situation that needed immediate repair. I thought back on the miles I had driven and how I had learned to completely tune out what became a very loud noise.<br><br>I still can't believe I had been able to tune it out. I realize it was quite crazy! I wonder what else in my life I had "tuned out" simply because I was too busy or distracted by other things in life--because I did not stop and listen.<br><br>I do not think I am alone with this; life is so busy, and we are always on the go. Elder Richard G. Scott reminds us, "Satan has a powerful tool to use against good people. It is distraction. He would have good people fill life with 'good things' so there is no room for the essential ones" ("First Things First," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2001, 7).<br><br>Robert Frost had this same idea when he said:<br><br><i>The woods are lovely, dark, and deep,</i><br><br><i>But I have promises to keep,</i><br><br><i>And miles to go before I sleep,</i><br><br><i>And miles to go before I sleep.</i><br><br>[Robert Frost, "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening" (1923), stanza 4]<br><br>We have too much going on to stop.<br><br>Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing, was a teenager when she heard a voice. The story is told that she was under a tree at her home when "God spoke to me and called me into His service" (in Gena K. Gorrell, <i>Heart and Soul: The Story of Florence Nightingale</i> [Toronto: Tundra Books, 2000], 21). She was not quite 17 when this experience occurred. Yet this powerful event shaped her life. Interestingly, when the voice of God told her she had a calling, He wasn't specific in what she was to do. This came later, over time, and through various other experiences in her life. However, it began quietly and calmly under a tree.<br><br>He does not come in the strong winds, nor in the earthquakes or the fire. He comes in a still, small voice. (See 1 Kings 19:11–12.)<br><br>President Boyd K. Packer reminds us: "The Spirit does not get our attention by shouting or shaking us with a heavy hand. Rather it whispers. It caresses so gently that if we are preoccupied we may not feel it at all" ("The Candle of the Lord," <i>Ensign,</i> January 1983, 53).<br><br>I love reading about the Nephites in 3 Nephi of the Book of Mormon as they are gathered around the temple in Bountiful after all the destruction has taken place. As they are talking amongst themselves, they hear a voice. However, the Lord had to repeat Himself three times before "they did hear the voice, and did open their ears to hear it" (3 Nephi 11:5). The people had to be still and in tune before they understood the message.<br><br>"Be still and know that I am God" always reminds me of a beautiful photograph taken of the Salt Lake Temple. In the picture you see just the spires of the temple as the clouds settle. To me it is as if the clouds are the unknown tumult of the world settling, and there stands eternal truth. There stands God. He never moves but is waiting for us to turn to Him.<br><br>Elder David B. Haight said, "The moment we step into the house of the Lord, the atmosphere changes from the worldly to the heavenly. . . . It is a refuge from the ills of life and a protection from the temptations" ("Temples and Work Therein," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1990, 61).<br><br>As the poem in the Washington D.C. Temple states: "Nor shout nor rush but hush ... for God is here" (a saying often found over entrances of old churches in England).<br><br>A few verses later in D&amp;amp;C 101, the Lord actually commands the Saints to "stand in holy places" (D&amp;amp;C 101:22). Find your own holy place where you can stop being distracted by the world and things around you and where you can stop and reflect to see the Lord's hand in your life.<br><br>I would like to close with one of my favorite stories, which likens this journey to a bike ride:<br><br><i>At first I saw God as an observer, like my judge, keeping track of things I did wrong. This way, God would know whether I merited heaven or hell when I died. He was always out there, sort of like the President. I recognized His picture when I saw it, but I didn't really know Him at all.</i><br><br><i>But later on, when I recognized my higher power better, it seemed as though life was rather like a bike ride, on a tandem bike, and I noticed God was in the back helping me pedal.</i><br><br><i>I don't know when it was that He suggested we change places, but life has not been the same since. ... </i><br><br><i>When I had control, I knew the way. It was rather boring but predictable. It was always the shortest distance between the points.</i><br><br><i>But when He took the lead, He knew delightful cuts, up mountains, and through rocky places and at breakneck speeds; it was all I could do to hang on! Even though it looked like madness, He [said], "Pedal!"</i><br><br><i>I worried and became anxious, asking, "Where are you taking me?" He just laughed and didn't answer, and I found myself starting to trust. I soon forgot my boring life and entered into the adventure, and when I'd say, "I'm scared," He'd lean back and touch my hand.</i><br><br><i>He took me to people with gifts that I needed; gifts of healing, acceptance and joy. They gave me their gifts to take on my journey. </i>Our<i> journey, that is, God's and mine.</i><br><br><i>And we were off again. He said, "Give the gifts away, they're extra baggage, too much weight." So Idid, to the people we met, and I found that in giving</i> I <i>received, and still our burden was light.</i><br><br><i>I did not trust Him at first, in control of my life. I thought He'd wreck it. But He knew </i>bike secrets, <i>knew how to make it bend to take sharp corners, jump to clear places filled with rocks, fly to shorten scary passages.</i><br><br><i>And I'm learning to [be quiet] and pedal in the strangest places, and I'm beginning to enjoy the view and the cool breeze on my face with my delightful constant companion, </i>my higher power.<i></i><br><br><i>And when I'm sure I can't go on anymore, He just smiles and says, "Pedal . . ." </i>[Author unknown, "The Bike Ride," <i>A 2nd Helping of Chicken Soup for the Soul: 101 More Stories to Open the Heart and Rekindle the Spirit</i> (Deerfield Beach, Florida: Health Communications, 1995), 311–12; emphasis in original]<i></i><br><br>As President Gordon B. Hinckley reminded us: "Don't worry. The Lord is at the helm. This is his church" ("The Lord Is at the Helm," fireside address, Brigham Young University, 6March 1994).<br><br>I testify that this is true. Put your trust in God, let go of your worries, and replace them with faith. Pedal when you need to pedal, take the time to stop when you need to be still, and always strive to know God.<br><br><i>Erin D.

<h1> for the Future: Always Learning and Growing - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is my distinct privilege and pleasure to welcome all of you and to extend my commendations and congratulations to those before us who are recognized in our program of the day and are adorned in the apparel earned by their accomplishments. As we will emphasize later, none has trod this path of achievement alone, and so in our adulation we include all who have contributed in any way to the success of these graduates. On behalf of our administration and board of trustees, thanks to all who have assisted, supported, and blessed the lives of this group of students we honor today.<br><br>Each graduating class is unique while having much in common with others who have previously gone this way. As is usual, we have representatives from all 50 states and 57 other nations. We have graduates close to the ages of our typical entering freshmen (whom we will welcome in a few days), and our oldest bachelor's degree recipient is 82! We honor those with unusual circumstances, like DeAnn Jones, who passed away before she could participate with us today.<br><br>Thirty percent of our graduates are from the College of Family, Home, and Social Sciences, while the remainder are distributed throughout the other colleges of the university. With the 2,423 degrees to be awarded at today's commencement exercises, we will have more than 8,000 new Brigham Young University graduates in the 2009 calendar year.<br><br>One of the issues of concern to you graduates is the unsettled economic situation in which we find ourselves. Some of you wishing to enter the workforce still have not secured employment, and the prospects seem yet uncertain. Some of you are continuing your education here or elsewhere and are also experiencing the effects of the economy and its related challenges. Others of you who are married or planning to be so soon will join or rejoin the honored ranks of homemakers. To you who will be giving primary attention to children and home, we can assure you that there will always be an abundance of work without layoffs or reductions in force!<br><br>In the current times it is especially important for all of us to understand that these challenges and uncertainties have been predicted and accounted for in the great plan of our Heavenly Father. I take considerable comfort in the promise of the Lord given in D&amp;amp;C 38:30 as He described the worldly conditions of this dispensation: "But if ye are prepared ye shall not fear." In many respects, you are prepared and therefore can move forward without fear or undue concern. In other ways, you are still preparing and always will be, but the promise still applies even as you change the tense.<br><br>In fact, in our theology of eternal progression we will always be learning and growing. Thus your BYU education, which has prepared you for the next phases of your lives, still finds you in a state of preparation that requires lifelong learning, developing, changing, and growing. We think you are up to the task and commend you for your current achievements and especially for your possibilities, both proximate and eternal.<br><br>Many years ago an English writer, Izaak Walton, wrote a famous book familiar to many of you entitled The Compleat Angler. I like to fish and did so the other day with my oldest son. While we caught a few trout, I can attest that I am not a "compleat" angler and likely will never be a fully competent fisherman. I mention Walton's contribution not because we have had much interest in training or teaching you about fishing but because of the notion that one can and must become complete in certain phases or dimensions of life.<br><br>Just as Walton's exposition was about much more than fishing, though he obviously loved the angling art, being a BYU graduate is about much more than just mastering the curriculum in your major. It is certainly that, but it has also prepared you to be a lifelong learner in your chosen discipline and in all phases and aspects of life. In addition, the uniqueness of the BYU experience, as is mentioned in the BYU mission statement, is also "to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life" (The Mission of Brigham Young University and The Aims of a BYU Education [Provo: BYU, 1996], 1). I don't think you will find that statement or goal in documents from any other great university that does not carry the name of Brigham Young University.<br><br>A rather common fallacy accepted in society is that with graduation, one has finished her or his education. That is a serious misunderstanding if we are considering a truly educated person, particularly one with the lofty goal of achieving eternal life and eventually perfection.<br><br>In reality, your diploma is a certification that this institution believes you are now sufficiently prepared to continue to learn and grow both intellectually and spiritually throughout your lives if you are willing to continue to make the same kind of effort at learning that you have demonstrated while students at BYU. This confidence expressed in you is also a tremendous challenge we give you to reach the potential that you have been given by heaven, by your parents and other supporters, and by those who have contributed to your education.<br><br>Another reason that I like the work of Izaak Walton, in addition to our shared enthusiasm for fishing, is that he understood very clearly that his learning and work were never really finished. Though The Compleat Angler was first published in 1653, Walton continued to add to, modify, and improve his treatise with multiple editions over the years until 1676.<br><br>A third reason I admire this man of these many generations past is that he was very loyal to his friends and family. He shamelessly learned from them and had them contribute to his education and to his literary efforts. He apparently wrote for recreation as well as vocation, shared what he learned, and enjoyed freely. In all of this, there is something for us to learn.<br><br>While it is a very good thing to become knowledgeable and settled in your own discipline and in your own faith, that is not enough. In my judgment, Walton's worldwide community of followers, which now includes many even in our own day, would have been in a lesser place without his willingness to share what he had learned. I do not suggest that all of us should become great writers, poets, or fishermen. What I do suggest is that each of us needs to understand that we who have been given so much have a greater responsibility to contribute to those around us, including our families, our communities, our nations, and our churches.<br><br>Those of us who are Latter-day Saints with the benefit of a BYU education have a particular and vital charge to follow the admonition of the Apostle Peter, who counseled that we should "be ready always to give an answer to every man [or woman, I will add] that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you" (1 Peter 3:15).<br><br>You will be naturally placed in situations and circumstances where by both precept and example you will be able to share the message of the Restoration and answer the honest questions about who we are, what we believe, why we believe, and why we act as we do. We have great confidence in you and understand that so very much depends on you.<br><br>We know that almost all of you are grateful for your blessings and experiences here. We charge you never to forget those who have made this remarkable opportunity possible for you. This includes your families, your teachers (both at BYU and from before you came here), the faithful tithe payers of the Church, and the generous benefactors of this university who make so much of your enriched experience here possible. In all of this, please remember your own contributions and recognize that God has helped you get to this point and has great expectations for you in the future.<br><br>You and Brigham Young University are part of Heavenly Father's great work. It is true, and we are led by apostles and prophets with President Thomas S. Monson as chairman of our board of trustees. I invoke the blessings of heaven upon you and yours at this momentous and wonderful time. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><em style="color: #333333; line-height: 24.375px;">Cecil O.

<h1>with Challenges - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Fellow graduates, these commencement exercises mark the summit of our educational experience at Brigham Young University. The journey thus far has not been an easy one. We have all encountered obstacles during our time here--some of which have seemed insurmountable. Our challenges have come in a variety of forms. Some of us have struggled with indecision regarding which major to choose. For others the challenge came each time we sat in the Testing Center wondering if we were the only ones noticing the rising temperature. Money has been scarce and sometimes even nonexistent.<br><br>Our presence here today is evidence that we have not given up. We decided on a major, we made our final walk down the stairs of the Testing Center, and we have survived our diet of ramen noodles and vending machine Hot Pockets.<br><br>We should feel deeply satisfied to know that we have always stood one more time than we have fallen. My fellow classmates, we have discovered for ourselves mankind's ability to overcome, to rise, and to triumph.<br><br>I would like to share three lessons that my educational experience at BYU has taught me about dealing with challenges.<br><br>Lesson one is that we do not need to deal with challenges alone. Our experience at BYU has strengthened our faith and trust in our Father in Heaven and His Son Jesus Christ. We have learned that with Their help "all things are possible" (Mark 10:27). We have also learned that God often eases our burdens through the instrumentality of other people.<br><br>Several times when I became overwhelmed with the challenges of school, work, family, and research projects, direction and encouragement from others gave me the fortitude to continue. Last year, after several months of preparation, I made the eight-hour drive to the Navajo Reservation in Arizona. My purpose was to obtain the permission of the Navajo Nation Institutional Review Board to perform language research on the reservation for my honors thesis. After reviewing my 22-page application for only a few minutes, they rejected my proposal and sent me on my way. My return trip allowed me plenty of time to become overwhelmed with discouragement. I had all but decided to give up on the project when I called Dr. Wendy Baker, my thesis advisor. Her empathetic words of enthusiasm and hope during that phone call gave me the determination to continue. I did continue, and we found another avenue of data collection. I have since defended my thesis and presented our research at two academic conferences.<br><br>Each of us will experience hardships and setbacks throughout our lives, but we do not need to endure them alone. The words of a favorite hymn come to mind:<br><br><i>What greater gift dost thou bestow,</i><br><br><i>What greater goodness can we know</i><br><br><i>Than Christlike friends, whose gentle ways</i><br><br><i>Strengthen our faith, enrich our days.</i><br><br>["Each Life That Touches Ours for Good," <i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 293]<br><br>Without the help and encouragement from friends like Wendy Baker, our journey would have been so much more difficult.<br><br>Lesson two is that we can endure challenges with patience. I worked hard during my undergraduate career to prepare for admission to graduate school. I kept my grades up, worked on research projects with professors, took a GRE prep class, and, like all of you, contributed in campus and community service projects. I carefully selected the graduate schools Iwould apply to and ensured my applications were complete and submitted early.<br><br>After months of waiting for each school to notify me of its admissions decision, I received a rejection letter, then another, and then another until every graduate school had respectfully denied me admission. With help and advice from professors in my department, Isubmitted a late application to one more graduate school. I was promptly admitted, and, from my present perspective, I am confident that I am going where I am supposed to go.<br><br>During that experience I learned what Elder Neal A. Maxwell meant when he said, "Those, however, who 'plow in hope' not only understand the law of the harvest but they also understand what growing seasons are all about" ("Plow in Hope," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2001, 60). During our time at BYU we have planted mustard-sized seeds of faith and knowledge (see Matthew 17:20). Although we will not immediately reap all that we have sown while here, spiritual and intellectual seeds within each of us will continue to bear fruit for the rest of our lives.<br><br>Lesson three is that we can serve others--even during our challenges. President Henry B. Eyring said that "the test a loving God has set before us is not to see if we can endure difficulty. It is to see if we can endure it well" ("In the Strength of the Lord," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2004, 17). Regardless of our circumstances, there will never be a better time than now to serve others. Our personal struggles should serve as a constant reminder of the needs of those around us. Challenges can also prepare us to approach the needs of others with empathy and compassion.<br><br>During my time at BYU I have been the recipient of many kind acts of service. A few months ago, after several days of car trouble, I discovered that my starter needed to be replaced. I mentioned this to a neighbor, hoping to get some advice. He offered to look at it for me and did not leave my side until he had replaced my starter almost six hours later. Such examples of selfless service have motivated me to try to be aware of the needs of others. Like all of us, I have participated in small, everyday acts of service. These small acts of service, however, seemed anything but small to those who needed help. One important lesson I have learned is to stop asking others whether they need help and just start helping.<br><br>I hope that we will leave this university remembering this maxim from Elder Maxwell: "Whatever our particular fields of scholarship, the real test is individual discipleship, not scholarship" ("Discipleship and Scholarship," talk given at the annual banquet of the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies at BYU, 27 September 1991; published in <i>BYU Studies</i> 32, no. 3 [summer 1992]: 7). As disciples, let us not forget that Jesus Christ's greatest act of service and His most immense personal challenge took place simultaneously.<br><br>I want to close by saying that today should be a day of gratitude. Let us take the time to thank family, friends, mentors, and other special people in our lives who have made today possible. And I speak for all of us when I say thank you to this university's board of trustees, administration, faculty, staff, and alumni. You have made a difference. Most important, may each of us find a quiet place to kneel and express gratitude to a loving Father in Heaven. I know that He is aware of and pleased with the accomplishment that we celebrate today.<br><br>As we move into a new season of life, may we always remember the lessons that we have learned during this "intellectually enlarging" and "spiritually strengthening" season of growth (<i>The Mission of Brigham Young University</i> and <i>The Aims of a BYU Education</i> [Provo: BYU, 1996], 3).<br><br><i>Jesse Aaron Egbert spoke as the representative of hisgraduating class at BYU commencement on 13August 2009.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1> Without Being Defensive: What do Mormons Believe? Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As I look at you graduates, tender feelings well up inside me. While it is not possible for me to shake hands with each of you and look you in the eye personally, I want you to know that you are precious in the sight of your Heavenly Father. He loves you. The leaders of the Church love you.<br><br>I also want you to know that you have an exciting and meaningful service to the Lord ahead of you. I recognize that years of sacrifice by your parents, as well as by each of you, have helped you become who you are. Today I look at you and recognize your own years of commitment to the Church and to nourishing your own testimonies through study and application of gospel principles. I look at you and see the future of the Church--not just the future bishops, stake presidents, mission presidents, and auxiliary leaders but the great ranks of future mothers and fathers, Primary and Sunday School teachers, youth leaders, home teachers, visiting teachers, Scout leaders, choir directors, and countless others who will serve the Lord in the 21st century.<br><br>It will be a different century than the one that has just passed. In some ways it will be better; in other ways it will be much more difficult for you and for your children. But one thing is inescapable: it will be <i>your</i> century--one in which you have the opportunity to leave your mark for good or otherwise. You will try to influence others, and others will try to influence you. Either you will share and promote your core values, rooted in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, or you will allow others to define your values for you and your posterity.<br><br>Communication in the future will continue to change through Internet and new media technologies. Your world of cyberspace--cell phones that capture video downloads, iTunes, social networks like Facebook, text messaging, blogs, Twitter, handhelds, and podcasts--is just the beginning of what is yet ahead for you in the remarkable expansion of technology. It makes me wish I had been born 20 years later so that I could figure out how to run my iPhone when it doesn't behave, which is quite often.<br><br>We are in a titanic struggle, my young brothers and sisters. From the dawn of mankind's history it has always been so. Good and evil have always been with us, and so has the right to choose between them. For the time I have with you today, I want to share some thoughts about standing firm for the truth.<br><br>Recently I saw some research about how other people see members of the Church. I have long been interested in this subject because I have had somewhat to do with missionary work in my Church assignments. Knowing how people see us is an important part of understanding how best to explain ourselves. This particular piece of research made an interesting observation. It suggested that members of our Church can sometimes appear very defensive to those who are not members of the Church. One respondent went so far as to say that when Mormons are explaining their beliefs, they speak in terms that suggest they are expecting criticism.<br><br>This was not the first time I have heard that kind of observation. But the more I have thought about it, the more I understand how easy it is, if we are not careful, to convey a sense of defensiveness in our communications with others.<br><br>I think I understand something of the reasons. From the time Joseph Smith walked out of the Sacred Grove in the spring of 1820, there have been those who have reacted negatively, even with hostility, to our message. Joseph tells us in his own words that the first time he attempted to share what he had seen with someone outside the family, it wasn't a pleasant experience. The Protestant minister with whom he shared his message told him that it was "all of the devil" (JS--H 1:21) and that there was no such thing as visions and revelations anymore. If Joseph thought that was bad, it was because he hadn't yet realized the relentless power of the adversary. The more the Church grew, the more it seemed to attract hostility. The small band of faithful Saints was driven from one place to another. It must have seemed to Joseph that it could not get much worse than the terrible suffering at Liberty Jail followed by the governor of Missouri issuing the extermination order against members of the Church. Of course it did get worse, and Joseph and Hyrum paid for their work, testimonies, and faith with their lives. That was the final act that launched the great trek west led by Brigham Young, bringing us to this American wilderness, a place of refuge in the Rocky Mountains for the members of the Church.<br><br>That is now an indelible part of history. You have heard the stories of hardship and sacrifice since you were a small child. Even converts to the Church who had no ancestors who survived those times embrace the people and the events of our early history as part of their own heritage. The stories both inspire and motivate us, as they should, and I hope and pray that in our relative comfort we will never forget those sturdy and faithful Latter-day Saints and the lessons we can learn from them.<br><br>And yet "this isn't 1830, and there aren't just six of us" anymore (Harold B. Lee to Boyd K. Packer; as retold in Boyd K. Packer, "The Standard of Truth Has Been Erected," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2003, 26). Could part of the defensiveness that others sometimes see in us suggest that we still expect to be treated as a disliked minority, forced to flee to the West? In our interactions with others are we expecting always to have to defend ourselves? If so, I think we need to make a course correction. Constantly anticipating criticisms or objections can lead to an unhealthy self-consciousness and a defensive posture that doesn't resonate well with others. It is inconsistent with where we are today as a Church and as a great body of the followers of Jesus Christ.<br><br>As in all things, we can look to the Savior as our Exemplar. He faced tremendous hostility from the outset of His ministry. When He first preached in the synagogues at Nazareth, some wanted to throw Him off a cliff. Yet He did not allow Himself to be intimidated. He knew that for the most part He would be misunderstood. Yet He was fearless in declaring His gospel, using such phrases as "some say unto you" followed by "but I say unto you." He knew what He wanted to say, and He said it without apology. As the scriptures say, "He taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes" (Matthew 7:29; see also Mark 1:22).<br><br>If we want to be respected today for who we are, then we need to act confidently--secure in the knowledge of who we are and what we stand for--and not as if we have to apologize for our beliefs. That doesn't mean we should be arrogant or overbearing. Respect for others' views should always be a basic principle for us--it's built right into the Articles of Faith. But when we act as if we are a persecuted minority, or as if we expect to be misunderstood or criticized, people will sense it and respond accordingly.<br><br>I invite those of you who are returned missionaries to be especially sensitive to this. You spent two years knocking on doors and dealing with every conceivable question and objection. It is easy in your conversations to think you are still knocking on doors. You're not. If you are in a position to share what you believe, there's no need to tread so carefully that you look like you are being evasive or anticipating criticism. The Apostle Paul said, "I am not ashamed of the gospel of [Jesus] Christ" (Romans 1:16)--neither should any of us be. I look forward to and greatly appreciate every opportunity I have to share my testimony of the marvelous message of the Restoration. And I cannot ever remember offending anyone in the process.<br><br>One of the reasons why this subject is relevant to you today is because the Church is getting stronger. In the United States, we are now the fourth-largest church. Latter-day Saints are everywhere, in communities from coast to coast, north to south. While our numbers may be more concentrated in the West, it is becoming more and more common for people in the country to know a Latter-day Saint personally. In addition, many members of the Church have achieved social prominence. A recent <i>Time</i> magazine article about the Church noted this fact and ran several photographs of prominent Latter-day Saints. (See "The Storm over the Mormons," <i>Time,</i> 22 June 2009, 48–53; also, online revised title, "The Church and Gay Marriage: Are Mormons Misunderstood.")<br><br>This prominence alone ensures that the Church is going to be talked about more and more and that Latter-day Saints are going to find themselves in more and more gospel discussions. That's why I have chosen this subject. You need to be honest, open, forthright, engaging, respectful of others' views, and completely nondefensive about your own.<br><br>I'm going to give you two suggestions for how to engage in conversations nondefensively.<br><br>The first suggestion: Don't let irrelevant issues drown out the more important subjects.<br><br>Our Church members have too often allowed others to set the conversational agenda. An example is polygamy. This ended in the Church as an official practice in 1890. It's now 2009. Why are we still talking about it? It was a practice. It ended. We moved on. If people ask you about polygamy, just acknowledge it was once a practice in our Church but is not now and that people shouldn't confuse any polygamists with our Church. In ordinary conversations, don't waste time trying to justify the practice of polygamy during Old Testament times or speculating as to why it was practiced for a time in the 19th century. Those may be legitimate topics for historians and scholars, but I think we simply reinforce the stereotypes when we make it a primary topic of conversations about the Church.<br><br>I realize that sometimes these conversations are triggered by stories that appear in the media. That doesn't change anything. Earlier this year a TV cable network series about polygamists depicted the sacred temple ceremony. That portrayal caused great concern among Church members, which is understandable. We were all offended by it. But I refer you to an article in response that was placed by the Public Affairs Department of the Church on its Newsroom Web site at that time. As I quote from it, listen to the tone. There is nothing defensive about it, yet it was responding to an inappropriate portrayal of one of our most sacred religious ceremonies:<br><br><i>Like other large faith groups, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sometimes finds itself on the receiving end of attention from Hollywood or Broadway, television series or books, and the news media. Sometimes depictions of the Church and its people are quite accurate. Sometimes the images are false or play to stereotypes. Occasionally, they are in appallingly bad taste.</i><br><br><i>As Catholics, Jews and Muslims have known for centuries, such attention is inevitable once an institution or faith group reaches a size or prominence sufficient to attract notice.</i><br><br>The article then goes on to discourage the idea of an organized boycott of the network or affiliated businesses, which was being actively promoted on the Internet among some of our members. Continuing the Newsroom quote:<br><br><i>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as an institution does not call for boycotts. Such a step would simply generate the kind of controversy that the media loves and in the end would increase audiences for the series. . . . Latter-day Saints should conduct themselves with dignity and thoughtfulness.</i><br><br><i>Not only is this the model that Jesus Christ taught and demonstrated in His own life, but it also reflects the reality of the strength and maturity of Church members today. . . .</i><br><br><i>If the Church allowed critics and opponents to choose the ground on which its battles are fought, it would risk being distracted from the focus and mission it has pursued successfully for nearly 180 years. Instead, the Church itself will determine its own course as it continues to preach the restored gospel of Jesus Christ throughout the world.</i> ["The Publicity Dilemma," March 9, 2009; http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/commentary/the-publicity-dilemma]<br><br>Let me give you another example in recent memory. A year or two ago, an independent film group made a movie about the Mountain Meadows Massacre. To describe this as a really bad B movie would be generous. Frankly, it was just awful--even the Hollywood critics panned it. The promoters did everything they could to provoke the Church into making it a major topic of conversation. In fact, we completely ignored it. We refused to allow them to set the agenda. The result: a big flop at the box office and presumably a lot of red ink in the promoter's bank account. Meanwhile, we continue to respond to and reach out in constructive and intelligent ways with the descendants of those who were involved in those terrible events at Mountain Meadows. Recently the Church has published a well-researched book titled <i>Massacre at Mountain Meadows</i> that documents the facts surrounding this tragedy (see Ronald W. Walker, Richard E. Turley, Jr., and Glen M. Leonard [Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 2008]).<br><br>My second suggestion: Emphasize that Latter-day Saints follow Jesus Christ and what He teaches--that we try to follow Him in all we do.<br><br>When all is said and done, the most important thing about you and your testimony is that you base your beliefs on what Jesus Christ taught and that you try to follow Him by living your life in a way that is acceptable to our Heavenly Father and to the Lord.<br><br>This is your foundation. It was Joseph Smith's foundation. He said:<br><br><i>The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.</i> [<i>HC</i> 3:30]<br><br>Whenever you are having a conversation about the Church, you should try to make this a point. We follow Jesus Christ. We try to live as He taught. That's the basis of our faith and our lives. This is the strongest nondefensive position you can take. You don't have to defend or justify anything when you are basing your position on the teachings of the Son of God and the fact that you are doing your best to keep His commandments.<br><br>It is a great blessing to have the doctrines of Jesus Christ, which are clear to those who study the scriptures and embrace His teachings. As we follow the doctrine of the Lord Jesus Christ, we come to know that all of us are the children of God and that He loves us. By following Christ we know where we came from before we were born, we know our purpose for being here on the earth, and we know where we will go when we leave this earth life. The plan of salvation is clear; it is God's plan for the eternal happiness of His children.<br><br>There are commandments that God has given for men and women to live by. They are His commandments, and no one is authorized to change them except it be by direct revelation to God's chosen prophet.<br><br>People throughout the world are drifting further and further away from the teachings of the Lord toward a secular society that the Apostle Paul described:<br><br><i>For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;</i><br><br><i>And they shall turn away their ears from the truth.</i> [2 Timothy 4:3–4]<br><br>Today is the day and the time Paul saw. There is an ever-growing number of people who believe that there is no God, no Christ, no plan of redemption, no Atonement, no repentance, no forgiveness, no life after death, no resurrection, no eternal life, and no eternal families sealed together forever.<br><br>How empty life must be without the blessings of the fulness of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ!<br><br>Now, my brothers and sisters, we follow Jesus Christ. We know the plan of happiness, the great plan of redemption through the Lord Jesus Christ. You graduates know the doctrines of Jesus Christ. You must strive now and always to live by them. Upon your generation will rest the responsibility to teach the doctrines of the Lord and to know how to build up His Church. Please remember that you do not need to feel like you must justify your beliefs; you simply need to explain them in a spirit of love and kindness. The truth always prevails when true doctrine is taught.<br><br>Here are just a few examples:<br><br>1. We follow Jesus Christ's doctrine of service to our fellow man. We serve both our members and those who are not members. The great work we do in humanitarian service throughout the world relieves suffering and hardship. We do all we can by sharing our resources of time and money to meet the needs of both our members and those of other faiths, recognizing that "inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me" (Matthew 25:40).<br><br>2. We follow Jesus Christ's doctrine of striving to live the Word of Wisdom, which is a sound way to enjoy a healthy physical body. We avoid drug abuse of all kinds, because our bodies house our eternal spirits and because happiness in this life is obtained by being spiritually strong and physically healthy.<br><br>3. We follow Jesus Christ by living the law of chastity. God gave this commandment, and He has never revoked it nor changed it. This law is clear and simple. No one is to engage in sexual relationships out of the bounds the Lord has set. This applies to homosexual behavior of any kind and to heterosexual relationships outside of marriage. It is a sin to violate the law of chastity.<br><br>4. We follow Jesus Christ by adhering to God's law of marriage, which is marriage between one man and one woman. This commandment has been in place from the very beginning. God said, "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh" (Genesis 2:24). God instructed Adam and Eve that they were to "be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it" (Genesis 1:28). Modern-day prophets and apostles reaffirmed this command in "The Family: A Proclamation to the World," issued in 1995. It reads:<br><br><i>God has commanded that the sacred powers of procreation are to be employed only between man and woman, lawfully wedded as husband and wife. . . .</i><br><br><i>The family is ordained of God. Marriage between man and woman is essential to His eternal plan.</i> ["The Family: A Proclamation to the World," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1995, 102]<br><br>5. We follow Jesus Christ and teach the first principles of the gospel and all of the other wonderful doctrines of the Restoration that, when embraced and lived, bring peace, joy, and happiness to the sons and daughters ofGod.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, you wonderful graduates, it is just this simple. May God bless you as you now leave this university and go out into the world and fulfill your pursuits, finding happiness and knowing that by following the teachings of Jesus Christ you will have peace, joy, and happiness in your lives.<br><br>I want to leave you my testimony. I bear witness to you that Jesus is the Christ. He is the Son of God. He does live. This is His Church. We are on His errand. He has given us teachings and commandments. We should understand them and teach them with love, power, and spiritual strength.<br><br>I invoke a blessing upon you that our Heavenly Father will enlighten you and bless you in every way when you have the opportunity to explain to the world the marvelous message of the Restoration and that as you explain to those who are not members of the Church that you may be blessed, that you may have heavenly direction, and that you may stand positive in your own feelings, never feeling that you need to be on the defensive being a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. May God grant you every blessing and righteous desire of your heart as you leave this university is my humble prayer. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>M.

<h1>ed for Good” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p>What an awesome sight! What a remarkable collection of personal accomplishment your presence here today represents! What a memorable feeling! I thank the university for the privilege I have to be here to share it with you. For you and your families, this is clearly a high point of your lives.<br><p>Events of a few years ago helped me gain an appreciation for the high points of my life. My oldest daughter, her fiancé, and I decided to climb Mount Rainier. It was something I had thought about often as a young kid growing up in Washington State, where I could always see this snow-capped mountain at the end of the valley where my family lived.<br><p>Mount Rainier stands just over 14,400 feet. It is a serious climb that ascends nearly two vertical miles and, for someone like me, requires serious conditioning. After climbing all day on the first day, we arrived dead tired at Camp Muir, which lies at an elevation of 10,000 feet. We ate and then fell asleep. Our guide woke up us at one o'clock in the morning to begin the climb to the summit. From Camp Muir we headed out across the Cowlitz Glacier with our crampons strapped to our boots and each of us connected to the person in front of us by rope just in case someone slipped on the steep, ice-covered glacier.<br><p>As we climbed, I became aware of how dependent we were on our guide to show us where to go to avoid the crevasses and other dangers and pitfalls. I was struck by the fact that every vertical step I took was into a foothold that someone who had gone before had carved out of the ice. We quickly fell into a routine of climbing for 50 minutes and resting for 10. The climb was amazing. It was a clear night with a full moon and a view of unspeakable beauty.<br><p>After a few hours of climbing, we reached our next rest stop at the top of what is ironically called Disappointment Cleaver. Our guide went to each climber and asked us this question: "Is this your high point?" His question struck me. I knew it was a nice way of asking if that was as high as I thought I could go. But I also remember feeling the distinct impression that as exciting and thrilling as the climb was, I could not count it as a high point in my life. That impression was validated just a few months later at the marriage of that same daughter. Surrounded by family and friends, appreciating what really matters in this life, I remember thinking and telling my daughter, "This is my high point."<br><p>Today marks the beginning, or "commencement," of what will be many high points in your life. I am grateful that my time here at Brigham Young University helped me understand the metric by which I could measure the high points in my life. It is the standard that is laid out in the mission of the university, which is "to assist individuals in their <i>quest for perfection and eternal life"</i> (<i>The Mission of Brigham Young University</i> and <i>The Aims of a BYU Education</i> [Provo: BYU, 1996], 1; emphasis added) and to help them become people "of faith, intellect, and character who have the skills and the desire to continue learning and to serve others throughout their lives" (<i>Mission</i> and<i> Aims</i> [Provo: BYU, 1996], 3).<br><p>That is a pretty high standard. As students of Brigham Young University today, you join a great alumni family of men and women now 370,000 strong throughout the world who share this mission--370,000 who have gone before you carving out footsteps to make your journey through life easier, 370,000 fellow alumni sharing a connection and a commitment to accomplish great things in life.<br><p>At the BYU Alumni Association, we believe that our ability to accomplish great things in life can be magnified when we connect with others who share the Spirit of the Y. We are dedicated to cultivate the Spirit of the Y by keeping you informed and connected to the good works that faculty and alumni are doing in the world and providing opportunities for you to learn, volunteer, contribute, and serve with the students, programs, and activities of your alma mater--keeping you "connected for good."<br><p>We feel so strongly about this idea of being connected for good that we have adopted it as the slogan of the Alumni Association. No longer students, we will remain connected as alumni with a shared commitment to go forth to do good in a world that has now become our campus.<br><p>As president of the Brigham Young University Alumni Association Board of Directors, I hereby confer on each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. Congratulations!<br><p>I invite you to continue to let the mission of BYU guide you to the high points in your life. Let that mission continue to lift and inspire you. Find ways you can be "connected for good"<i> </i>and receive the blessings that come to those who continue to learn and serve others throughout their lives. May God bless you. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p><br><br><i>Dee T.

<h1>g Finches and Family Life - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Since I received this assignment from the First Presidency, I have read carefully the theme and pondered and prayed. I have reviewed the catalog listing more than 1,000 classes and the names of the instructors. There is a good feeling to all of it. I have come this morning to teach.<br><br>When we presided over the New England Mission, we lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Across the street lived Dr. Carl J. Friedrich, a retired Harvard professor, a world renowned scholar. We sent our boys over to clear their sidewalk of snow. That opened contact with them. When my wife's parents came to visit at Christmas, the Friedrichs invited us over for the lighting of their Christmas tree, anold-fashioned tree with wax candles alit. Itwas a very beautiful experience.<br><br>While visiting one day with Dr. Friedrich, he told me of his academic degrees from European universities. He became very agitated and said it really irritated him when people asked what he was going to do with allthe knowledge he had gained. He answered sharply, "Why should I have to do anything with it?"<br><br>Well, I know that you have something to do with the knowledge that you will gain in this great Education Week for yourself, for your family, and for the Church. You are learning much at this great conference.<br><br>I do not know who wrote these very meaningful lines, but I think they apply today:<br><br><i>Suppose that we state as a tenet of wisdom</i><br><br><i>That knowledge is not for delight of the mind,</i><br><br><i>Nor an end in itself, but a packet of treasure</i><br><br><i>To hold and employ for the good of mankind.</i><br><br><i>A torch or a candle is barren of meaning</i><br><br><i>Except it give light to men as they climb,</i><br><br><i>And theses and tomes are but impotent jumble</i><br><br><i>Unless they are tools in the building of time.</i><br><br>. . .<br><br><i>And truly our tireless and endless researches</i><br><br><i>Need yoking with man's daily problems and strife,</i><br><br><i>For truth and beauty and virtue have value</i><br><br><i>Confirmed by their uses in practical life.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>I feel the best possible use of what you are learning at this BYU Education Week will be for your family.<br><h2><b>The House Finches and theSerpents</b></h2><br>The back windows of our home overlook a small flower garden and the woods which border Little Cottonwood Creek. The north side of the garden is the gable end of another part of the house. Except for a large window in the middle, this wall is thickly covered with English ivy.<br><br>Every year this ivy has been the nesting place for house finches. They are small birds dressed as drably as sparrows except in the springtime, when the male puts on a bright red cap and neckerchief as his costume for the serenading that he will do during the nesting season. The male house finch is one of the best soloists in the bird world. The nests in the vines are safe from the foxes and raccoons and cats that are about at night.<br><br>One day there was a great commotion in theivy. Desperate cries of distress brought eight or 10 finches from the surrounding woods to join in this cry of alarm. I soon saw the source of the commotion. A snake slid partway down out of the ivy and hung in frontof the window just long enough for me to jerk it out of the ivy and slam it against the ground. The middle part of the snake's body had two bulges--clear evidence convicting the snake of having taken two fledglings from the nest.<br><br>Not in the 50 years that we have lived in our home had we seen anything like that before. It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience--or so we thought.<br><br>A few days later there was another commotion, this time in the vines covering our dog run--we heard the same cries of panic and saw the same gathering of the neighborhood finches. Now we knew what the predator was. A grandson climbed onto the run and pulled out another snake that was still holding on tightly to the mother bird it had caught on the nest and killed.<br><br>I said to myself, "What is going on? Is Eden being invaded again?"<br><br>We do not destroy the snakes every time we see them, for they help to control insects and rodents. But we had learned a lesson this time.<br><br>For years I had thought the vines were perfectly safe for the birds, but the lesson wasmuch too obvious--too clearly obvious. Ireflected upon Adam and Eve and the serpent in the Garden of Eden as recorded in the book of Genesis.<sup>2</sup><br><br>Now if this story of birds and serpents is an unpleasant way to begin a sermon and makes us uncomfortable, it was meant to do just that. I have read the plainspoken words of the prophets. Some of their teachings are not always comfortable to read. But while this example is unpleasant to talk about, I hope that the principle will be more plainly understood.<br><h2><b>The Adversary's Influence</b></h2><br>There came into my mind the warnings spoken by the prophets. We will not always be safe from the adversary's influence, even within our own homes. We need to protect ournestlings.<br><br>In order to do that, we must first acknowledge that Satan, the devil, lives; what his purposes are; what his intentions would be; and what our defenses should be.<br><br>He was lying in wait in the Sacred Grove when the boy Joseph entered. No doubt Satan was hoping to forestall the Restoration. He was an "actual being from the unseen world, who had such marvelous power as [the boy Joseph] had never before felt in any being" (JS--H 1:16).<br><h2><b>A Dangerous World</b></h2><br>We know that we are spirit children of heavenly parents here on earth to receive our mortal bodies and to be tested. We live in a very dangerous world that threatens those things which are spiritual. The family, the most fundamental organization of the Church, is under attack from forces seen and unseen. The adversary is about. His objective is to cause injury to the family. If he can weaken and destroy the family, he will have succeeded.<br><br>The scriptures tell us, "Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell" (Matthew 10:28).<br><br>We also know that the prophets have said that Satan cannot take one sparrow, or one finch, out of our nest unless we permit it.<sup>3</sup><br><h2><b>Perilous Times Have Come</b></h2><br>Paul warned Timothy and warns us. (Notice how perfectly this warning describes what is going on around us now.)<br><br><i>This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</i><br><br><i>For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents</i> [let me repeat that--"disobedient to parents,"], <i>unthankful, unholy,</i><br><br><i>Without natural affection</i> [let me repeat that--"without natural affection"], <i>trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</i><br><br><i>Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</i><br><br><i>Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</i><br><br><i>For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,</i><br><br><i>Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</i> [2 Timothy 3:1–7]<br><br>These verses serve as a warning, showing usthe patterns to avoid. We must be ever watchful and diligent.<br><br>But Paul also gave us the key to our protection. Speaking in the same chapter, he identified healing power in this small phrase: "From a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus" (2Timothy 3:15).<br><br>In 2 Nephi we are warned:<br><br><i>Therefore, wo be unto him that is at ease in Zion!</i><br><br><i>Wo be unto him that crieth: All is well!</i><br><br><i>Yea, wo be unto him that hearkeneth unto the precepts of men, and denieth the power of God, and the gift of the Holy Ghost!</i><br><br><i>Yea, wo be unto him that saith: We have received, and we need no more!</i> [2 Nephi 28:24–27]<br><br>Moroni spoke of the wickedness of the secret combinations and the wicked men to come among us. He warned us that they would be with us in our day and said:<br><br><i>When ye shall see these things come among you thatye</i> [should] <i>awake to a sense of your awful situation. . . .</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, I, Moroni, am commanded to write these things that evil may be done away, and that the time may come that Satan may have no power upon the hearts of the children of men, but that they may be persuaded to do good continually, that they may come unto the fountain of all righteousness and be saved.</i> [Ether 8:24, 26]<br><h2><b>A Pattern in All Things</b></h2><br>Do we need any more evidence to understand that we are at war with the adversary? The revelations teach us how to win this spiritual war:<br><br><i>And again, I will give unto you a pattern in all things, that ye may not be deceived; for Satan is abroad in the land, and he goeth forth deceiving the nations--</i><br><br><i>Wherefore he that prayeth, whose spirit is contrite, the same is accepted of me if he obey mine ordinances.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 52:14–15]<br><h2><b>The Seventy</b></h2><br>The Lord called 70 men and sent them forth. He gave them authority to teach and instruct and combat the forces of evil. These Seventies returned, and the New Testament says they marveled "with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name" (Luke 10:17).<br><br>And the Lord replied, "Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you" (Luke 10:19).<br><br>We have the names of these Seventies who were called at the time of Christ. Stephen, the martyr, was one of the Seventy, and Nicanor, who also died when Stephen was martyred, was a Seventy.<sup>4</sup><br><br>Much has been done to prepare the Church and its members to resist the forces of evil. We live in a day of revealed direction. I have been witness as a General Authority to changes that were revealed from time to time in order that the Lord might better edify His children.<br><br>For example, when I first came into these circles of the Church there were seven Presidents of the Seventy. They were the First Council of Seventy, the seven of them, and other seventies were in stakes. That pattern of organization served its purpose for a time. As the Church began to grow and move abroad, more Quorums of Seventy were required to minister to branches and wards and stakes and missions across the globe. And much has been changed over the years. The seventies in the stake quorums have been discontinued. Instead, there are now eight Quorums of Seventy with 85 General Authority Seventies and 218 Area Seventies assigned to the work. Each of the Seventy has had conferred upon him the apostolic authority.<br><br>The role of the Seventy is to instruct and edify the leaders and members of the Church and to build up and strengthen fathers and mothers in their sacred role as parents and leaders in the home. They strengthen the parents, including single mothers who need and deserve the watch-care that they can receive.<br><br>The Seventy go where the Twelve, limited by their number, cannot. Seventies are scattered across the world, as they were in the early days of the Church. When you look at the map of the world and where they are, it is dotted with the Seventies who are now serving.<br><br>One who holds the office of Apostle, Seventy, patriarch, high priest, or elder carries the consummate priesthood authority held on the earth--the Melchizedek Priesthood or "the priesthood . . . after the holiest order of God" (D&amp;amp;C 84:18).<br><h2><b>God Is Our Father</b></h2><br>From the accounts of the Council in Heaven we learn that God is our Father, and we are His children.<sup>5</sup> We would do well to always remember Him as our Father. We are instructed to address Him as "our Father which art in heaven" (Matthew 6:9).<br><br>Our Father delegates to His priesthood leaders a commanding authority to preach, toteach, to minister, and to bless.<br><h2><b>Those with a Body Have Power over Those Without</b></h2><br>Joseph Smith taught that "wicked spirits have their bounds." Now listen carefully:<br><br><i>Wicked spirits have their bounds, limits, and laws by which they are governed or controlled. . . . It is very evident that they possess a power that none but those who have the Priesthood can control.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>Joseph Smith also taught a principle crucial in importance that everyone, particularly those holding the priesthood, should fully understand. He said:<br><br><i>We came to this earth that we might have a body and present it pure before God in the celestial kingdom. The great principle of happiness consists in having a body. The devil has no body, and herein is his punishment. He is pleased when he can obtain the tabernacle of man. . . .</i><br><br><i>All beings who have bodies have power over those who have not</i> [let me say that again--"all beings who have bodies have power over those who have not"]. <i>The devil has no power over us only as we permit him.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br><i>Satan cannot seduce us by his enticements unless we in our hearts consent and yield. Our organization is such that we can resist the devil; if we were not organized so, we would not be free agents.</i><sup>8</sup><br><h2><b>Moral Agency</b></h2><br>The agency defined in the scriptures is a "moral agency," which means that we can choose between good and evil.<br><br><i>That every man may act in doctrine and principle pertaining to futurity, according to the moral agency which I have given unto him, that every man may be accountable for his own sins in the day of judgment.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 101:78]<br><br>We feel free to choose our actions and our responses to life's events and challenges, but we are not free to choose the consequences of those actions.<br><h2><b>Tolerance Can Become a Vice</b></h2><br>I must say something about tolerance. Tolerance is a virtue, but, like all virtues, when exaggerated it transforms itself into a vice. The permissiveness afforded by the weakening of the laws of the land to tolerate acts of immorality does not reduce the serious spiritual consequences that result from the violation of God's law of chastity.<br><br>Let me say that again: We who have bodies have the power and authority over those who do not. And we are free to choose what we will and to pick and choose our acts, but we are not free to choose the consequences. They come as they will come.<br><br>Alma taught that "the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance" (Alma 45:16). In order to understand, we must separate the sin from the sinner.<br><br>While "the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance," He is not condemning everyone because of sin. For example, when they brought Him a woman taken in adultery, obviously guilty, He dismissed the case with five words, "Go, and sin no more" (John 8:11). That is the spirit and the letter of His ministry.<br><h2><b>All Have the Light of Christ</b></h2><br>We are born with the Light of Christ, a guiding influence which permits each person to recognize right from wrong.<br><br><i>For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God.</i><br><br><i>But whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do evil, and believe not in Christ, and deny him, and serve not God, then ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of the devil; for after this manner doth the devil work, for he persuadeth no man to do good, no, not one; neither do his angels; neither do they who subject themselves unto him.</i> [Moroni 7:16–17]<br><br>Teach yourself and teach your families about the gift of the Holy Ghost.<br><br><i>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</i><br><br><i>If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.</i> [1 Corinthians 3:16–17]<br><h2><b>Moses and Satan</b></h2><br>The Pearl of Great Price begins with an account of Moses being shown all of the creations of God. When this great vision came to him, Moses learned by this enlightening experience the great difference between being in the presence of the Father and the presence of the imitator--the adversary. There is instruction for us in this account from the Pearl of Great Price.<br><br>After being instructed by the Lord and having seen all things,<br><br><i>the presence of God withdrew from Moses, . . . and</i> [he] <i>was left unto himself. . . .</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that it was for the space of many hours before Moses did again receive his natural strength like unto man; and he said unto himself: Now, for this cause I know that man is nothing, which thing I never had supposed</i> [meaning he was completely humble, completely reduced]. [Moses 1:9–10]<br><br>And in that circumstance, during that time, "it came to pass that . . . Satan came tempting him, saying: Moses, son of man, worship me" (Moses 1:12).<br><br>Moses refused, noting the difference in glory between the Father, whom he had just seen, and Lucifer, the fallen son of the morning. Moses said:<br><br><i>Who art thou? For behold, I am a son of God, in the similitude of his Only Begotten; and where is thy glory, that I should worship thee?</i><br><br><i>For behold, I could not look upon God, except his glory should come upon me, and I were transfigured before him. But I can look upon thee in the natural man. Is it not so, surely?</i> [Moses 1:13–14]<br><br>In consummate arrogance, Satan angrily demanded, "I am the Only Begotten, worship me" (Moses 1:19).<br><br>Moses was frightened, but when "he received strength, . . . he commanded, saying: Depart from me, Satan, for this one God only will I worship, which is the God of glory" (Moses 1:20).<br><br>Satan did not leave. Two times more Moses ordered him to leave him. Both times he remained.<br><br>The fourth time, Moses invoked the ultimate authority and commanded Satan to depart, saying:<br><br><i>In the name of the Only Begotten, depart hence, Satan.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that Satan cried with a loud voice, with weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth; and he departed hence.</i> [Moses 1:21–22]<br><br>Moses learned something about himself, about the Lord, and about the limited power ofthe adversary through that experience.<br><br>Each one of us has to work through a similar testing.<br><br>The scriptures tell us, "Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God" (1Corinthians 2:12).<br><h2><b>Focus on the Family</b></h2><br>For several decades I have watched the changes in the Church to restructure and clarify the focus on the family.<br><br>Family home evening was encouraged by the First Presidency in 1915. The first family home evening manual was printed in 1965. Then in 1970 all auxiliaries and agencies of the Church were instructed to set Monday evening aside for family home evening.<br><br>Family home evening accommodates a man who holds the priesthood, the father of the home, to preside over and instruct his children, with his wife, the children's mother, as his helpmeet at his side fortifying the home with their combined testimonies. And the single mothers are given that authority. The single mother is never far from His watch-care. Family home evening is not just an ordinary, routine program of the Church.<br><br>In 1995 that great document "The Family: A Proclamation to the World"<sup>9</sup> was prepared by all members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. It speaks of gender set before birth to be protected and never defiled.<br><br>The hope is that Latter-day Saints will recognize the transcendent importance of the family and live in such a spiritually attentive way that the adversary cannot steal into the home and carry away the children like that serpent did tothose innocent nestling finches.<br><h2><b>The Priesthood Protects Our Homes</b></h2><br>Our homes are most vulnerable; therefore, the consummate power of the priesthood has been given to protect the home and its inhabitants. It is not an easy or small thing to be a presiding officer in the Church or in the home. The father has the authority and responsibility to teach his children and to bless and provide for them the ordinances of the gospel and every other priesthood protection necessary. He is to demonstrate love and fidelity and honor to the mother before the children that they can see that love.<br><br>"The great plan of happiness" (Alma 42:8) provides that an ordinary member can be extraordinary just "by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel" (Articles of Faith 1:3). We can find safety and security for ourselves and our children by honoring the covenants we have made and living up to the ordinary acts of obedience required of thefollowers of Christ.<br><br>Other simple, individual acts of obedience include prayer, scripture study, temple worship, payment of tithes and offerings, and acceptance and faithful fulfillment of callings.<br><br>Isaiah said, "The work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever" (Isaiah 32:17).<br><br>That peace is also promised in the revelations in which the Lord declares, "If ye are prepared ye shall not fear" (D&amp;amp;C 38:30).<br><h2><b>Fear Is the Opposite of Faith</b></h2><br>Some of you have come today with heavy hearts regarding the welfare of a wayward family member--a son or daughter, grandson or granddaughter. Some of you have been denied the privilege of worthy companionship or even an opportunity of marriage. Some have been denied the privilege of parenthood. But it is not finished in mortality.<br><br>Let me remind you that fear is the opposite of faith. Be hopeful, faithful, and prayerful. Lucifer will <i>not</i> succeed. I do not believe that any righteous, pleading prayers will go unheeded.<br><br>The Lord has said:<br><br><i>While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.</i> [John 17:12]<br><br>I have come to know that faith is a real power, not just an expression or belief. We have a body (Satan does not); we have faith (Satan does not). However much we suffer along the way, in the end all can be well.<br><br>Parents should know that ultimately their children need not be lost. Prayers and service will be rewarded with the thing that they desire the most: the safety and welfare of their children.<br><h2><b>Light and Truth</b></h2><br>The revelations teach:<br><br><i>The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth.</i><br><br><i>Light and truth forsake that evil one.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 93:36–37]<br><br>We are commanded "to bring up [our] children in light and truth" (D&amp;amp;C 93:40). If we explore and understand the things of the Spirit, then we can find out who the enemy is and how to protect ourselves and our children.<br><br>I pray that each of us here can come to know who we are: a child of God embodied in a physical body with attendant powers and blessings. The gospel has been restored and the consummate power of priesthood is among us. If you are righteous and faithful, He will answer your prayers, though not always in mortal life. We believe in an eternal pattern of progression under the direction of the Lord Jesus Christ, whom we worship, and in reverence to the Father, who is our Father, the Father in Heaven.<br><br>I invoke His blessings upon all of us here that the knowledge of the gospel doctrines will protect us and arm us against any challenge that may come to us in our life and do so as a servant of the Lord and in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Boyd K.

<h1>es Brigham Young University Special? - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers, sisters, and friends, welcome to this year's Annual University Conference. I trust you have enjoyed the summer--as they say, both days of it! Or, as many asked in the very rainy month of June, "What summer?" We hope all of you, including those who are here for the first time, are refreshed and full of anticipation for a wonderful and busy academic year.<br><br>At the outset, let me tell all of you how grateful I am for you and for the way this community of scholars and saints has responded to our difficult economic season. My already high level of regard and appreciation has been significantly enhanced. Almost without exception, colleges, departments, and other organizations have responded to the hiring freeze with good humor, solid support of our board of trustees, and remarkably good and creative responses to the attendant difficulties all have encountered. Likewise, the attitudes and adjustments required in the delays of some projects, the targeted decreases in some support budgets, and especially the uncertainties of the duration of our current challenges have been exemplary. For all of this, I express the sincere thanks of our board of trustees, our BYU administration, and especially our students and friends.<br><br>Almost daily, because of the factors with which we are all aware, I am asked when we think this recessionary economic period will come to a close. My answer is that we do not know, and you can quote me on it. It will conclude sometime, and BYU will be well positioned to continue in its progress and advancement. I predict that in some future time all of us will be expressing gratitude for the lessons this season has taught us and for the adjustments that have been made. Again, Iexpress my profound thanks to all of you.<br><br>Let me also assure you that I am in almost constant contact with the commissioner and our board of trustees to address our most critical and pressing needs effectively during this unsettled period. They are most supportive and give me--and I hope you--reason for great optimism for our future.<br><br>Our theme this year comes from the familiar verse found in Doctrine and Covenants 88:118: "Teach one another words of wisdom." Sharon and I consider it a great privilege to be part of this very special community known as Brigham Young University. Thank you for your faith, diligence, humility, and excellence in behalf of our students and university community. This includes both the words of wisdom you utter and also the examples of dedicated service you share with me, our students, colleagues, and the many each year who visit our beautiful and inspiring campus.<br><br>Some visitors arrive for the first time with little or no background regarding BYU. Others come with some understanding of at least a few aspects of Brigham Young University, and some come with considerable trepidation because of ignorance or misconceptions about this remarkable institution.<br><br>Some of our distinguished visitors come in a formal or official capacity, perhaps part of an established exchange program, an institutional or discipline accrediting team, or as international visitors, including ambassadors and other government leaders. Others come less formally, perhaps to visit a friend on campus, consult with a colleague, witness a cultural production or athletic event, or to learn more about an area of research, a program, or a "best practice" taking place on campus.<br><br>Our visitors include young children in yellow school buses coming to the Museum ofArt, Bean Museum, or Derrick Planetarium. They include students and parents "scouting out" BYU. They include proud grandparents and alumni coming to<i>their</i>campus, perhaps to reminisce about how they met, to cheer on their now-adult child or grandchild, or to attend a lecture or concert.<br><br>Many visitors say they feel something when they come to Brigham Young University. Often they cannot explain it. They try to put their finger on what they are feeling with words such as<br><br>"The campus is attractive, clean, and feels safe."<br><br>"Your students are enthusiastic and fun-loving but also so polite and focused."<br><br>"Your faculty is first-rate academically and so caring about students and others."<br><br>In some form these queries ultimately ask, "What makes Brigham Young University special?"<br><br>In my time today I will try to address several dimensions of the question "What makes Brigham Young University special?" Iwill be telling you in the audience things you already know. You are the living examples of BYU. You are the substance of my response to questions I am frequently asked by visitors and friends from other campuses across this nation and from countries around the world.<br><br>Also, taking a step back to explain something to someone else helps us clarify for ourselves what we think and understand. Of course I have neither the time nor ability today to address every dimension of this important question, but let us begin.<br><br>So, what makes Brigham Young University special?<br><br>One of the many reasons I am grateful we have the Gordon B. Hinckley Alumni and Visitors Center at the doorway of our campus is that it provides a starting point to speak of our commitment as Christians and Latter-day Saints. We believe in God, His Son Jesus Christ, the restoration of gospel truth and priesthood authority through the Prophet Joseph Smith, and the doctrines by which the human soul is enlarged by all that is lovely, of good report, or praiseworthy. We also testify of our status as genuine spiritual daughters and sons of our Heavenly Father. I hope you will all visit the Hinckley Center and then take your friends there when they visit campus.<br><br>Some visitors come expecting Brigham Young University to be a kind of religious seminary where future LDS missionaries wear white shirts or conservative dresses and ride bicycles two by two. This image is understandable, and it is also true that the Missionary Training Center to the northeast is technically on the BYU campus. A significant number of BYU students do leave the university to offer voluntary Church service worldwide as LDS missionaries--24 months for men and 18 months for women. Likewise, a considerable number of our staff and faculty also serve for extended periods as missionaries, either interrupting their BYU careers for a season or capping their retirement experiences as missionaries.<br><br>But such service, given without monetary compensation but valuable for life lessons, is not a formal or credited part of a student's BYU experience, nor are older missionaries rewarded financially as they serve missions at their own expense. Some Brigham Young University students take language tests for language credit when they return from an international mission just as do students who participate in Study Abroad and other language study programs.<br><br>At a more conceptual level, a few visitors can imagine BYU as a religious institution but not also as a rigorously academic university. For a few such visitors, the idea of a religious university--faith and intellect together--seems a modern contradiction in terms. Respectfully, we have a different view, to which I'll return in greater detail in a moment.<br><br>On a strictly academic level, visitors ask what makes BYU special or different among institutions of higher education. Directly or indirectly, such queries also ask what makes Brigham Young University similar to other fine institutions of higher learning.<br><br>In this regard, related questions include:<br><br>What are the mission and aims of BYU?<br><br>Specifically, what is the relationship between undergraduate teaching, your clear emphasis, and some graduate programs of distinction?<br><br>How are you funded?<br><br>How are you managing financially in these times of economic volatility?<br><br>What do you look for in your students as they enter and as they graduate?<br><br>What do you look for in your faculty and how are they distinctive or similar to other good faculties?<br><br>Where and how do you feel you are being most successful as a university?<br><br>Do you have a sense of where you are heading as a university?<br><br>These all are fair and important questions, and others occur to you and to our guests. In this setting I have neither time nor capacity to address these questions in the way they each deserve. I will, however, share some observations with those who may be visiting for the first time or the 100th time. And, again, thank you to this audience for your willingness to share together how we respond to these important queries from our visitors.<br><h2><b>BYU Mission and Aims</b></h2><br>When dealing with important, critical, and central questions about Brigham Young University, a good place to begin is with our foundational and constitutional statements. For this reason I will rely rather liberally for a few minutes on the BYU Mission and Aims documents.<br><br><i>The mission of Brigham Young University--founded, supported, and guided by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints--is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life. That assistance should provide a period of intensive learning in a stimulating setting where a commitment to excellence is expected and the full realization is pursued. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Students at BYU should receive a broad university education. The arts, letters, and sciences provide the core of such an education, which will help students think clearly, communicate effectively, understand important ideas in their own cultural tradition as well as that of others, and establish clear standards of intellectual integrity.</i><br><br><i>In addition to a strong general education, students should also receive instruction in the special fields of their choice.</i><br><br>Let me continue with some other statements of significance:<br><br><i>The university cannot provide programs in all possible areas of professional or vocational work, but in those it does provide the preparation must be excellent. Students who graduate from BYU should be capable of competing with the best in their fields.</i><br><br><i>Scholarly research and creative endeavor among both faculty and students, including those in selected graduate programs of real consequence, are essential and will be encouraged.</i>[<i>The Mission of Brigham Young University</i>and<i>The Aims of a BYU Education</i>(Provo: BYU, 1996), 1–2]<br><br>Of course I might have quoted the entire mission statement and usefully explored each thought and each sentence contained therein, but I think you see the general pattern emerge of who and what BYU is--perhaps part of what makes us special and also gives us common cause with the great intellectual and scholarly traditions of Western academia. It would not be a waste of your time to review again these documents in their entirety.<br><br>As a university dedicated to education for eternity, we do believe in intensive learning, instimulating inquiry, in commitment to excellence, and in pursuing the full realization of human potential. As do many large and complex institutions of higher education, we are constantly seeking to keep balance and perspective consistent with and deriving from the directions of our board of trustees with respect to teaching and research and undergraduate and graduate education, selecting students who will most thrive in and add to our institution and those from various backgrounds who can also contribute in unique ways to our enriched environment. We attempt to do all of this while also being cognizant of our responsibilities to serve a large student body and many national and international applicants as well.<br><br>From our basic core principles, inextricably connected with our sponsoring Church, comes our commitment to the charted course for the education we offer our students and our community. From it derives our university's central purposes, our values, the way we are funded, why we take seriously the Honor Code, and our deep doctrinal commitment to learn, including the many ways there are to learn and the many manifestations and expressions of what learning is for.<br><br>Our board of trustees is actively involved in the setting of broad principles and policies while entrusting us at the university to govern ourselves while pursuing the board mandate to make BYU the best it can be (see Cecil O. Samuelson, "A More Excellent Way: A Changing BYU in a Changing World [BYU Annual University Conference, 24 August 2004], and "The BYU Way" [BYU Annual University Conference, 23 August 2005]). As noted in our mission statement, to be the best BYU can be requires attention and focus. We are a large, comprehensive university. Our 560-acre campus includes four museums, two libraries, and more than 300 total buildings--about half of which are for student housing and the majority of the remainder for academic programs. We have slightly more than 30,000 daytime students, including about 3,000 graduate students, and the vast majority being undergraduates. Our faculty currently is about 1,300 strong, and our full-time administrative and staff associates number approximately 2,800 with another 1,000 part-time faculty, administrative, and staff personnel and currently close to 13,000 part-time student employees.<br><br>However large and complex BYU may be, no university, including BYU, can be all things to all people. There are necessarily some things we can do and some we cannot. Former BYU President Jeffrey R. Holland put it this way: "We cannot do everything but what we choose to do we will do superbly well" ("We Cannot Do Everything but What We Choose to Do We Will Do Superbly Well,"<i>BYU Today,</i>December 1981, 16).<br><br>Let me offer a corollary to what President Holland said. It may seem particularly relevant in our current economic times, though its application is not limited to economic times that require choices, but it is part of what BYU is generally. In the spirit of "we cannot do everything but what we choose to do we will do superbly well," we also ask, "What should we do more of, and what could we do less of?" This is a natural phenomenon: If we want to add, we need to ask, what will we subtract? And, naturally, we want to add or intensify or improve that which is most central and that which is done excellently. Conversely, we should do less of that which, while important, may be less central or less able to be done well. In addition, our world and our disciplines are changing, and both require our regular and thoughtful response in a timely manner.<br><h2><b>BYU Students</b></h2><br>Another element of the answer to the question "What makes BYU special?" is our students! Everyone knows that a major secret to any university's success is the students who choose to attend. BYU students come from all 50 states and more than 100 different nations. More than 2,000 international students attend BYU yearly; 75 percent of BYU students speak a second language; nearly 50 percent of BYU students have lived outside the United States, including having been participants in about 158 student programs located in 58 countries around the world.<br><br>In a typical entering class, such as our 2009 freshman class, to use a specific example, BYU has had 10,345 applicants, with 6,983 admitted. Many universities pride themselves on having as many applicants as possible. We do not. In fact, our exemplary admissions and advisory staff work very hard to help high school students who are interested in BYU but who are likely not to achieve admission find alternative higher education options where they may have a greater chance for academic success. I'm grateful this is a place that cares about all students, including those not enrolled at BYU. Happily, some who are not initially successful in entering Brigham Young University eventually qualify elsewhere and are able to transfer here and ultimately graduate from BYU.<br><br>Of those who are admitted, we project 5,600 will be enrolled. Our very high percentage of enrolled students among those admitted is second in the country. Our students really want to come to BYU!<br><br>This year, among our admitted students, 660 are from the first generation of their families to attend a university. The average high school GPA of the entering class is almost 3.8, and the average ACT score is almost 28. Twelve percent, that is 824 students, received 4.0 GPAs in high school, and we have 592 valedictorians. With 40 percent of our incoming class having 3.9-plus GPAs, it is not surprising that our top incoming student cohort looks--by standardized test scores, grade point averages, and demonstrated talents, interests, and service--like an Ivy League entering class. Where they absolutely differ is that all students who are admitted to BYU also must have a very strong and detailed ecclesiastical endorsement from their priesthood leaders, if LDS, or their clergy, if of another faith.<br><br>While BYU pays significant attention to GPA and ACT scores as proven, accurate predictors of likely academic fit and success at BYU, we also read carefully each application as part of our overall dedication to finding students who really want to be at BYU for the reasons that will help them excel and contribute as part of our commitment to an enriched environment. In addition, but not as part of the freshman class, a considerable number of "late bloomers" who have shown themselves capable of success at BYU by their performance at other institutions are admitted as transfer students eachyear.<br><br>Especially in these unsettled and challenging economic times, some recognize, as reflected in various national rankings, that BYU offers tremendous, in fact, nationally ranked, value--that is, an excellent education at a generally affordable cost. This pleases us, but it also frankly worries us. We always want value and values to go together. While we always want expenses to the students and their families to be as low as possible, we also would be disappointed to have students come only or primarily because of favorable cost comparisons--thus the extra care given to the "whole student" in the admissions process. We are delighted our great students come to BYU for its spiritual environment and Honor Code as well as for our outstanding academics. This may help give additional insight to our recent efforts to strengthen and improve our ecclesiastical endorsement procedures.<br><br>It would be reasonable to ask, "Do or should all good LDS students come to BYU?"<br><br>The answer, of course, is a resounding "no" to both questions. We do encourage all LDS students to participate in the institutes of religion wherever they may be if not at a Church institution. We recognize not all good LDS students can or should come. We are grateful for those who do. We understand those who do not and are grateful for the contributions they make wherever they study.<br><br>BYU is pleased with our student retention. Those who enter as freshmen and return for their sophomore year within three years are 87 percent. This duration accounts for the 24 or 18 months of voluntary Church missionary service in which so many of our students participate. The retention rate reaches 93 percent after four years and 94 percent after five years--again, also accounting for students who don't leave on missions or return at the exact beginning of semesters or who may work or be elsewhere involved before returning to the university.<br><br>In the process of time, our students graduate. This past April 2009, for example, there were 3,891 bachelor's degree graduates, 515 master's degree graduates, and 152 doctoral graduates. In our most recent graduation of 12 days ago, we recognized an additional 2,423 students. Ninety-one percent of the men graduating had served full-time LDS missions, and 19 percent of the women were also returned missionaries.<br><br>Regardless of the economic times, recruiters and BYU students both know the value of a BYU education in terms of long-term and immediately marketable skills and training. This is why 133 of the Fortune 500 companies recruit at BYU, why BYU is one of the top five schools recruited by Exxon Mobil in computer science, and why BYU nurses and public school teachers are highly recruited, among many others that you can also identify.<br><br>And three years after graduation, when we ask every BYU graduate to participate in our alumni questionnaire, we are pleased to see almost unanimously positive responses. For example, if we look at the graduating class of 2005, which was surveyed in 2008, we find that 97 percent rate their BYU experience as good and excellent with 96 percent saying they would attend BYU again if they were to make anew decision as to their university of choice.<br><h2><b>BYU Faculty and Staff</b></h2><br>Along with its students, a university's contributions and reputation are measured largely by its faculty and staff. BYU has a very dedicated and highly talented faculty and staff who largely hold terminal degrees in their individual fields from many of the most impressive institutions in the United States and throughout the world. Many also have additional academic or professional recognition and credentials. Like our students, our faculty come from almost everywhere and, if they chose, could be virtually anywhere. We are very grateful they are so committed not just to their disciplines but also to the unique mission of Brigham Young University.<br><br>This means BYU faculty come with a spirit of consecration. Many feel as if they were called to be at BYU, although each understands their positions are technically professional and not ecclesiastical. The result of this is a group of leading and outstanding scholars and professionals who have a sense of dedication seldom seen or experienced elsewhere.<br><br>Having chosen BYU, these remarkable faculty members have also brought with them a commitment, as I discussed last year, to real and consequential teaching, research, and citizenship. This comes from a deep understanding of the mission of BYU and, for most, a similar understanding and covenant relationship with our sponsoring Church.<br><br>As we have said before, Brigham Young University is an undergraduate teaching and learning institution with some graduate programs of distinction. In this statement we find much that explains BYU's identity, purpose, and views on how we determine and measure excellence and what we are striving to become.<br><br>Student mentoring is important at BYU. While the concept of student mentoring is by no means new--we have previously traced its roots back to the very beginning with Karl G. Maeser and his associates--it may still seem unusual to some to see undergraduates involved so directly with faculty in research and other creative work. Sharing important activities like planning, publishing, presenting, and promulgating creative works and research results are very much a part of the BYU fabric and mission.<br><br>There is, however, a subtle balance necessary for our faculty in involving students in research. The balance is not only quantitative--not doing less than is desirable or more than is practical--but also qualitative--making sure that the necessary work gets done but also that important learning for all participating is accomplished. This is why so many BYU faculty, excellent and contributing in every way, know their greatest long-term achievement will be in the success of their students.<br><br>This means BYU faculty are student-centric. It is very different for faculty to tolerate undergraduate students as a necessary requirement for a position at a university and for faculty like our own who see the purpose of the university as the nurturing of the students with whom they interact and teach.<br><br>Something BYU shares with the best universities everywhere is our commitment and passion to the "aha" expression of curiosity--the fire of intellectual exploration and learning. In our case, we seek to be bilingual or multilingual in both the languages of various lands and in the languages of our disciplines while also being competent in the things of the Spirit. We strive to do all of this in order to further the quest and seek to advance the frontiers of new knowledge through all available sources of both insight and inspiration.<br><br>These forms of learning "by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118) are complementary. They coordinate faith and intellect. They complement both and compromise neither.<br><br>I have shared some views about what makes BYU special. Let me now also try to emphasize where and how BYU is similar to other fine institutions of higher education. My list is not all-inclusive but suggests some basic and important commonalities.<br><br>We are committed to open inquiry and to academic freedom. I hope you are aware of the inquiry conference we held last February. The proceedings will be available in the weeks ahead, and I invite you who did not attend to review the content and summaries of the presentations and discussions. In addition to remarkable presenters from both our faculty and elsewhere, including Dr. Sandra Ellman of our Northwest Accreditation agency, we were treated to wonderful summary comments by President Henry B. Eyring of the First Presidency. I was very impressed and touched by both the depth of scholarly consideration and also by the deep understanding expressed in terms of the importance of institutional and individual academic freedom as valued at BYU. We will be announcing soon the exact time of availability of the proceedings of this important event that we will likely repeat in some format from time to time.<br><br>We are committed to contributing to knowledge that is the product of our research and other creative works. It is no longer a secret in the broader academic community or here at home that we have much work of great significance coming from BYU. Weekly I have the privilege of reviewing print media, especially newspapers, and I think there is never a week that goes by that someone or some group at BYU is not recognized for a newsworthy discovery or contribution. It is not the publicity that is so important, helpful as it may be, but the evidence of the learning that has occurred as new knowledge has been discovered or created.<br><br>We are demonstrably committed to excellent learning and teaching. Here I would submit that perhaps the best evidence for these achievements is found in the students themselves. While I have already mentioned with pleasure the high level of their subjective satisfaction and appreciation for their BYU educational experiences, we also have impressive objective data that supports how well our graduates do. Not only are the ones seeking employment at the time of graduation highly sought after, but our students wishing to continue in graduate programs and professional schools are also finding great success. We must remember that these favorable conditions are not only the result of the impressiveness of current students and graduates but also the result of the performance of our students and graduates who have gone before in years past.<br><br>We are committed to good citizenship and to contributing to our families, communities, the world, and also to the academic community generally. Think of so many of our alumni who are prominent in virtually every walk of public life. Think of those who serve in their churches, in the charitable organizations of their communities, in leadership positions in industry and commerce as well as the broader academy. While perhaps not as well known publicly, the numbers of our faculty who contribute to their disciplines on editorial review boards and committees and in accreditation site visits to other institutions and prestigious commissions are impressive and laudatory. If time permitted, we could mention other activities and contributions as well.<br><br>We work closely through an arrangement we call "Shared Services" with our other Church Educational System sister institutions: BYU–Idaho, BYU–Hawaii, and LDS Business College. We also interact with the Church's seminaries and institutes when it makes good sense to do so. The boards and leaders of each of these entities meet together monthly. In the face of this close coordination, each institution has its own distinct identity and mission. For example, we at BYU have the only charter for significant research and graduate education among the LDS Church–sponsored institutions.<br><br>Likewise, we try to be good academic citizens in our state. On many issues and projects, we work closely with Utah Valley University, the University of Utah, Utah State University, and the other state institutions of higher education, including community colleges and universities. While we compete vigorously and with considerable success athletically with our natural in-state rivals, we, like they, understand the value and importance of collegiality and cooperation, and all of our universities are thus strengthened. The sharing agreements between our libraries and joint participation on research grants and contracts are only two examples of the many we could mention.<br><br>We strive to be good academic citizens in the nation also, as I have already mentioned. We work with a wide diversity of educational associations and groups at the local, regional, and national levels. This includes editorial boards, national organizations, scholarly and professional societies, as well as groups such as the Mountain West Conference in athletics, the American Association of Presidents of Independent Colleges and Universities, the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities, and the U.S. Department of Education.<br><br>While we cooperate and interact as we can, we stand independent of all external institutions when we must, just as does our sponsoring Church (see D&amp;amp;C 78:14). We try to join with others when we can in a spirit of genuine engagement and mutual contribution in support of good and worthy causes. But there are some things we cannot and will not do.<br><br>Happily, our history provides patterns of how we can and must deal with external realities, both opportunities and challenges. As an example, BYU Broadcasting has had to deal with potential challenges to KBYU, our Public Broadcasting Service television station, over our continuing to carry religious programming. While the media may have made more of the situation than really existed--because at no time was our programming in serious jeopardy--it highlights the fact that not everyone will understand or agree to everything we believe to be fundamental.<br><br>As you all know, we do not have coeducational student housing at BYU, nor will we have it in the future. During Elder Oaks' presidency, there were Title IX challenges to our values and practices. With some very good legal work and help from heaven, we have been able to continue our essential and nonnegotiable policies and practices on student housing. There are just some things we cannot and will not do. We know that other challenges exist and are coming, but we face them with confidence, with faith, and with courage because we know that BYU is a very special place and receives very special help when it is merited and needed. Our challenge is to continue to be vigilant and do the very best we can so that perceived mediocrity in one area might not be used as an excuse for assaults against our basic values or our unique educational mission.<br><br>A further commonality we experience with all universities and institutions in this nation and in most of the world is the current economic uncertainty and challenge. Because of the prudence of our board leaders and the solid position of the university generally, we have been affected less severely than have other institutions of which we are aware.<br><br>Some very excellent universities in this country have had dramatic budget cuts with both program and staff eliminations and layoffs. While it is true that we have been asked to curtail or reduce spending where we can and in certain categories, it is also true that we have been spared blanket layoffs or draconian cuts.<br><br>It is true that BYU, like all Church entities, has been under a hiring freeze for several months. It is also true that we have been asked to do more with less. Because not all faculty who have either left or retired have been able to be replaced, we have had to ask our faculty to teach more and larger sections and eliminate some courses that might be attractive but not essential. It is also true that with the permission of the board we have been able to bring in just a few more visiting faculty than usual to help us with the load. As I said at the outset, our board of trustees is committed to and supportive of our current efforts and also to our future stability and continuing improvement.<br><br>Nevertheless, it has been a somewhat stressful time that may yet continue for a while. Let me take this occasion to thank our entire community publicly and profoundly for handling this difficult time with so much care, class, and understanding. Many sacrifices have and are being made, and we are grateful for what is being done. I think we all recognize how fortunate we are to have employment and the solid backing of the board and leadership of the Church. Some institutions may fail or even go away, but neither will be the lot of BYU.<br><br>Brigham Young University will continue to strive to be the best it can be. There is much current discussion about what is described by some as the "new normal." In society generally, examples include the understanding that children will not automatically live in larger homes than did their parents nor have the expanding discretionary spendable resources some have thought to be inexhaustible for several generations. I find it quite interesting to hear various financial advisors give advice as if it were new, while the prophets of this dispensation have been counseling us clearly in this regard for decades.<br><br>I believe it fair to say that none of us yet fully understands what the "new normal" might mean for BYU. What we in the leadership do understand is that we will need to be even more careful, more thoughtful, and more courageous in doing more with less, in deciding what we must do less of or eliminate in order to keep this hallowed institution on track to becoming the best it can be, and in doing all that is necessary to meet the obligations and opportunities appropriately placed before us. As good as BYU is--and I believe this university is very good--we have much yet to do to achieve the expectations and promises that exist for us.<br><br>You will see us do some reorganizing and streamlining. You will see us delay some projects that can properly wait for a later time, but you will also see us move ahead with things that must continue. Our new BYU Broadcasting facility just east of us will be completed on time not only because of its importance to the university but also because of its importance to the kingdom. Needed maintenance on the campus will continue, but we will also be a little more patient with some things we would like to do than we have been in the past. Conditions will change, and we will adapt with the counsel and direction of our leaders to assist us.<br><br>I have sought to introduce or review some of what I think makes BYU special in response to the questions of so many who feel something on our campus and want to know what it means. Thanks to all of you for letting me share these thoughts and considerations with you. It is always an honor and pleasure to welcome friends and visitors to Brigham Young University and a very special and valued privilege to greet and meet with your colleagues and associates.<br><br>A special thanks once again to this audience for all you do as we continue our efforts to fulfill the trust given us by our Brigham Young University Board of Trustees, presided over by the First Presidency, to help continue making BYU, and ourselves in the process, the best we can be.<br><br><i style="color: #333333; line-height: 24.375px;">Cecil O.

<h1>et Us Anew  Our Journey Pursue” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, Shane and Robin. That was beautifully done. May we, like Nephi, rejoice in God's mercies even when the journey is toilsome. Especially when it is toilsome.<br><br>We have just sung "Come, let us anew our journey pursue" (<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 217). Perhaps no metaphor for mortality is more ubiquitous than that of life as a journey. The image takes many forms and colorations. Some regard the journey from birth to death as an accident of biology, a purposeless passage into oblivion "full of sound and fury, signifying nothing" (William Shakespeare,<i>Macbeth,</i>act 5, scene 5, lines 27–28). For believers, the journey through mortality is purposeful. It does not lead merely to the grave but constitutes a pilgrimage to a promised land. And for Latter-day Saints, this pilgrimage marks a journey home, a return to a loving Father who sent His children to learn what could be learned only through trial.<br><h2><b>Trials Along the Trail</b></h2><br>Trials are an inevitable and necessary part of our journey home. We knew this before we came to earth. Even so, when "fiery trial" befalls pilgrims along the way, it can feel "as though some strange thing happened unto you," as Peter wrote to the Saints facing persecution under Nero (1 Peter 4:12). It is one thing to know in principle that trials are part of the journey and quite another to experience them in practice. As Shakespeare quips, "There was never yet philosopher That could endure the toothache patiently" (<i>Much Ado About Nothing,</i>act 5, scene 1, lines 35–36).<br><br>This has been a trying year for me, and I fear that I have not always endured my toothaches patiently. I've sometimes felt weary in the journey, even though the difficulties we have faced at BYU pale in comparison to those experienced by American higher education generally. Many, if not most, universities have experienced furloughs, forced program reductions, deep budget cuts, and layoffs. If you read the<i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i>or even our local newspapers, you don't need me to inform you that public and private universities across the country, including those in Utah, have taken big hits. Even the richest universities, such as Harvard, have had to engage in painful belt-tightening because so much of their operating revenues comes from their endowments.<br><br>That BYU would also face challenges ought not to have taken us entirely by surprise. Last year, as you may recall, I showed you this big green ledger book that I had discovered collecting dust in the ASB. It contains a record of faculty salaries at BYU from 1921 through World War II. I mentioned last year that during the Great Depression salaries dipped below their 1921 level, and I said that while I did not "expect a salary cut such as was experienced during the Great Depression, . . . we need to be prepared to face the challenges of our day, whatever they may be, in a manner worthy of our forebears' legacy of sacrifice" (John S. Tanner, "Learning in the Light," BYU 2008 Annual University Conference faculty session address, 26 August 2008).<br><br>I am grateful that thus far during the current recession BYU has been spared draconian budget cuts and layoffs. In fact, most of you received a raise. But BYU is not immune to the consequences of the downturn. Given current conditions and projections, for example, raises may be less likely next year. We anticipate no increase to our salary budget and a modest reduction in our supplies and travel budgets. Regarding the hiring freeze, it continues in force. As the president said this morning, we simply don't know when it will end.<br><br>Frankly, we don't know what the future holds for either the economy or the academy, but I personally feel confident of two things: in the future, there will continue to be solid, ongoing support from the Church<i>for</i>us; and the future will continue to require a spirit of sacrifice and dedication<i>from</i>us. It always has. Therefore, I want to repeat counsel I have given in each fall address the past two years.<br><br>For two years running I have called your attention to a statement by President Spencer W. Kimball. He predicted:<br><br><i>It will take just as much sacrifice and dedication to preserve these principles in the second century of BYU--even more than that required to begin this institution in the first place.</i>["The Second Century of Brigham Young University," BYU devotional, 10 October 1975]<br><br>This is a sobering statement when you recall the sacrifices made by those who built BYU and who were sometimes paid in produce and promises.<br><br>Now, in context, President Kimball was probably speaking more of the spiritual sacrifices necessary to preserve BYU's ideals in a sea of secularism than of financial sacrifices necessary to sustain its basic operation. But whatever the nature of the trials we are called upon to face in our days at BYU, as President Kimball predicted, they will require a spirit of sacrifice and dedication. Maintaining this spirit at BYU has been a concern for all those who have guided BYU--whether in times of adversity or in times of prosperity.<br><br>It has also been a concern for me. As I said two years ago when discussing President Kimball's prophecy: "For BYU to meet this impending test, we must keep alive the spirit of sacrifice and consecration" (John S. Tanner, "A House of Dreams," BYU 2007 Annual University Conference faculty session address, 28 August 2007). Similarly, last year, in speaking again of President Kimball's prophecy, Isaid: "I am persuaded that sacrifice and consecration are vital in preserving the Spirit of the Y" ("Learning in the Light"). The current challenges test our level of consecration.<br><h2><b>Trials as a Test</b></h2><br>Now I do not think for a minute that the hiring freeze, budget cuts, and other small sacrifices we have been asked to make have been concocted as a test. Nonetheless, they do test our spiritual mettle. They bear spiritual as well as temporal implications for us on our journey heavenward. For just as there is no such thing as a temporal commandment (see D&amp;amp;C 29:35), there is no such thing as a merely temporal trial. These current challenges test not only our ability to manage but also our willingness to hearken.<br><br>Given this, what has BYU's response to the current exigencies revealed about its spiritual health? From my vantage, what has been revealed to date is very heartening. In the main, BYU has met the test remarkably well so far--beginning first and foremost with the president. As always, he has acted with complete fidelity to the mandates of our trustees, whose trust constitutes one of BYU's most precious assets in good times and bad. His iron determination to follow prophetic guidance without evasion and with exactness has increased this asset for us all.<br><br>I've seen a similar spirit of obedience, gratitude, and sacrifice among the faculty and staff. It's been quite remarkable and heartwarming. I don't believe there is another major university in the world where one would find such aspirit of commitment to the common good.<br><br>Since the freeze was announced in December, over and over again I have heard heartfelt expressions of gratitude from you for the remarkable resources we enjoy, and I have witnessed your willingness to do more with less. You have come up with creative proposals to find ways to accomplish the work with reduced resources. I've seen departments transfer staff to help units who have lost personnel to the freeze. I have seen faculty volunteer to teach introductory classes in other departments and assume duties formerly discharged by an advisement center. I have seen faculty forego leaves, take on heavier teaching assignments, reduce travel, and accept restructuring plans with good grace. And the staff has been equally magnificent. They, too, are doing more with less. Moreover, they continue to transfer permanent positions from their side of the ledger to ours. We received three more slots from them this year, for a total of 13 over three years. Their "big, hairy, audacious goal" is to transfer 25 slots from administration to faculty. When the freeze is lifted, the positions from these transfers will be deployed to help us meet critical needs.<br><br>In short, the economic downturn has awakened an upturn in the spirit of sacrifice on campus. This has made my heart swell with joy to sojourn among such Saints. While our trials to date have been relatively modest in comparison with those of our forebears, it appears to me that their pioneer spirit still lives on today among a little band of pilgrim professors in Provo. I've worried in past years that our academic success might make us proud and that our generous support might make us complacent--that we weren't prepared to walk in the footsteps of those who have gone before us. After this year, I feel more sanguine that, were we called upon to do so, we might be able to pull our wagons back to Missouri after all.<br><br>What is more, I suspect that many of you would even do so with a smile. You have frequently responded to the current conditions with good humor and good cheer, as the Lord commands: "In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world" (John 16:33). An example of your finding humor in adversity is a poster that one of John Rosenberg's chairs prepared for him. It wittily captures a conversation he and many faculty leaders have been having with you over the past year: "Hope. Nope. Cope!" After the poster was mounted in the hallway, faculty have continued to have fun with its gallows humor. They now pin on the poster news clippings about conditions elsewhere in the academy as reminders that it could be worse. We're coping. And we need to plan on continuing to cope. This is a time for all hands on deck.<br><h2><b>A Catalyst for Good</b></h2><br>The freeze has functioned not only as a test but as a catalyst for good at BYU. Latter-day Saint sojourners know that opposition is required for growth (see 2 Nephi 2:11) and that we are better off owing to a "fortunate fall." Even bitter adversity can have its sweet uses (see Shakespeare,<i>As You Like It,</i>act 2, scene 1, line 12). Likewise, as a result of the hiring freeze and the reduction in travel budgets, requests to fill vacancies, attend conferences, and expand programs are receiving more rigorous scrutiny than ever before. This strict scrutiny is a good thing. It needs to continue in perpetuity.<br><br>Stricter scrutiny, however, has tended to occur ad hoc rather than systematically. So I have asked every college to complete comprehensive workload analyses for each department and faculty member. Most deans report that this has been a revealing exercise, even for deans and chairs who thought they knew their units well. It will help units deploy resources more effectively and equitably, as well as hold individuals more accountable. It will also enable the central administration to respond more knowledgeably to resource requests. We are better off because we have been forced to rigorously examine our resource deployment. There is more transparency, more strategic decision making. Many college councils now regularly discuss position vacancies and frequently recommend moving positions around rather than simply proposing to continue the status quo.<br><br>Current conditions have also prompted us to look for ways to realign programs to strengthen natural synergies and streamline administrative costs. The most dramatic example of this involves the programs in Health and Human Performance, which have been realigned with other colleges. We need to continue to look for more efficient and effective ways to accomplish critical tasks. This is not easy or pain free, but if we meet the challenge wisely, this period will have been a fortunate fall for BYU. Like Adam and Eve, we'll be better off for it. Like Christian, the hero of John Bunyan's allegory<i>The Pilgrim's Progress,</i>we'll be encumbered with fewer burdens on our backs and a clearer vision about the way to the Celestial City.<br><br>Another example of a proposal that promises to streamline while strengthening a core university program is the potential restructuring of general education. I stress that this is only a proposal as yet. Associate Academic Vice President Jeffrey Keith and Dean John Bell have floated a revised model for general education to the Faculty General Education Council, Deans Council, and Academic Vice President's Council. The new model promises to greatly simplify general education requirements and reduce hours while potentially increasing general education's effectiveness. Other institutions that have adopted the model report that it has also significantly increased buy-in by faculty and students. The model allows faculty from across campus to be involved in general education. It also provides students with greater flexibility as well as more opportunities to pursue minors and interdisciplinary study. The new model also makes it easier for the university to define and measure general education outcomes, thereby ensuring that the huge investment BYU is making in the general education of our students is truly meeting its objectives. Now, I am a great proponent of general education, so I want us to look at this proposal very carefully and critically. We have not settled on this new model, but we are kicking the tires. It might be time to trade in a gas guzzler for a more efficient new model. You'll be hearing more about this proposal in the coming weeks as we solicit faculty input.<br><br>To summarize: I believe that substantial good has come out of our efforts to cope with straitened circumstances. Being forced to ration resources has required us to be more reflective about what we're carrying in our wagons and more creative in how we've organized the wagon train and distributed the load. It has brought our community together in a spirit of shared sacrifice. When some are stuck in the mud or are in dire need of food, others pitch in to pull them out and then share provisions. However, we can't continue indefinitely to lose members from our little band. I am grateful that the board has been willing to consider limited exceptions to the freeze to meet the most dire needs. To this point the freeze has not frozen BYU in the snows of Wyoming on its journey toward a rendezvous with its prophetic destiny.<br><h2><b>Teaching Each Other Along the Way</b></h2><br>In preparation for this talk, I reread John Bunyan's<i>The Pilgrim's Progress.</i>(Well, actually, I listened to it while participating in a 100-mile bike ride around Utah Lake.) I was struck by how much of the allegory is devoted to conversation. Bunyan's pilgrim Christian is constantly engaged in teaching and learning from others he meets along the way on his journey to the heavenly Jerusalem. So should we on our journey home. Latter-day scriptures repeatedly enjoin the Saints to "teach one another ... doctrine" and "words of wisdom," "according to the office wherewith I have appointed you" (D&amp;amp;C 88:77, 118; 109:7; D&amp;amp;C 38:23). Last year I mentioned that the injunction to "teach one another" had impressed itself on my mind. I felt that we needed to think more about this as faculty. This impression has remained with me throughout the year--hence our conference theme.<br><br>I discovered last year that Karl G. Maeser had developed an explicit plan for teaching and learning at Brigham Young Academy. You may remember that he adopted as "the guiding rule for the teacher" in the Academy that "whatever can be done by the pupils, the teacher should never do himself" (Maeser, "The Monitorial System," Church School Department,<i>Juvenile Instructor,</i>1 March 1901, 153; see also Maeser,<i>School and Fireside</i>[Salt Lake City: Skelton and Co., 1898], 272). Thus this institution promoted active learning and peer teaching well before it became fashionable in academe. Active learning and peer teaching are part of our institutional DNA.<br><br>In fact, the practice of collaborative learning among Latter-day Saints goes back well before Maeser's Academy to the earliest school in the Church. By revelation the School of the Prophets envisioned a porous boundary between student and teacher. As described in Doctrine and Covenants 88:122, every learner was expected to become both student and teacher at different times, "that all may be edified of all"--this has profound implications for us--"and that every man may have an equal privilege"--this, too, has deep significance for us. I sense that there is important wisdom for us yet to mine that has been deposited in such revelations about teaching one another.<br><br>We tried to bring some of these implications to light in the president's midyear leadership meetings last December. In the lead-up to those meetings, the Center for Teaching and Learning gathered video clips of faculty engaging in active learning activities. Here are some short clips, one from the University of Massachusetts and three from BYU: Debra Himes from Nursing; Matthew Mason from History; and Janet Young from Teacher Education. [A video was shown of professors using a variety of ways to involve students in learning.]<br><br>As these video clips demonstrate, there is a wide variety of ways to engage students in active learning. The video clips also demonstrate that active learning is not rocket science. Active learning strategies may be as simple as having students capture content and critique each other's captures. Such strategies need not replace but can effectively supplement lectures.<br><br>Let's do a brief demonstration together of an active learning activity. [A video was shown of a professor using steel balls and a wooden track to help students learn physics.]<br><br>Now you never know when our students are going to need to be able to apply what they learn from us about acceleration. My son-in-law recently shared this from YouTube. [A video was shown of a man sliding down a giant waterslide, launching from a ramp, and then landing in a pool of water.]<br><br>Do you want to see it again? Here it is. [The video was shown again.]<br><br>Actually, the video is doctored. It generated a lot of buzz a couple of weeks ago on YouTube before it was exposed as a hoax. When I saw it, I was reminded of the steel ball demonstration, so I couldn't resist sharing it. Real or fake, it is the kind of prank some nut like Evel Knievel might actually try.<br><h2><b>Faculty Teaching One Another</b></h2><br>Teaching each other entails more than faculty teaching students or students teaching students. It goes beyond what we categorize under "teaching" in our annual stewardship reports. We fulfill the scriptural mandate to teach one another when faculty teach and learn from other faculty. Certainly we teach one another when we publish scholarship, especially in high-impact journals. Faculty also teach one another when they share and discuss research and creative work among departmental colleagues. I have noticed that departments with strong research cultures are generally places where faculty share and critique works in progress. They engage in lively conversations about each other's research and creative work. In such departments, faculty mentor not only students but each other. They engage in robust conversation about developments in the disciplines. I strongly encourage this form of teaching one another here at BYU.<br><br>I also encourage and commend your efforts to learn from each other across college boundaries. I was heartened to hear in resource planning several deans speak about plans they have to collaborate with other colleges. I have long believed that this sort of collaboration ought to be more prevalent than it is at BYU, in both our teaching and our research. We ought to look for ways to learn from each other across our silos. Advances in knowledge often take place at the intersection of the disciplines.<br><h2><b>Taking Stock of Our Progress</b></h2><br>In<i>The Pilgrim's Progress,</i>Christian and his fellow travelers frequently take stock of their progress toward the Heavenly City. We're also taking better stock of our progress toward our goal of helping students achieve stated learning outcomes. To this end, we're talking a lot more with each other about what our students are actually learning, not just about what we think we are teaching them. Assessment is no longer a hiss and a byword on our journey; it's merely a rubric for the many ways we're trying to measure our effectiveness. Some colleges have instituted assessment days and retreats. One college calls its retreat "Camp Assessalot." We are in the middle of a paradigm shift from teaching to learning. Our focus is shifting from "my course" to "our program." We are beginning to reconceptualize teaching as a public part of our profession--like our research--rather than as what we do in private behind closed classroom doors.<br><br>Increasingly, faculty are also taking stock of their courses in medias res by soliciting formative midcourse student feedback. The new tool developed by the Center for Teaching and Learning has made this easier than ever. It is proving to be effective in raising student teaching evaluations. Evidently, students like to know that we care about what they think. More to the point, midcourse evaluations are helping faculty make adjustments that actually improve learning--which is the whole point. We assess not merely to understand, nor to increase popularity. We take stock to improve learning, to get better.<br><br>One of my favorite lines in<i>The Pilgrim's Progress</i>occurs when Christian encounters Mr. Talkative. As his name indicates, Mr. Talkative loves to talk, especially about salvation. Everything for him becomes an occasion to expound the gospel, but never an occasion to repent and live it. Bunyan shrewdly observes:<br><br><i>Some cry out against sin, even as the Mother cries out against her Child in her lap, when she calleth it</i>[a]<i>naughty Girl, and then falls to hugging and kissing it.</i>[John Bunyan,<i>The Pilgrim's Progress</i>(1678), part 1;<i>The Pilgrim's Progress</i>(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1984), 67]<br><br>Likewise, it is not enough for us to gather assessment data only to excuse familiar faults by saying, "Oh, students always complain about my organization. I'm just a free spirit. They need to learn to roll with the punches when there is no syllabus or I don't return assignments." We must use what we learn from program and course assessments not like a fop to preen and admire ourselves but like an engineer to measure performance and improve it.<br><h2><b>Remembering Those in the Last Wagon</b></h2><br>In our interactions with students and colleagues, we need to remember those in the last wagons (see J. Reuben Clark, Jr., conference address, 5 October 1947;<i>To Them of the Last Wagon</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1947]; also "They of the Last Wagon,"<i>Improvement Era,</i>November 1947, 704–5, 747–48). The president has detailed what remarkable students we have at BYU, and indeed we do have great students. The best could go anywhere and no doubt will go places after they leave us that we and they scarcely dream of, bringing honor and renown on themselves and their alma mater. But there will always be some who don't finish first, indeed, who struggle to finish at all. I do not advocate lowering standards for stragglers, but I do implore us all to assist those who plod along in the last wagons just hoping to complete the trek. You and I would also struggle in some classes. We admit only students who can succeed, but not necessarily who can succeed equally in every subject. Each student has different aptitudes. As Eliot Butler used to say, quoting Will Rogers, "Everybody is ignorant, only on different subjects" (<i>New York Times,</i>31 August 1924; quoted in<i>The Will Rogers Book,</i>comp. Paula McSpadden Love [Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1961], 138). Likewise, everybody has something to teach us if we are willing to learn from one another.<br><br>Some of our students will<i>not</i>go on to become prominent professionals in law, medicine, or business, much less follow our paths to graduate school and the professoriate. They won't grow up to be just like us. Imagine that! Yet they too are beloved sons and daughters of the King we serve and whose throne is the object of our pilgrimage. What is more, they have equal potential to grow up to become like Him. We therefore ought to value and attend to the needs and futures of all those we travel with. For, to paraphrase Chaucer, "pilgrims are we all" (see Geoffrey Chaucer, "General Prologue,"<i>The Canterbury Tales</i>[c.1387], lines 26–27).<br><br>I commend and encourage the initiatives that I am beginning to see bubble up all across the university to pay attention to those who don't immediately go on to a career or graduate school in their major disciplines. Attention to them is a healthy effect of the economic downturn. As financial storms rage and cold economic winds blow, it is important to consider what lies in store for those who don't have the prospect of immediate shelter in the form of a career or graduate school. Well might we echo King Lear's words in the storm as he confessed his failure to notice the downtrodden: "O, I have ta'en Too little care of this!" (Shakespeare,<i>King Lear,</i>act 3, scene 4, lines 32–33). It is salutary for us to turn attention to the needs of all our students, not just the high achievers. It is also the prudent thing to do. More often than not, our future donors will come from the ranks of those who haven't gone on to pursue academic careers but who loved their experience with us at BYU nonetheless.<br><h2><b>Conclusion: Stones and Storms</b></h2><br>In conclusion, let me tease out lessons for our journey from one of the great epic journeys in scripture. The Book of Mormon tells of many migrations to the promised land. None is more evocative than the exodus of the Jaredites. Lehi's group evidently crossed the sea in sailing ships that could be steered and were open to the light of day (see 1 Nephi 18:22). The Jaredites, by contrast, crossed the fearful deep in barges that could not be steered but were completely at the mercy of the tempests and tides. As if this weren't terrifying enough, the Jaredites also faced the prospect of traveling in darkness for a journey that would last almost a full year (see Ether 6:11). The Lord solved these twin challenges of light and steering in two very different ways--through stones and storms.<br><br>As you will recall, He touched with His finger clear stones presented to Him for that purpose by the brother of Jared. As a result of the Lord's touch, the stones shone forth welcome light to illuminate the dark passage across the deep. We generally remember this divine intervention that helped the Jaredites on their epic voyage. But what about the lack of steering? The Lord addressed this problem with a rougher remedy. He "caused that there should be a furious wind blow upon the face of the waters, towards the promised land; and thus they were tossed upon the waves of the sea before the wind" (Ether 6:5). The Lord's hand was in the storms that "buried [the barges] in the depths of the sea" (Ether 6:6) just as it was in the stones that lighted them.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, I believe that God is likewise in both stones and storms on our pilgrimage to the promised land. We take with us on our journeys bright memories of times when His finger touched our lives. These testimonies light the dark way home, warming us with memories of sacred encounters with a personal God who cannot withhold Himself from those who love Him. The touch of His finger in our lives provides both a promise and a foretaste of the Lord's full embrace. God is in the glowing stones.<br><br>But God is also in the storm. He says to the brother of Jared that the winds and the rains and the floods "have gone forth out of my mouth" (Ether 2:24). He sends his "furious wind" to blow the little band of Jaredite pilgrims toward a new and better home (Ether 6:5). It takes faith to find God in the tempests, but He is there too.<br><br>The Book of Mormon records that "the wind did never cease to blow towards the promised land while they were upon the waters" (Ether 6:8). In a moving epilogue to a very wise book entitled<i>My Grandfather's Blessings,</i>the Jewish physician Rachel Naomi Remen refers to this verse in the Book of Mormon. She writes:<br><br><i>In the course of any lifetime there are times when one has to sail into the unknown without a map or compass. These can be times of despair and terror; they can also be times of discovery. Having accompanied many people as they deal with the unknown, I find that the most moving part of the Mormon exodus story is a single line. Despite the challenges and great difficulties of this sea journey, "the wind always blows in the direction of the promised land." I have seen many people spread their sails and catch this wind.</i>[Rachel Naomi Remen, "Epilogue,"<i>My Grandfather's Blessings: Stories of Strength, Refuge, and Belonging</i>(New York: Riverhead Books, 2000), 376]<br><br>I pray that we can be wise and faithful enough to catch this wind.<br><br>Our closing musical number is entitled "Pilgrim Song." The Apostle Paul says that we are to teach one another not simply through words but through hymns and spiritual songs:<br><br><i>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</i>[Colossians 3:16]<br><br>In the closing song, I hope you feel the grace in our students' hearts as they sing of their faith that we are going to live forever.<br><br>Someday we shall reach the harbor and be "out of the swing of the sea" (Gerard Manley Hopkins, "Heaven-Haven" [1918]). Someday God shall wipe away every tear. This is the promise every pilgrim clings to and holds in his heart, as recorded so beautifully in the book of Revelation:<br><br><i>And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?</i><br><br><i>. . . And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</i><br><br><i>Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them.</i><br><br><i>They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat.</i><br><br><i>For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.</i>[Revelation 7:13–17]<br><br>Brigham Young provided a similar perspective for our early pioneer pilgrims who suffered so much on their mortal journeys. He said:<br><br><i>We talk about our trials and troubles here in this life: but suppose that you could see yourselves thousands and millions of years after you have proved faithful to your religion during the few short years in this time, and have obtained eternal salvation and a crown of glory in the presence of God; then look back upon your lives here, and see the losses, crosses, and disappointments, the sorrows . . . , you would be constrained to exclaim, "But what of all that? Those things were but for a moment, and we are now here."</i>[<i>JD</i>7:275]<br><br>I am grateful for the knowledge shared by pilgrims and pioneers alike, that in eternity "all shall be well, and all manner of thing shall be well" (Julian of Norwich,<i>Revelations of Divine Love</i>[c. 1373–1388; also called<i>A Book of Showings</i>], Thirteenth Revelation, chapter 27). The choir shall now sing "Pilgrim Song," whose chorus supplies a coda for these remarks:<i>My soul doth long to go where I may fully know the glory of my Savior. And as I pass along I'll sing the Christian song: I'm going to live forever.</i><br><br>["Pilgrim Song," arranged by Ryan Murphy (2000); lyrics adapted from "The Christian's Song,"<i>The Golden Harp; or, Camp-Meeting Hymns, Old and New</i>(Oneida, New York: George W. Henry, 1857), 26–27]<br><br><i>John S. Tanner was academic vice president when this address was delivered at the BYU Annual University Conference faculty session on 25 August 2009.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>ure: Relationships and Covenants - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As summer comes to a close and we embark on a new semester, I welcome all of you to Brigham Young University. We are delighted to have those of you here for the first time and grateful for those of you returning. This is a wonderful place, and this is an exciting time to be here.<br><br>At BYU we speak often and regularly of our historic past. We do so because we benefit so very much from lessons previously learned and sacrifices made. We must never forget that we figuratively eat fruit grown on trees we did not plant, drink from wells we did not dig, learn and live in buildings we did not build, and are warmed by fires for which we did not provide fuel (see Deuteronomy 6:10–12). All that we experience is made so much better and satisfying because those of previous times and generations cared not only for their present but also for the future--our present. It is for this reason that today I want to spend our minutes together in considering our futures.<br><br>For almost all of us at Brigham Young University, our future is not only a curiosity but also a fact of our doctrine. We are a millennial people, meaning that we believe the living Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, will literally come again and reside upon the earth. The Millennium will be a long time, a thousand years by our current standards, but will in the grand scheme be a relatively short period because we understand that all people will eventually be granted immortality and those who have earned it will have eternal life (see Moses 1:39). Thus we will live a very long time and our future will be greatly extended beyond what we can conceive in our current state. Because we will live forever, it seems obvious that we must be concerned about our future both proximately and distally.<br><br>Some think about the future, if they consider it at all, in rather fatalist terms. That is, they live and act as if the days to come have already been predetermined for them. They have not! Others seem to feel that what they do or do not do today or tomorrow can be fully compensated for with what some have described as "deathbed repentance." This is likewise a dangerous and largely erroneous point of view.<br><br>Happily, many of you believe the decisions you now make are real and have either a positive or a negative impact on your future in both mortality and the eternities. I believe you are right and encourage you to act and perform as you think and believe.<br><br>Very soon you will be focused--as you should be--on the first examinations of the semester. Living today is very important because who you are now is greatly influenced by your past life, just as your future is affected by your present experiences. In a very real sense, our entire lives are like our years as college students. At the end, we will all be different than we were at the beginning, and what we do along the way has a great deal to do with our possibilities and eventual outcomes.<br><br>Recently I had the opportunity of joining other General Authorities in attending a celebration for President Thomas S. Monson on the occasion of his 82nd birthday. In his remarks that day, he referred to a favorite song of years ago, "Que Sera, Sera." I remember it well and still hear it from time to time. When I was just beginning high school (back in ancient history for most of you!), Doris Day, a well-liked actress and singer of the time, made this song very popular. In it is found some wisdom but also some false doctrine.<br><br>Don't worry. I don't plan to sing it, but I want to share the words.<br><br><i>When I was just a little girl,</i><br><br><i>I asked my mother, "What will I be?</i><br><br><i>Will I be pretty? Will I be rich?"</i><br><br><i>Here's what she said to me:</i><br><br><i>"Que sera, sera.</i><br><br><i>Whatever will be, will be.</i><br><br><i>The future's not ours to see.</i><br><br><i>Que sera, sera.</i><br><br><i>What will be, will be."</i><br><br><i>When I grew up and fell in love,</i><br><br><i>I asked my sweetheart, "What lies ahead?</i><br><br><i>Will we have rainbows day after day?"</i><br><br><i>Here's what my sweetheart said:</i><br><br><i>"Que sera, sera.</i><br><br><i>Whatever will be, will be.</i><br><br><i>The future's not ours to see.</i><br><br><i>Que sera, sera.</i><br><br><i>What will be, will be."</i><br><br><i>Now I have children of my own.</i><br><br><i>They ask their mother, "What will I be?</i><br><br><i>Will I be handsome? Will I be rich?"</i><br><br><i>I tell them tenderly:</i><br><br><i>"Que sera, sera.</i><br><br><i>Whatever will be, will be.</i><br><br><i>The future's not ours to see.</i><br><br><i>Que sera, sera.</i><br><br><i>What will be, will be."</i><br><br>["Que Sera, Sera" ("What Will Be, Will Be"), Jay Livingston and Ray Evans, 1956]<br><br>There is significant truth in the notion that much of what happens to us is unexpected and not in our control. However--and this is most vital and critical to understand--the things of greatest ultimate importance to us are largely in our control and are within the scope of our agency.<br><br>You might wish to rebut this assertion, and I can understand how you might do so with great sincerity and conviction. You could accurately mention that if you develop cancer or some other horrible illness, it was not your choice or your fault. You would be correct.<br><br>You could fairly point out that because of the selfishness of another, you could be seriously hurt physically, morally, or spiritually, and this also would not be your choice or your fault. You would still be correct.<br><br>You could, with precision, describe being in a generally appropriate place doing what you should be doing and still have your life taken or damaged through a natural disaster or act of war--none of which was predictable or under your control--and again you would be right.<br><br>When you get to be my age, you might report that, in spite of your best efforts, you have not been able to meet your eternal companion or be blessed with children or fulfill some other righteous ambition or goal, and you could well be accurate in your assessment that this was not your fault.<br><br>While a student, you might observe that some people have not studied or worked as hard as you have but still get better grades or more impressive opportunities. Other friends might have more pleasant or helpful roommates or study partners. You know students who seem to be able to eat all they want and not gain weight or folks who you might deem to be less nice or attractive who have more dates. This list of unfair occurrences not under your control is almost endless.<br><br>I would agree with all of these observations and most of the others that would readily come to mind. Life is not fair or equal. Notwithstanding our best efforts, things rarely, if ever, turn out exactly the way we would expect, predict, or desire. Life is full of great surprises, both happy and sad. Nevertheless, Istand by my assertion that you are really and quite completely in control of those things of ultimate importance.<br><br>What are the things of greatest importance? Your list and mine might vary on particular days or during specific seasons of our lives. We likely will be thinking about different things, with a far different hierarchy of significance, on the night before a consequential midterm examination when compared with the night before a big celebration or pending vacation trip. While immediately of great concern, most of these matters have little lasting value or compelling import when compared with things I will suggest to you are ultimately of the greatest importance. My list will not be comprehensive--in fact, our time together today allows me to identify only three--but if you take the matter seriously and personally, perhaps it will assist you in making your own roster of things of great magnitude.<br><br>First, I mention your relationships. These include your relationship with your Father in Heaven and His Son Jesus Christ. These associations are fundamental in their own right but also foundational for all of your other relationships. You must not only know but always remember that you are literally the spirit child of Heavenly Father and are known and loved by Him. Just as it was necessary for Him to leave his Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, entirely on His own during the atonement process, He occasionally allows us to feel distance from Him for our own good or because of our own poor choices. However, we must never forget the actual substance of our relationship and the desire of the Father for us to return honorably to His presence. Likewise, Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, has paid the very high price that compensates for our sins, weaknesses, and disappointments when we have otherwise done our very best.<br><br>Your family, although possibly imperfect in some ways, also encompasses a series of relationships of vital importance. Many of you don't need to be reminded of the centrality of the family in our lives and in our doctrine, but all of us need to be helped on occasion with the applications. Most of you are away from home for the first time, and this is an adjustment for you. Likewise, it is also a potentially difficult time for your parents and other family members. Make sure you don't forget them even when you don't need additional money urgently, and, above all, make sure that you love and honor them even when you see their struggles or perceived deficiencies. God loves you and expects that you likewise will love those of your family circle.<br><br>Because we are all children of Heavenly Father, we must have high regard for and good relationships with others. Even though you will differ with many people on matters of preference and principle, remember the injunction of the Savior to love other people.<br><br><i>A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</i><br><br><i>By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</i> [John 13:34–35]<br><br>The last relationship of importance I will mention to you is with yourself. Be honest with yourself, including your failings, mistakes, and deficiencies, but also remember who you are. Allow me to transpose a little the words of Jesus: "Love yourself as you love your neighbor" (see Matthew 22:39). You won't be successful in any of your other relationships if you don't have a healthy sense of who you reallyare.<br><br>Second, your covenants are of utmost importance both now and forever. Keeping them is a fundamental component of your integrity and of your relationship with heaven. For those of us blessed to be at BYU, the Honor Code is a covenant we have made, in addition to those we make as Church members. As hard as it is to qualify and make sacred covenants, keeping them and enduring to the end is also arduous and demanding. As you have been reminded, holding on to the iron rod (see 1 Nephi 8) has never been more vital or necessary than it is in today's world.<br><br>In the future some of our company today will feel disappointed or cheated because, through no fault of their own, they have not been able to complete all the covenants they would like to make and receive all of the attendant blessings. Make and keep all the sacred covenants you appropriately can and God will open the way for you to make and enjoy the others you desire either later in this life or in the next.<br><br>Third, handling your commitments now and in the near future, including the rest of your mortal life, will have a great impact on who you are and what you will become. Make your word your bond. Never represent another's work as your own. Be one known as absolutely dependable and reliable. Loyalty is a major component of each of the relationships I've just mentioned and is also a large part of the covenants and commitments into which you enter. Just as we learn "line upon line," our responsibilities and their associated commitments also increase over time. Most of you are young adults and are experiencing both more individual freedom and more personal responsibility than ever before. Small things like getting to class on time, doing your share of the dishwashing and floor sweeping in your living quarters, and helping those around you when you see the need and without being asked are vital. Likewise, important Church callings, your campus job, or significant assignments in BYUSA are opportunities both to learn and to demonstrate your capacity in handling adult duties and responsibilities. Rarely, if ever, is one entrusted with truly big opportunities and major accountability if he or she has not established a pattern of appropriately fulfilling lesser commitments, obligations, and tasks.<br><br>I hope this brief litany of things that affect your futures will be the cause of some careful reflection on what and where you need to direct your energy, your prayers, and your focus. Your futures are bright--brighter than most of you can currently imagine--because of who you are as children of God. He loves you, and we do, too. He has great confidence in your potential, and we also share that perspective. He has great expectations for you and of you, and we are grateful to be in your company and have the privilege of witnessing your growth and development in the relatively short time you are at Brigham Young University. You can make your futures be as bright as you wish in the truly important things. Be sure to keep them in mind and not become distracted by the many temptations and diversions that will envelope you if you allow them to do so.<br><br>As I conclude, let me again reflect with you on the popular song of more than 50 years ago, "Que Sera, Sera." With great apologies to Ray Evans and Jay Livingston, who wrote the words to this piece, and because I am certainly not a composer of either lyrics or music, I would like to suggest a final verse just for us here that might clarify my views on our futures:<br><br><i>Now that I've grown older,</i><br><br><i>The future's more clear to me.</i><br><br><i>Some things I can't predict or control,</i><br><br><i>But I can become what I need to be.</i><br><br>Heavenly Father does live and loves you. He not only wants you to succeed but has enabled you to do so with His help and that of the Atonement of His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ. This is Their work, and you are very important in our joint goal with Them, which is for all of us to achieve eternal life. We have been and now are being led by living apostles and prophets with President Thomas S. Monson as our beloved current president and prophet leader.<br><br>We are glad you are at BYU and pray for your success and continued growth during this new, exciting academic year. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O. Samuelson was president of Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 8 September 2009.</i><br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1> Rod—The Word of God - Sharon G. Samuelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a great pleasure for me today to welcome all of you delightful students to Brigham Young University. Whether you are just beginning your first semester or are returning to continue your education, the campus is more beautiful and exciting when you are here. My husband and I feel honored to be able to share our time with you at this wonderful institution. You bless so many here with your love of life and the goodness that emanates from you in the Marriott Center this morning. We desire that each of you has success and happiness in your lives, just as we wish the same for our children.<br><br>Speaking of our children, a few short weeks ago my husband was talking to our five-year-old grandson, Owen. Owen looked at my husband's hand and said, "Your hand looks old. How old are you?"<br><br>In reply to my husband's answer, Owen quickly asked, "Isn't that about 100?"<br><br>Owen was quickly assured by his grandfather that he had quite a few years to go until the 100-year-old birthday would occur.<br><br>Even though neither my husband nor I is a centenarian, we are old enough to have had years filled with joys, blessings, and successes as well as challenges, sorrows, and disappointments. My life has taken many different paths, and as I have traveled them, my testimony of our Savior Jesus Christ has been strengthened daily. His words, as found in the scriptures, bring such guidance to my life and seem to become even more meaningful as I view today's world from the perspective of one who is, day by day, moving a little closer to 100.<br><br>Lately I have been drawn to the Book of Mormon, where Lehi tells his family, "Behold, I have dreamed a dream; or, in other words, Ihave seen a vision" (1 Nephi 8:2). All of you are familiar with the prophet Lehi's marvelous vision, which he had as he journeyed with his family in the wilderness. This vision is often referred to as the vision of the tree of life and teaches us about the course we should follow through all the years of our lives.<br><br>In the narrative, Lehi was led by a heavenly messenger to a tree laden with fruit that was desirable to make one happy. As he traveled the path to this tree, he went through a dreary waste and spent hours in darkness. He eventually did partake of the fruit, which we know is representative of the love of God. It filled his soul with great joy, and he was desirous that his family should partake of it also.<br><br>In his vision, Lehi beheld people seeking to come forward to partake of the fruit while clinging to a rod of iron on a strait and narrow path. The scriptures inform us that the iron rod is the word of God, or the gospel of Jesus Christ. As they pressed forward, however, a great mist of darkness, or temptation, arose. It was so dense that many became confused. They were unable to find their way and wandered onto strange roads. Large numbers of them did come forth from the mist of darkness, grasping the iron rod, until they did partake of the fruit of the tree.<br><br>On the other side of the river, Lehi saw a great and spacious building, or the pride of this world, and<br><br><i>it was filled with people</i> [or the so-called wisdom of the world], <i>both old and young, both male and female; and their manner of dress was exceedingly fine; and they were in the attitude of mocking and pointing their fingers towards those who had come at and were partaking of the fruit.</i> [1 Nephi 8:27]<br><br>A considerable number of those who had tasted of the fruit became ashamed and turned from the happiness they had felt because of those who were mocking and scoffing them.<br><br>It is this aspect of Lehi's vision that has struck me so deeply in the last little while: individuals who had tasted of the fruit but stillturned away from the word of God.<br><br>This dream was of great significance to Lehi and his family, and it has in no way diminished in its importance to you today. You are living in a world where mists of moral and spiritual darkness surround you and where the adversary is seeking the souls of men through all manner of iniquity. The conditions of your world today were foreseen by the prophets of old and have been and are of great concern to prophets of these the latter days.<br><br>Concerning Lehi's great vision, President Harold B. Lee said:<br><br><i>If there is any one thing most needed in this time of tumult and frustration, when men and women and youth and young adults are desperately seeking for answers to the problems which afflict mankind, it is an "iron rod" as a safe guide along the straight path on the way to eternal life, amidst the strange and devious roadways that would eventually lead to destruction and to the ruin of all that is "virtuous, lovely, or of good report."</i> ["The Iron Rod," <i>Ensign,</i> June 1971, 7]<br><br>You live in a marvelous period of history when you are blessed to have the restored gospel in your lives. You have the word of God, or the iron rod, within your grasp at the present time, or you would not be with us today. Your lives are ahead of you as you search for happiness and eternal joy. In order to live with God once again, you cannot deviate from the strait and narrow path or lose your firm grip on the iron rod or you will be as those who were lost in Lehi's vision.<br><br>As I admitted earlier, I am a little older than most of you here today and have been witness to and saddened by people who I believed were firmly grasping the iron rod but then chose to release their grasp and stray from that which they once valued in their lives. They have tasted of the fruit and for various reasons--and with an abundance of excuses--became ashamed and cast their eyes down and let go of the rod. Some once spoke of their strong testimonies of the teachings of the gospel but in the ensuing years have turned away from all that they believed in their past. There have been those too who relaxed their grasp of the rod and slipped from the path but repented and regained their hold of it. That is of great joy to those who love them as well as to the Lord.<br><br>I have seen some who have succumbed to the persuasions of others who sought to destroy their faith and lead them away from the word of God and thus cause them to lose their grasp of the iron rod. The scriptures have a warning for those individuals who would seek to do such.<br><br>Christ warned, "But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better . . . that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea" (Matthew 18:6).<br><br>There may be those in your lives who will attempt to do the same to you. Be strong and true to the word of God you believe to be true today.<br><br>While traveling on the path to the tree of life, there is no shortcut to reach it; there is just danger off the designated path chosen by Jesus Christ. I often am looking for a shorter or better way to reach a goal or accomplish something that I need to do in my life, but I try to make sure that this way does not affect my eternal salvation or put me in danger of losing something very precious. However, I am reminded of a time I decided to create my own shortcut to reach a destination.<br><br>Near my daughter's home in Denver is a delightful cement and asphalt bike path and walkway. The path leads one through undeveloped as well as developed areas. When I visit there, I take my granddaughter in her stroller as I do my daily walks. The beginning of the path that leaves my daughter's area is downhill for about eight to ten minutes of the walk. You know what that means: the last of the walk is uphill. After walking for 45 minutes or so, I always dread that last uphill climb--especially pushing a stroller.<br><br>When I first started walking this path, I noticed that just before the sidewalk begins its ascent back to my daughter's street, there is a dirt path that is much shorter but steeper than the cement pathway. It would lead me to the street and thus cut out some of the uphill climb near the end. I figured a short uphill climb would be better than a long one, even with its steepness.<br><br>Therefore, on one of my walks I decided toattempt it and began to push the stroller up the path. However, I failed to notice that on the dirt path there was also gravel. Halfway up, my feet began to slip on the rocks, and I found myself and the stroller going backward. I concluded that this was not a good thing, and I became concerned for the safety of my granddaughter as well as for myself. Luckily, grasping the stroller tightly, I was able to turn the stroller off the dirt path and head it back down to the safety of the sidewalk, even though I was running because of the decline. I never attempted that shortcut again.<br><br>My dear young brothers and sisters, there is no shortcut to eternal salvation. Snares, pitfalls, and mists of darkness will come into your lives. I'm sure you have experienced some already. You will run into difficulties, but if you hold very tightly to the iron rod of righteousness, you will receive blessings and protection from the Lord. You will face opposition, but you have the agency to make choices that will determine what happens to you both mortally and eternally.<br><br>If you study the Book of Mormon closely, you will notice that often God's people have tended to believe their present state to be the right one, and although they know the teachings of the Savior, they slowly drift into the ways of the world. This is happening all around us today. However, there is a wonderful promise recorded in the Book of Mormon concerning the iron rod in your lives. It is found in 1 Nephi 15:24:<br><br><i>And I said unto them that it was the word of God; and whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto it, they would never perish; neither could the temptations and the fiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto blindness, to lead them away to destruction.</i><br><br>Thus it is so important that each of you cling tenaciously to the iron rod every day and in every aspect of your life.<br><br>You are at Brigham Young University to seek an education, and that is what you are encouraged to do by your families as well as by the leaders of the Church. The scriptures, however, also give you a warning in 2 Nephi 9:29, where Jacob says to those who think they are very smart and clever, "But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God."<br><br>The Lord loves you, and He does desire for you to succeed in the righteous secular aspects of your life, but not to the detriment of those things spiritual.<br><br>It is my prayer that you do not settle for less than what the Lord wants you to be and that your hands, when old and covered with wrinkles of age, will still be firmly grasping the iron rod. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Sharon G. Samuelson, wife of BYU President Cecil O.

<h1>the Pure in Heart - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a privilege to stand before you this evening. I want to thank everyone in the choir for that beautiful music. Thank you so much for the spirit that you brought. And thank you for the beautiful prayer. I am happy and humbled to be here, and I pray that tonight each of you will know how much the Lord loves you. Iwant you to know how deeply I love you.<br><br>I am happy that my husband, Steve, and members of my family are also here. I love my husband. He and I attended Brigham Young University, and it is here where we made the decision to marry. I think it is interesting that I am standing before you on our wedding anniversary. Happy anniversary, dear! You know, we have been married as long as it took to build the Salt Lake Temple! Or for the children of Israel to wander in the wilderness! And everything we have to show for it is sitting right here on the front row. Our children are our treasures. I love them. I love being their mother. I have watched them grow in the gospel and be tutored from pulpits of the Church. And I am grateful that they have chosen to heed the counsel of prophets, seers, and revelators.<br><br>I have watched the youth of the Church grow in the gospel. I have a unique and special connection with the young women because of the years in which I have served as a member of the Young Women general presidency. We have essentially gone through the Young Women years together. We've earned our Young Women medallions together. We have stood every week and repeated the words of the Young Women theme together: "We are daughters. ... We will 'stand.' ... We believe..., we will be prepared."<sup>1</sup> I think of you as my young women. And I have seen many of you young men as you have received and advanced in the priesthood, honored your covenants and priesthood power, and prepared for and served missions throughout the world. I have met many of you in your mission fields. You are my heroes! You are amazing in your strength and courage and desire for righteousness.<br><h2><b>The Lord Will Help You Make Important Decisions</b></h2><br>Each one of you has embarked on a journey as a Latter-day Saint, and you are in the most critical time of life. This is the time for you to form eternal habits and make lasting decisions. You are the future of the Church and of the nations in which you live. You have been reserved "for such a time as this" (Esther 4:14). You will be presented with opportunities that far surpass your greatest expectations, and you will be blessed, as I was, with defining moments that will influence and affect this decade of decisions.<br><br>It was here at BYU, in a devotional such as this, that it all began for me. I had been dating a young man. One night he began talking about marriage, and he was very persistent! I didn't sleep well that night because of the things he said, and I knew I had to make a decision. I prayed that the Lord would help me know what to do, but I received no instant answer. The next morning we attended a devotional together. While sitting in that devotional, I listened in amazement as the speaker, Elder A. Theodore Tuttle, stood and began to speak about the process of making important decisions. It was as if he were speaking directly to me. He knew my heart, and his words went deep into my soul. He outlined the process of decision making by referring to Doctrine and Covenants section 9. Everyone else seemed to be very familiar with this section of the scriptures except me. You are all familiar with it too, but for me, that day, it was pure revelation and provided a pattern for me to receive an answer to my prayers. He read:<br><br><i>Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me.</i><br><br><i>But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</i><br><br><i>But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of thought that shall cause you to forget the thing which is wrong.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 9:7–9]<br><br>Though this passage was originally directed to Oliver Cowdery, in that moment it became personal for me and was a direct answer to the question I had asked the night before in prayer. Elder Tuttle also outlined a process of listing positives and negatives, making a tentative decision, and then taking that decision back tothe Lord in prayer.<sup>2</sup><br><br>I knew that I had to <i>act!</i> I couldn't just keep doing what I was doing. I had to decide to decide. I knew it, and I knew God knew that I knew it. After I made a tentative decision to move forward, I can't say that my answer came as a burning in my bosom. But it did feel right and comfortable and good. I was no longer perplexed or troubled. I felt peace. I knew what to do, and I was happy. And so I went forward, and that persistent young man is here with me tonight. I am grateful for his goodness, his insistence, and his patience.<br><br>Was it always easy after that answer came? No. My husband says, to this day, that he can show you the heel marks in the sidewalk outside the door of the Salt Lake Temple where I got a little scared and thought that I wanted to wait. But this is what I learned: As you exercise your faith through prayer, the Lord will help you make defining decisions in defining moments. He will hear and answer your prayers through the whisperings of the Holy Ghost. You will not be left alone. You have been given the blessing to be able to receive the guidance of the Holy Ghost. In Doctrine and Covenants section 8, the Lord promises each of us, "I will tell you in your mind and in your heart" (D&amp;amp;C 8:2). That is what happened for me, and that will happen for each of you.<br><br>I bear witness that the Lord hears and answers our prayers and that He will guide and direct us as we seek to do His will and keep His commandments. This is the process of receiving personal revelation. And so I pray that this evening the Spirit of the Lord will accompany you as you listen to the message I have prepared--that it will be crystal clear. I pray that this message will take root in your heart and that it will become very personal to you. I pray that the Holy Ghost will impress upon you the importance of this simple message so that you might be able to incorporate it into the important decisions that you will make during the defining moments of your life.<br><h2><b>Lead the World in a Return to Virtue</b></h2><br>The message I bring this evening is a clarion call for you, the young adults of this chosen generation, to lead the world in a return to virtue. What is virtue? Why is it important? And how can each of us join together in this noble and sacred cause?<br><br>Let me begin with a simple story of a pioneer girl named Agnes Caldwell. Agnes told of her experience in the Willie Handcart Company in 1856. At the time, she was only nine years of age. She related:<br><br><i>Although only tender years of age, I can yet close my eyes and see everything in panoramic precision before me--the ceaseless walking, walking, ever to remain in my memory. Many times I would become so tired and, childlike, would hang on the cart, only to be gently pushed away. Then I would throw myself by the side of the road and cry. Then realizing they were all passing me by, I would jump to my feet and make an extra run to catch up.</i><br><br>She goes on to share:<br><br><i>Just before we crossed the mountains, relief wagons reached us, and it certainly was a relief. The infirm and aged were allowed to ride, all able-bodied continuing to walk. When the wagons started out, a number of us children decided to see how long we could keep up with the wagons, in hopes of being asked to ride. At least that is what my great hope was. One by one they all fell out, until I was the last one remaining, so determined was I that I should get a ride. After what seemed the longest run I ever made before or since, the driver ... called to me, "Say, sissy, would you like a ride?" I answered in my very best manner, "Yes sir." At this he reached over, taking my hand, clucking to his horses to make me run, with legs that seemed to me could run no farther. On we went, to what to me seemed miles. What went through my head at that time was that he was the meanest man that ever lived. ... Just at what seemed the breaking point, he stopped. Taking a blanket, he wrapped me up and lay me in the bottom of the wagon, warm and comfortable. Here I had time to change my mind, as I surely did, knowing full well by doing this he saved me from freezing when taken into the wagon.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br><i>Agnes Caldwell and her family arrived safely in the Great Salt Lake Valley November 9, 1856. They settled in Brigham City, Utah, where Agnes met and married Chester Southworth. They became the parents of thirteen children</i> [and] <i>helped settle an LDS colony in Cardston, Alberta, Canada.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>Had the driver of that wagon taken Agnes into the wagon without making her run, she would have surely succumbed to the bitter cold. And had Agnes chosen to give up and fall behind, her story may have ended much differently. However, for Agnes this became her defining moment, and though the decision to run did not make perfect sense at the time, she ran anyway. She ran toward Zion--following in the footsteps of the prophet Brigham Young and heeding the voice of the Lord, who said, "Let them awake, and arise, and come forth, and not tarry, for I, the Lord, command it" (D&amp;amp;C 117:2).<br><br>This was the run of her life! It was hard, and she resisted. But by running she was able to generate enough body heat to keep warm and keep her from freezing during her ride in the wagon. Each of you is on a journey to Zion, and, like it did with Agnes, what the Lord has said applies: "Awake, and arise, ... come forth, and [do] not tarry" (D&amp;amp;C 117:2), for Zion is not only a place--Zion is "the pure in heart" (D&amp;amp;C 97:21). And purity of heart must be your goal in order to reach that final destination! Never before has there been a generation quite like yours. You are better prepared and better equipped. You have what it takes, and now is the time for the run of your life--your run to Zion!<br><br>President Thomas S. Monson and those before him have shown us the way. The path is clearly marked, and the pace is steady and strong. You, like Agnes, are being asked to cross the plains. You may not have to give up all your earthly possessions, but the journey to Zion requires that you give up all of your sins so that you may come to know Him--the true and living Christ. You may even be asked to run to the point of exhaustion, but by doing so, the warmth of the Lord's love will preserve you for the great work yet to come.<br><br>What you are being asked to do is the same thing the Lord asked when He named His Church The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In Doctrine and Covenants 115 we read, "Arise and shine forth, that thy light may be a standard for the nations" (verse 5). Little Agnes Caldwell ran toward Zion, and by so doing she and all those like her set forth a standard for the nations and for this generation. Her journey to Zion had everything to do with her faith and testimony. It had everything to do with Joseph Smith and Moroni and Oliver Cowdery and Nephi and Moses and Joshua and even Thomas S. Monson. And it had and has everything to do with you and me. Agnes ran because she had a testimony. Her mother knew the gospel was true and taught it to her daughter. They sacrificed their all in order to come to Zion and there build a temple to our God. They knew that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God and that the Book of Mormon was true. They knew that the blessings to be bestowed in holy temples were necessary for the plan to be accomplished. And they knew, as Moroni repeatedly taught Joseph Smith, that "if it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming" (JS--H 1:39).<br><br>Zion was then, and is now, the goal. It is the cause of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. And now is the time, as Mormon and Moroni exhorted, to "be faithful in Christ" (Moroni 9:25) and to "lay hold upon every good gift, and touch not the evil gift, nor the unclean thing" (Moroni 10:30). Now is the time to "awake, and arise from the dust, ... that the covenants of the Eternal Father which he hath made unto thee, O house of Israel, may be fulfilled" (Moroni 10:31). Now is the time to return to virtue!<br><h2><b>A Return to Virtue Is a Return to Purity</b></h2><br><i>Virtue</i> means purity. It begins in the heart and in the mind. "It is a pattern of thought and behavior based on high moral standards."<sup>5</sup> At the very core of virtue is chastity--meaning sexual purity. Virtue and chastity are inseparably connected. You cannot have one without the other. A return to virtue is a return to purity. Some have said that virtue means being kind or honest or having integrity. But the center of a virtuous life is chastity, and one simply cannot be honest or possess integrity in the absence of sexual purity. It is impossible. One cannot tamper with the divine spirit and precious body--the eternal soul--of another and be deemed as possessing any kind of virtue or be virtuous. To do this compromises the very agency we fought for in our premortal life. Some have said that virtue is only for women, but it is not gender based. The Latin root word for <i>virtue</i> is <i>virtus,</i> which means "strength." One contemporary meaning states that virtue is an "effective power or force; [especially], the ability to heal or strengthen."<sup>6</sup> Thus virtue does not just apply to women but to all.<br><br>When the woman in the streets of Jerusalem reached out and touched the hem of the Savior's garment, she knew she would be healed. Why? Because she recognized His purity and His power. The Savior Himself said, "I perceive that <i>virtue</i> is gone out of me" (Luke 8:46; emphasis added; see also Mark 5:30; Luke 6:19). The kind of virtue to which He was referring is power, priesthood power, which always accompanies Latter-day Saint men who are pure and practice "virtue and holiness before [the Lord]" (D&amp;amp;C 38:24).<br><br>Last year on a cold April day after general conference, I climbed Ensign Peak with my two counselors, Mary Cook and Ann Dibb. There we unfurled a gold Peruvian shawl--a banner calling for a return to virtue. There atop that peak, as we looked into the valley and viewed the majestic Salt Lake Temple, we knew that a return to virtue meant a return to moral purity. Virtue is the golden key that unlocks temple doors. As Elder Russell M. Nelson taught, the temple is really the reason for everything we do in the Church: "Every activity, every lesson, all we do in the Church points to the Lord and His holy house."<sup>7</sup> Brigham Young knew that, and there atop Ensign Peak we also knew that to be true.<br><br>As we unfurled this banner to the world, we knew that a return to virtue is not only essential, it is critical. We must be worthy to enter the Lord's holy temple and make and keep sacred covenants and to do the work we have been prepared and foreordained to do. No unclean thing can enter into His house. Just as the driver of that rescue wagon saved Agnes Caldwell from freezing to death, we too have been given the opportunity and privilege to become saviors on Mount Zion--to do for others something they cannot do for themselves. This can happen only when we are worthy to make and keep sacred covenants and receive the ordinances of the temple.<br><h2><b>"Ye Are a Chosen Generation"</b></h2><br>Each of you has a great work to do. What you do and what you decide matters because <i>you</i> matter. You are "choice spirits who were reserved to come forth in the fulness of times to take part in laying the foundations of the great latter-day work, including the building of the temples and the performance of ordinances therein" (D&amp;amp;C 138:53–54).<br><br>No wonder Satan has increased the intensity of his attacks. If you can be distracted, delayed, or disqualified from entering into the temples and doing the very work you have been prepared and reserved to do, he wins. What becomes clear is that you must be pure and worthy in order to receive the promptings from the Holy Ghost that you need for the decisions you are making now. What also becomes clear is that you must remain worthy to enter the Lord's holy temples.<br><br>All the sacrifice and work of all the prior generations have led to this moment. Pioneers sacrificed everything, even their lives, in order that we might see this day because, you see, your advent on the earth is not random. This was all part of the plan you embraced in the premortal realm. You are positioned in a remarkable place in the history of the world. It has been said of you that you are "a pivotal generation."<sup>8</sup> Peter said of you, "Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation" (1 Peter 2:9). Never before has so much been expected. Never before has so much been given: prophets, scriptures, priesthood, ordinances and covenants, temples, the Book of Mormon, and the gospel in its fulness. You have been prepared, called, and chosen. This is your time. I believe that the contributions of your generation will be listed in bold print in any review of these turbulent times in which we are living.<br><br>To accomplish the tasks you have been foreordained to do, your faith must be firmly centered on our Savior, Jesus Christ. You must remember that faith is not only a principle of power but of action. You must act on the faith you already possess. In the premortal realms you exhibited not just faith but "exceeding faith and good works" (Alma 13:3). As Alma said, each of you were "called and prepared from the foundation of the world according to the foreknowledge of God" (Alma 13:3). Young men, you were prepared to receive the priesthood, which would enable you to exercise the power of God while here on the earth. Young women, you were given the noble gift and responsibility to nurture others and become mothers to other choice spirits. You were entrusted with the very powers of godliness--to create a mortal life. Virtuous people are committed to the sanctity of life. They respect God's counsel on how life is to be conceived, protected, and nurtured. There is no strength that is greater than the strength of virtue nor any confidence that is more sure than the confidence of a virtuous life.<br><br>In the premortal realm you participated in a war. You fought with your faith and testimony to accept and sustain the plan that was presented by God the Father. You knew it was right, and you knew that the Savior would do what He said He would do because <i>you knew Him!</i> There were no neutral spirits in the War in Heaven, and there can be no neutral positions now where choices between right and wrong are to be made. The Lord Himself said, "He that is not with me is against me" (Matthew 12:30). You stood with Him! You were eager for your assignment. You knew what was going to be required of you. You knew how difficult it would be, and yet you were confident you could not only accomplish your divine mission but that you could make a difference. As one prophet said of you and your day:<br><br><i>For nearly six thousand years, God has held you in reserve to make your appearance in the final days before the Second Coming of the Lord. ... God has saved for the final inning some of his strongest children, who will help bear off the Kingdom triumphantly. And that is where you come in, for you are the generation that must be prepared to meet your God.</i><br><br><i>All through the ages the prophets have looked down through the corridors of time to our day. Billions of the deceased and those yet to be born have their eyes on us. Make no mistake about it--you are a marked generation.</i><sup>9</sup><br><h2><b>Return to Virtue Could Save a Nation</b></h2><br>When Peter wrote his epistle to the early Saints, he told them to "add to [their] faith virtue" (2 Peter 1:5). Faith without virtue would soon languish and die because without virtue there is no purity. Without virtue there is no strength. And without virtue there is no spirituality. It is clear that once you really understand who you are, you must be pure because purity precedes spiritual power.<sup>10</sup> The power of which I am speaking is not the kind of power we see in the world. It has nothing to do with fame, position, good looks, celebrity, or wealth. The power and strength of which I am speaking has everything to do with virtue, which is chastity and sexual purity.<br><br>We live in a world that is concerned about cleanliness and purity--the cleanliness of our air and the cleanliness of our environment, our water, and even our food. In some places we legislate against pollution and even have government-funded environmental protection agencies to ensure that we are not made ill by contaminants that get into our air, our water, or our food supply. Yet society tolerates moral pollution in the form of pornography on billboards, television, and the Internet and in entertainment and other media. We tolerate filth that invades our minds through suggestive lyrics, music, and language. In some respects we are an organic generation ensuring purity and quality in our lives, and yet we are polluting our moral fiber. I believe that the lack of virtue in our society is directly responsible for many of our social, financial, and governmental ills. I believe that the disintegration of faith and families and the financial unrest are directly related to a lack of virtue in our society. And I believe that a return to virtue could save an entire nation.<br><br>We call for a social reform, but what is really needed is a moral reform--a call for a return to virtue. And if we who have been given so much, including the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, don't lead the world in that return to virtue, who will? You were leaders in the premortal world and stood for everything that is now threatened in society. You who are preparing to be influential in every sector of society, the young adults of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, can and must lead this return.<br><br>During the critical days of World War II, Winston Churchill aroused an entire nation when he said:<br><br><i>You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word: victory. Victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory, however long and hard the road may be; for without victory, there is no survival.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>Young men and young women, I echo that call for the war in which we are engaged today by paraphrasing the words of Winston Churchill for you: You ask, what is our aim? Ican answer with one word: virtue. Virtue at all costs, virtue in spite of all opposition, virtue, however long and hard the road to repentance may be; for without virtue, there can be no victory.<br><br>In the Book of Mormon, Helaman and his stripling warriors are known for their virtue and their ability to trust in their mothers' testimonies. They were "true at all times in whatsoever thing they were entrusted" (Alma 53:20). They were covenant keepers, and they fought to ensure that their parents could also keep their covenants. Victory was their aim and virtue was their strength.<br><br>Mormon wrote to his son Moroni about the degenerate society in which he lived. He reported that they had become so base and immoral that they didn't value those things that were "most dear and precious above all things, which is chastity and virtue" (Moroni 9:9). Could it be that we have reached this point in our society? In a bygone era, those who violated the law of chastity were branded with a scarlet letter. Now that brand and letter seems to be worn by the chaste.<br><br>What will your generation be known for? Will you be known as the tolerant generation, the consumer generation, Generation X or Y? Will you be known as the generation who was seduced into living your lives <i>virtually</i> instead of <i>virtuously?</i> Or will you, could you, be known for your purity and virtue and for your courage and strength in leading the rest of the world in a return to virtue--a return so stunning that the very purity of your lives and the strength of your conviction change the course of society and change the world?<br><br>You are preparing for the Savior's return. You must abhor sin. You must position and prepare yourselves now to be "more fit for the kingdom."<sup>12</sup> It has been prophesied that in a coming day, people of all nations will say, "Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, ... and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths; for out of Zion shall go forth the law" (2 Nephi 12:3). Will you be the generation to lead this ascent?<br><h2><b>Be Guardians of Virtue</b></h2><br>In order to do this, each of us must be guardians of virtue. Young women, guard your personal virtue. It really is, as Mormon described, "most dear and precious above all things" (Moroni 9:9), and so are you. You are daughters of God. You carry within yourselves the sacred power to create mortal life and to become mothers of Heavenly Father's choice and pure spirits. It is one of God's greatest gifts to His precious daughters. Safeguard that power by living the standards, dressing and acting modestly, and remaining virtuous. Safeguard your power through purity of thought and action. Do not allow anyone to tamper with your God-given gifts. By so doing, you, your family, and the generations that follow will be strengthened and blessed.<br><br>Young men, you too are guardians of virtue. You hold priesthood power--the power to bless and to act for God here on the earth. The Lord has said to all priesthood holders, "Practise virtue and holiness before me" (D&amp;amp;C 38:24). Guard your personal virtue, your thoughts, what you view, what you say, and your actions. Do not allow pornography to diminish your personal power. Remain pure so that you can exercise the power of the priesthood with which God has entrusted you. Moroni summarized the ancient prophetic teaching about virtue when he told us:<br><br><i>Be wise in the days of your probation; strip yourselves of all uncleanness; ask not, that ye may consume it on your lusts, but ask with a firmness unshaken, that ye will yield to no temptation, but that ye will serve the true and living God.</i> [Mormon 9:28]<br><br>Several years ago I was running early in the morning on the day before Thanksgiving with a group of women. We called it our Thanksgiving run, and as we ran we called out things for which we were thankful. I had just finished saying that I was thankful for a strong, healthy body when I slipped and fell on a patch of black ice on the road. As I tried to get up, I realized that I was badly hurt. I knew I had broken my leg just above the ankle--and I won't say how I knew or I could faint right here on the spot. My husband said that if I had been an NFL football player, I would have made the highlight films that night.<br><br>As I lay there in the road in the shadows of the early morning light, waiting for help to arrive, I saw the lights of a car come speeding down the road right toward where I lay. The car screeched to a stop, and a man jumped out. He said he had thought I was a garbage bag in the road and almost kept going. I asked if he were a member of the Church, and he replied that he was. I asked if he could give me a blessing because the pain was so severe I didn't know how long I could stay in that condition. He paused and then said: "I can't. You better wait for your husband to do that." Then he got in his car and drove away.<br><br>When I arrived at the hospital, I was wheeled into a little cubicle in the emergency room where I waited to be taken into surgery. As they moved the curtains to the side, there were my husband and all five of our sons. As they encircled me and laid their hands on my head, I felt their purity, their power, and their strength. Young men, priesthood men, keep yourselves pure so that you may be able to use your priesthood power at a moment's notice. That day I was blessed by their priesthood power, which they exercised in virtue and holiness.<br><h2><b>Remain Virtuous in a Toxic World</b></h2><br>I truly believe that one virtuous young woman or young man, led by the Spirit, can change the world! But before we can change the world, we must change ourselves. President Boyd K. Packer said we live in an environment that "is becoming toxic, poisonous to the spirit."<sup>13</sup> So what are some of the things that we can do right now in order to remain virtuous in a toxic world?<br><br><i>First, repent.</i> I am very aware that there are some listening tonight who don't feel virtuous or who have made mistakes. That is why a <i>return</i> to virtue is so important. You must know that you can return. You can change.<br><br>If I were going the wrong way in the middle of a marathon, and I realized my mistake, would I keep going? I would immediately turn around! Why? Because I would have lost valuable time and precious energy and strength, and it would be much harder for me to finish the marathon because of this extra distance and added time. I wouldn't stay on the wrong course because no matter how long I ran there, I would never reach the finish line. And yet for many who have made a moral mistake, a little voice keeps saying: "You blew it. You can't change. No one will ever know anyway." To you I would say, Don't believe it. "Satan wants you to think that you cannot repent, but that is absolutely not true."<sup>14</sup> A return is always possible because of the Savior's Atonement. President Monson has said to each of us who have made mistakes:<br><br><i>If any of you has slipped along the way, there are those who will help you to once again become clean and worthy. Your bishop or branch president is anxious and willing to help and will, with understanding and compassion, do all within his power to assist you in the repentance process, that you may once again stand in righteousness before the Lord.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>Some of you have been abused and are victims of the sinful acts of others. As Mormon said, you have been deprived "of that which [is] most dear and precious above all things, ... chastity and virtue" (Moroni 9:9). Please know that because of the Savior's Atonement, healing is possible. You are not to blame, for you have not sinned and repentance is not required. The Savior suffered not only for our sins and imperfections, but He also took upon Himself our sorrows (see Alma 7:11). Through His infinite Atonement He will heal you and give you peace. Run to Him. Because of our Savior's Atonement, God the Father will hear your prayers. He will answer through the Holy Ghost and others who will be placed in your path.<br><br>I am so grateful for this doctrine and for the principle of repentance. Without it, none of us could ever return to our heavenly home pure and worthy to dwell in the presence of God the Father and our Savior, Jesus Christ. I am grateful for the restoration of priesthood power on the earth in these latter days that enables us to receive the help we need to return to virtue. This power also enables us to remain "unspotted from the world" (D&amp;amp;C 59:9) as we partake of the sacrament worthily. Each week as we renew our covenants, we promise to keep His commandments, to take His name upon us, and to always remember Him. And He, in turn, promises that we can always have His spirit to be with us. (See D&amp;amp;C 20:77, 79.) In a world that is so enticing and so appealing, it is imperative for each of us to receive, recognize, and rely on the guidance of the Holy Ghost. This wondrous gift will show each of us "all things [that we] should do" (2 Nephi 32:5). That is an absolute promise because the Holy Ghost is a member of the Godhead. Some of His roles are to teach, testify, comfort, and warn. This precious gift also purifies and sanctifies. Thus the Holy Ghost and virtue are inextricably connected. We can be purified "by fire and by the Holy Ghost" (2 Nephi 31:17). When this occurs, "we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually" (Mosiah 5:2).<br><br><i>Second, be careful about your choice of friends.</i> In today's technological society, we may spend more time with nonhuman companions than we do with our peers. While we may be very careful about our <i>human</i> companions, sometimes we give little thought to the other companions that we allow to influence us. Media of any kind can be a very powerful social influencer. We have all been given three precious gifts for our mortal experience. These include our body, our agency, and our time. If Satan can entice us to use our time in unfocused or unproductive or, even worse, nonvirtuous pursuits and then deceive us into believing that if we do this in private our actions don't affect anyone, he is victorious. "If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we [must] seek after these things" (Articles of Faith 1:13).<br><br>Seek the companionship of <i>virtuous</i> friends, not <i>virtual</i> friends. Remember, "virtue loveth virtue [and] light cleaveth unto light" (D&amp;amp;C 88:40). This is a relationship scripture. In your pursuit of friendships and an eternal marriage partner, you cannot just make a list of all the qualities you are looking for in another or in an eternal companion. You must <i>be</i> your list at all times and in all things and in all places.<br><br><i>Third, enter a program of strict training.</i> When training for a marathon, one has to have a strict training plan in order to be prepared to go the distance. This same concept applies to life. We are in the run of our life, and there must be a strict training plan. The success components of this plan include things we will do every single day, without fail, in order to invite the Spirit's companionship into our life. They will be different for each of us but will always include daily prayer. Our Heavenly Father hears our prayers, and He will answer them. I testify that that is true. Our challenge is to be in a place where we can hear and recognize the answers.<br><br>Strict training will also include daily reading of the Book of Mormon. Joseph Smith said that "a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book."<sup>16</sup> The Book of Mormon will increase your faith in Jesus Christ, and it is through your faith that you will be able to withstand temptation. This record is for you and your generation. Reading just five minutes every single day will change your life. I know this is true because I have been doing it, and so have thousands of others. Think of the change in five years if every one of us would commit to do this even for just five minutes every single day.<br><br><i>Lastly, smile!</i> And when you smile, remember who you are. You are sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father. He knows you. He knows your name. He trusts you, and He loves you. So, smile! This is just basic training, but it must be strictly done every single day.<br><h2><b>Press Forward--Don't Get Discouraged!</b></h2><br>Let me add just one more suggestion to this list: <i>"Press forward with ... a perfect brightness of hope" (2 Nephi 31:20). Don't get discouraged!</i> Your journey will be challenging at times, and it will not always be easy.<br><br>As I have studied the scriptures, it has become increasingly clear to me that the Lord takes His chosen people out of comfort zones again and again and tutors them on the things that really matter. For example, on the first leg of the Jaredites' journey, they landed on a beach, and they stayed there for four years. They were really in a comfort zone! In fact, they became so comfortable that they forgot to call upon the Lord. But the Lord had a different experience in mind for them. He chastened the brother of Jared for three hours. He told him in advance that the next leg of the journey would be difficult--that he would be submerged in the depths of the sea and driven by the winds. But He also reassured him with six beautiful words: "I prepare you against these things" (Ether 2:25). The Lord will prepare you, and He will prepare a way for you!<br><br>Sometimes I think we totally underestimate the great blessings we might have and the knowledge we might gain if we were willing to move out of our comfort zones. Perhaps that is why Nephi observed:<br><br><i>Wo be unto him that is at ease in Zion!</i><br><br><i>Wo be unto him that crieth: All is well!</i><br><br><i>Yea, wo be unto him that hearkeneth unto the precepts of men, and denieth the power of God, and the gift of the Holy Ghost!</i> [2 Nephi 28:24–26]<br><br>It has been said that we are becoming a generation of spectators and critics. Let me share with you one of my favorite quotes. Ikeep it on my mirror. It says:<br><br><i>It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, and comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcomings; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least</i> [he] <i>fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat.</i><sup>17</sup><br><br>Do not be just a spectator or a critic. You didn't do that in the premortal realm. You weren't neutral then. You stood firm. Do not allow the very voices who cry for tolerance to not tolerate you or your view. This is the arena where all that you defended and chose <i>then</i> is taking place <i>now.</i> Do not get tired or distracted or disqualified! Be willing to step out of your comfort zones and "press forward with ... a perfect brightness of hope" (2 Nephi 31:20).<br><h2><b>Unfurl Your Banner of Virtue</b></h2><br>All over the world young Latter-day Saint women are declaring their commitment to remain pure and chaste. Young women, along with some young men, have climbed mountains and unfurled their personal banners declaring their commitment to return to virtue and to remain pure and chaste. Will you join with them? Contemplate your personal banner. What would you put on your banner if it were your only or last message to the world? What would your banner be or look like?<br><br>In another time and another place, another banner was unfurled. It was done by one courageous man, Moroni, who was committed to the cause of righteousness. The society in which he lived was in turmoil. The desire for power and wealth and status had caused some of the strongest and most determined to, as the Book of Mormon describes, be "poison[ed] by degrees" (Alma 47:18). In other words, those who were initially fixed and determined not to compromise were slowly persuaded to do just that. Alexander Pope expressed what it means to be poisoned "by degrees" this way:<br><br><i>Vice is a monster of so frightful mien,</i><br><br><i>As to be hated needs but to be seen;</i><br><br><i>Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,</i><br><br><i>We first endure, then pity, then embrace.</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>It was in this climate that Moroni unfurled his banner--the title of liberty--calling for a defense of families, of women and children, and of religion and God. He was not neutral. He was not passive. He was not tolerant. He was right! He went forth boldly. The scriptures describe Moroni in words that I believe describe many of you:<br><br><i>If all men had been, and were, and ever would be, like unto Moroni, behold, the very powers of hell would have been shaken forever; yea, the devil would never have power over the hearts of the children of men.</i> [Alma 48:17; see also Alma 46:12–13, 18, 21]<br><br>You are the banner! Your lives of purity and virtue are the banner that will cause the nations of the earth to look up--to come to the temple. As you remain virtuous, you will be led by the Holy Ghost, and your personal virtue will qualify you to go to the temple often. If you don't have a recommend, now is the time to become worthy to receive one. This is your work. The temple will be a strength and a protection to you in an ever-darkening world, and it will become an ensign not only to you but to the nations. A return to virtue is a return to the temple, and a return to the temple is a return to the Savior.<br><h2><b>Virtue Brings the Blessings of Eternity</b></h2><br>Forty-one years ago I knelt at an altar in the Salt Lake Temple and there entered into a covenant relationship with this wonderful man on the stand beside me. That decision has made all the difference in the decades that have followed. I guess what I am trying to tell you is to <i>be there!</i> Don't get distracted now! Don't forget who you are! And don't allow anything to disqualify you for the blessings that await you in the Lord's holy temple.<br><br>I feel prompted to share the words in Doctrine and Covenants 121:45–46. They are for those who are called and chosen and who endure valiantly. They are for you in these trying days, just as they were for Joseph Smith and the Saints in those trying days of the early Church: "Let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God [and] the Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion."<br><br>When we are virtuous, we are promised we shall confidently stand in His presence--holy and like Him. We are promised priesthood power, the very power of godliness, because we are virtuous! We are promised the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost, who testifies, directs, warns, comforts, and sanctifies. And finally, we are promised that we shall have eternal life, the greatest of all God's gifts. We will be gods, living a godlike life, when we are virtuous. We will be like Him--pure even as He is pure.<br><br>The journey to Zion--the pure in heart--will take everything you and I have. I pray that each one of us will have the desire and strength to move out of our comfort zones as we prepare for the run of our lives and, like Agnes Caldwell, reach up and take the Master's hand. His promise is for each of us: "I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up" (D&amp;amp;C 84:88). I testify that our Father in Heaven and His Son, Jesus Christ, live and They will prepare us for the great work to be done in the holy temples of our Lord in preparation not only for the Savior's Second Coming but also for our eternal exaltation. And I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Elaine S.

<br>
<br>
I have looked forward to the opportunity of accepting the assignment and the invitation to be with you today, for I realize you are the heart and soul of many of the parents of this Church, all over the world. What a glorious sight you are! I am also pleased to recognize the officers and faculty members of this fine institution.<br><br>My dear young brothers and sisters, you are in the prime of your lives. You are on the cutting edge of progress. You live in a time of extreme difficulties but also a time of exceptional opportunities. I think the nation and the world have never been beset with a greater variety of challenges to meet and problems to solve, and you and those similar to you are destined to meet those challenges and to solve those problems. I know you can, because the Lord will provide the help you need.<br><br>I love the passage from the book of Acts in the New Testament where we read of the confrontation between a man from Ethiopia, who was reading from scripture, and Philip of old. Philip asked the man if he understood the words he was reading. The man replied to Philip, "How can I, except some man should guide me?"<sup>1</sup> Of course Philip sat with him and guided him in his understanding.<br><br>Just last Thursday I was sitting in the room in the Salt Lake Temple where the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve meet once each week. I gazed up at the wall which faces the First Presidency, and there I observed a portrait of each President of the Church. As my gaze moved from the Prophet Joseph right down through President Hinckley, I thought, "We have had great Presidents of this Church. Each one has guided us; his writings have stimulated us; his messages have inspired us. To show us the way, we have those whom the Lord has provided."<br><br>Some years ago I spoke here of the Presidents of the Church I have known, giving brief personal glimpses. Today I would like to mention each one in greater depth.<br><br>The man who was President of the Church when I was born and who was president until Iwas nearly eighteen years old was the seventh President of the Church, Heber J. Grant. He was ordained and set apart as President on November 23, 1918, at the age of62.<br><br>The Church was a little different when President Grant was President. His personal office was what we refer to now as the First Presidency Boardroom. He sat at a large, rather imposing desk in the enormous room, and just about anyone could drop in to see him. The Church was relatively small at the time. A friend of mine told me that he and another young man had been asked to visit President Grant to see if he would come to their ward and speak at the commemoration of the restoration of the Aaronic Priesthood they were planning. He said they walked through the front door of the Church Administration Building, walked to the back of the building where President Grant's secretary sat, and said, "Is the President in?"<br><br>She replied, "Yes, would you like to see him?"<br><br>They answered in the affirmative and were shown into that beautiful boardroom. President Grant welcomed them and said, "What can I do for you two young men today?" They made their request, and President Grant responded, "Of course I'd be happy to come and speak to the young men. Give me the date and time, and I'll be there." He stood, and they thanked him and left. President Grant visited their ward on the appointed date.<br><br>This scenario probably took place in the early 1930s, and I can assure you that everything is handled <i>much</i> differently today.<br><br>President Grant presided during a time when there was tremendous change in the world, including the financial challenges of the Great Depression. He assisted in the development of the welfare program of the Church and helped the members cope with the tragedy of World War II.<br><br>He was a persistent person. As a boy he wanted to learn how to throw a baseball. He was not as good as he desired to be, so he practiced hour after hour throwing the ball at a target marked on the barn door. He became very proficient. He also was a poor penman, but through extensive practice he developed beautiful penmanship.<br><br>President Grant loved to stand before the priesthood of the Church. Those were the days when everything was a little less structured, and he'd go to the microphone and say, "We're now in priesthood session. We're off the record. The press is not in attendance." Then he'd discuss any subject he chose.<br><br>On one occasion he stood in priesthood meeting and said, "I have a letter from a man who made a suggestion concerning what subject I should address at conference. This man said he felt I had spoken too many times concerning the Word of Wisdom and strongly urged me to speak on a different topic." President Grant continued, "That is one man who obviously needs to hear more about the Word of Wisdom, and therefore I shall address that topic tonight," and he did so.<br><br>President Grant's favorite song was "Do What Is Right." And let me add the words "let the consequence follow."<sup>2</sup> Think of that: Do what is right. President Grant lived by the words of that song. His favorite food was bread and milk--very common, simple fare. A favorite quotation of his is attributed to Ralph Waldo Emerson: "That which we persist in doing becomes easier to do; not that the nature of the thing has changed, but that our capacity to do has increased."<sup>3</sup> What would be the trait of President Heber J. Grant that he would probably have you remember and incorporate in your life? I feel it would be <i>persistence.</i> Persist in all those things which are good and noble.<br><br>After 27 years as President of the Church, President Grant passed away on May 14, 1945, at the age of 88.<br><br>I move next to President George Albert Smith, the eighth President of the Church, ordained and set apart as President on May 21, 1945, at the age of 75. He was president of the Church when I served as a bishop, and he signed my bishop's certificate.<br><br>I believe one of President Smith's most noble accomplishments was after World War II. Starvation was rampant in Germany and in other nations of Europe. President Smith met with United States President Harry S. Truman and said, "We'd like to send welfare supplies to the starving people of Europe, but the bureaucracy and the red tape in postwar Europe are keeping us from doing so."<br><br>President Truman heard his plea and opened the way. He asked, "How many months will it take for you to assemble your supplies?"<br><br>President Smith replied, "President Truman, they're already assembled. All you need do is say go, and they'll be rolling within twenty-four hours."<br><br>President Truman was taken aback by this slender man who spoke rather softly--but oh, could he move things along. The supplies were sent, and Elder Ezra Taft Benson was also sent to oversee their distribution. Lives were saved as a result.<br><br>This great leader had such a compassionate heart. A personal friend of mine told me of an example of such compassion. He said his uncle Junius Burt worked on the street department crew for Salt Lake City, and on a very cold day many years ago, he and others on the crew were chipping ice with shovels and hand implements from South Temple Street between State Street and Main Street. President George Albert Smith said to one of the workers who had no coat, "You should wear a coat today. It's too cold to be out here in this very frigid weather working as you are working."<br><br>The man, who did not know President Smith, replied, "I have no coat to wear."<br><br>President Smith then removed his own coat, handed it to the man, and said, "Here, you take this coat and wear it. I work just across thestreet, and I can get there without a coat."<br><br>Received by that worker that day was more than an overcoat. Received was a gesture of kindness which the recipient of the coat and his coworkers never forgot.<br><br>President George Albert Smith's favorite song was "Let Us Oft Speak Kind Words,"<sup>4</sup> which he personified. His favorite food was apple pie with a little warm milk on it. What was one of his favorite statements? He always taught, "There is a great tug-of-war going on between the Lord and the adversary. Stay safely on the Lord's side of the line." Oh, how applicable it is today in our lives! A trait of President Smith's which he would no doubt encourage us to incorporate in our lives would be <i>compassion.</i> This great leader had a compassionate heart.<br><br>President George Albert Smith served as President of the Church for six years, passing away on his 81st birthday, April 4, 1951.<br><br>Now we move to David O. McKay, the ninth President of the Church. He was sustained as President on April 9, 1951. I remember sitting in the Tabernacle on that day. He was 77 years old.<br><br>Just over twelve years later, in October of 1963, President McKay extended to me a call to serve as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. As I sat there in his office, he had me pull my chair up very close to him, and he put his hand on my knee. His eyes penetrated to my very soul. I will simply say this much about a very sacred experience which I don't share often. He said, "Brother Monson, the Lord has called you to the apostleship. You will become the newest member of the Council of the Twelve." We both wept a little bit. I later wept a lot more when I realized the extent of my responsibilities.<br><br>President McKay was a man of many attributes, but one which stands out is that of consideration. He was always considerate of others. Let me illustrate. I was in his office on one occasion prior to my call to the Twelve. I did the printing of his books, as I did for many of the other Brethren. On that particular occasion I noticed a painting on the wall, and I said to him, "President McKay, that's a lovely painting. Is it a rendition of your childhood home in Huntsville, Utah?"<br><br>President McKay sat back in his chair, gave a familiar David O. McKay chuckle, and said, "Let me tell you about that picture. A sweet woman came in to see me one day and presented to me that beautiful painting, framed and ready to be placed on the wall. She said, `President McKay, I have spent the entire summer painting this picture of your ancestral home.'" He said he thanked her profusely and accepted the gift. "Do you know, Brother Monson," he continued, "that sweet woman painted the wrong house. She painted the house next door! I didn't have the heart to tell her. She may come back, so that's why it's hanging on the wall." But then he made this comment, and here is a vital lesson for us. He said, "In reality, Brother Monson, she painted the right house, because when, as a young boy, I would lie on the bed which was on the front porch of my ancestral home, the view I had through that screened porch was of the very house she painted. She <i>did</i> paint the right house for me."<br><br>President McKay's favorite song was "Oh Say, What Is Truth?"<sup>5</sup> His favorite food: Cummings chocolates.<br><br>What would be an expression of his? From his own heart and soul he said, "True Christianity is love in action."<sup>6</sup><br><br>Again, the noble principle from President McKay that I would share with you today is <i>consideration.</i> May we ever be considerate.<br><br>President McKay served nineteen years as President, until his death January 18, 1970, at the age of 96.<br><br>Next I mention Joseph Fielding Smith, tenth President of the Church. He was ordained and set apart on January 23, 1970, at the age of 93.<br><br>On one occasion I was touring the missions in the South Pacific, having left my wife and family at home. I remember that when I arrived at Auckland, New Zealand, after four or five weeks of meetings in many countries, there was a letter for me from Joseph Fielding Smith, who at that time was my quorum president. He wrote, "Dear Brother Monson, I've been thinking about you and thought you'd like to know that all is well here at home, and I am very pleased that you are in the South Pacific area of the world. My prayers have been with you. We are ready to welcome you home when you return. Sincerely, Joseph Fielding Smith." What a kind and thoughtful thing to do.<br><br>As one of the Church's most prolific writers, President Smith's numerous books and articles helped educate generations of Latter-day Saints concerning the history and doctrine of the Church. He was direct in his teaching of adherence to gospel principles, and yet he was particularly tender in his attitude toward those who fell short.<br><br>His favorite song was "Prayer Is the Soul's Sincere Desire." And I'll add the next thought: "uttered or unexpressed."<sup>7</sup> And as for his favorite food, I observed him at our luncheon table in the temple on Thursdays, and he seemed to love sweet pickles. I hate them! I would see to it that he got the sweet pickles, and I'd take the dill pickles.<br><br>What would be a favorite quotation from President Smith? From the book of Alma in the Book of Mormon he emphasized the scripture "Wickedness never was happiness."<sup>8</sup> I'll repeat it: "Wickedness never was happiness."<br><br>What would be his guiding principle for us? It would be gospel <i>scholarship.</i> He was truly a scholar. I believe we could say that he would leave for you and for me this advice: Be studious. I say that to you as student body members too: be studious. When it is test week, you'll be grateful you were studious!<br><br>President Joseph Fielding Smith served asPresident of the Church for two and a half years, until his death on July 2, 1972, at the ageof 95.<br><br>Harold B. Lee, eleventh President of the Church, was ordained and set apart as President on July 7, 1972, at the age of 73.<br><br>I was with President Lee on one occasion in New York City, where he had an interview with George Cornell, the senior writer of religion for the Associated Press. As we sat there, George Cornell said to President Lee, "I'd like to talk to you about some of the controversial aspects of your Church."<br><br>As he mentioned one or two of them, Brother Lee said, "George, your readers do not want to hear about that. What your readers want to hear about is the great welfare program of the Church and the outstanding education program of the Church." Mr. Cornell began to take notes, and as a result an almost full-page story from the Associated Press described our educational effort and our welfare program. No mention whatsoever was made of the controversial subjects of that time. This was the persuasive ability of Harold B. Lee.<br><br>President Lee also took time to teach. A lesson I will recount is rather tender. On one occasion our oldest son had a tumor in his leg, and we were naturally very worried, as were the doctors. Our son was in the hospital to have surgery, which could possibly lead to the amputation of his leg. Brother Lee had been my stake president as a boy, so I asked him if he would join me in giving a blessing to our son. He consented, and as we met at the hospital one evening after work, he stopped me before we went up the stairway and said, "Tom, there is nowhere in the world I would rather be, and there is nothing that I would rather be doing than standing by your side in giving a priesthood blessing to your son." The operation was successful; the tumor was benign. I shall ever be indebted to Harold B. Lee for being where the Lord needed him to be at a particular time.<br><br>One of President Lee's favorite songs was "Praise to the Man"--"who communed with Jehovah!"<sup>9</sup> I'll pause for a moment and say that when I was first called to the Twelve, I noted that Brother Lee was playing the organ. And he said, "Brother Monson, as our newest apostle, would you choose the song you'd like for us to sing today?" And I chose his favorite, and we all sang it with gusto.<br><br>A favorite food of his was bread and milk, and a favorite quotation of his was "Stand ye in holy places, and be not moved."<sup>10</sup> Remember this. I will repeat it: "Stand ye in holy places, and be not moved." What would be a guiding principle from him? I would say he would encourage us to <i>be in tune with and to be responsive to the whisperings of the Holy Spirit.</i><br><br>Harold B. Lee served just one and a half years as President of the Church. He passed away on December 26, 1973, at the age of 74.<br><br>After President Lee came President Spencer W. Kimball, twelfth President of the Church, ordained and set apart as President on December 30, 1973, at the age of 78.<br><br>For President Kimball, obstacles became his opportunities. He was totally dedicated, a worker such as one seldom sees. He cared not at all about personal aggrandizement.<br><br>One day I was sitting in the temple near President Kimball. As I looked down, I noticed that he had a large hole in his shoe. And I mean large! His stocking showed through. After the meeting I said to Arthur Haycock, President Kimball's secretary, "Arthur, you can't let the President wear those shoes."<br><br>Arthur responded, "Has he got that pair out again? He has many pairs of shoes, and I frequently hide that pair, but he searches and finds that particular pair most of the time."<br><br>President Kimball was known for his statement showing his humility: "My life is like my shoes--to be worn out in service."<sup>11</sup><br><br>President Kimball was totally, completely, unequivocally dedicated to the Lord. He was dedicated to living the gospel.<br><br>One of President Kimball's favorite songs was "I Need Thee Every Hour."<sup>12</sup> Let's remember that one particularly. That choice demonstrates his humility. Concerning his favorite food, I watched him for all the years I was in the Twelve while he was living. He would fill a glass with milk and take some date nut bread and crumble it into the glass until it was thick. Then he would take a spoon and eat it! I did not follow his example.<br><br>What was a favorite quotation or a lesson from him? "Lengthen your stride." We had to lengthen our stride in order to keep up with him! I asked President Kimball what would be a guiding principle from his life. And then I answered it: I believe it would be <i>dedication.</i><br><br>Spencer W. Kimball served as President of the Church for twelve years until his death on November 5, 1985, at the age of 90.<br><br>Brother Hinckley and I served with President Kimball on the Missionary Executive Committee, so we were with him every Tuesday morning assigning missionaries, and the three of us had a very good camaraderie together.<br><br>One day he said to Brother Hinckley and me, "Is this the night where the parents are coming to visit with the mission presidents who are here for conference and we're to have our offices ready for them?"<br><br>Brother Hinckley and I said, "Yes, it is, President."<br><br>"Is your office ready, Tom?"<br><br>I said, "Yes, it is."<br><br>"Is your office ready, Gordon?"<br><br>"Yes, it is."<br><br>"Uh, will the two of you carry on with the meeting while I make my office ready?"<br><br>He carried a thick stack of papers and would thumb through them constantly until they were worn out on the edges, and he began to take care of cleaning up his office so it would be ready for the parents and missionaries. He emptied the files, put them in the closet, and then he moved everything off of his desk and moved it to his secretary's desk. And then he picked up that big stack of papers he usually carried and threw it in his refrigerator. It was the only place left, so he refrigerated his notes! And then he said, "Now I'm ready!"<br><br>You had to love him. You had to love Spencer W. Kimball. You just had to.<br><br>I'll introduce one little thought. He said to me one day, "Tom, could you come in and help me with a problem I have?"<br><br>I said, "Sure!"<br><br>So I went into his office, and he had a man sitting there. (I hope he's not related to you.) But Brother Kimball in a sweet way said, "Brother Monson, this is Brother So-and-So, and he's not happy with the assignment which we made for his son to go on a mission. Why don't you tell Brother Monson why you're not happy with the call the apostles made."<br><br>He still didn't catch on. He said, "Well, he's assigned to the New England mission. I don't want him to go to the New England mission; I want him to go to the old England mission."<br><br>And then Brother Kimball with a smile said, "And which mission would you have him assigned to of those in Great Britain?"<br><br>"Oh, any of 'em, any of 'em."<br><br>And Brother Kimball said, "Now let's see. There's Bristol, there's London, there's London South," and he named them all. "Now which one?"<br><br>And the man said, "Oh no, you go ahead."<br><br>"No, since you, as the father, rather than Brother Monson and I as apostles, are making your missionary son's assignment, you name it."<br><br>I'd never seen a man told off so adroitly, yet he didn't recognize he was being told off.<br><br>He said, "Well, that one you mentioned, Bristol. That sounds good. Send him to Bristol."<br><br>After he left, Brother Kimball said, "Aren't some parents unusual?" He would not use a word I might have used, but then he wasn't in the navy like I was! (That line is not in my prepared message!)<br><br>Now I come to Ezra Taft Benson, thirteenth President of the Church. He was ordained and set apart as President on November 10, 1985. Ihad the privilege of serving as his second counselor during the years he was President.<br><br>President Benson was a generous leader. I was in his office one day when I was a member of the Twelve, and we were chatting. I noticed that he had a beautiful hand-tooled riding saddle sitting on a display in his room. It had been given to him in honor of his service as Secretary of Agriculture.<br><br>I said, "My, Brother Benson, that's the most beautiful saddle I've ever seen."<br><br>He replied, "Do you want it? Why don't you take it? You like to ride horses."<br><br>I assured him that although I appreciated the gesture, I couldn't take the saddle.<br><br>President Benson was the only President of the Church to have received the honor of "Most Preferred Man" at BYU when he was a student here. We'll have a moment of silence for that one. I think the female student body were the only ones allowed to vote.<br><br>Early in his apostolic years President Benson was called by President George Albert Smith to leave home and family and fill a special mission to war-torn Europe. The magnitude of his call was overwhelming. For ten and a half months President Benson labored night and day, blessing the members of the Church in Europe who had suffered through years of war, giving them nourishment for their bodies and everlasting hope for their souls. From the chaos of war came Saints--scattered, battered, and very much in need. To them came Ezra Taft Benson, with his superb organizational skills and with the inspiration of Almighty God.<br><br>Through the inspired welfare program of the Church, hundreds of tons of lifesaving food and clothing were transported across the vast Atlantic Ocean and, under the direction of this gifted leader, distributed to the hungry, the cold, and the homeless.<br><br>What a personally satisfying and spiritually rewarding experience it was for me to serve as one of President Benson's counselors in the First Presidency of the Church.<br><br>President Benson's favorite song was "How Great Thou Art."<sup>13</sup> His favorite food was fresh raspberries, and we had them as often as possible at our temple luncheons when he was President of the Church. His favorite quotation was from the Book of Mormon, words spoken by the Lord. It's in the form of a question, and I pose it to you: "What manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am."<sup>14</sup> That would apply to every man and woman here today: "Even as I am," said the Lord.<br><br>What is a guiding principle from President Benson? I'd have to say it is <i>love.</i> The manner in which he treated his sweet companion and, indeed, all with whom he came in contact provides an example for all of us. Let us love one another.<br><br>Ezra Taft Benson served as President of the Church for eight and a half years until his death on May 30, 1994, at the age of 94.<br><br>We come now to Howard W. Hunter, fourteenth President of the Church, who was ordained and set apart on June 5, 1994, at the age of 86. It was my privilege once again to serve as second counselor.<br><br>My most tender meeting with Howard W. Hunter took place on October 3, 1963, as I entered the outer office of President David O. McKay, who had invited me to come and visit with him that Thursday afternoon--for what purpose I knew not at that time. Howard W. Hunter had been checking some matters with President McKay's secretary. Brother Hunter and I greeted each other and shook hands. I noted the tears in his eyes with yet a smile on his lips and a catch in his voice. I did not understand why he was so emotional. After visiting with President McKay, where he extended to me my call to the Twelve, I understood. Howard W. Hunter had known why I was there that afternoon. He had been where Iwas now going. He had felt the feelings I was soon to experience.<br><br>One of President Hunter's hallmarks was that of courtesy. Whether in a moment of pleasant conversation or in times of constant pain, he was ever courteous. On one occasion a man who had been painting in President Hunter's home said to me, "President Hunter is so remarkable. He graciously thanked me and my crew for painting a room. He commented on the color match, the absence of brush or roller marks, and repeated a hearty thank-you as he shook my hand when we finished our work and departed his presence."<br><br>President Hunter loved all the hymns, but one of his favorites was "Have I Done Any Good in the World Today?"<sup>15</sup> One of his favorite foods was Alaskan crab.<br><br>Before I move on: One day I was with him and a member of the welfare committee, and Brother Hunter had taken a long time setting people apart--you know, it was a division of a stake--and we hadn't had anything to eat. And the man from the welfare committee said, "Could we go to this fish restaurant? They have Alaskan crab, and that's my favorite."<br><br>Brother Hunter said, "Fine choice, fine choice." Then he went right through a red light. And he just smiled. Then he went through a second red light, and then he said, "Oh, by the way, I'm color-blind. I have to see where the light is, then I know which color itis."<br><br>I said, "Brother Hunter, would you like me to drive?"<br><br>He said, "Well, I think you and the welfare man might be a little happier if you did." So I drove the rest of the way.<br><br>What would be one of his favorite quotations? He loved the scripture found in Proverbs, chapter 27, verse 2: "Let another man praise thee . . . and not thine own lips." Modesty, modesty, modesty.<br><br>What would be a guiding principle from President Hunter's life? I believe it would be his ability <i>always to look for the best in people--</i>such an important quality to emulate.<br><br>President Hunter died March 3, 1995, at the age of 87.<br><br>Finally, brothers and sisters, I come to Gordon B. Hinckley, fifteenth President of the Church, ordained and set apart on March 12, 1995, at the age of 84.<br><br>Two years after he was ordained a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in 1961, I joined him in that quorum, and we sat side by side for most of the next 44 years. We had known each other for many years prior to our calls to the Twelve. He was a choice and beloved friend, as well as a trusted and respected colleague.<br><br>President Hinckley is the President of the Church most of you will remember best, for he was President during much of the time you were growing to young adulthood. He was a kind man who taught and who lived tolerance, never disparaging another person's beliefs.<br><br>President Hinckley was a wordsmith. I will repeat the word: <i>wordsmith.</i> He was well read and a scholar, and he could put words and phrases together in such a way that it was a pleasure to listen to his messages.<br><br>As many of you know, each Thursday morning the members of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles have a meeting in the Salt Lake Temple. We are driven in carts underground from the Church Office Building parking lot to the temple. During the cold winter months, President Hinckley always wore a coat and a hat during the brief ride. As our cart passed under Main Street, President Hinckley knew when we were within the confines of the temple, rather than under the street. Without a word he would remove his hat and place it in his lap. He seemed to know instinctively when that moment arrived. It was such a simple yet profound expression of reverence and respect for the house of the Lord, and it made a deep impression on me.<br><br>All of you will recall that during the last few years of his life President Hinckley always had a cane with him. He would walk to his seat in the Conference Center while waving to the crowd with his cane or using it to tap someone on the shoulder. President Hinckley and I for years went to the same doctor, and during one of my visits a few years ago, the doctor said to me, "Could you please do me a favor? President Hinckley should use his cane for walking because it steadies him. The last thing we want is for him to fall and break a hip, or worse. Instead, he waves it around and doesn't use it when he walks. Tell him the cane has been prescribed by his doctor, and he needs to use it as it was meant to be used."<br><br>I listened to the physician's request and then replied, "Doctor, I am President Hinckley's counselor. You are his doctor. <i>You</i> tell him!"<br><br>One of President Hinckley's favorite hymns has words written by Rudyard Kipling--that's the British in him. The hymn is "God of Our Fathers, Known of Old."<sup>16</sup> One of his favorite desserts was pie and ice cream. He loved the Prophet Joseph Smith; he loved the Savior. A favorite quotation was taken from the words of the Prophet Joseph concerning the Savior:<br><br><i>And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives!</i><br><br><i>For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father.</i><sup>17</sup><br><br>What would be a guiding principle from President Hinckley's life? It is one which we would all do well to follow: <i>Do your best.</i><br><br>Gordon B. Hinckley served as President of the Church for nearly thirteen years until his death on January 27, 2008, at the age of 97.<br><br>What can we learn from the prophets whom I have known and about whom I have visited with you today? We can learn that they never wavered, never faltered, never failed; that they are men of God.<br><br>May we be persistent in those things which are good and noble. May we ever stay safely on the Lord's side of the line. May we be considerate, studious, and responsive to the whisperings of the Holy Spirit. May we be dedicated to the gospel of Jesus Christ. May we love one another and always look for the best in people. May we do our best in all that we do.<br><br>God bless you, my dear young friends. Remember that there is another whom you can follow--even the Lord Jesus Christ. He said, "Come, follow me." Let us follow Him. He has sent Presidents of the Church, whom we can have as guides and whom we can follow. He Himself extended that kind, generous, personal invitation when He said, "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him."<sup>18</sup><br><br>As the sixteenth President of the Church, my story is yet to be summarized by those who will follow. In the meantime, I pledge my life, my strength--all that I have to offer--in serving the Lord and in directing the affairs of His Church in accordance with His will and by His inspiration.<br><br>I invoke His blessings upon you. I bless you that you may follow the teachings of prophets, that your lives may thereby be enriched. I bless you that you may have joy in your hearts, that you will have peace within your souls, that you will have contentment in seeing the influence for good that each one of you has upon the lives of others, and I do so in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Thomas S.

<h1>e Ye Stripped of Pride?&quot; - Kim b. Clark - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am grateful to be with you today. I pray that the Holy Ghost will be with us and that you and I might be taught and edified by the Spirit.<br><br>One summer many, many years ago, my mother decided it would be a great project for her children to refinish the dining room chairs. The chairs were painted a dark cherry color, and my mother had discovered that underneath that paint was good, hard maple wood.<br><br>I will never forget that experience. We began by applying a nasty solvent called toluene to all the painted surfaces, and then we scraped the paint off. Once the paint was removed, we had to sand the wood with several grades of sandpaper in order to remove the very last bits of paint and to prepare the wood for a new finish. When the sanding was finally done, we applied a finish to highlight the grain and enhance the wood's natural color. In the final step we sealed the new hardwood finish with two coats of varnish. Those chairs were transformed!<br><br>I think about that experience every time Iread Alma's penetrating question to the members of the Church in Zarahemla:<br><br><i>Behold, are ye stripped of pride? I say unto you, if ye are not ye are not prepared to meet God. Behold ye must prepare quickly; for the kingdom of heaven is soon at hand, and such an one hath not eternal life.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>The words "are ye stripped of pride?" evoke in me images and smells from that summer. I think of toluene and scraping and stripping and sanding to get down to bare wood. When I think of the finishing process with a vibrant color and the protecting sealing varnish, I think of the description of the Savior as "the author and finisher of our faith"<sup>2</sup> and the words of King Benjamin to his people:<br><br><i>Therefore, I would that ye should be steadfast and immovable, always abounding in good works, that Christ, the Lord God Omnipotent, may seal you his.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>My message today is about being stripped of pride. I want to talk with you about overcoming pride and becoming humble followers of Christ.<br><h2><b>Pride--The Universal Sin, the Great Vice</b></h2><br>Twenty years ago President Ezra Taft Benson delivered a powerful sermon on pride. It is a talk all of us should read carefully and often. Speaking in general conference, President Benson said:<br><br><i>The central feature of pride is enmity--enmity toward God and enmity toward our fellowmen.</i> Enmity <i>means "hatred toward, hostility to, or a state of opposition." It is the power by which Satan wishes to reign over us. . . .</i><br><br><i>Pride affects all of us at various times and in various degrees. . . .</i><br><br><i>Pride is the universal sin, the great vice.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1989/04/beware-of-pride?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>4</sup></a><br><br>Pride in all of its manifestations has played a central role in the struggle between good and evil, a struggle going back to the War in Heaven. The seriousness of the sin of pride is rooted deep in the doctrines of salvation.<br><br>In premortality we lived with our Heavenly Father as spirit sons and daughters. In the premortal council, Heavenly Father presented His great plan of happiness through which we could obtain immortality and eternal life.<br><br>Our Father knew that all of us would sin and "come short of the glory of God,"<sup>5</sup> so He sent His Beloved Son to atone for our sins, redeem us, and give us the strengthening power to become more like Him and our Father and ultimately receive the greatest gift of God--eternal life.<br><br>Here is the Great Truth in the Father's plan: Through the Atonement of Christ we can receive peace, joy, happiness, and eternal life with our Heavenly Father. There is a Redeemer! Jesus Christ, the Holy One of Israel, is the only "name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God."<sup>6</sup><br><br>The Father's plan was not received well by all of His children. Lucifer, a son of the morning, rebelled against the Father, against His Beloved Son, and against the plan. He presented his own proposal:<br><br><i>Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>There are several things to note about Satan's proposal:<br><br>1. Satan would replace Christ; indeed, there was no need for Christ and no need for an atoning sacrifice at all.<br><br>2. There would be no agency. Everyone would be redeemed; no one would be lost.<br><br>3. It would surely happen, and Satan would be the sole reason why.<br><br>4. Therefore, he should have God's honor and glory.<br><br>Here, in stark contrast to the Father's plan and the Great Truth, was Satan's Great Lie: You can obtain joy, happiness, and eternal life without Christ, without God, and without any special effort on your part; and Satan would make all this happen without any sacrifice, pain, or suffering on his part--rather by the sheer force of his power.<br><br>It was and is the Great Lie by the father of lies. It would not have worked. It was contrary to the will of the Father and to eternal laws of justice and mercy. And there, right in the middle of the Great Lie, at the very center of Satan's rebellious, diabolical scheme, was pride. There was pride and all of its sordid offspring--arrogance, selfishness, greed, vain ambition, unrighteous dominion--on a cosmic scale.<br><br>The Father rejected Satan's proposal. Then, driven by deep, deep pride and enmity toward the Father and the Son, Satan made war in heaven. He "accused [our brethren] before our God day and night"<sup>8</sup> and pushed the Great Lie with such deception and persuasion that a third part of the hosts of heaven followed him. But the forces of righteousness "overcame [Satan] by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony."<sup>9</sup> And so Satan "was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him."<sup>10</sup><br><br>Satan continues his war against God and us in the mortal world, where we are subject to the frailties, weaknesses, and temptations of the natural man. As it was in the premortal realm, so it is on earth; pride is at the heart of Satan's war on God and on His children. It has been that way since the days of Adam.<br><br>But pride has become especially critical in our day. We live in the dispensation of the fulness of times when the Lord is blessing His children with great knowledge, remarkable technologies, expanded opportunities for learning, and unprecedented wealth. With these blessings, however, comes this warning from the Lord:<br><br><i>It must needs be that the riches of the earth are mine to give; but beware of pride, lest ye become as the Nephites of old.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>Beware of pride! This is the warning voice of the Lord to us now, in our day. We have obtained so much control over the resources of the earth, so much understanding of the biology of life, so much capacity to travel and to communicate instantly that we have become "puffed up" in our learning and our apparent control and power. Pride and its children--materialism, envy, arrogance, greed, thirst for recognition, and lust for control and dominion--have become rampant in our culture and society. Modern Babylon is awash in pride.<br><br>The Book of Mormon prophets saw our day and spoke powerfully about modern-day pride. In his prophecy of the last days, Nephi saw that many would "be puffed up in their hearts"<sup>12</sup> and "wear stiff necks and high heads."<sup>13</sup><br><br>Hundreds of years later Moroni wrote these words about our day:<br><br><i>Behold, I speak unto you as if ye were present, and yet ye are not. But behold, Jesus Christ hath shown you unto me, and I know your doing.</i><br><br><i>And I know that ye do walk in the pride of your hearts.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>The Book of Mormon was written for us. It bears witness of Jesus Christ and warns us of the perils of pride, both in prosperity and in adversity. In the story of Laman and Lemuel, we see two proud brothers who murmured and rebelled and were filled with resentment and anger in the face of the loss of their home and possessions, their afflictions in the wilderness, and their failed expectations of leadership. Despite visits from angels and even the voice of the Lord and many other blessings and miracles, pride took root in their souls, their hearts were hardened, and they rejected the Lord and His prophets.<br><br>We also see this same pattern of pride, hardness of heart, and rejection of the truth in the face of prosperity. Indeed, the Book of Mormon is a record of an entire people greatly favored of the Lord who succumbed to the temptations of pride, rejected the Lord, and were destroyed.<br><br>The message is clear: Whether in prosperity or in adversity, if we are not diligent and faithful, even the elect of God, even those greatly blessed by the Lord, can fall prey to the Great Lie and become hard-hearted, self-absorbed, stiff-necked, and puffed up in their pride.<br><br>This is something we see all too often. You may have seen the interaction of pride and adversity among people you know. Perhaps because of some setback or a failed expectation or some other problem, a faithful member of the Church feels some resentment, some sense of being a victim unfairly treated. That resentment grows and festers and feeds on pride until it turns to anger and even bitterness. Over the years the member stops coming to Church, fails to keep the commandments, and finds ways to rationalize sinful behavior.<br><br>Or perhaps you have seen the interaction of pride and prosperity. It happens to wonderful people who in their college years are full of promise. These are people of great ability and spirituality. They marry in the temple, attend some of the country's finest graduate schools, and graduate with distinction. They are blessed with beautiful children and wonderful family lives. They are active in the Church and serve in positions of responsibility.<br><br>But something happens to them on the way to a life of service, joy, and happiness. What happens is pride. Somewhere along the way the honors of men, wealth, power, and recognition become more important than their love of the Lord, the love of their spouses and children, and their service in the kingdom. They divorce, leave the Church and their families, and become wholly worldly in their attitudes and their behavior.<br><br>The effects of pride, whether in adversity or in prosperity, are deadly. As Alma prophesied:<br><br><i>They that will harden their hearts, to them is given the lesser portion of the word until they know nothing concerning his mysteries; and then they are taken captive by the devil, and led by his will down to destruction. Now this is what is meant by the chains of hell.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>This calamity comes little by little over time. Pride and its effects are like a thin film of darkness that begins to settle on the soul layer by layer, year by year, until the light of the gospel grows dim. Such people become hardened in their hearts, selfish in their behavior, and puffed up in the pride of their eyes.<br><br>There is always, of course, hope. The proud and selfish souls can come back. But after years of darkness and so many layers of pride, it will take a lot of spiritual solvent and a lot of spiritual scraping and sanding to get down to a bare soul and a soft heart. And think of the time they have wasted, the opportunities for growth and becoming that they have lost, the lives they could have saved, and the joy they could have received had they seen what was happening early on and acted on it to change. Had they just recognized those first thin films of pride, they might have repented and sought the Lord's redeeming power right then. Had they seen it and acted, they could have humbled themselves and been stripped of pride.<br><br>Well did the Lord warn us: Beware of pride. Beware; be alert; be on guard against the perils of pride. May I suggest some things to watch for, some things of which we should all beware? I think of this list as red flags of pride. These red flags are like the little flags that landscapers put on the lawn when they have applied dangerous chemicals. Thin films of pride come with warning flags like the following:<br><br>1. Do you find yourself critiquing the talks in sacrament meeting?<br><br>2. Are you critical of others? Do you look down on others? Do you scorn or ridicule them?<br><br>3. When adversity strikes, do you hear a voice inside that says, "Why me?"<br><br>4. Do you react to prophetic counsel by ignoring it, being upset by it, or interpreting it to suit your own desires?<br><br>5. When you do something good, do you hear a voice inside congratulating yourself?<br><br>6. Do you feel self-gratification and a sense of importance in your knowledge and skill?<br><br>7. If someone you know receives something good, do you hear a voice inside saying, "What about me?"<br><br>8. Do you find ways to let others know of your success without appearing to boast?<br><br>9. If someone corrects a mistake you made, do you feel defensive and resentful?<br><br>10. When someone does something that creates inconvenience for you, do you feel annoyed?<br><br>I could go on. There are many, many red flags of pride.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, I did not get this list from a book. I have firsthand experience with the questions I have asked you, and I know that if you and I ever feel any of them or hear any of them in our minds, we need to recognize them for what they are--the echoes of the Great Lie, the beginning of a call to enmity with our Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>In that moment of recognition, we stand at a crossroads between two paths. We can follow the path of the Great Lie and act on those prideful feelings, or we can follow the path of the Great Truth and choose Christ. It is a choice. Are we going to keep our covenants, or are we going to break them? To reject the Great Lie and choose Christ takes an act of will. We have to consciously say to ourselves: "I am not going down the path of the Great Lie. With faith in Christ and with His help, I am going towalk the path of the Great Truth."<br><br>Heavenly Father's plan to help us make that choice was beautifully summarized by Alma in his words to the people of Ammonihah:<br><br><i>Humble yourselves before the Lord, and call on his holy name, and watch and pray continually, that ye may not be tempted above that which ye can bear, and thus be led by the Holy Spirit, becoming humble, meek, submissive, patient, full of love and all long-suffering.</i><sup>16</sup><br><br>We must first catch ourselves in the moment when prideful thoughts or feelings come and then act in faith to choose Christ, seeking God's help in prayer. This is what Alma meant when he admonished us to "humble [ourselves] before the Lord . . . and watch and pray continually."<br><br>But that is not the end. We must not only catch ourselves in prideful thoughts and feelings, not only choose Christ in that moment, but through the Atonement of Christ and the power of the Holy Ghost repent of our sins, receive forgiveness, and be led by the Holy Spirit to become "humble, meek, submissive, patient, full of love and all long-suffering."<br><br>When we choose Christ, acting in faith to humble ourselves before Him, we put ourselves in the hands of the Master Finisher. As we do His will, He will help us be stripped of pride and become meek and lowly in heart, filled with His pure and perfect love.<br><br>The Lord's finishing process may not always be pleasant. He will chasten and correct and give us experiences that polish us. If we are steadfast and immovable in doing what He wants us to do, we will not be deflected from the true path by adversity or prosperity. We will become the humble followers of Christ, and the day will come when He will seal us His.<br><br>Being stripped of pride and becoming meek and lowly in heart is not easy. We cannot do it by ourselves. But there are patterns of life we can establish that will help us beware of pride, remember Christ, humble ourselves before Him, and put ourselves in His hands. I will leave you today with four patterns:<br><h2><b>Pattern Number 1: Never Do Anything to Drive the Spirit Away</b></h2><br>The Holy Ghost is essential to the Lord's finishing process. But the Spirit is very sensitive to any degree of unrighteousness. Don't do anything or wear anything or say anything or read anything or listen to anything or watch anything or go anywhere that would drive the Spirit away.<br><h2><b>Pattern Number 2: Don't Let the World Get into Your Heart</b></h2><br>Never set your heart on things--on money or houses or cars or clothes or any other thing. Don't let a career or power or the honors of men get into your heart. They can get there very easily if you are not careful. Set your heart on the Lord and His kingdom, on your family and the temple and the things of eternity. Always live modestly within your means, and always pay your tithing and give a generous fast offering.<br><h2><b>Pattern Number 3: Serve the Lord</b></h2><br>Accept and always magnify callings in the Church and volunteer to be of service in the kingdom. When the promptings of the Spirit come sending you on the Lord's errand to rescue a lost soul or to comfort one in need, act on those promptings quickly as soon as you can.<br><h2><b>Pattern Number 4: Stand in Holy Places</b></h2><br>Make your home a sacred, holy place where the Spirit may dwell. Be in the chapel to partake of the sacrament every Sunday and prayerfully renew your covenant to "always remember him and keep his commandments."<sup>17</sup> If you live near a temple, go often to the house of the Lord. Relive those sacred ordinances and covenants. Reflect on your gratitude for the plan of salvation and for the Great Truth of the Atonement, on its power in your life, and on your need for the blessings and strength that are in the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, I know that if we establish these patterns in our lives we will beware of pride, we will be true to our covenants, and we will be in the Master's hands. You and I have much work to do. The Lord is moving with power in the earth preparing us and the kingdom for His return. Given all the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, you and I need to be like Ammon, the son of Mosiah, a great and mighty missionary who said:<br><br><i>Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak; therefore I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I can do all things.</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>This combination of humility and courage is what we need, and it is precisely what comes to those who reject the Great Lie and humble themselves before the Lord. Listen to the way President Henry B. Eyring described the process that occurs when we remember the Great Truth of the Savior and put ourselves in His hands:<br><br><i>Those memories, if we choose to invite them, can produce a powerful blend of courage and meekness. No problem is too hard for us with his help. No price is too great to pay for what he offers us. And still in our greatest successes we feel as little children. And in our greatest sacrifices we still feel in his debt, wanting to give more. That is a humility which is energizing, not enervating. We can choose that shield as a protection against pride.</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/henry-b-eyring_child-god/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>19</sup></a><br><br>Brothers and sisters, our protection, our hope, our salvation is in Jesus Christ. I bear witness of Him, the Holy One of Israel, the Light and the Life of the World. He is the Living Son of the Living God. This is His church and kingdom. I know that if we humble ourselves before Him and put ourselves in His Hands, we will be stripped of pride and He will polish us and finish us and seal us His. Iknow that is true.<br><br>I invoke the blessings of our loving Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son upon you this day, that you may become the humble followers of Christ and that the peace, joy, happiness, and power of heaven may flow into your life and into the lives of your families and loved ones now and forever. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Kim B.

<h1>ney through life, Divine Direction</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to you today. And I'm grateful to my family, my students, and all of those who have supported me in this effort. I've been part of the BYU community much of my life, from the time my father taught here while I was growing up to when I was a student here in the 1970s to my return as a professor a dozen years ago. It's been a great privilege for me to be associated with BYU and the fine people who are committed to learning in the light of the gospel--a meshing of the Spirit and the intellect.<br><br>As I look back to my college years a long time ago, I realize that my BYU education prepared me to become not only a scholar, a citizen, a wife, and a mother but also a Latter-day Saint. My hope is that my words today will especially help you students in your spiritual training that is an integral part of theeducational enterprise at this university.<br><br>Today I will talk about the crossroads of my scholarly and spiritual lives by pondering the idea of life journeys. I study the history of travel and tourism, and in my most recent book I wrote about the history of family vacationing in post–World War II America. Studying travel and tourism provides a lens through which I view the currents of change, and it allows me to better see how those changes came about and what they mean to us today.<br><br>In preparing this talk I realized that the scriptures are replete with stories of travel--defined as moving through space over time in a departure from daily routine. Some scriptural journeys begin as rather everyday pedestrian trips but become momentous through miracles. My first thought was of Paul's trip to Damascus, when he lost his sight and became converted to Christianity, as told in Acts 22. Other journeys, like the flight of Mary and Joseph with the infant Jesus, are undertaken to escape enemies. Perhaps the greatest journeys are the migrations of an entire people--like the pioneer trek of our ancestors from Illinois to here in the West to build Zion.<br><br>By studying these journeys we can gain new insights into our own life journey: from the premortal existence to our birth, our maturation into adults, and our eventual return to our Father in Heaven after we die and are redeemed by the sacrifice of our Savior.<br><br>Today I want to focus on a particular kind of travel experience that we read about in the scriptures: a journey into the wilderness. While not all of you will have traveled in an area uninhabited by humans--the definition of <i>wilderness--</i>all of us travel into an unknown future, a figurative wilderness. By considering our journeys into the wilderness--whether literal, such as a weekend camping trip, or figurative, such as our future--today I will draw upon scripture and my own experiences to discuss how we can prepare now to find our way through the unknown territory through which we will travel in our lives. I believe that by so doing we can derive greater meaning from our own journeys into the wilderness.<br><br>So I want to divide my topic today into three stages of travel: first, we prepare for the journey ahead; second, we undergo the journey into the wilderness; and third, like historians, we reflect back on our journey to make meaning out of our experience.<br><h2><b>Stage 1: Preparing for the Journey</b></h2><br>By now all you freshmen taking Religion 121 are well versed in the particulars of Lehi's journey that open the Book of Mormon. If we read carefully from 1 Nephi 2, we gather that preparations were brief:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that the Lord commanded my father, even in a dream, that he should take his family and depart into the wilderness.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that he was obedient unto the word of the Lord, wherefore he did as the Lord commanded him.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that he departed into the wilderness. And he left his house, and the land of his inheritance, and his gold, and his silver, and his precious things, and took nothing with him, save it were his family, and provisions, and tents, and departed into the wilderness.</i> [1 Nephi 2:2–4]<br><br>From these verses we understand that the Lord commanded Lehi to take his family and journey into the wilderness, that Lehi was obedient, and that the whole family (his wife, Sariah, and their four sons--Laman, Lemuel, Nephi, and Sam) went together into the wilderness. We know very little about Lehi's preparations, but we can make some assumptions. We can assume he sold or gave away his house, the land he had inherited, his silver and gold, and all "his precious things." Lehi and Sariah left everything and took only tents and provisions--probably food, cooking utensils, tools, and maybe seeds. In fact, so total was Lehi's commitment to leave it all behind that later the Lord commanded him to return for the plates of Laban. I don't know how he got hold of the gold he'd given away to get those plates, but somehow he--or his sons--did.<br><br>So now let me switch gears and juxtapose this scriptural story with an account of my own journeys into the wilderness. For the past 15 years I have made a summer trip to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in northern Minnesota on the Canadian border. My friends and I travel through the wilderness in canoes, and when we travel from one lake to another, we portage our canoes and belongings over land. An average day includes five to seven such portages, following trails created by French voyageurs who brought in furs to sell atmilitary forts in the 18th century.<br><br>For part of our journey we are quite alone, and on rugged routes deep in the wilderness we can travel all day without seeing another person. Each lake is inhabited by a pair of loons, and the birds' dances across the water at sunset are a treasured sight. We occasionally see dangerous wild animals, black bears, and moose, but the worst wilderness threat in Minnesota, as you all know, is the mosquito! Ican see some of you are familiar with the mosquitoes in Minnesota.<br><br>Preparing for this trip takes time and effort. Each January I plan my trip by buying a permit through an outfitter and gathering some girlfriends and unsuspecting female relatives like my loyal daughter-in-law to go with me into the wilderness. The next six months I work to stay in good shape and lose those Christmas pounds I gained from eating too much chocolate so that I will be able to carry the 60-pound canoe myself on the portages. It's important to me to pull my weight and do my fair share of the hard work. I study the map, get used to my hiking boots again, and pack my personal gear: a change of clothing, rain gear, swimsuit and towel, reading material, and strong, 100 percent–DEET mosquito repellent. Our outfitter supplies us with canoes, camping gear (like tents and cooking equipment), and dehydrated food. Like Lehi, we know that since we will carry everything ourselves, we want to pack light--but we must also be prepared to travel alone in the wilderness.<br><h2><b>Stage 2: The Journey</b></h2><br>Let's return to the Book of Mormon to learn about the journey of Lehi's family in the wilderness. When they left their camp by the borders of the Red Sea to move into the unknown, they were given a navigational tool. We read in 1 Nephi 16:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord spake unto my father by night, and commanded him that on the morrow he should take his journey into the wilderness.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that as my father arose in the morning, and went forth to the tent door, to his great astonishment he beheld upon the ground a round ball of curious workmanship; and it was of fine brass. And within the ball were two spindles; and the one pointed the way whither we should go into the wilderness. . . .</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that we did take our tents and depart into the wilderness, across the river Laman.</i> [1 Nephi 16:9–10, 12]<br><br>The "round ball of curious workmanship" led them along the best route, where they hunted wild beasts and found fertile areas that provided plant food. Nephi observed that the pointers in the ball "did work according to the faith and diligence and heed which we did give unto them" (1 Nephi 16:28). We do not really know the size of the ball, but we can surmise that it was relatively small, since Nephi wrote, "And thus we see that by small means the Lord can bring about great things" (1 Nephi 16:29). It was like a compass, and if they did not heed it with faith and diligence, it would not work for them.<br><br>As in any journey, things go wrong. Nephi's steel bow broke, his older brothers became angry with him, and everyone was tired and hungry and began murmuring. Only then did the travelers begin to fully appreciate how the "round ball of curious workmanship" guided them. At first they thought the ball was mainly like a compass, but it turned out to be much more than that. And I read again from the scriptures:<br><br><i>And there was also written upon them </i>[the pointers]<i> a new writing, which was plain to be read, which did give us understanding concerning the ways of the Lord; and it was written and changed from time to time, according to the faith and diligence which we gave unto it.</i> [1 Nephi 16:29]<br><br>When they paid close attention to the ball, they could see writing that helped them understand the ways of the Lord. The writing changed according to the degree of attention they gave it and according to the circumstances they faced. Thus the "round ball of curious workmanship" gave them direction not only in the way they should travel but also in how they should live. By providing the "round ball of curious workmanship," the Lord was able to guide them through the wilderness, but only to the degree that they took heed of the ball's instructions.<br><br>I can find parallels to their experiences in my own journeys in the wilderness. Like Lehi's family, when we go to the Boundary Waters, we go without a guide. We do have a map and a compass, but, like the "round ball," they are useless unless we actually pay attention to them. Now you might ask yourselves, how could we <i>not</i> pay attention? Well, if you put two good friends in a canoe, and they get to talking, or become so absorbed in the lovely scenery that, behold (and it came to pass, we might say), they can be someplace and not know where they are! Not knowing where you are, obviously, is the definition of being lost.<br><br>I have had more experiences of being lost in the wilderness than I care to admit, but let me tell you about the most recent one. A few years ago our group of six took a trip up the Magnetic River to the Saganaga Lake. This is one of my favorite routes, and although it was the third time for me, it was the first time for the others. We were on our final day of the trip, and we were running a bit behind. Our stove had caught on fire in the morning (the fuel hose was not placed properly when we cooked our pancakes), so breakfast was delayed, and we had encountered a few rough portages at midday.<br><br>So we arrived on the lake late in the afternoon. Those of you who are sailors will know that late afternoon is when the winds come up, and we were paddling westward directly into the wind. It was a tough paddle, and with the wind in our faces, at times it felt like we were paddling in peanut butter. Two very strong paddlers manned one of our four canoes, and as they got out ahead of us, I noticed that they missed the turn.<br><br>Now, this is an easy mistake, because as we looked west there were many islands. If they had read the map more closely or had used their compass, they would have known where to go, but for some reason they lost track of where they were. Yelling into the wind at them would have been futile, and they did not look back to see signals we were giving them with our paddles. (In case you students don't know, cell phones do not work in the wilderness.)<br><br>At that moment I was faced with a dilemma. Should I take the other three canoes the right direction, or should we follow our first canoe off course? What would you do? Because their physical safety was my first concern, I reasoned it was better to be off course together than apart in the right place. We followed them for another half hour before they realized they were lost and pulled over to wait for us. We all pulled up, glad to have a little rest on the island's mossy bank after an afternoon of paddling into the wind. We gathered around a map, but only after we aligned our intended route on the map with the compass I carried were we able to head off in the proper direction.<br><br>But the story does not end here. Because we were wandering in the wilderness for an extra three hours, the campsite we had selected was already taken. It was after seven o'clock and the sun was sinking in the sky when we finally found a less preferable site that was still vacant. Totally exhausted, we disembarked and unloaded our gear, and some set up tents while the others cooked dinner over an open fire. It was eight o'clock when we finally ate our dinner. That night as we lay in our sleeping bags listening to the lullaby of the loons, we were glad to be safe and sound despite our misadventure. It was a hard lesson, but we learned the lesson Lehi's family learned. Things will go wrong, but if you pay attention to where you are going, use the compass, and stay together, you will complete the journey.<br><h2><b>Stage 3: Making Meaning of Our Journey</b></h2><br>Like Nephi, I tell you about my journey some time after it has happened. As historians, we know that memories are imperfect and that no two persons remember the same event the same way. What we choose to remember can be more interesting than knowing what really happened. Let's turn to Alma to understand how Lehi's descendants made meaning of the great journey to the promised land. First, take note that as modern readers we do not know the name of the "round ball of curious workmanship" until we read Alma's explanation to his son Helaman over 500 years later. In Alma's day, Lehi's descendants were making meaning of the journey. I read from Alma 37:<br><br><i>And now, my son, I have somewhat to say concerning the thing which our fathers call a ball, or director--or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . And behold, it was prepared to show unto our fathers the course which they should travel in the wilderness.</i><br><br><i>And it did work for them according to their faith in God; therefore, if they had faith to believe that God could cause that those spindles should point the way they should go, behold, it was done.</i> [Alma 37:38–40]<br><br>Alma explained to Helaman that the Liahona showed them the course that they should travel in the wilderness and that it worked only if they had enough faith to take a look at it and to follow it. Furthermore, as Alma told Helaman, when<br><br><i>they were slothful, and forgot to exercise their faith and diligence . . . then those marvelous works ceased, and they did not progress in their journey; </i><br><br><i>Therefore, they tarried in the wilderness, or did not travel a direct course, and were afflicted with hunger and thirst, because of their transgressions.</i> [Alma 37:41–42]<br><br>What was their transgression? It was that they didn't exercise faith in the Liahona, didn't look at the guide the Lord had given them, and lost their way.<br><br>As I have made meaning of my own journeys through my photo collections and writings, I have derived lessons that I have only come to understand with the passage of time. Today I realize that Alma's words certainly applied to my friends and to me in our wilderness journey: We were lost because we were "slothful" and forgot to read the map. So we did not travel a direct course, and we had a very tough go of it. Luckily, with the use of a compass we were able to get back on course and safely make it to our destination.<br><br>The experiences of our literal journeys in the wilderness can be applied to our journey through life. Alma explained this to Helaman:<br><br><i>And now, my son, I would that ye should understand that these things are not without a shadow; for as our fathers were slothful to give heed to this compass (now these things were temporal) they did not prosper; even so it is with things which are spiritual.</i> [Alma 37:43]<br><br>As Alma reminded Helaman, if we do not heed the direction of the Lord, we will not progress in our journey of life. We can easily lose our way and take unplanned and costly detours, and we might not get back on course to our destination. In our journey of life, we do not have the Liahona, but we do have the Lord to guide us if we will pay heed. Alma assured us that it is easy for us to follow the Lord:<br><br><i>For behold, it is as easy to give heed to the word of Christ, which will point to you a straight course to eternal bliss, as it was for our fathers to give heed to this compass, which would point unto them a straight course to the promised land.</i> [Alma 37:44]<br><br>We can find the Lord's guidance by reading the scriptures, listening to our latter-day prophets, and heeding the counsel of our Church leaders and those who love us. In our recent general conference, President Dieter F. Uchtdorf addressed this subject. At times we may wander away from the gospel and away from gospel principles, and we may feel unworthy to be found. He said:<br><br><i>Though we are incomplete, God loves us completely. Though we are imperfect, He loves us perfectly. Though we may feel lost and without compass, God's love encompasses us completely.</i> ["The Love of God," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2009, 22]<i></i><br><br>By living worthily and seeking the guidance of the Holy Spirit, we will have a successful journey in the unknown wilderness of our future. As Alma clearly stated:<br><br><i>And now I say, is there not a type in this thing? For just as surely as this director did bring our fathers, by following its course, to the promised land, shall the words of Christ, if we follow their course, carry us beyond this vale of sorrow into a far better land of promise.</i> [Alma 37:45]<br><br>I will close by referring back to my own experience. When I return from my journey in the wilderness each year, the first thing I do, even before I get cleaned up, is call my husband on the telephone. I tell him: "I am back. I am safe. I love you." I can only imagine that it must be like that when we return to our Heavenly Father. After our life's journey, we will be reunited with Him and our loved ones, and we can say: "I am back. I am safe. I love you." It is my hope that we will give heed to the word of Christ to carry us beyond this "vale of sorrow" to live with Him again. I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Susan Sessions Rugh was associate dean of the BYU College of Family, Home, and Social Sciences when this devotional address was given on 13October 2009</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>Generation - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is an honor for me to address you and test your ability to understand English spoken with an accent. English is the language of the Restoration, but I am sure that over time, with the growth of the Church, it will be English spoken with an accent. I would like to express my gratitude to all those who have participated in making arrangements and preparing for this gathering so that we can hold this devotional. I am especially grateful for you, the students. You are wonderful people, and I marvel at all that you represent. In January of this year President Monson was talking to the young people at a Church Educational System devotional where he quoted an American poet whose words reflect my feelings today also. President Monson quoted:<br><br><i>How beautiful is youth! how bright it gleams</i><br><i>With its illusions, aspirations, dreams!</i><br><i>Book of Beginnings, Story without End,</i><br><i>Each maid a heroine, and each man a friend!</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>You are in a wonderful time of your life and are learning so much. You are busy exploring possibilities and are gleaming with aspirations and dreams. You are at a point where you are making decisions that require you to be brave and bold. Your decisions are being recorded in your book of beginnings, in your stories without end.<br><br>I know about those decisions. I was born and raised in Montevideo, Uruguay. I am a convert to the Church. I joined when I was 18 years old. Becoming a member of the Church meant that I often found myself in the minority. When I was baptized, I was the only member of my family to join the kingdom, and I was in the minority. In college I was usually the only Latter-day Saint, and so again I was in the minority. Later I moved with my family to Ecuador, and there I was still in the minority. Then I was called as a General Authority in the year 2001, and I continued to be in the minority as I served in the wonderful lands of Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.<br><br>I have come to learn that true principles are key factors that help us in making decisions in the crucial circumstances of our lives. To understand this, let me take you back to the wars of independence in South America. During those violent times, José Gervasio Artigas rose as the national hero of Uruguay, my home country. He was a man who cherished learning and often insisted on the importance of getting an education. In fact, his armies echoed his words by using his phrase as a greeting among soldiers: "Be ... as educated as you are brave" or "Sean los orientales tan ilustrados como valientes."<sup>2</sup> I learned this from an early age. Such a teaching of a true principle in my upbringing was very helpful when facing the challenges of always being in the minority.<br><br>I mention this because it is inevitable that sooner or later you will be in the minority in standing for righteousness and in standing for the principles and doctrines of the Church. You may already know what that is all about. When that time comes--if it has not yet come--you will be strengthened by what you have learned. You are so blessed with the opportunity to get an education, both of secular and of spiritual things. Such an education should lead you to be brave in making key decisions. For example, right now you might be concerned with key issues such as marriage, studies, employment, and serving others. You need to study these things out in your mind.<sup>3</sup> Your academic preparation will help you do that. You also need to use the "eye of faith"<sup>4</sup> to look forward to the fruit you can reap in those different fields.Your spiritual preparation will help you do that. In exercising faith, all of us should be bold. We need the faith of Peter, who decided to follow the calling of the Master even when it meant walking on water. We are to jump out of the boat with courage. We need the courage to believe.<br><br>Let's focus now on three areas where it is certain that at some point you will be in the minority--areas that will require boldness. First, you will need to be brave in order to break the chains that hold you back; second, brave in defending the principles of truth and righteousness; and third, brave in serving others. There are so many decisions that have to be made in order for you to move in the right direction with your aspirations and dreams.<br><br>You can break whichever chain is holding you back. The Savior is there with His arm of mercy wide open to succor us in our efforts to break our chains. Breaking those chains, especially if they are heavy, requires great courage. In the scriptures we find a telling example of someone who was so weighed down by his chains that he felt it would be better to be "banished and become extinct both soul and body"<sup>5</sup> than to continue wearing his heavy chains. This man was Alma the Younger. His chains were so paralyzing that he withered, "racked with torment [and] harrowed up."<sup>6</sup> And yet when we think of Alma the Younger, we remember him as one of the greatest examples and leaders in the great Nephite nation.<br><br>He was able to break the chains. How did he do it? In his own words, as recorded in the Book of Mormon, he explained:<br><br><i>While I was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins, behold, I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world.</i><br><br><i>Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains ofdeath.</i><br><br><i>And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more. ...</i><br><br><i>... Yea, my soul was filled with joy....</i><br><br><i>Yea, ... there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>The key to Alma being able to break the chains that held him back was that he was brave enough to focus his thoughts on Jesus Christ, the Redeemer. He exercised faith in the Savior's power to take away his pain. It is important to note that he moved his thought away from the pain, away from his sins, away from the chains that held him back, and focused on Jesus Christ. He looked up to Christ, not down at the chains. Doing this required a great deal of courage. This required that he overcome his fear of failure. In other words, exercising faith requires the courage of believing. We are to be brave, believe in His redeeming power, and act accordingly.<br><br>Another key decision in life is to defend the principles of truth and righteousness even if you are the only one doing it. Those are moments to be brave and bold.<br><br>I remember attending college in Uruguay in the early 1970s, a time when materialism was taught with great strength in the educational system there. Materialistic philosophies, endorsed even by subversive groups, had infiltrated higher education to the extent that many fertile souls were taught in the classroom that there was no God. In the middle of those turbulent days I came to know that the Book of Mormon was a divine book and, consequently, that Joseph Smith was a prophet and that God was real. Even though those in authority denied the existence of God, and religion was frowned upon by all around me, I knew that God lives and that He had restored the truths found in the Book of Mormon through a living latter-day prophet.<br><br>I understand how Caleb, one of the 12 spies, might have felt when he heard the other 10 spies who had been sent by Moses to survey the promised land as they reported that the land was populated by enemies in great, fortified cities<sup>8</sup> and that those enemies were giants, making the spies feel as small as grasshoppers.<sup>9</sup> Such a report was very discouraging, but "Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it."<sup>10</sup> That was a bold statement. Caleb explained what the source of his courage was. He said, "If so be the Lord will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the Lord said."<sup>11</sup><br><br>Which is your source of courage? Sooner or later you will find yourself in a world where you are in the minority as Caleb was. It will be up to you to act and to defend the truth in such a world. Take Caleb as your example. He was brave because he had faith in the Lord and in the promises made through His appointed representative on earth.<br><br>You may find yourselves in situations whereyou have to be brave in defending the principles of righteousness even when no one is watching. In such situations, you may draw courage to defend the principles of righteousness from your faith in God and also from your love toward God and your fellow man. Think for a moment of Joseph who was sold into Egypt. Through the blessings of the Lord he was able to gain his master's trust to the point that Potiphar "made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had."<sup>12</sup> And then, one day, Joseph found himself alone with Potiphar's wife, who made advances on him. The book of Genesis tells us:<br><br><i>She said, Lie with me.</i><br><br><i>But he refused, and said unto his master's wife,...</i><br><br><i>There is none greater in this house than I; neitherhath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?</i><sup>13</sup><br><br>Even though Joseph could have secretly yielded to the invitation to forsake the principles of righteousness, he did not. He was brave. When you are alone, when no one sees you, what is your source of courage to resist temptation? Joseph mentioned two sources for his courage in defending the truth, even when it seemed no one would know he had done so.<br><br>First, he would not betray his Egyptian master's trust. And so it should be with us. Every time we fail to stand for truth or righteousness, we are betraying someone's trust. It may be the trust of a father or mother, the trust of a wife or husband, the trust of a son or daughter, the trust of a Church leader, the trust of a friend, or the trust of a missionary who taught us the gospel.<br><br>Second, Joseph would not sin against God. There is no question that Joseph loved God dearly. Consequently, he would do nothing to offend God. Our love of God is linked to our refusal to sin against Him. Through your love of God, be bold in defending truth and righteousness, even if you are the only one doing it.<br><br>If you are brave enough to break the chains that hold you back and brave enough to defend the principles of truth and righteousness, you will be better qualified to serve others and even contribute to the rescue by bringing back to Church activity the "lost battalions"<sup>14</sup> President Monson has referred to.<br><br>Time in college is a wonderful time, a time to plant so many dear memories. However, you will have to face some hurdles. A lot of the restraints you had at home or in your mission are now gone. You more than likely enjoy greater autonomy now than in any other time in your life. In addition to that, you may find that you are thinking of yourself too much. What will I study? What nonacademic activities will I pursue? What will I do this weekend for fun? What will I ...? You may notice how often the pronoun <i>I</i> comes to your mind. This is especially the case if you are single and don't have a spouse and children to look after. It becomes very easy to justify a self-centered existence in college. Such an existence is perilous for the soul.<br><br>Let me suggest an antidote for that danger: Be brave and serve others. This, of course, is our prophet's call. Just this last October in general conference he encouraged us to serve with these words:<br><br><i>My brothers and sisters, we are surrounded by those in need of our attention, our encouragement, our support, our comfort, our kindness--be they family members, friends, acquaintances, or strangers. We are the Lord's hands here upon the earth, with the mandate to serve and to lift His children. He is dependent upon each of us.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>With jobs, school, social activities, and so many other commitments and responsibilities, you probably feel that the day is far too short. How can you then serve others? As always, the answer lies in the Savior.<br><br>I cannot imagine someone with more things to do than the Savior Jesus Christ. After His crucifixion, the Savior came to the ancient Americas and taught the people. When He finished, He commanded the people to go home and study His words and return in the morning for more teachings. It seems clear He had plenty to do when He said, "Now I go unto the Father, and also to show myself unto the lost tribes of Israel."<sup>16</sup> But pay attention to what happened after He announced he had to go and do other things:<br><br><i>When Jesus had thus spoken, he cast his eyes round about again on the multitude, and beheld they were in tears, and did look steadfastly upon him as if they would ask him to tarry a little longer with them.</i><sup>17</sup><br><br>In that moment he was flexible and adapted what He was planning to do. Instead of going right away to the Father, He stayed longer in order to serve His beloved ones.<br><br><i>And he said unto them: Behold, my bowels are filled with compassion towards you.</i><br><br><i>Have ye any that are sick among you? ... Bring them hither and I will heal them, for I have compassion upon you; my bowels are filled with mercy. ...</i><br><br><i>... And he did heal them every one as they were brought forth unto him.</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>He took the time to heal them one by one. This wonderful edifying experience is recorded in 3 Nephi 17 in the Book of Mormon. It is a powerful example for us. We need to develop the ability to see the need in others and break away from our own to-do list in order to serve our fellow man. This will require courage, no doubt, because we may be afraid that if we take time for unprogrammed service, other things will be left undone. We need flexible agendas to leave room for the promptings of the Spirit. The Savior was moved by love to meet the needs of others. But most of all, let us remember that He loved His Father and He had the courage to obey.<br><br>When thinking of the Lord Jesus Christ, it is hard not to evoke the feelings of that night in Gethsemane as He agonized under the weight of the sins and pains He would suffer for all. In those critical moments that He wished He did not have to go through, "he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt."<sup>19</sup> Glory be to the Father, the Son partook of that bitter cup. In that moment He showed more courage than any man ever has. He showed the courage to break away "the bands of death, and the chains of hell."<sup>20</sup> He showed the courage to stand for truth in the direst of hours, the courage to serve all, but, above all, he showed the courage and love to put the will of the Father before His own.<br><br>If we are bold enough to put the will of the Father before our own, in due time we could say as Paul said:<br><br><i>I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:</i><br><br><i>Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day.</i><sup>21</sup><br><br>How beautiful you are! Here you are working on an outstanding education. Be brave enough to defend truth and righteousness and to develop a spirit of service by putting your faith in Christ.<br><br>May the Lord bless you with your book ofbeginnings and your stories without end. Iknow that the Prophet Joseph Smith was brave in not denying what he knew was true. I testify that there is a prophet living on the earth today, namely, Thomas S. Monson, who is also valiant, brave, and courageous in defending truth. I testify that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, the Holy Messiah. I bear this witness in the holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Walter F.

<h1>Not Put Us Here to Fail - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning, beloved students, faculty, friends, family, and my esteemed brother in the gospel for over 35 years, President Cecil O. Samuelson. I have always treasured our close and respectful relationship, and I say to you, President Samuelson, that Brigham Young could not have selected a better leader than you, who has reached great heights in medicine, in life, and, above all, in integrity. Thank you for such a generous introduction, and thank you to the beautiful choir from whom we have just heard. I am so privileged to be invited to this world-class university. My wife, Karen, and I thank you.<br><br>I am truly honored to be here today. May I begin with this simple sentence: God did not put us here to fail. I would say to you, have faith in yourself--believe in what you are doing, and, most important, be a person of integrity. It is totally up to you, and no one else, how your life evolves. Many would like to think that our parents, our professors, or even our bishops are responsible for our future. What we become, who we are, and the footprint we will leave in life is based entirely on our own determination, hard work, education, and sacrifice. Our Heavenly Father expects the best from each of us. We must believe in ourselves. Don't give in when the going gets rough. You are laying the foundation of a great work, and that great work is your life. Never cut corners, demean other people, or waste time "hanging out." Decide who you are and what your goals entail--then go for the roses. Life has little regard for those who waste time.<br><br>My father and grandfather were rural schoolteachers in southern Idaho and Utah, and it was my hope to someday follow their example. But I refused to forsake my dreams, and each day my mind was filled with new ideas and hopes and aspirations. I would never listen to anyone who spoke negatively nor acknowledge that there were shortcomings that could not be overcome. I always thought that the key to life is finding happiness in any given place or time while remembering the great scriptural axiom "Men are, that they might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25).<br><br>People around us cheer when we are happy and positive. Self-pity is the most negative quality of the human spirit. Thus when one is happy and positive and truly believes in himself or herself, great achievements lie ahead.<br><br>Throughout my life, in my heart and soul, I wanted to explore the world--to reach into the unknown--to travel beyond my childhood boundaries. It is so important that we each live our own dream--not someone else's dream. If what you are doing in your life is not your own dream, then whose is it?<br><br>Perhaps I can best explain this through a personal experience.<br><br>When I was the age of many of you and was attending college at the very challenging Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, things weren't going great, at least not academically. It was a struggle for me simply because I didn't apply myself to the rigorous studies. After my sophomore year I went home and visited with my father. He encouraged me to change my major and to attend a college that was not so difficult. I thought about taking an easier route and remembered the wise statement a radio commentator had recently made. He stated, "Difficulty is one excuse history has never accepted."<sup>1</sup><br><br>I returned to college my junior year a reinvigorated, new person. I applied myself. I studied diligently. My grades skyrocketed, and upon graduation two years later I was awarded the university's highest honors. Thus I realized between my sophomore and junior years that it was <i>my</i> dream I must live and not my father's, and that I must achieve it through adversity and hard work.<br><br>Making dreams become reality requires great sacrifice and determination. Most people are content to just coast along. Many don't like to apply their talents and abilities or to put in long hours of work. But to achieve any dream and to make something truly remarkable happen in our lives, we must face adversity head-on, and we must overcome all of the obstacles in our pathway.<br><br>Today, obstacles are significant. They are everywhere. It is easy to become a prisoner to abusive behavior when we think there is no possible way out. Just think of the complex issues of attempted suicide, pornography, drug abuse, eating disorders, sexual identity, and addictions that come in various forms and disguises. These are very real challenges to many people. Every family feels at some point the heartache and pain of watching a loved one or friend falling prey to one of these life-altering demons. Once ensnared, most individuals believe they have little chance of escaping. But I say unto you: Your life's dream can be achieved. These demons are momentary setbacks. Do not succumb to desperation. Don't get down on yourself. You can create a pathway to success. There is a road to recovery, and many of us have traveled that road.<br><br>With regained balance and confidence in life we can make it. Our dreams can be fulfilled. We should never, never give up hope. We must follow the example of the Little Train That Could, trying to pull its load over the mountain: "I think I can, I think I can, I think I can!"<br><br>Today the economy represents a challenge that we have never witnessed before. Some of our families have lost their homes. Some of us, or perhaps our relatives or friends, have lost their jobs. Almost everyone has lost something or has been diminished in some capacity. May Isuggest to you that, contrary to public opinion, there is much to be learned from the lessons of our times.<br><br>Benjamin Disraeli, a former prime minister of England, stated, "There is no education like adversity."<sup>2</sup> And it was Sir Winston Churchill, another great British prime minister, who led that nation through the unrelenting struggles of World War II, who stated, "We receive our inspiration from the mountaintops but receive our maturity from the valleys of life."<sup>3</sup><br><br>Many of us here today are either going through one of the valleys of life or will someday experience one of these challenges or moments of adversity. Remember that adversity determines our character. During times of trial and tribulation, I often think of the Prophet Joseph Smith and the many adversities that afflicted his life. The Lord brought peace unto his heart during one of these times when He stated, "My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment" (D&amp;amp;C 121:7).<br><br>It is always interesting to observe how people react during times of crisis. Indeed, our very own character is formed by the lessons of trial and challenge. Character, in turn, emerges within each of us in our hearts and minds to establish our own personal set of standards--or, as the outside world would refer to it, our personal integrity. Integrity is critical to our lives--and to our dreams of achievement. We must remember that <i>without</i> integrity nothing else matters and that <i>with</i> integrity nothing else matters. Thus personal integrity, shaped and fashioned and molded to a great extent by adversity and personal trials, determines the person or individual we represent to others.<br><br>Again, we must each remember that God did not put us on this earth to fail. We are His children. We are here to succeed. The obstacles placed before us will be many, and in certain cases we may falter or even fail. I love the scripture that states, "He who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more" (D&amp;amp;C 58:42).<br><br>I often recall the Atonement of Jesus Christ. The Atonement, of course, is the entire purpose for the restoration of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It provides a means for eternal life. But there is another purpose as well. The Savior's suffering and struggles in the Garden of Gethsemane and His ultimate Atonement allows each of us to heal from the sins or afflictions of which I spoke earlier. Through the Lord Jesus Christ we don't have to carry guilt over our shoulders as if it were a 50-pound bag of rocks. We can and should repent and move on. The Lord has provided the way for us to heal and then use our adversities to great advantage in the future. Shakespeare said it best when he simply stated, "Sweet are the uses of adversity."<sup>4</sup> As we overcome many imposed limitations or challenges, the door is open for us to do anything in life that is honorable and good. We can follow our dreams and reach the stars and make a big difference in the lives of many.<br><br>When I started our company 40 years ago, I had no money. I had worked diligently as a young man to help my family make it through life financially. Although a scholarship had been awarded to me to attend one of America's most prestigious universities, I worked through college to pay for those extra costs that scholarships don't cover. Then for several years after graduation I worked for a small company to gain experience and wisdom. I went to graduate school at night and received a master of business administration while having young children at home and serving in a bishopric. Thus, after much preparation, when I decided to form my own company and asked the banks for a loan but was rejected, I said to myself, "<i>No</i> is only the beginning of the conversation." Filled with confidence, I returned many times to the banker and finally wore him down. He granted me a meager loan, and I began a small business. Step-by-step and acquisition-by-acquisition we grew and expanded. On many occasions, as we built the business, various bankers, attorneys, and accountants would tell me it was impossible to proceed, but I forged ahead because I genuinely believed in myself and was adamant that no one else was going to determine my own personal destiny. And no one else but you will determine your personal destiny.<br><br>I thought often of my great-great-grandfather, apostle Parley P. Pratt, and his tribulations as a missionary in England, as the first missionary in South America, and as one of the first missionaries in the Pacific Isles. He was turned down repeatedly. He was mocked. He was jailed with the Prophet Joseph Smith, but he was never discouraged. So how could one of his grandsons possibly give up a great opportunity to open doors for others without trying repeatedly to accomplish the objective? Throughout these early years of my business, the thought came to me repeatedly that difficulties in life are intended to make us better--not bitter! Roadblocks always seemed to surface, but slowly, over the years, with determination and prayer, a great business evolved.<br><br>Has it been a challenge? Of course it has. Almost every day is a struggle for many of us. But we must remain positive. Nothing comes easy. Next year our company celebrates 40 years as a reputable, global enterprise with a respected name. We have fought every day honorably and with fairness to forge ahead. Challenges will affect us every day. We refuse to fall for pyramid schemes or get-rich-quick gimmicks. They are all guaranteed to backfire. We have never been sidetracked by the lure of easy money. That doesn't exist either.<br><br>People of integrity balance their lives. Successful people follow President Hinckley's prioritization schedule. He listed our priorities in this order:<br><br>1. Our Eternal Spouse<br><br>2. Our Eternal Children<br><br>3. Loyalty to Our Employer/Profession<br><br>4. Commitment to Our Church Calling<br><br>5. Attention to One's Personal Fitness and Health<sup>5</sup><br><br>One might ask, why is it is so important to strive for excellence as a son or daughter of God? Or, if we succeed, will it really make a difference in the lives of others? We need only look to Jesus Christ, the Savior of mankind. He often spoke about our need to be our brother's keeper and to watch over those less fortunate and those who are underserved:<br><br><i>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: Iwas thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</i><br><br><i>Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me....</i><br><br><i>And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</i> [Matthew 25:35–36, 40]<br><br>On the wall behind my desk, as a daily reminder, hangs the great industrialist Andrew Carnegie's declaration of the law of accumulation of wealth. He stated:<br><br><i>The duty of the man of wealth</i> [is] <i>to consider all surplus revenues which come to him simply as trust funds, which he is called upon to administer ... in the manner which, in his judgment, is best calculated to produce the most beneficial results for the community--the man of wealth thus becoming the mere agent and trustee for his poorer brethren.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>My heart is deeply touched every time I embrace patients at the Huntsman Cancer Institute or greet one of the thousands of students who have received our scholarships or embrace the homeless in many countries who have given up on themselves. Wealth, if utilized wisely as the Savior advocated, is indeed a blessing to all involved. On the other hand, an unwise servant can create chaos, misery, and unhappiness if wealth is misdirected or not used for the upliftment and betterment of mankind. Thus our charity will become our legacy.<br><br>In your studies you have been taught correct principles with which you must now govern yourselves. Have the courage to be true to what you know is right. Have faith in yourself. You have great power within your human soul--each and every one of you--to accomplish something great. The accumulation and use of wealth for the betterment of others is only one form of greatness. A righteous mother and father stand above all others. Obedient children are a blessing to a family, and a humble soul who loves the Lord can achieve great goodness.<br><br><i>Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</i><br><br><i>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</i> [Proverbs 3:5]<br><br>Our paths will be as plentiful as there are separate individuals in this great Marriott Center today. Never deny yourself the right to reach your individual dreams. You and the Lord, working together, can accomplish anything. Never forget--God did not put us here to fail.<br><br>I shall always remember how the precepts of the gospel of Jesus Christ dramatically changed my life. Although my parents were not active in the Church, I always was inspired by the law of tithing. It was a great honor as a young boy to make an appointment with my bishop to pay 50 cents or $1 or $2 tithing--earnings from delivering newspapers, mowing lawns, orcleaning out grocery stores. Little did I know that this simple habit would affect my life's work.<br><br>In 1970, at the age of 32, I was appointed by the president of the United States to oversee the Welfare, Social Services, and Medicaid Program for the entire United States. It was an enormous task for a young man, but I thrived on my new appointment in Washington, D.C., as part of the presidential administration. Several months into that appointment, Ireceived a call from the White House chief of staff, who asked me if I would immediately come to a meeting in his West Wing office. Nervously, I was interviewed for the next two days to determine if I was the proper candidate to become special assistant to the president of the United States and also serve as White House staff secretary. I had to pinch myself several times to realize that here I was, a young man born and raised in southern Idaho, now one of 14 candidates to possibly become one ofthe president's right-hand men.<br><br>Near the end of the second day, the White House chief of staff looked me squarely in the eyes and asked a most improbable and unexpected question. He asked, "Are you a full-tithe payer in your church?" Yes, he injected the word <i>full.</i><br><br>Without hesitation I said, "Yes, sir, I am. I always have been. It is an honor for me to pay a full tithing to my church."<br><br>He said, "No one here in the White House is a member of your faith, but I know enough about your religion to know if you are a full-tithe payer, you are a person of integrity. Thus I am recommending you to the president to become his next assistant."<br><br>The very next day I moved my offices into the White House. It was a humbling but joyful experience to know that the result of honoring the priesthood and paying a full tithing not only brings the joys of heaven but also, at times like this, can bring the honors of men.<br><br>I have always remembered the wise counsel of President Harold B. Lee. He, like the prophets of the Lord before and after him, helps guide and direct our lives during this mortal journey. I loved President Lee. He quoted a profound statement on one occasion that I have always remembered and that applies to many situations. Quoting Dr. Alfred C. Lane of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, he said, "Faith keeps one true in the dark and humble in the spotlight."<sup>7</sup> President Lee was simply telling us what we have been discussing today: that if we are men and women of integrity, we don't need to wonder what happens when the lights go out. We have predetermined our course of action of becoming a person of honor and integrity.<br><br>One might question the survival of integrity in today's marketplace of deceit and dishonesty. Let me share this personal story with you, which I hope will show that this is possible. Some 24 years ago my young business was struggling. I needed a partner. A recent economic recession had been devastating to our earnings. I decided to sell 40 percent of our company; we would retain the other 60 percent. We found a willing and able buyer. After much discussion we arrived at a price for the 40 percent valuation. We shook hands on the deal. Then it painfully took more than six months for the buyer to write the contracts that provided a legally binding agreement between us.<br><br>During that six-month period our earnings had increased dramatically, and the business was in a rapid growth mode. Sales were the highest ever. Financial consultants on Wall Street told me that the value of the 40 percent of our company the buyer and I had agreed to six months prior was now worth five times the original amount. Things had changed! Moreover, the first oral agreement, our lawyers told me, was not binding because no legal papers had been signed. Since nothing had been signed in the beginning and since our agreement was based on only a handshake, the buyers felt an obligation to pay a higher price. I admired them for that, and our business desperately needed capital. We were expanding aggressively throughout the United States and some foreign countries, and I had many bills to pay. But I informed the buyers that we must stay with the original agreement. I would not increase their cost! My behavior shocked the entire industry. They could not understand why I would not take hundreds of millions of dollars more. But I was confident that this was the honorable thing to do and explained to them, "A deal is a deal, and a handshake is your bond, and I will not vary therefrom."<br><br>When the president of this large, international company that had purchased the 40 percent passed away, though I didn't know him well, his family asked me to speak at his funeral. It was truly a great honor.<br><br>I mention this story to you, brothers and sisters, with gratitude for the power and spirit of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost acts within each of us as a moral compass. It tells us what is right and what is wrong. We always know when we are not doing the right thing. Patterns of integrity for life should be formed in our youth; then we never have to struggle with the answers. The Holy Ghost is there to prompt us, and we never have to reason through those promptings. Acting on them can have a positive and powerful and remarkable impact on our lives. Remember, God did not put us here to fail.<br><br>Always keep in mind that nothing meaningful can come your way without integrity, and integrity is often challenged by adversity. Never let the accumulation of wealth in itself be a goal. Be creative, work hard, and surround yourself with bright, honest people. Be astraight shooter and follow your dreams. But, above all else, believe in yourself, and between you and the Lord your dreams can and will come true, and in your pursuit of your dream, never, never forget others. It is a privilege to serve others, and I thus close with these lyrics paraphrasing the poem by John Donne:<br><br><i>No man is an island,</i><br><br><i>No man stands alone,</i><br><br><i>Each man's joy is joy to me,</i><br><br><i>Each man's grief is my own.</i><br><br><i>We need one another,</i><br><br><i>So I will defend</i><br><br><i>Each man as my brother,</i><br><br><i>Each man as my friend.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>I love the Lord. It is a great honor to bear the holy priesthood. I revere and sustain our beloved prophet, Thomas S. Monson, and I leave with you my testimony that God lives. He is my Savior and Redeemer. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is restored upon the earth as a blessing to each one of us. Ialso testify that God will not place adversity in our path without giving us the strength to rise above it. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. Edward R.

<h1>e the Times - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning, my young friends. Ihope you have enjoyed your short Thanksgiving break. Sister Burton and I are delighted to be on this beautiful campus with you today. It is always good to be with your marvelous president, President Samuelson; his lovely wife; and members of his administrative team.<br><br>It is an interesting time to be on campus. The fall semester is soon coming to an end--too soon for those who have procrastinated writing that required term paper or who are substantially behind in reading assignments, but perhaps not soon enough for those looking forward to Christmas travel or even the conclusion of their university experience. For some it is the time to start cramming for final exams. Remember the counsel "If ye are prepared ye shall not fear" (D&amp;amp;C 38:30). All of this is going on in the aftermath of an emotional football game with an in-state rival. Thank you for the invitation to spend a few minutes with you today. You are an awesome--and intimidating--audience.<br><br>I asked our BYU-attending grandchildren for their suggestions on what would be an appropriate subject for me to address this morning. Unanimously they replied, "Anything but marriage and dating. We have heard a lot about those subjects." However, just for the record, it is important to understand that because of the eternal nature of marriage, you can never hear too much about it.<br><br>Because I have such deep respect and admiration for the opinions of the best Cougar grandchildren on campus, I will refrain from speaking about marriage and dating this morning, except for this last fleeting reference: Sister Burton and I are in our 50th year of marriage. Convincing her to marry me was by far my most notable achievement and certainly my greatest blessing. She is wonderful! Over these 50 years we have learned it is exciting and really fun to spoil and associate with grandchildren while we are in our fifties and sixties. I sometimes wish we would have had those grandchildren first. For those who are prone to defer and procrastinate getting married, remember your destiny may be raising challenging teenagers while in the senior years of life. Think about that scenario for a moment. It may be worth thinking about getting married now rather than avoiding that challenge later.<br><br>I spoke in the last general conference of the Church. It is always an intimidating experience, as you can well imagine. There are several audiences you think about as you prepare for general conference. First, there is the audience present in the Conference Center; second, the unseen audience--those listening or viewing via an electronic connection; and third, those who will read the proceedings of the conference in the<i>Ensign</i>or<i>Liahona</i>magazines. Over the past year I have become aware of another large and rapidly growing audience on Twitter. Tweeters send "tweets," or electronic messages, to friends expressing their feelings regarding the contents of your message, usually while you are speaking. It is possible to monitor the tweet traffic that occurs in the Conference Center during a given time period. Let me show you the 25 pages containing the tweet traffic during my conference talk on virtues ending in<i>-ity.</i><br><br>I'll share just a couple of the more positive tweets. One said, "That darn 13th Article of Faith." Another said, "Who in the heck is H. David Burton?" And another said, "My wife is all about the affordable needs. She's forced me to learn a lot." Still one more said, "This isn't a typical Burton talk at all. But I like it." And lastly, "You just know the -ity thing is going to be the new 'Six B's.' Mormons like that kind of thing." I won't bother you with the tweets that were something less than positive. However, please remember honesty, civility, integrity, dignity, and, most of all, charity as you tweet each other today. Take pity on a fragile ego already intimidated by this occasion.<br><br>As Christmas approaches and the weather turns cold and snow covers the ground, I often reflect on a large picture that graced the foyer of the grade school I attended. The picture depicted General George Washington leading a freezing, exhausted, ragtag group of men as they attempted to cross the Delaware River on Christmas Day in 1776. The purpose of the crossing was to help preserve the independence of our nation, which had just been chronicled six months before. This event was described in a series of pamphlets written by Founding Father Thomas Paine, entitled simply<i>The Crisis.</i>Thomas was a journalist who traveled with the Continental Army. He was not a good soldier, but his treatise helped inspire the army during this difficult time. It turned out to be a very popular pamphlet series. The percentage of the population who read it was larger than the percentage who watch the Super Bowl today. One quote from that publication has survived the 233 years since it was first penned. It simply is "These are the times that try men's souls" (<i>The American Crisis,</i>also called<i>The Crisis,</i>no. 1 [23 December 1776]).<br><br>Interestingly,<i>The Crisis</i>not only describes the foundations of the American Revolution, it also depicts the life of Thomas Paine himself. Paine had the great gift of exciting passion with his writings, but his writings also brought him an abundance of criticism. He was equally adept at communicating ideas and concepts to common men and women as he was communicating with intellectuals and the well educated. He certainly had what we would describe today as an agenda. He was staunchly antislavery. He was one of the first to advocate a world peace organization. He even suggested a social security program for the elderly and poor. His biggest challenge centered on his radical views on religion, which ultimately brought him disdain. By the end of his life only a handful of people thought enough of him to even attend his funeral. His lasting legacy lay in his stirring writings in support of the Revolution and the thought-provoking quote "These are the times that try men's souls."<br><br>Indeed, today may be a time that tries some men's and women's souls. The challenges for many are great. Secularism abounds in the land. Satan's minions are unabated and seem to have dominion in many aspects of our lives. Economic uncertainties breed fear for the future. Trusted institutions have betrayed our trust and have opted for greed. Widespread discontent exists between nations and world religions. Death and despair plague portions of our planet. Some children of our Father in Heaven are suffering because they lack basic human needs. Perhaps there are some in this very audience whose souls are stressed, wondering what the future holds for them.<br><br>As I contemplate our time, I also think of a quote from Charles Dickens' great novel<i>A Tale of Two Cities.</i>I'm sure you will recall it as well:<br><br><i>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.</i>[1859, 1]<br><br>We all have to determine for ourselves if we--in mixed turbulent times like we are currently in--perceive the glass of water to be half full or half empty. I'm a half-full sort of guy. Ipropose that we are, indeed, living in the best of times. In spite of all of its warts, 2009 is a great time to be alive. We are living in a time of great opportunity. In his book<i>The Greatest Generation,</i>Tom Brokaw suggests that it was the Great Depression of the 1920s and 1930s that served as the catalyst that built the character of the generation whose selfless sacrifice led to victory in World War II. This generation also served as the backbone for the economic and technological explosion that graced the last half of the 20th century. During the Great Depression there were, to be sure, those who took advantage of the disadvantaged, but there were many who rose above themselves and the times to give opportunity to those who were suffering. People reached out to feed neighboring children even when they had great difficulty feeding their own. Comfort was extended to others in spite of personal pain. We have that same opportunity today. The challenges of 2009 can be the platform that sensitizes, prepares, and launches us to the tomorrows of our lives.<br><br>The noted author Stuart Wilde wrote that "in a time of crisis we all have the potential to morph up to a new level and do things we never thought possible" ("The Cat &amp;amp; the Lion," Stuart Wilde "A" List, posted 19 February 2007 on stuartwilde.com). Why do I see the glass half full when difficulties abound? Why do I feel 2009 is an exciting time to be alive? Why is it the best of times even though men's souls are being severely tested? For me, and I hope for you, it comes down to this simple fact: It is an awesome and exciting time to be alive because the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ has again been restored to the earth in our day. Only a relative few of our Father in Heaven's children have had that great blessing and opportunity. Why are we so blessed? I do not know all the whys and wherefores. I merely express deep appreciation. It is exciting to see divine prophecy unfold before our very eyes as the gospel spreads rapidly around the world.<br><br>Let me give you a little perspective. Do you know what important event will transpire at Church headquarters this Friday promptly at 9:00 a.m.? This is a little piece of Church operational trivia that will likely not be on any of your final exams, but perhaps it should, because you may be affected by what is decided. One of the constitutional councils of the Church will convene under the direction of President Monson. The council is described in section 120 of the Doctrine and Covenants. It is called the Council on the Disposition of the Tithes. It is made up of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, and the Presiding Bishopric. It is the council's responsibility to determine how the resources of the Church will be used in 2010 for the purpose of blessing lives of individuals and families, of increasing testimony and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and of building the kingdom of God around the world.<br><br>If you could sit in on the council meeting, I think you would see and feel why it is exciting to be alive and be a participant in helping the gospel of Jesus Christ spread around the world. Inasmuch as you won't be in attendance, let me share a few facts about what occurred last year on that eventful first Friday in December. The council set aside enough resources to begin more than 300 new meetinghouse projects this year. Because meetinghouse projects are several years in duration, there are currently about 1,000 meetinghouses under construction somewhere around the world. Enough resources were set aside to build 13 new temples if the First Presidency so chooses. Today there are 21 temple construction projects, spread out from Kiev in the Ukraine to Cebu in the Philippines. Today there are 130 operating temples. It is exciting to think that many in this room will likely be alive when temples number 230 or 330 are completed. Here is another piece of useless trivia: The Church will likely build more building square footage this year than will Wal-Mart. Think about that. And we'll have just about as much problem getting zoning and permits as they do.<br><br>The Lord has entrusted His nearly 27,000 bishops and branch presidents to see that each in their flock has the means to sustain life and the opportunity to be self-reliant. Sufficient resources were set aside to accomplish this task.<br><br>Education is extremely important. Enough resources were set aside last December for over 50,000 of you to have a quality university experience in a marvelous environment at a very reasonable cost. How fortunate you are and how excited you should be because of your presence at this institution. Sufficient resources were also allocated to bless the lives of over half a million young people by providing religious education in seminaries and institutes around the world.<br><br>We are a missionary Church. We have always been a missionary Church, and I suspect we will always be a missionary Church. Last December enough resources were provided to vigorously pursue that sacred mandate, with about 52,000 full-time missionaries organized in 350 missions. The result of this endeavor in 2009 will likely be the equivalent of creating 400 new wards and 50 new stakes.<br><br>One of the very exciting aspects of temple worship is the use of technology in identifying ancestors, linking families, and performing sacred ordinances. Funds were provided to continue a multiyear, first-of-its-kind project of developing and perfecting a Web-based process to efficiently accomplish this task.<br><br>Indeed, 2009 is a special and exciting time. In terms of the gospel of Jesus Christ, it certainly is the best of times. As each of you contemplates what is occurring quietly around the world, I hope you will feel excitement and optimism laced with an abundance of gratitude.<br><br>The Old Testament prophet Amos reminded us that "surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets" (Amos 3:7). My testimony is that it is exciting as well as humbling to live at a time when living prophets serve as the mouthpiece of our Father in Heaven. I have had the great opportunity to closely observe and serve at the direction of three marvelous prophets, seers, and revelators. Each has been a unique personality, but each has been dedicated to moving the kingdom of God forward under the power and inspiration of heaven. President Hunter's typical response to a troubling temporal issue simply was "Pray and go do as inspired." As difficult issues were discussed, President Hinckley would often say, "David, we are on the Lord's errand. Go do your best. All will be well." And then he would add, with his marvelous smile, "And even your best may not be good enough." President Monson's inspired advice is nearly always "Make sure you measure twice and cut once."<br><br>Time after time I have witnessed inspired prophetic direction move the kingdom of God forward in miraculous ways. It is exciting for all of us to be living at a time when we can each be literally tutored, in person or via technology, at the feet of living prophets. I can only say, "Wow!"<br><br>Think of the technological advancements that have happened in the lifetime of your parents, and then think of what is likely to happen during the course of your lives. The Internet and all of its many aspects affecting commerce, communication, social interface, and knowledge--to list but a few--continues to bloom and blossom in directions never contemplated just months and years ago. To be sure, some of the blooms and blossoms have unintended consequences that Satan has captured to "try men's souls." But that is a subject for another day. It is wonderful to see how technology is helping all of the Father's children enjoy the fruits of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Enjoy and participate in the thrill of the best of times!<br><br>Certainly too many of our brothers and sisters around the world need more of this world's goods and services in order to recover from devastation or sustain living standards commensurate with gospel participation. For me it is exciting to see how Latter-day Saints around the world respond when the need is great and help or resources are required. We express gratitude for the substantial and generous contributions from those who have been blessed with much, but it is the small contributions given week after week by many that make it possible for the Church to reach out to those of any race, creed, or religion who have need.<br><br>If you want to experience real excitement, look into the appreciative faces of recipients and caregivers when a long-hoped-for wheelchair allows them some mobility. It is both exciting and heartwarming to hear the expressions of appreciation, particularly from women, when they have a clean and convenient source of water in their village.<br><br>To see a widow's or senior couple's tears when thousands of "helping hands" enter a community devastated by flood and storm to begin the overwhelming task of cleanup is exciting as well as heart-wrenching.<br><br>Yes, these are the times that may try men's souls, and perhaps for some the challenges of the day may seem overwhelming, but for all who continue to have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, who regardless of circumstances continue to be positive and obedient, who continue to see the glass half full, 2009 and the times that follow will be the best of times. Keep in mind the old Chinese proverb "The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor man perfected without trials."<br><br>What do you call the story of a person who breezes through college, lands the perfect job, climbs the corporate ladder with ease, and quickly makes a fortune? The answer is it's a fairy tale--it just never happens. Real life is littered with struggle, problems, mistakes, and lessons that all combine in the process of polishing our gem. Each should be treasured because over time they will constitute the best of times. Henry David Thoreau is attributed as saying, "Success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it." To be sure, success is a process as well as a journey. It is not a destination.<br><br>The word<i>remember</i>is found in the scriptures over 550 times. It is an important verb in our lexicon. It simply means to bring to mind or think of again. Book of Mormon prophets like King Benjamin, Alma, and Helaman used the phrase "O remember, remember" particularly as they emphatically counseled their sons on various issues (see Mosiah 1:6–7; Alma 37:13; Helaman 5:12).<br><br>Today we would do well to "remember, remember" the testimony of father Lehi as he counseled his sons. He said:<br><br><i>But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things.</i><br><br><i>Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy.</i><br><br><i>And the Messiah cometh in the fulness of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall. And because that they are redeemed from the fall they have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon, save it be by the punishment of the law at the great and last day, according to the commandments which God hath given.</i>[2 Nephi 2:24–26]<br><br>We need to "remember, remember" during times that test our souls to enjoy and keep focused on Father in Heaven's plan of eternal happiness while at the same time carefully navigating through the best of times.<br><br>Perhaps for us in 2009 it would be wise for us to remember to be fully immersed and invested in the gospel of Jesus Christ. An old Christmas story best describes what is meant by invested and immersed. The story is told in first person by a tired shopper who after a long, cold day of Christmas shopping finds herself exhausted on a crowded bus with her arms full of carefully selected gifts. The last available seat on the bus is near the back next to a very handsome gentleman who politely helps her situate her packages.<br><br><i>"My goodness," he said, "did you leave any merchandise still in the stores for the rest of us?" ...</i><br><br><i>The woman in the seat behind us joined in .. . , "The worst thing is that the day after Christmas we will be carrying this same armload back to the store to exchange it."</i><br><br><i>Her comment brought a general chuckle from all those within earshot, including my seat mate. As the laughter subsided, he began in a quiet, melodious voice, deepened with experience, to teach me a lesson that I have never forgotten.</i><br><br><i>"Hear now the parable of the shopper," he said, speaking gently and indicating my packages. "A woman went forth to shop, and as she shopped, she carefully planned. ... The many purchases were made with the pure joy and delight that is known only to the giver. Then the gifts were wrapped and placed lovingly under the tree.</i><br><br><i>"In eager anticipation she</i>[watched]<i>each face as the gifts were opened.</i><br><br><i>"'What a lovely sweater,' said the eldest daughter, 'but I think I would prefer blue. I suppose I can exchange it?'"</i><br><br>[The man went on to tell how each recipient made similar remarks about his or her gift.]<i>"How sad it is," continued his soft, beautiful voice, "when gifts are not received in the same spirit they are given. To reject a thoughtful gift is to reject the loving sentiment of the giver himself. And yet, are we not all sometimes guilty of rejecting?"</i><br><br>[By now the bus had stopped, and the passengers were all gathered around. The gentleman]<i>took a present from my stack.</i><br><br><i>"This one," he said, holding it up and pretending to open the card, "could be to you."</i><br><br><i>He pointed to a rough-looking, teenage boy in a worn denim jacket and pretended to read the gift card.</i><br><br><i>"'To you I give My life, lived perfectly, as an example so that you might see the pattern and live worthy to return and live with Me again....'"</i><br><br><i>. . . He set the present down and took another one from my pile.</i><br><br><i>"This one," he said, holding up a pure, white present, "is for you." He held out the gift to a worn-looking woman, who in earlier years must have been a real beauty and was still attractive. ... She read the card out loud and allowed her tears to slip without shame down her painted face.</i><br><br><i>"'My gift to you is repentance. This Christmas I wish you to know for certain that though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow, and I the Lord will remember them no more. ... Signed, your Advocate with the Father.'" ...</i><br><br>[Next the man]<i>looked around the group and brought a ragged, unkempt, little child forward. "This big, red package would be for you if He were here. The card would say, 'On this Christmas and always, My gift to you is love. My love is pure! It is not dependent on what you do or what you look like. I love you as you have been, as you are now, and as you will be in the future. From your brother, Jesus.'...</i><br><br><i>"And this silver package to you, madam," he said with a bow and handed the gift over to an aging grandmother two rows behind.</i><br><br><i>". . .

He tore off the paper to reveal a worn, well-used book. ...</i><br><br>[Finally the man]<i>stood up. He was leaving, making his way slowly down the aisle. Hepaused just as he reached the front and said, "One last gift. Peace! Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid."</i><br><br><i>With those words, he was gone.</i>[From Costley, "The Parable of the Shopper,"<i>Ideals--Christmas</i>55, no. 6 (November 1998): 50–51]<br><br>Oh, remember, remember, my dear friends, the best of times are clearly all about example, repentance, love, salvation, eternal life, service, scriptures, and peace of mind and soul.<br><br>To find joy in the "best of times," remember, remember to take sufficient time to love, listen, learn, laugh, lighten, lead, and lift.

The learned usually find themselves equipped to live in a world that no longer exists" (Eric Hoffer,<i>Reflections on the Human Condition</i>[New York: Harper and Row, 1973], 22). Remember that "intelligence without ambition is a bird without wings" (C.Archie Danielson, quoted in<i>Emotion: Webster's Quotations, Facts and Phrases</i>[San Diego: Icon Group International, 2008], 7).<br><br>Don't take yourselves too seriously. It is okay to laugh once in a while, particularly at your own foibles. Lighten the load of others. Most often you will find the need in your own home, family, or community.

<h1>s You, Self-worth</h1>
<br>
<br>
I testify that God, our Heavenly Father, loves each of you. He knows your name. He knows your circumstances. He hears your prayers and wants to bless you in every righteous desire through His Son, Jesus Christ. Like Alma, "I testify unto you that I do know that these things ... are true. ... They are made known unto me by the Holy Spirit of God" (Alma 5:45–46). I know these things because of my own journey. And if Heavenly Father loves me and knows of me--since He is no respecter of persons--He loves you as well.<br><br>My purpose today is to share with you five facets of my testimony that show God loves us. These are simple and quite personal. I pray that your testimony of God's love for you will grow as you think of your own experiences and that together we may receive the "word of truth" through the Holy Ghost (D&amp;amp;C 50:17). Ihope that as I speak, you will contemplate the many ways that God loves you. As I conclude today, I will ask you a question: "So what are you going to do?"<br><br><b>First:</b> I testify that God loves us because He grants unto us the revelator known as the Holy Ghost.<br><br>It was October of 1972, a clear and sunny Sunday. I was a freshman at BYU. I rode my bicycle up Provo Canyon to Upper Falls. There I contemplated what in the world I was doing here. You see, I came to BYU as a nonmember. Why? Well, several friends at high school were going to BYU, and they simply invited me along. I applied to BYU, and when my parents and I visited campus, coming from smoggy and dry Southern California, we were sold. I knew very little about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints except that they didn't smoke or drink.<br><br>I had arrived on campus a week or so early to attend a late summer honors program. There I met my first roommate, Rahn Price. After a long day we were ready to go to sleep in our room in Deseret Towers (may they rest in peace). Then something unusual happened. Rahn rolled out of bed, knelt at his bedside, and prayed silently. I didn't know what to do. I was quite astonished. I finally said my own prayer:<br><br><i>Now I lay me down to sleep,</i><br><br><i>I pray the Lord my soul to keep;</i><br><br><i>Should I die before I wake,</i><br><br><i>I pray the Lord my soul to take.</i><br><br><i>Amen.</i><br><br>I was done well before he was. Much later, Rahn said that was the most awkward prayer he had ever said. However, I'm grateful that he did say that prayer.<br><br>As the semester began, I learned about agency from a Book of Mormon teacher named Bruce Hafen. I learned of the Atonement. Although I had grown up in a Christian church and was raised by "goodly parents" (1 Nephi 1:1), these concepts were certainly deeper than the wading pool of doctrine I had grown up with.<br><br>Once the semester began, my friends in Helaman Halls invited me to church, but I respectfully declined. They did not pester me or make me feel out of place. On Sundays I would just do my own activities, limited as they were by a bicycle.<br><br>I found that agency--a topic I had been learning about in my Book of Mormon class--was interesting as presented in the dorms. It was fast Sunday (whatever that meant), and when my floor went off to church, I went down to the Cannon Center for a casual breakfast. But there was no breakfast because it was fast Sunday. I hadn't planned to fast, but it appeared that I would be fasting even though I hadn't planned on it. This was in the day when you didn't have refrigerators and microwave ovens in each dorm room. There was no food there. I was suddenly faced with my own mortality--I knew I was going to die. I figured I had just enough strength left to make it to some local restaurant. Der Wienerschnitzel was the closest. All I needed was a little food to tide me over until the obligatory fast Sunday concluded in the dorms. So I ordered about a dozen hot dogs. I've been grateful to Der Weinerschnitzel ever since.<br><br>But thankfully I matured. With the help of Rahn, my other friends, Brother Hafen, and my own budding awareness of the beautiful doctrines of the gospel, a seed had been planted. And on that October Sunday morning at Upper Falls, I actually asked Heavenly Father a question--something I was not taught to do growing up. Like most, I was taught that you can ask for blessings. It had never really occurred to me to ask Heavenly Father a question, because that implied you expected an answer--that you expected God to actually hear your prayer and acknowledge it with some sort of communication. It wasn't even a question about the Church I had at that time. I wasn't ready for that just yet. It was a question about me: "What wouldst thou have me do?" For the first time in my life I felt what I knew in an instant was the Holy Ghost, that unmistakably distinct and identifiable feeling in my bosom that has since guided me in all matters spiritual and most temporal: a warmth--not alarming or acidic, but peaceful and calm--that gave me clarity and resolve. Like the answer cited by Sister Matsumori in October's general conference: "It felt like sunshine" (Vicki F. Matsumori, "Helping Others Recognize the Whisperings of the Spirit," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2009, 10).<br><br>What was my answer? That I had a special mission to perform. I had no idea what that meant. It didn't matter at that time, because what I had found out that day was that God lives, that He knew who I was, and that, whatever He was doing at the time, He had answered my prayer through the Holy Ghost. I've been grateful ever since and have tried to demonstrate that gratitude by serving Him. My view of the world had changed: from peering through a keyhole at life to having an eternal panorama opened to my heart and mind's view.<br><br>If God loved me enough to answer my prayer, I know that He loves each of you.<br><br><b>Second:</b> I testify that God loves you because He restored the priesthood, and the Aaronic Priesthood in particular, to the earth. I testify that His love is manifest through the gift of the ministering of angels that can protect us and comfort us as we learn more about Him.<br><br>Since that day in October my heart was prepared to receive the gospel. I learned by study and also by faith. I noted that Rahn held the Aaronic Priesthood and was a priest in that priesthood. Through sacred experiences we had together, I know that the Aaronic Priesthood encompasses the power of God and the keys of the ministering of angels. I know that such keys are a gift to young men in the Church who love Him. It is something to be desired. At the time, I identified with Simon, the sorcerer of the New Testament, who said, "Give me also this power" (Acts 8:19). Although Simon spoke of the Melchizedek Priesthood, I was desiring this Aaronic Priesthood. I know that the priesthood--Melchizedek and Aaronic--is God's love made manifest to us to protect and serve. When you return home soon and see those gangly young Aaronic Priesthood holders in your ward, you might remember to thank them for carrying the power of God within them.<br><br><b>Third:</b> I testify that Heavenly Father loves us because He blesses us so much as we try to serve Him. He meets us much more than halfway when we act on the smallest seed of faith. He blesses us all along our journey back to His presence when we incline our ear and heart toward Him.<br><br>December 2, 1972, was a clear and crisp day. It was the day of my baptism. All the guys on my floor in Helaman Halls were up early getting ready for the service. But of course nobody said a word to me. It's a guy thing--like baseball players who don't want to jinx a pitcher who goes into the seventh inning with a no-hitter. I was both amused and impressed.<br><br>Who but Rahn Price baptized me? I received the gift of the Holy Ghost, which spirit had led me to the place I was at that time (see D&amp;amp;C 6:14). I received the priesthood and felt the whole armor of God. Thank you, Rahn. A few months later I was ordained a priest in the Aaronic Priesthood by Norm Nemrow. (You might know him as Professor Nemrow here at BYU.) Thank you, Norm.<br><br>I was soon called as a home teacher. I was excited to serve with this Aaronic Priesthood that I had so much desired. One evening I had a particularly vexing physics homework assignment to do. I also had home teaching appointments. For the first time I faced a test of my new faith. What to do? Up until that time intellect had been the king of my hill, my lofty aspiration. But now? How did faith work once you were baptized? Would Heavenly Father turn His attention elsewhere now that I was within the Church? I went home teaching. When I returned to my dorm room to tackle Physics 121, all I can say is that Heavenly Father magnified my efforts in a very personal and significant way. I had not known that the Holy Ghost could teach physics. I've never forgotten that lesson of being blessed beyond what I merited at the time. I was strengthened, confirmed in my faith, and encouraged.<br><br>King Benjamin put it this way:<br><br><i>I say unto you that if ye should serve him who has created you from the beginning, and is preserving you from day to day, by lending you breath, that ye may live and move and do according to your own will, and even supporting you from one moment to another--I say, if ye should serve him with all your whole souls yet ye would be unprofitable servants.</i><br><br><i>And behold, all that he requires of you is to keep his commandments; and he has promised you that if ye would keep his commandments ye should prosper in the land; and he never doth vary from that which he hath said; therefore, if ye do keep his commandments he doth bless you and prosper you.</i><br><br><i>And now, in the first place, he hath created you, and granted unto you your lives, for which ye are indebted unto him.</i><br><br><i>And secondly, he doth require that ye should do as he hath commanded you; for which if ye do, he doth immediately bless you; and therefore he hath paid you. And ye are still indebted unto him, and are, and will be, forever and ever; therefore, of what have ye to boast?</i> [Mosiah 2:21–24]<br><br>Heavenly Father blesses us so that our seeds of faith can grow all of our lives to produce a harvest of happiness as we put the kingdom of God first and allow everything else to follow (see Matthew 6:33). The Lord said, "I will go before you and be your rearward; and I will be in your midst, and you shall not be confounded" (D&amp;amp;C 49:27). I agree with Nephi, who said, "My God hath been my support; he hath led me through mine afflictions in the wilderness; and he hath preserved me upon the waters of the great deep" (2 Nephi 4:20). Each effort I make, no matter how small, is blessed greatly. God is truly generous with His love.<br><br>My faith was tried more seriously as I considered what to do about a full-time mission as a convert to the Church. I testify that as I exerted my faith, Heavenly Father strengthened my heart and melted the hearts of my parents, who had been adamantly opposed to my serving. But Heavenly Father went before my face and softened their hearts. I was able to serve with their blessing, and in giving back some of the love I had been given, as I served, I received, as usual, more blessings than I deserved.<br><br>I know that God will support you as you look to Him in every good thing. He's got your back! Selfless service at any time increases our gratitude for God.<br><br><b>Fourth:</b> I testify that God loves us because He wants us to have everything that He has; He puts no limits on how much we can learn, grow, and progress. Our friend Stephen Covey calls it an "abundance mentality" versus a "scarcity mentality." Heavenly Father calls it the "plan of happiness" (Alma 42:8), the plan that can "bring to pass [our] immortality and eternal life" (Moses 1:39).<br><br>I remember when I walked upstairs in the original Harold B. Lee Library that in the stairwell I was confronted with the scripture "Seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118). I was initially shocked at such a thing, but after my October experience and others like it, I came to know that there is no limit to how much we can learn, love, and live. William W. Phelps put it this way in verses 4 and 5 of his hymn:<br><br><i>There is no end to virtue;</i><br><br><i>There is no end to might;</i><br><br><i>There is no end to wisdom;</i><br><br><i>There is no end to light.</i><br><br><i>There is no end to union;</i><br><br><i>There is no end to youth;</i><br><br><i>There is no end to priesthood;</i><br><br><i>There is no end to truth.</i><br><br><i>There is no end to glory;</i><br><br><i>There is no end to love;</i><br><br><i>There is no end to being;</i><br><br><i>There is no death above.</i><br><br><i>There is no end to glory;</i><br><br><i>There is no end to love;</i><br><br><i>There is no end to being;</i><br><br><i>There is no death above.</i><br><br>["If You Could Hie to Kolob," <i>Hymns, </i>1985, no. 284]<br><br>President Uchtdorf recently summarized:<br><br><i>Our Father in Heaven has given us, His children, much more than any mortal mind can comprehend. Under His direction the Great Jehovah created this wondrous world we live in. God the Father watches over us, fills our hearts with breathtaking joy, brightens our darkest hours with blessed peace, distills upon our minds precious truths, shepherds us through times of distress, rejoices when we rejoice, and answers our righteous petitions.</i><br><br><i>He offers to His children the promise of a glorious and infinite existence and has provided a way for us to progress in knowledge and glory until we receive a fulness of joy. He has promised us all that He has.</i> [Dieter F. Uchtdorf, "The Love of God," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2009, 22]<br><br>We're really tested with this concept as parents. Our oldest daughter has borne the brunt of much of our learning. (Come to think about it, though, our other three children didn't fare much better.) But as an active teenager, she would ask if she could go do this or that with her friends. Her requests were always reasonable, and she reminds us often that we were lucky that she even asked. But I remember once telling her no. She, of course, wanted to know why. I said, "Because I'm your father, and I figure every once in awhile I should exercise that right and just say no." Well, how silly that was! Heavenly Father doesn't do that because He doesn't exercise such capricious constraints. She and I talked for quite awhile that night because she justifiably called me on my section 121 violation (see verses 39–46). So Ilet her go and demonstrated my love and trust for her.<br><br>In addition to Heavenly Father not constraining us capriciously, I know that He loves us because He is anxious to impart all knowledge into our hands:<br><br><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 88:79]<br><br>The knowledge that comes by the Holy Ghost through faith and prayer could be very useful to you in the upcoming days.<br><br>Fifth: I testify that God loves us because He sent His Son to atone for our sins and for the sins of all humankind everywhere. This is the most powerful manifestation of all. I felt it first as I prepared for baptism and now each week as I prepare to receive the sacrament.<br><br>The Atonement has been written about for centuries by prophets both ancient and modern, but is it written in our hearts? The Atonement is not an academic abstract that is learned like the multiplication tables. If we are prepared, like Nephi and Enos, the Atonement can sink deep in our hearts and fill us with wonder (see 1 Nephi 11–14; Enos 1:3).<br><br>The manner of receiving the teaching of the Atonement is illustrated with the examples of Nephi and his elder-in-age but younger-in-spirit brothers, Laman and Lemuel.<br><br>Nephi, in seeking an interpretation of his father Lehi's dream, had a discourse with an angel:<br><br><i>And it came to pass after I had seen the tree, Isaid unto the Spirit: I behold thou hast shown unto me the tree which is precious above all.</i><br><br><i>And he said unto me: What desirest thou?</i><br><br><i>And I said unto him: To know the interpretation thereof....</i><br><br>It's interesting that the angel didn't just tell Nephi the interpretation. As a matter of fact, the angel could have made a nice spreadsheet of the vision, with the symbols across the top in columns and the explanation in the next row. But instead:<br><br><i>It came to pass that he said unto me: Look!...</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the great city of Jerusalem, and also other cities. And I beheld the city of Nazareth; and in the city of Nazareth I beheld a virgin, and she was exceedingly fair and white.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that I saw the heavens open; and an angel came down and stood before me; and he said unto me: Nephi, what beholdest thou?</i><br><br><i>And I said unto him: A virgin, most beautiful and fair above all other virgins.</i><br><br><i>And he said unto me: Knowest thou the condescension of God?</i><br><br><i>And I said unto him: I know that he loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning ofall things.</i><br><br><i>And he said unto me: Behold, the virgin whom thou seest is the mother of the Son of God, after the manner of the flesh.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that I beheld that she was carried away in the Spirit; and after she had been carried away in the Spirit for the space of a time the angel spake unto me, saying: Look!</i><br><br><i>And I looked and beheld the virgin again, bearing a child in her arms.</i><br><br><i>And the angel said unto me: Behold the Lamb of God, yea, even the Son of the Eternal Father! Knowest thou the meaning of the tree which thy father saw?</i><br><br>Well? Had the angel made a spreadsheet? No! Nephi experienced the answer:<br><br><i>And I answered him, saying: Yea, it is the love of God, which sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts ofthe children of men; wherefore, it is the most desirable above all things.</i><br><br><i>And he spake unto me, saying: Yea, and the most joyous to the soul.</i> [1 Nephi 11:9–23]<br><br>The love of God is the most desirable and joyous to the soul. Later Nephi testified:<br><br><i>And I, Nephi, saw that he was lifted up upon the cross and slain for the sins of the world. </i>[1 Nephi 11:33]<br><br>The Atonement had sunk deep into Nephi's heart.<br><br>Contrast this with Laman and Lemuel's experience. They had dismissed the visit of an angel (see 1 Nephi 3:31), did not believe the words of their father (see 1 Nephi 2:11–12), and found "the truth to be hard" (1 Nephi 16:2). When they asked Nephi about the interpretation of each element of the dream, Nephi simply gave them the spreadsheet explanation. Although the Atonement had taken root in the fleshy portion of Nephi's heart (see 2 Corinthians 3:3), the hardened hearts of Laman and Lemuel remained unchanged (see 1 Nephi 16:22).<br><br>The Atonement is a gift from Heavenly Father through His Son that we especially need to remember at this time of year. It was the ultimate gift of both the Father and the Son: of the Father because He allowed His Son to suffer; of the Son because of what He did for us. Even football fans know the most famous scripture of all:<br><br><i>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</i> [John 3:16]<br><br>A glimpse of our Heavenly Father's anguish came to me several years ago during a high-adventure trip with my oldest son and several members of his priest's quorum. We had gone to the San Juan Islands off the coast of Washington. One of the activities the boys wanted to do was ride their bicycles on the paved road down from the top of Mount Constitution. I've done a bit of riding in my life, and I encouraged the boys to first ride up the mountain so they could remember where the gravel, the cracks in the pavement, the tightest turns, and other such potential hazards were. But of course that was too hard. So we took all the boys and the bikes to the top and all started down. I came down last, and I helped pick up each boy as each crashed at a different location. My son, for example, had entered a hairpin turn going hopelessly too fast. He had a choice: go over the railing or lay the bike down. With brakes tightly squeezed, he laid the bike down and skidded for some distance on the asphalt. His T-shirt rolled up his back, and he received quite a road rash, including embedded bits of small gravel and tar.<br><br>Like any unprepared Scout troop, our only cleaning agent in the first-aid kit was alcohol. As I watched his friends begin to clean the wounds on his back with the alcohol, I simply could not bear to watch. The pain must have been excruciating, and I could not stand to see my son suffer.<br><br>I know that Heavenly Father hurt at the sight of His Son's suffering. I know that both Heavenly Father and His Son love us.<br><br>President Uchtdorf summarized God's love for us this way:<br><br><i>Though we are incomplete, God loves us completely. Though we are imperfect, He loves us perfectly. Though we may feel lost and without compass, God's love encompasses us completely.</i><br><br><i>He loves us because He is filled with an infinite measure of holy, pure, and indescribable love. We are important to God not because of our résumé but because we are His children. He loves every one of us, even those who are flawed, rejected, awkward, sorrowful, or broken. God's love is so great that He loves even the proud, the selfish, the arrogant, and the wicked.</i><br><br><i>What this means is that, regardless of our current state, there is hope for us. No matter our distress, no matter our sorrow, no matter our mistakes, our infinitely compassionate Heavenly Father desires that we draw near to Him so that He can draw near to us.</i> [See D&amp;amp;C 88:63.] ["The Love ofGod," 22–23]<br><br>In conclusion I testify that God our Heavenly Father loves each of you. He knows your name. He knows your circumstances. He hears your prayers and wants to bless you in every righteous desire through His Son Jesus Christ.<br><br>I'm grateful to have had the opportunity of attending BYU those many years ago. I'm grateful for the Spirit that is here both then and now. I truly am.<br><br>So here is my question: What are you going to do? I pray that you might feel inspired this season to use Heavenly Father's love for you as a verb. And I pray that what you need to do will be revealed to you through prayer. The Primary children have it right:<br><br><i>I know my Father lives and loves me too.</i><i>The Spirit whispers this to me and tells me it is true,</i><i>And tells me it is true.</i><br><br>["I Know My Father Lives," <i>Hymns, </i>1985, no. 302]<br><br>I add my testimony that it is true, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Rollin H. Hotchkiss was associate chair of the BYU Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering when this devotional address was given on 8 December 2009.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.
