<h1>;s Unsung Heroes - Cecil O. Samuelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Once again it is our pleasure to welcome you to Brigham Young University at the beginning of winter semester. We have just finished a wonderful holiday season with the commemoration of the birth of the Savior of the World as our central focus and now enter a new year rich with anticipation and possibilities. We are grateful for those who have come back, just as we are for those of you with us for the first time. We are part of a truly remarkable community, and I am grateful for the blessing of being here. I hope and anticipate that the same is true for each of you.<br><br>Recently some friends shared an interesting account that transpired years ago at the Air Force Academy. William "Bill" Crawford, known to the cadets in the squadron he served as Mr. Crawford the janitor, was barely recognized or acknowledged, and he did nothing to draw attention to himself or to promote himself with the students. He did his job exceedingly well, and apparently no one paid much attention to him or to his service to the academy and to future Air Force officers.<br><br>Mr. Crawford's personal appearance was not particularly impressive, and he demonstrated with his gray hair, his wrinkled face, and his slightly shuffling gait nothing of greatness that was readily apparent to the students. He was polite but apparently shy. He typically did not speak to the young cadets unless they spoke first, which they rarely did. He just seemed, as reported by one of the cadets, to "[blend] into the woodwork."<br><br>All of that changed in the fall of 1976 when one of the students was reading a book about World War II and the infantry campaign in Italy. Let me turn to the words of then student and later Air Force Colonel James Moschgat:<br><br><i>On Sept. 13, 1943, a Private William Crawford from Colorado, assigned to the 36th Infantry Division, had been involved in some bloody fighting on Hill 424 near Altavilla, Italy. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . "In the face of intense and overwhelming hostile fire . . . with no regard for personal safety ... on his own initiative, Private Crawford single-handedly attacked fortified enemy positions." It continued, "For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at risk of life above and beyond the call of duty, the President of the United States . . ."</i><br><br>Cadet Moschgat said to his roommate, "You're not going to believe this, but I think our janitor is a Medal of Honor winner."<br><br>The following Monday morning, the cadets couldn't wait to ask Bill, the janitor, about the story. As they met him, they showed him the page in question. He looked at it quietly for a time and then said, "Yep, that's me."<br><br>They then asked him why he had not ever told them about his experiences and his medal. He just humbly responded, "That was one day in my life and it happened a long time ago."<br><br>The students had to leave for class, but, for them and for Mr. Crawford, things were never the same again. Quickly the word spread throughout the academy that they had a hero among them and that their janitor had won the Congressional Medal of Honor.<br><br>Let me return to Colonel Moschgat's account:<br><br><i>Cadets who had once passed by Bill with hardly a glance, now greeted him with a smile and a respectful, "Good morning, Mr. Crawford." Those who had before left a mess for the "janitor" to clean up started taking it upon themselves to put things in order. Most cadets routinely stopped to talk to Bill throughout the day, and we even began inviting him to our formal squadron functions. He'd show up dressed in a conservative dark suit and quietly talk to those who approached him, the only sign of his heroics being a simple blue, star-spangled lapel pin. Almost overnight, Bill went from being a simple fixture in our squadron to one of our teammates.</i> [From Colonel James Moschgat, 12th Operations Group Commander, "Lessons in Leadership"; see document <i>Ask the Chief,</i> Oct-Nov-Dec 2001, www.uscg.mil/leadership/field/attach12a.doc; also <i>Checkpoints,</i> winter 2002 (an Air Force Academy publication)]<br><br>Well, there is more to the story about Bill Crawford's remarkable life, but my purpose in sharing it with you today is to have you consider the same question I asked myself as I read this account for the first time. My question is: Who are the unsung heroes here at BYU who deserve our recognition and acclaim?<br><br>I don't know that we have many Congressional Medal of Honor recipients among us or serving largely behind the scenes at BYU. I do know that in this extraordinary community of students, staff, faculty, and administrators there are many who deserve our respect, admiration, and appreciation.<br><br>Our dictionaries provide a number of definitions for the word <i>hero.</i> The one I would like you to think about today is one that defines <i>hero</i> as a woman or a man with achievements and qualities that we greatly admire. We can all think of heroes of prominence whom we honor significantly. They typically deserve our praise and our gratitude.<br><br>But the lesson of the account of Bill Crawford at the Air Force Academy reminds me--and I hope you--that we are likely surrounded by heroes who receive few if any public accolades and little if any recognition for what they have done and do. At the risk of embarrassing some friends, I'll mention four examples of people here at BYU whom I consider to be heroes. You will have your own list--and, in fact, my own is much longer as well.<br><br>Before I mention the four in our midst, let me reflect on some notions about heroes. Early in my calling as a General Authority, I was asked to prepare chapters for two books. The first was entitled <i>Heroes from the Book of Mormon</i> (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1995), and I had the privilege of studying the life of the brother of Jared and then preparing a manuscript. While he occupies a prominent place in the book of Ether, it is striking that we do not know his name from the Book of Mormon account itself. The Prophet Joseph Smith revealed his name at a later date as Mahonri Moriancumer (see note in George Reynolds, "The Jaredites," <i>Juvenile Instructor,</i> 1 May 1892, 282).<br><br>What I learned about the brother of Jared that qualifies him as a hero includes his remarkable faith in the Lord and the Lord's willingness to answer his prayers. He had confidence in his brother and in himself, but he relied primarily on the Lord. He was able to accept criticism and correction from the Lord, and this led to the saving of his people. The brother of Jared's life is worthy of our study and emulation, and he is a true hero.<br><br>The second chapter was for a book entitled <i>Heroes of the Restoration</i> (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1997). In this assignment I studied in detail the life of David W. Patten, an original member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. He was ordained in February 1835 with the initial Quorum of the Twelve. He died a short three and one-half years later at age 38 in the Battle of Crooked River in Missouri. Among the very first martyrs of this dispensation, little is known of David Patten by most Latter-day Saints today. We know he is mentioned in two places in the Doctrine and Covenants: the first when called on a mission in section 114, and the second after his death with the following assurance of his destiny found in section 124. Said the Lord: "David Patten I have taken unto myself; behold, his priesthood no man taketh from him; but, verily I say unto you, another may be appointed unto the same calling" (D&amp;amp;C 124:130).<br><br>Unlike Bill Crawford, Elder Patten did not survive his battle, nor did he live to have his name held in respectful remembrance except by the relative few who know our history and the tremendous sacrifices made by those called out of obscurity and who remain mainly obscure. I judge Elder Patten to be a hero not just because he gave his life for the Restoration but because he also lived for the Restoration. He was loved and trusted by the Prophet Joseph Smith, and he blessed the lives of those with whom he served.<br><br>You will have a hard time finding the word <i>hero</i> in the scriptures, and yet there are many besides the two I have mentioned who deserve this description. Let me mention just two more before I reflect on those of our own circle.<br><br>I have often been intrigued by Ananias, the man who baptized Paul after his encounter with the Lord on the road to Damascus. While there are others by the same name in the scriptures, all we know about this particular man is found in the two accounts of Paul's conversion in the book of Acts (see Acts 9:10–18, 22:12). We know Ananias was a disciple of the Savior, who had appeared to him in vision and had instructed him to go find Saul, restore his vision through the laying on of hands, and baptize him.<br><br>Ananias knew about Saul and did not like what he knew. He considered Saul to be dangerous and an enemy of the Lord. Nevertheless, he did as he was instructed and made the difference in the life of the man who was to become one of the most able of Jesus Christ's apostles. We know nothing of Ananias' life before or after these events, but his faithfulness and contribution, which have benefitted so many, qualify him as a hero.<br><br>Think of the little maid or servant of the wife of Naaman the Syrian, who was afflicted with leprosy and couldn't find a cure. This young woman--whose name we do not know and who was captured in Israel and taken to Syria--said to her mistress, "Would God my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy" (2Kings 5:3). We know the rest of the story and how Elisha instructed Naaman to bathe in the Jordan River seven times and how irritated this made Naaman. Other heroes include his servants, who persuaded Naaman to obey the prophet. When he did as he had been directed, he was cured.<br><br>Think of these obscure servants--those whose names we also don't have and whose lives are otherwise unknown to us. What if the young woman had not mentioned the prophet Elisha to Naaman's wife, and what if the servants had not persuaded Naaman to follow the prophet's counsel? These are also heroes because they made a real difference--as have Bill Crawford, the brother of Jared, David W. Patten, and others you might think of as well.<br><br>Now, if you will, return with me to my earlier question that followed the account of Bill Crawford at the Air Force Academy. Who are the unrecognized heroes here at BYU who deserve our recognition and acclaim? I hope you will think of those you know and, perhaps even more important, those you haven't recognized but encounter regularly on this remarkable campus. As examples, I will mention just four for whom, it seems to me, the title of "hero" can justifiably apply. I will not mention students or faculty, although I can think of several in each category, but will focus on special people who have essentially made their service and assistance to others the central component of their assignments at Brigham Young University. I encourage you to think about and identify your own list because you will likely be surprised--as was I--at how many we really have among us.<br><br>Janet Calder began her service at BYU about the same time Dallin H. Oaks began his as BYU president. Over the years she supported Presidents Oaks, Holland, Lee, and Bateman and now finally assists me. She is a consummate lady who greets every visitor or caller to the president's office with cheerful, helpful, patient courtesy even when she is not able to respond affirmatively to the requests or demands that are made of her. She has the unenviable task of keeping my calendar straight and helping me meet the multiple requirements and necessary commitments of my office. Regularly I'm told how helpful, considerate, and thoughtful Janet is. I echo those sentiments from my personal experience of these past few years.<br><br>Duane Busby has been an invaluable asset in the Athletic Department for many years. He handles the major logistical load in seeing that our football team, coaches, and others have the equipment they need. He sees that appropriate arrangements have been made for the care and keeping of the equipment when traveling and does virtually anything requested of him to make things flow smoothly. While seemingly shy and retiring by nature, he nevertheless is dogged in his determination to make sure those for whom he has responsibility are afforded all that they need in order to fulfill their responsibilities and assignments. All of this he does with pleasantness, competence, and absolute reliability. You don't read about Duane on the sports pages, but you do hear about him from his friends and student athletes.<br><br>Lynne Hansen of Dining Services began her sojourn at BYU more than 25 years ago. Together with remarkably able and competent associates in BYU Dining Services, she has overseen major events of many sorts, has attended to the needs of high-profile guests of BYU, and has personally looked after and assisted in the many hosting chores of four BYU presidents and their wives. She is always pleasant, immediately responsive to any request--even the totally unexpected--and is truly an artist in the creation of menus, table and plate presentations, and all of the other details of an important event. Well recognized for her professionalism in the industry, she also has had a tremendously positive influence in helping student employees develop the traits and skills that allow them to have similar successes themselves. She doesn't seek the limelight but makes it shine brightly for others.<br><br>Mark Philbrick has been the chief BYU photographer for many years and always represents the university, its officers, students, faculty, staff, and visitors in the best possible light and in the most favorable poses. He treats all with great respect and is recognized far beyond the university for both the quality and the reliability of his artistic work. He is called upon by the university, the Mountain West Conference, the NCAA, and others to make sure an accurate and adequate photographic history is kept of significant and important events. He is equally comfortable capturing with his cameras the images of prophets, performers, and players--all the while recognizing that his service to Brigham Young University is his focus, rather than any recognition that might rightfully accrue to him. You might not recognize Mark's face, but you all will recognize his work.<br><br>I wish time would allow for me to go on and on and recognize so many more who are so deserving. The four I have just mentioned are authentic examples of literally hundreds more who also deserve our accolades and commendation. While each of the four has a unique job description and their contributions are evaluated in different ways, they also have characteristics that entitle them, in my estimation, to be considered heroes of Brigham Young University. Let me enumerate some of these traits.<br><br>First, they are nice people. They are considerate of each person they meet and clearly focus their attention on the needs of others rather than on themselves. They are always courteous.<br><br>Second, they are people of high professional competence. They know their jobs and do them extraordinarily well. They do not show off, but they do what they do with excellence.<br><br>Third, they are self-starters. By that I mean they immediately and reflexively identify what needs to be done and then do it without the need to be ordered or asked. In that regard, they typically are found doing necessary things that some might feel others ought to be worried about.<br><br>Fourth, they love BYU. They understand that this unique place has special responsibilities and opportunities, and they are totally committed to making the university and the people around them successful.<br><br>Fifth, they are authentic people in the way they live and serve. Their devotion to the kingdom, the university, and the Savior is deep, profound, and absolutely consistent.<br><br>Sixth, they are wise and generous enough to have made their careers at BYU even when they have had other alternatives and certainly could have been better compensated financially elsewhere.<br><br>Seventh, each knows the compensation that matters most does not come in the form of money but does come from the deep satisfaction of making the lives of others better or more comfortable.<br><br>For each of these four and the others you and I are thinking of as well, additional attributes and positive characteristics could be mentioned. They fully incorporate the counsel of Jesus Christ, who said, "Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister" (Matthew 20:26). Likewise, they are examples of the truth expressed by King Benjamin when he taught, "And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God" (Mosiah 2:17).<br><br>I am grateful for the privilege we have at BYU to be surrounded by wonderful and authentic heroes. I am so appreciative to be able to share and declare along with them the testimony that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that we are all blessed to have the opportunities to act in ways that might also qualify us to be heroes for someone else. May itbe so. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O. Samuelson was BYU president when this devotional address was delivered on 8 January 2008.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1> the Day - Sharon G. Samuelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Today is January 8, 2008, and the beginning of a new semester at Brigham Young University. I always look forward to the start of a new year with great anticipation, wondering what the days will bring as the year unfolds. I do know that this beautiful campus will be filled with the excitement and activity that always occur when you are here. Each day can provide experiences that can make your time at BYU the means to achieving your goals and the righteous desires of your hearts.<br><br>Each of you has taken a different pathway that has resulted in your attending Brigham Young University. You have come from all over the world and represent many different nations and cultures. For some of you, it is your first time at BYU. For others, this semester is a continuation of your schooling at this institution. Ibelieve that the Lord has, in His loving and caring way, opened the door for you to enter this university. The Lord has told you that He will open doors to bless your lives if you remember Him. In Revelation 3:8 we read, "Behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name."<br><br>It is now your opportunity to immerse yourself in the BYU experience and take advantage of all that is available for you in learning things spiritual and temporal, serving and caring, and enhancing your testimonies of the teachings of the Savior, whose birth we have just celebrated. The Lord has stated that He will continue to open doors for you if you remember Him and keep His commandments.<br><br>Brigham Young once said, "Education is the power to think clearly, the power to act well in the world's work, and the power to appreciate life" (quoted by George H. Brimhall in "The Brigham Young University," <i>Improvement Era,</i> vol. 23, no. 9 [July 1920], 831). I especially am drawn to the last part of his definition: "the power to appreciate life."<br><br>When my husband and I were first married, he was an undergraduate student with a goal of attending medical school, and I was teaching sixth grade. His classes, part-time work, and studies obviously took most of his time. My obligations with work and spending evenings doing all that was necessary to fulfill my teaching responsibilities also took many hours to complete. Once we included our Church callings, we didn't have much time together during the week. I found that Iwas always looking forward to Friday evenings, when not only would things become more relaxed but we could have some time together as well as a little social life during the weekends. Ialways seemed to have the "thank goodness it's Friday" mentality. On Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays I was always looking forward to the weekends; thus I was not really enjoying the weekdays. I was happy on Friday nights, Saturdays, and Sundays and a little depressed on the weekdays.<br><br>However, one day something occurred that caused me to see this negative outlook in a new light. I can't recall what caused this change in my attitude, but I was struck with the thought that by wanting the weekdays to pass by quickly and always looking forward to the weekends, I was wishing a very important part of my life away. I realized that my time <i>now</i> was valuable and I should appreciate every day--not wish it away! After all, I didn't know how many Mondays through Fridays I had in my future. Time passes quickly enough, and, because I wanted it to do so, I did not take full advantage of some valuable opportunities and experiences that were available to me.<br><br>Concerning the days of your lives, Ralph Waldo Emerson once said:<br><br><i>They are of the least pretension and of the greatest capacity of anything that exists. They come and go like muffled and veiled figures, sent from a distant friendly party; but they say nothing, and if we do not use the gifts they bring, they carry them as silently away.</i> [Ralph Waldo Emerson, "Works and Days," <i>Society and Solitude,</i> 1870]<br><br>I still can vividly recall the time I realized that I should savor and treasure each day and be thankful for and appreciate life. I somehow realized that each day is a gift from a loving Heavenly Father and that if I did not view each day as such, I would be ungrateful. I was always wanting tomorrow or, in my case, the weekend. This was a terrible thing because I was neglecting my todays for my tomorrows.<br><br>Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin put it best when he stated:<br><br><i>One thing I know for certain: the time we have here goes by far too quickly. Don't waste any more time sitting on the bench watching life pass you by.</i> [Joseph B. Wirthlin, "Lessons Learned in the Journey of Life," <i>Ensign,</i> December 2000, 12]<br><br>Each of you has been given the opportunity to enter the door that opened to allow your entrance to BYU. It is now up to you to be grateful for and relish fully your life as a student here. An appreciation of each day and of life is dependent upon your ability to notice the things that make up those 24 hours. Most often the simple aspects of life may be considered dull and uninteresting. You may overlook the commonplace things that may appear meaningless and ordinary. You may thank your Heavenly Father for the very important or necessary parts of your lives, or what you may consider the "big" blessings, and then forget the "little" ones. Robert Frost expressed this thought in his poem "Dust of Snow" (1923):<br><br><i>The way a crow</i><br><br><i>Shook down on me</i><br><br><i>The dust of snow</i><br><br><i>From a hemlock tree</i><br><br><i>Has given my heart</i><br><br><i>A change of mood</i><br><br><i>And saved some part</i><br><br><i>Of a day I had rued.</i><br><br>On a day he already cursed because it had not likely been a happy one, something happened that at first added to his frustration. As the poet was going under a tree, some snow fell on him as it was knocked off a branch by a crow flying into the sky. At first filled with anger, he looked up only to see the beauty of the black crow as it flew against the contrast of the sky in the background. To him it was a very precious and wonderful moment.<br><br>So it can be for you when you see all the beauty that exists in your lives. Gratitude for all that the Lord has given you enables you to appreciate life and treasure each day you have to spend in this earthly existence.<br><br>It is unrealistic to ignore that at times there are and will continue to be some days when it may seem impossible to appreciate that particular day and time. Days come where there isdisappointment, tragedy, illness, pain, heartache, and suffering. You most likely will wish that that day, and often the days following, would just pass by quickly or that the circumstances causing the pain would never have happened. However, this is not the plan of our Heavenly Father. On days such as these, you must look to your Lord and Savior for sustenance, love, and His atoning sacrifice for all of you.<br><br>The life of the Prophet Joseph Smith gives usmany examples of days of despair, pain, and sadness. While in Liberty Jail and in the depths of discouragement and tribulation, he was told by the Lord in Doctrine and Covenants 122:7 that "all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good."<br><br>Such it is for you that it needs be that you experience days of sorrow as well as days of joy to prepare you to one day return to your Father in Heaven's presence. They are necessary for your eternal progression. These trials test your faith, endurance, and submission to the will of the Lord and are part of God's plan for you.<br><br>The mission of a BYU education is to strengthen you spiritually, enlarge you intellectually, build your character, and help lead you to a lifetime of service. When your days are filled with lessons, activities, friends, the gospel, and a multitude of opportunities to serve and bless the lives of others, you can appreciate and treasure each day whether that day is one of happiness and success or one of sadness and failure. Service and love are two important ingredients for one's appreciation of life, and opportunities for both are in abundance in our university community.<br><br>Just as the Lord opened a door for you to be in this devotional today, He will continue to open more doors and will be a beacon of light to follow during your days here. He will make available opportunities and experiences that will enable you to achieve much that will bless your lives each day in areas both secular and temporal. When you seek and listen to the Spirit and follow the promptings of the Holy Ghost, many blessings will be forthcoming. Your capacity for expanding your horizon of experiences during your time at BYU will be boundless if you but enter the doors that the Lord provides for you commensurate with your faith. In fact, He has said that these doors cannot be shut by others, but you can close them yourself if you choose to shut Him out ofyour life.<br><br>As you make your way on the paths of life, there will be many of these doors and opportunities attainable to you. Some you can anticipate being open as you make choices and decisions to lead you to them. However, some doors you really would like to open for you may not, and you cannot understand why theydon't.<br><br>I'm sure you can recall something you wanted to be or do or have that never came to fruition. At the time you may have been disappointed, sad, or even angry. The door never opened, and some others you would desire in the future may not as well. However, the Lord knows your needs and desires to a much greater extent than you do.<br><br>Some doors may not open at the exact time you desire, but they will open when the Lord sees fit, so you must put your trust in Him and in His wisdom and understanding. Marvelous gateways are opened when you keep the Lord's word (see Revelation 3:8) and center your life on the teachings of Jesus Christ. He teaches that your life is priceless and precious, and your gratitude and appreciation for it will bless your sojourn here.<br><br>My dear brothers and sisters, I hope that you will treasure each day during your time as a student at Brigham Young University, whether it is measured in weeks, months, or years. Enjoy life; be happy; have fun; be productive; give service and love to others; and, especially, be faithful. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Sharon G.

<h1>le Truths from Heaven—The Lord’s Pattern - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear young friends, my wife and I are delighted and honored to be with you this evening. I visualize you in many locations around the world as this fireside is being broadcast over the Church satellite system in 32 languages. I trust and pray that I might be understood and that, wherever you are, you will feel the Spirit and understand my message.<br><br>I understand this audience to be primarily young single adults in various circumstances. Many of you have just graduated from high school. Others are a little older and have enjoyed several years of university or college education. Many of you are employed or enrolled in schools that provide training to educate and equip you with skills to care for yourself and a family. And, of course, many of you are returned missionaries and are looking forward to the next phase of your life, of which we will speak tonight. How grateful I am that each of you--in all of your various circumstances--would gather tonight that we may be together for a moment and feel the common spirit that prevails throughout this Church.<br><h2><b>Ten Simple Truths from Heaven</b></h2><br>I have entitled my talk "The Simple Truths from Heaven--The Lord's Pattern." The first phrase of my title is taken from a remarkable discourse given by the Prophet Joseph Smith in Nauvoo in 1844, the same year he was martyred. Joseph Smith was speaking at the funeral of a member of the Church by the name of King Follett. He began his discourse with this statement: "I do not . . . intend to please your ears with superfluity of words or oratory, or with much learning; but I . . . [intend] to edify you with the <i>simple truths from heaven.</i>"<sup>1</sup><br><br>The second phrase of my title is found in scripture. The Lord's pattern is referred to in the Doctrine and Covenants: "I will give unto you a pattern in all things, that ye may not be deceived; for Satan is abroad in the land, and he goeth forth deceiving the nations" (D&amp;amp;C 52:14).<br><br>I desire to teach you the simple truths of a pattern the Lord established before the foundation of the world and about which we begin to learn when we read of Adam and Eve being placed in the Garden of Eden. It is a pattern you should desire to participate in. The outstanding feature of this pattern and plan is that you may experience eternal joy. Remember Lehi's statement in 2 Nephi: "Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25). To participate in this pattern will be the most important decision you will ever make.<br><br>Be careful that you do not reject the pattern as being too harsh. The pattern has been taught by many prophets. Remember, prophets love and speak truth, and they do not soften or modify truth to speak the easy things that people like to hear (see Isaiah 30:20; 2 Nephi 9:40). So be careful that you do not reject the prophets because your personal circumstances and timetable do not presently accommodate their counsel.<br><br>I pray that as I speak your hearts and your minds will be open to receive, through the Spirit, impressions and inspiration to guide you as you make important decisions affecting your lives. I bear witness that what I speak is the Lord's will to His children--especially to you, the young single adults of this Church.<br><br>When our loving Heavenly Father, through His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, created and organized this earth, He established a pattern with respect to the organization of the family that continues today. So now, reading from the book of Moses in the Pearl of Great Price, let's review 10 simple truths from heaven and discuss how these truths are a pattern for you today.<br><h2><b>1. God Has Created This Earth for Our Habitation and Use</b></h2><br>First: "And I, the Lord God, took the man, and put him into the Garden of Eden, to dress it, and to keep it" (Moses 3:15).<br><br>As you know, God created the heavens and the earth and all forms of life and gave His children dominion over those forms of life. God created the beautiful Garden of Eden and put man in the garden to dress it and to keep it. We may not live in the Garden of Eden as Adam initially did, but we are given the opportunity to dress and take care of that portion of the earth where we live. We are to have joy.<br><br>Thus my first simple truth from heaven is that God has created this earth for our habitation and use. We are to work. We are to better our circumstances and those about us. We have a responsibility to be busy and fully engaged in living a purposeful life and in carrying out the responsibilities given to us by our Heavenly Father.<br><br>The eternal plan of salvation, which the Father authored and Jesus Christ carried out and became Chief Advocate of, provided that we would have the opportunity to come to this earth to acquire a physical body and to prove our willingness to keep God's commandments. Well, here we are. We do live on a beautiful earth. We have the knowledge of the restored gospel. We have every opportunity humanity has ever had. What will we now do with these privileges?<br><h2><b>2. Man Should Not Be Alone</b></h2><br>Let us now look at the second simple truth from heaven. Once again, I read from the book of Moses: "And I, the Lord God, said unto mine Only Begotten, that it was not good that the man should be alone; wherefore, I will make an help meet for him" (Moses 3:18).<br><br>Here we see that one of the simple truths from heaven is that it is not good that man or woman should be alone. He or she is to have a helpmeet. Few, if any, simple truths from heaven are more important to us than the knowledge that we are to have a helpmeet for us, a wife for a man or a husband for a woman.<br><br>Perhaps we should define <i>helpmeet.</i> You must not misunderstand what the Lord meant when Adam was told he was to have a helpmeet. A helpmeet is a companion suited to or equal to us. We walk side by side with a helpmeet, not one before or behind the other. Ahelpmeet results in an absolute equal partnership between a husband and a wife. Eve was to be equal to Adam as a husband and wife are to be equal to each other.<br><br>Adam was still in the Garden of Eden when the Lord declared that he was to have a helpmeet. He had not yet partaken of the fruit of the tree that would result in expulsion from the Garden of Eden and eventual physical death. Accordingly, Adam received his helpmeet for eternity. This was not a casual relationship. This was a covenant relationship.<br><br>As you contemplate your helpmeet, plan for eternity. Plan to enter a holy temple. Be worthy to enter the temple. The temple is where you and your helpmeet can form a family that will be eternal. Wherever possible, all of you young men should serve an honorable mission before you conclude selecting a helpmeet. Your mission service will prepare you for your future role as a righteous husband and father and willbe a blessing to you throughout your life. It will bless your future posterity.<br><br>Occasionally we meet members, including young single adults, who have heard of, seen, or been members of families where a temple marriage did not bring happiness and was canceled. Not wanting to experience that possible result, and in fear of making a mistake, some shy away from the responsibilities of marriage, and particularly of a temple marriage.<br><br>Tonight I plead with you not to allow the actions of others to deter you from making righteous decisions and following eternal patterns. Satan, who does not desire your happiness or eternal progression, would put fear and doubt in your mind to convince you that you should not attempt to seek a helpmeet who could bring you eternal companionship and joy. Brothers and sisters, have faith, not fear, and be worthy to enter holy temples.<br><br>I urge all of you to fix in your mind the need to seek out and find a companion, as prescribed by the Lord. To do so, you must seek out opportunities to associate with members of the opposite sex who share your gospel values. For that purpose we encourage you to not only be active in the Church but to participate in all of the opportunities the Church provides for personal development and association. Our institutes of religion are marvelous facilities where you may gather and meet one another and exercise leadership qualities and talents so that you might see those about you who may complement you as a helpmeet.<br><br>I know that many of you desire marriage but lack opportunity. Our hearts ache for so many of you faithful young single adults in that situation. I am familiar with a faithful family in the Church with several sons who were once in that situation. The parents and the sons decided to substantially increase temple worship and to continue to "bother the Lord" on this subject. Rich blessings followed, companions were found, and temple marriages occurred. Do all that you can to qualify for the Lord's help in this respect. Be patient; trust in the Lord. The blessings will eventually come.<br><br>Remember, it is a simple truth from heaven that you are not to be alone in your eternal journey. You are to seek out a righteous companion and move forward in great faith so that you can, in His time, fulfill the eternal destiny that our Heavenly Father has planned for you.<br><h2><b>3. The Plan Provides That a Man and a Woman Will Cleave unto One Another as Husband and Wife</b></h2><br>Later, as related in the same chapter of Moses, the Lord forms Eve. The Lord then says, "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife; and they shall be one flesh" (Moses 3:24).<br><br>This is my third simple truth from heaven, that a man shall leave his father and mother and cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh. I think we could also say that a woman shall leave her father and mother and cleave unto her husband.<br><br>To cleave together as husband and wife results, in most cases, in a physical departure from the security and dependence you have on your parents. However, as you make this change, this new relationship--to adhere firmly, closely, and unwaveringly to a husband or wife--will not diminish the eternal love and respect you have for your parents.<br><br>There is no substitute for this simple truth from heaven. The revelations speak of a relationship between a man and a woman. Understanding this simple truth will eliminate all confusion with respect to issues sometimes inappropriately called "alternative lifestyles." Such alternative lifestyle issues are the workings of Satan.<br><br>Please realize the importance of this simple truth from heaven. A man and a woman are to cleave to one another. In other words, they are to cling faithfully to one another spiritually, emotionally, and physically.<br><br>As I have previously mentioned, this relationship is appropriate because of the beautiful ordinance of celestial marriage administered in our temples. When you have been born in the covenant or have been sealed to your parents in a temple, the bonds that bind you to your parents are rearranged just enough to allow you and your helpmeet, a man and a woman, to be sealed to one another. Through this ordinance your sealing to your parents is made stronger because your sealing to a helpmeet extends the sealing from your parents through you and down through your children and future generations.<br><br>I know of no greater decision that any of you will make than selecting a companion, a woman for a man or a man for a woman, to become one flesh in the eyes of the Lord through temple sealing. It is the pattern of the Lord that man and woman should be married and cleave unto one another. Any other pattern is not of the Lord.<br><h2><b>4. Agency Is Essential</b></h2><br>A wonderful principle has been provided by our loving Heavenly Father that I will refer to as the fourth simple truth from heaven. This is the principle of agency. We read further in the book of Moses: "Nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee" (Moses 3:17).<br><br>Each of us has agency. The Lord will not force us into making any decisions that violate our personal agency. However, we must be willing to accept the responsibility that comes from exercising the agency given to us. Remember, Satan attempted to force all people to follow him. That pattern was rejected by Heavenly Father. Satan then rebelled "and sought to destroy the agency of man" (Moses 4:3). Through the plan of our Heavenly Father, however, we have agency. One exercise of that agency is to seek and select a companion.<br><br>Now, we know that generally in our society the man should initiate opportunities that lead to social interaction. I would counsel all young men--yes, <i>all</i> men within the sound of my voice--that you do have the responsibility to initiate these opportunities. Do not delay this matter. There is a difference between a "lost opportunity" and a "wasted opportunity." Do not waste time. Do not procrastinate the opportunities you have to seek and select a companion. There has been much spoken by modern-day prophets that would encourage you to seek out a companion. This counsel especially applies to returned missionaries and those who are moving forward with their education and are mature enough to accept the responsibilities of adulthood, which include the responsibility of marriage.<br><br>Even as I give you this counsel, I am keenly aware that some of you may have experienced disappointment in past relationships. What seemed to be right did not work out, and you have to start all over again. This might be characterized as a "false start." Most young single adults have this experience. The reasons are many: different goals, unbalanced relationship, too immature and not ready for marriage, and it just didn't feel right. Do not be discouraged. You are working toward decisions that have an eternal consequence. Be mindful. Be prayerful. But be resolute in your desire to exercise your agency to find and select the right helpmeet.<br><br>Let me discuss for a moment a very delicate subject that often affects agency. It is a subject your parents and leaders may have strong feelings about but may not know how to discuss it with you. It is the subject of personal appearance.<br><br>Exercise of agency is sometimes influenced by personal appearance, both your own and another's. On occasion, it is difficult to become acquainted with someone's real self because of first impressions.<br><br>Be willing to sit down with a trusted friend and ask this question: What would you recommend I do to improve my physical appearance? Listen to what he or she says. Do not be offended, but take to heart his or her counsel. If necessary, joyfully and happily improve yourself, whether it involves having a smile on your face, losing weight, or changing your hairstyle, grooming, clothing, mannerisms, personal hygiene, or anything else.<br><br>Well, I finally said it. Are you offended at me? Remember, your body is the temple of your spirit. Be sure it is clean, tidy, neat, fit, and pure so that your spirit can shine through and be seen by all.<br><br>Of course, I realize, as we all do, that not everyone will have the opportunity to marry in this life. However, tonight I am speaking of the rule and not the exception. The rule is that we should seek a companion even though there will be many exceptions due to health, inadequate opportunity, and other factors. Fortunately, the complete gospel plan, as we understand it, is that those who are faithful in this life but are denied the opportunity to be married will have the blessings not enjoyed during this life at a later period of time. How grateful I am for that doctrine.<br><h2><b>5. We Live by Work All the Days of Our Lives</b></h2><br>As Adam and Eve left the Garden of Eden, the Lord gave them this instruction, which is my fifth simple truth from heaven. I quote again from the book of Moses: "By the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, until thou shalt return unto the ground--for thou shalt surely die--for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou wast, and unto dust shalt thou return" (Moses 4:25).<br><br>We are to work while we inhabit this earth. We should prepare ourselves to be self-reliant, and we should be willing and able to care for afamily.<br><br>Fortunately, many of you have the opportunity to acquire an education in universities and colleges. Others of you have the wonderful and unique opportunity to acquire skills and training that will equip you to secure a good job and provide economically for your family. I speak, in the latter reference, of the Perpetual Education Fund. I serve as a member of the board of this fund, and I know the great blessing it is to those of you who are earnestly striving to better yourselves and to prepare yourselves to marry a companion and rear a righteous family in the Church. To all of you, I say, be willing to work and to work hard to provide for your family while you live upon this earth.<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley has repeatedly encouraged you to get all the education you can--to enable you to care for your family and serve in the Church.<br><h2><b>6. Husbands and Wives Are to Have Children and Create a Family</b></h2><br>In my mind, the sixth simple truth from heaven, and the most important following the truth to cleave unto one another as husband and wife, is the truth found in the following scripture from the book of Moses: "And Adam knew his wife, and she bare unto him sons and daughters, and they began to multiply and to replenish the earth" (Moses 5:2).<br><br>This simple truth from heaven identifies the duty to bear children. Now, this simple truth lies before you--but not before marriage! Please lock firmly in your heart and mind your desire to be a parent in due time. Acquire now the attributes necessary to be a loving father or mother to the children who will eventually grace your home. Seek to acquire the patience and skill you will need to teach and rear children in the knowledge of the Lord.<br><br>The Brethren of the Church are being bolder in counseling young married couples to move forward and have a family. The world would suggest that it might not be proper to have a family until all temporal arrangements are in order. The world says delay until you have completed your education; delay until you have acquired a suitable home, furnishings, and conveniences; delay until you have secure employment that is economically sound; delay until you have acquired the toys and playthings of entertainment and convenience. All of this delaying is of the world and is the influence of Satan attempting to destroy the family.<br><br>Prophets teach that after considering means and circumstances--including personal health--and other factors of which each couple is personally aware, we should not delay having a family. Have the faith to step forward into this phase of your life, knowing that your Heavenly Father will support and sustain you with the unique and special challenges that come with being a parent.<br><br>It is not necessary to delay having a family until you have acquired all of the conveniences that your parents had when you left their home. Remember, it took your parents many years, even decades, to acquire the lovely home and furnishings that they have, and you must be willing to have the faith to start where you are and build, grow, and develop while you have a family. As husband and wife, look forward to working together and sacrificing to accomplish this purpose.<br><br>Be careful that you do not delay having a family so that you can economically acquire the toys or entertainment that, in the long run, do not bless you eternally.<br><br>If you were to speak to most older married couples in your ward or branch and among your friends, you would find that in almost every case they started their married life and began their family with very few physical possessions--especially as compared to what they now have.<br><br>Sister Tingey and I were married and our first child was born while I was in law school. Our first apartment, a basement apartment, was a huge step down from our prior experience of living in our parents' homes. The ceiling of each doorway included heating pipes, and the height of the pipes was the middle of my forehead. I cannot number how many times I hit my head going from room to room. Sister Tingey remembers the "hideous wallpaper," as she called it, displaying large red roosters. We had no laundry facilities and used a commercial Laundromat for 18 months.<br><br>Our second apartment, while I served in the military, was a duplex that shared one bathroom located between the two apartments. The bathroom had two doors, one to each apartment. You may well surmise what my wife thought of that arrangement. We slept on a fold-up bed that was easy to move around but extremely uncomfortable. Our first kitchen table was a card table with folding legs. On many occasions during the year we used that table, I inadvertently knocked one of the legs, and the entire table and contents came crashing to the floor.<br><br>For several years when we had four children under the age of nine, we lived in an apartment with only two bedrooms. Were we crowded? Absolutely! Yet, today, some of the sweetest memories of our family come from that period.<br><br>As you can see, we had few of life's necessities and no luxuries in our first living arrangements. Looking back on it, we realize it didn't matter. We were in love, we wanted to start a family, and we simply trusted in the Lord and had faith that all would work out.<br><br>Today, 48 years later, we have a lovely home with all, and probably more, of the necessities and conveniences that we need. But when we started out, we had so little. We are happier today because our love has grown through the sometimes difficult life circumstances we have shared and not because we have acquired more worldly possessions.<br><br>You must have that same faith and be willing to move forward into that life. Be prepared to start where you are and grow and develop your family with love and appreciation for your blessings.<br><h2><b>7. A Family Continues On, Becoming a Multigenerational Family</b></h2><br>The next simple truth from heaven is the pattern established by Adam and Eve to not only have children but to have posterity. We read: "And from that time forth, the sons and daughters of Adam began to divide two and two in the land, and to till the land, and to tend flocks, and they also begat sons and daughters" (Moses 5:3).<br><br>We are attempting to develop a multigenerational Church. To have posterity--to be not only a parent but also a grandparent and a great-grandparent--is one of the enriching blessings that comes to faithful members of theChurch.<br><br>As the General Authorities watch the Church grow and develop in many countries of the world, one of the most satisfying experiences we have is seeing faithful multigenerational families living where the Church has been for only a few decades. Already we see children, grandchildren, grandparents, and so forth. This is the ideal. This is what we should work to have wherever possible: a large and wonderful family that will assist in growing and developing the Church in any country or any land where you live.<br><br>A wonderful and very descriptive scripture appears in Psalms:<br><br><i>Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is his reward.</i><br><br><i>As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth.</i><br><br><i>Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them.</i> [Psalm 127:3–5]<br><br>Are you willing to exercise your mind and visualize where you will be or where you want to be in 20 or 25 years? If you are now 20, what will be your life when you are 40 or 45 years ofage?<br><br>In almost every instance when I have asked that question of young single adults, they have described "family" as their first priority. Physical possessions and toys are not a frequent focus. Being surrounded with a loving family--your children and grandchildren--is what most of you describe as where you want to be.<br><br>Start today to make that personal vision a self-fulfilling prophecy that will come true.<br><h2><b>8. We Acknowledge God, Worship Him, and Offer unto Him Our Sacrifices</b></h2><br>As Adam began his life outside the Garden of Eden, he began to offer sacrifices. We read asfollows:<br><br><i>And after many days an angel of the Lord appeared unto Adam, saying: Why dost thou offer sacrifices unto the Lord? And Adam said unto him: I know not, save the Lord commanded me.</i><br><br><i>And then the angel spake, saying: This thing is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father, which is full of grace and truth.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, thou shalt do all that thou doest in the name of the Son, and thou shalt repent and call upon God in the name of the Son forevermore.</i> [Moses 5:6–8]<br><br>This simple truth from heaven is that as you establish your life as a married couple with a family, remember who you are in relation to your Heavenly Father. Remember that He is your God and your Father and you are His son or daughter. Offer sacrifices of your time and talents to Him. Be faithful in the Church. Serve your fellowman. Seek to establish righteousness. Acknowledge your many blessings by offering and returning to Him a tithe of your increase so that through humility you acknowledge and recognize the dependence you have on your Heavenly Father.<br><h2><b>9. From These Sacrifices Come Promised Blessings</b></h2><br>The ninth simple truth from heaven is recognition of the blessings that come as a result of your sacrifice. The scriptures state:<br><br><i>And in that day the Holy Ghost fell upon Adam, which beareth record of the Father and the Son, saying: I am the Only Begotten of the Father from the beginning, henceforth and forever, that as thou hast fallen thou mayest be redeemed, and all mankind, even as many as will.</i><br><br><i>And in that day Adam blessed God and was filled, and began to prophesy concerning all the families of the earth, saying: Blessed be the name of God, for because of my transgression my eyes are opened, and in this life I shall have joy, and again inthe flesh I shall see God.</i><br><br><i>And Eve, his wife, heard all these things and was glad, saying: Were it not for our transgression we never should have had seed, and never should have known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption, and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient.</i><br><br><i>And Adam and Eve blessed the name of God, and they made all things known unto their sons andtheir daughters.</i> [Moses 5:9–12]<br><br>Did you note some of the blessings that Adam and Eve received through their sacrifice? They enjoyed the companionship of the Holy Ghost, who bore record of the Father and the Son and guided and directed them in all of their decisions. They were blessed to enjoy the spirit of prophecy concerning their family so that they would be guided in the decisions they made and how they cared for their children. Their eyes were opened so they could see and distinguish between good and evil and could make proper choices for their family.<br><br>The scriptures state that Adam and Eve would have joy and rejoice in the blessings that came to their family. And they were promised that all of these blessings and things would be made known to their sons and daughters--their posterity.<br><br>Do you believe these promises can be yours as a result of your willingness to accept the responsibilities of marriage and family? I bear witness that they will be and that you can have the same blessings for your circumstances that Adam and Eve had for their family.<br><h2><b>10. The Fulness of the Gospel, Including All Temple Ordinances, Is Available to Us</b></h2><br>The last simple truth I will share with you tonight relates to the blessings that result from sacred ordinances. We read in the concluding verses of the fifth chapter in Moses as follows:<br><br><i>And thus the Gospel began to be preached, from the beginning, being declared by holy angels sent forth from the presence of God, and by his own voice, and by the gift of the Holy Ghost.</i><br><br><i>And thus all things were confirmed unto Adam, by an holy ordinance, and the Gospel preached, and a decree sent forth, that it should be in the world, until the end thereof; and thus it was. Amen.</i> [Moses 5:58–59]<br><br>This scripture, which is my tenth simple truth from heaven, promises that all things will be yours if you follow the pattern of which we are speaking. This means, of course, that all of the blessings of the restored Church are yours. Specifically, when it refers to "an holy ordinance," it makes reference to temples and to the beautiful temple ceremonies and ordinances that are provided therein. What a wonderful blessing to anticipate that you may be able to enjoy the full blessings of the gospel of Jesus Christ, including all temple blessings, when you are willing to participate in the beautiful and <i>simple truths from heaven</i> I have shared with you this evening.<br><h2><b>Follow Inspired Counsel</b></h2><br>In summary, the 10 simple truths from heaven we have spoken of tonight are as follows:<br><br>1. God has created this earth for our habitation and use.<br><br>2. Man should not be alone.<br><br>3. The plan provides that a man and a woman will cleave unto one another as husband and wife.<br><br>4. Agency is essential.<br><br>5. We live by work all the days of our lives.<br><br>6. Husbands and wives are to have children and create a family.<br><br>7. A family continues on, becoming a multigenerational family.<br><br>8. We acknowledge God, worship Him, and offer unto Him our sacrifices.<br><br>9. From these sacrifices come promised blessings.<br><br>10. The fulness of the gospel, including all temple ordinances, is available to us.<br><br>Please do not reject this counsel. Try not to delay marriage where opportunity is available. Do not seek for perfection in a companion. Generally, perfection does not exist. Remember, you are not perfect. Instead seek for a husband or wife who will grow with you to perfection.<br><br>Do not delay having a family. Be willing to sacrifice and rear a family with all of the resulting challenges, knowing that in the process you will have wonderful memories that fortify and sustain your family for years to come.<br><br>I know that my counsel to you tonight is very weighty. For some, it would appear impossible to obtain. But please have faith, and join that faith with works. The Lord is aware of you as individuals and of your particular circumstances. He will bless you. He will assist you in bringing to pass that which is right and which you righteously desire. Please have faith.<br><br>In conclusion, I believe many of you may be saying: "I believe all that you say and desire to have and follow these patterns in my life. But how will I know if my decisions are right?"<br><br>I would like to answer: You will know in the same manner by which the leaders of the Church today receive promptings that lead to the making of many important decisions. You will know by the Spirit.<br><br>You are entitled to peace and to a spiritual witness that will confirm your feelings that it is right. Your feelings of love for one another and your compatibility as a couple will be made known to you in the manner prescribed in the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, I will impart unto you of my Spirit, which shall enlighten your mind, which shall fill your soul with joy;</i><br><br><i>And then shall ye know, or by this shall you know, all things whatsoever you desire of me, which are pertaining unto things of righteousness, in faith believing in me that you shall receive.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 11:13–14]<br><br>Do not seek for more, such as the voice of an earthquake, but listen for the still, small voice. It will come, and you will know.<br><br>May God bless you, my beloved young members--you future fathers, mothers, grandfathers, grandmothers, and leaders of the Church. We love you. The Lord loves you. He wants you to be happy. He wants you to have joy. He wants you to follow the eternal pattern He has established.<br><br>I bear witness that the patterns of these simple truths from heaven are true, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Earl C. Tingey was a member of the Presidency of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given on 13 January 2008.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. <i>HC</i> 6:303; emphasis added.<br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>r of Deliverance - Henry B. Eyring - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am grateful for the honor and the opportunity to speak with you today. It is an honor because you are precious children of our Heavenly Father. In the life before this one you were His pupils. I am honored by this invitation from the First Presidency to teach. It is an opportunity because you have chosen to listen, among the many things you could be doing, and so you must have at least a hope that I will say something useful to you. I pray that will betrue.<br><br>We are unique. No two of us are in exactly the same circumstances. We have not had identical experiences in the past, nor do we have a single vision of what happiness in the future would be for us. There will be people from every part of the United States and many countries of the world listening. Because of that variety, I have prayed to know what help God wants to offer to us all. An answer finally came.<br><br>Today I wish to bear witness of God's power of deliverance. At some point in our lives we will all need that power. Every person living is in the midst of a test. We have been granted by God the precious gift of life in a world created as a proving ground and a preparatory school. The tests we will face, their severity, their timing, and their duration will be unique for each of us. But two things will be the same for all of us. They are part of the design for mortal life.<br><br>First, the tests at times will stretch us enough for us to feel the need for help beyond our own. And, second, God in His kindness and wisdom has made the power of deliverance available to us.<br><br>Now you might well ask, "Since Heavenly Father loves us, why does His plan of happiness include trials that could overwhelm us?" It is because His purpose is to offer us eternal life. He wants to give us a happiness that is only possible as we live as families forever in glory with Him. And trials are necessary for us to be shaped and made fit to receive that happiness that comes as we qualify for the greatest of all the gifts of God.<br><br>Today I will talk about some of the trials we are given and the power of deliverance available to us as we pass through them. There are many different tests, but today I will speak of only three. You may be in one of these tests now. For each, the power of deliverance is available--not to escape the test but to endure it well.<br><br>First: We can feel overcome with pain and sorrow at the death of a loved one.<br><br>Second: Each of us will struggle against fierce opposition--some of which comes from dealing with our physical needs and some from enemies.<br><br>Third: Each of us who live past the age of accountability will feel the need to escape from the effects of sin.<br><br>Each of these tests can provide the opportunity for us to see that we need the power of God to help us pass them well.<br><br>Some of you may feel the pressures of those tests now, but all of us will face them. It helps to know that they do not come from random chance or from a cruel God. And knowing what a wonderful reward lies ahead helps to endure the tests well. The Prophet Joseph Smith needed and got that assurance when he was feeling deserted and nearly overwhelmed by persecution and contention among those he ledand loved:<br><br><i>My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;</i><br><br><i>And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>The Lord told Joseph that his trials would be for a small moment. That was true for him, and it will be for us as we compare the duration of any earthly trial with the endlessness of eternity. And the reward for passing the tests well is to become worthy of eternal life. That assurance will help us when enemies defame us or doctors deliver a grim prognosis.<br><br>That brings us to the first category of trials we will consider: the tragedy that death can bring. Life ends early for some and eventually for us all. Each of us will be tested by facing the death of someone we love. Just the other day I met a man I had not seen since his wife died. It was a chance meeting in a pleasant social holiday situation. He was smiling as he approached me. Remembering his wife's death, I phrased the common greeting very carefully: "How are you doing?"<br><br>The smile vanished, his eyes became moist, and he said quietly, with great earnestness, "I'm doing fine. But it's very hard."<br><br>It is very hard, as most of you have learned and all of us will sometime know. The hardest part of that test is to know what to do with the sorrow, the loneliness, and the loss that can feel as if a part of us has been lost. Grief can persist like a chronic ache. And for some there may be feelings of anger or injustice.<br><br>The Savior's Atonement and Resurrection give Him the power to deliver us in such a trial. Through His experience He came to know all our griefs. He could have known them by the inspiration of the Spirit. But He chose instead to know by experiencing them for Himself. This is the account:<br><br><i>And behold, he shall be born of Mary, at Jerusalem which is the land of our forefathers, she being a virgin, a precious and chosen vessel, who shall be overshadowed and conceive by the power ofthe Holy Ghost, and bring forth a son, yea, even the Son of God.</i><br><br><i>And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.</i><br><br><i>And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>Good people around you will try to understand your grief at the passing of a loved one. They may feel grief themselves. The Savior not only understands and feels grief but also feels <i>your</i> personal grief that only you feel. And He knows you perfectly. He knows your heart. So He can know which of the many things you can do that will be best for you as you invite the Holy Ghost to comfort and bless you. He will know where it is best for you to start. Sometimes it will be to pray. It might be to go to comfort someone else. I know of a widow with a debilitating illness who was inspired to visit another widow. I wasn't there, but I am certain that the Lord inspired a faithful disciple to reach out to another and thus was able to succor them both.<br><br>There are many ways that the Savior can succor those who grieve, each fitted to them. But you can be sure that He can and that He will do it in the way that is best for those who grieve and for those around them. The constant when God delivers people from grief is people feeling childlike humility before God. A great example of the power of that faithful humility comes from the life of Job. You remember the account:<br><br><i>Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,</i><br><br><i>And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.</i><br><br><i>In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>Humility is one constant in those who are delivered from grief. The other, which Job had, is abiding faith in the power of the Savior's Resurrection. We all will be resurrected. The loved one who dies will be resurrected as the Savior was. The reunion we will have with them will not be ethereal but with bodies that need never die nor age nor become infirm. When the Savior appeared to His apostles after the Resurrection, He not only reassured them in their grief but also all of us who might ever grieve. He reassured them and us this way:<br><br><i>Peace be unto you....</i><br><br><i>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>The Lord can inspire us to reach out for the power of deliverance from our grief in the way best suited to us. We can invite the Holy Ghost in humble prayer. We can choose to serve others for the Lord. We can testify of the Savior, of His gospel, and of His restoration of His Church. We can keep His commandments. All of those choices invite the Holy Ghost. It is the Holy Ghost who can comfort us in the way suited to our need. And by the inspiration of the Spirit we can have a testimony of the Resurrection and a clear view of the glorious reunion ahead. I have felt that comfort as I looked down at the gravestone of someone Iknew--someone that I know I can at some future time hold in my arms. Knowing that, I was not only delivered from grief but was filled with happy anticipation.<br><br>Had that little person lived to maturity, she would have needed deliverance in another set of trials. She would have been tested to stay faithful to God through the physical and spiritual challenges that come to everyone. Even though the body is a magnificent creation, keeping it functioning is a challenge that tests us all. For too many in the world it is hard to find enough food and clean water to get through the next day. Everyone must struggle through illness and the effects of aging.<br><br>Beyond the challenges of the body that come from within, we face the opposition of enemies from without. There is anger and hatred in the world around us, and some of it will at times be directed at us. As the Prophet Joseph learned, the opposition grew as he became more valuable to the Lord's purposes.<br><br>The power of deliverance from these trials is in place. It works in the same way as the deliverance from the trial that comes in facing the death of a loved one. Just as that deliverance is not always to have spared the life of a loved one, the deliverance from other trials may not be to remove them. It may not be to have perfect health or to have enemies vanish or ignore us. He may not give relief until we develop faith to make choices that will bring the power of the Atonement to work in our lives. He does not require that out of indifference but out of love for us. Here is His warning:<br><br><i>For behold, the Lord hath said: I will not succor my people in the day of their transgression; but I will hedge up their ways that they prosper not; and their doings shall be as a stumbling block before them.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>There is a guide for receiving the Lord's power of deliverance from opposition in life. Itwas given to Thomas B. Marsh, then the president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. He was in difficult trials, and the Lord knew he would face more. Here was the counsel to him that I take for myself and offer you: "Be thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers."<sup>6</sup><br><br>The Lord always wants to lead us to deliverance through our becoming more righteous. That requires repentance. And that takes humility. So the way to deliverance always requires humility in order for the Lord to be able to lead us by the hand where He wants to take us through our troubles and onto sanctification.<br><br>We might make the mistake of assuming that illness, persecution, and poverty will be humbling enough. They don't always produce by themselves the kind and degree of humility we will need to be rescued. Trials can produce resentment or discouragement. The humility you and I need to get the Lord to lead us by the hand comes from faith. It comes from faith that God really lives, that He loves us, and that what He wants--hard as it may be--will always be best for us.<br><br>The Savior showed us that humility. You have read of how He prayed in the garden while He was suffering a trial on our behalf beyond our ability to comprehend or to endure, or even for me to describe. You remember His prayer: "Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not mywill, but thine, be done."<sup>7</sup><br><br>He knew and trusted His Heavenly Father, the great Elohim. He knew that His Father was all-powerful and infinitely kind. The Beloved Son asked for the power of deliverance to help Him in humble words like those of a little child.<br><br>The Father did not deliver the Son by removing the trial. For our sakes He did not dothat, and He allowed the Savior to finish themission He came to perform. Yet we can forever take courage and comfort from knowing of the help that the Father did provide:<br><br><i>And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.</i><br><br><i>And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.</i><br><br><i>And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,</i><br><br><i>And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>The Savior prayed for deliverance. What He was given was not an escape from the trial but comfort enough to pass through it gloriously.<br><br>His command to His disciples, who were themselves being tested, is a guide for us. We can determine to follow it. We can determine to rise up and pray in great faith and humility. And we can follow the command added in the book of Mark: "Rise up, let us go."<sup>9</sup><br><br>From this you have counsel for passing the physical and spiritual tests of life. You will need God's help after you have done all you can for yourself. So rise up and go, but get His help as early as you can, not waiting for the crisis to ask for deliverance.<br><br>The way that President Hinckley designed the Perpetual Education Fund--about which you have heard--is an example. It was intended for those who would find it hard to follow the prophet's admonition to get an education. They would face difficulty, almost overwhelming challenges. But the plan required that they stand up and do all they could for themselves while being faithful enough to God to qualify for His help when the difficulties might become overwhelming. They had to make and follow their own plan to get the education and to find the means to finance it. They were required to attend institute and be faithful in the Church.<br><br>I was able to see what happened. I saw miracles come to help those who went forward as if it all depended upon them but acted as if it would finally all depend on God's power of deliverance.<br><br>In education and in life you will face stumbling blocks and opposition. You can and must go forward with confidence. If you start determined to qualify for God's power of deliverance, not just in education but also in all the trials of mortality, you will succeed. You will be strengthened. You will be guided around and through barriers. Help and comfort will come. Your faith in Heavenly Father and the Savior will be increased. You will be strengthened to resist evil. And you will feel the gospel of Jesus Christ working in your life.<br><br>And that brings us to the third trial. All of us will at times struggle to feel free from the effects of sin. Only the Savior had the power to resist every temptation and never sin. So the most important and most difficult trial for us all is to become clean and to know that we are. All of us yearn at times for the confidence that we will see the Lord's face, as we will, in the final judgment and see it with joy and pleasure.<br><br>The purpose of our long discussion today about trials and what it takes to get the powers of deliverance was to give you and me hope for happiness in that day of judgment that will come for all of us. What it takes to qualify for the powers of deliverance in the trials of life also can qualify us for the assurance we need that we will have passed the ultimate test of mortality.<br><br>We have seen that deliverance always requires humility before God. It takes submission to His will. It takes prayer and the willingness to obey. It takes serving others out of love for them and for the Savior. And it always requires and invites the Holy Ghost.<br><br>As you are delivered in trials, the Holy Ghost comes to you. Many of you have felt the result of frequent contact with the Holy Ghost. It may have been in your missionary service, where you needed deliverance many times. The Holy Ghost came to comfort and to guide you. As that recurred again and again, you may have noticed a change in yourself. The temptations that once troubled you seemed to fade. People who once seemed difficult began to appear more lovable. You began to see almost unreasonable potential in very humble people. You came to care more about their happiness than about your own.<br><br>If that change in you came, it was more likely gradual than sudden. Yet it was what the scriptures call the "mighty change."<sup>10</sup> And it is the evidence you and I need to have hope and assurance as we look forward to the great and final test [the final Judgment] that comes after this life. Your experience in enduring well in the trials of life by drawing on God's power of deliverance can bring you the assurance you need to find peace in this life and confidence for the next.<br><br>I bear you my solemn witness that God the Father lives and loves us. I know that. His plan of happiness is perfect, and it <i>is</i> a plan of happiness. Jesus Christ was resurrected, as we will be. He suffered so that He could succor us in all of our trials. He paid the ransom for all of our sins and those of all of Heavenly Father's children so that we could be delivered from death and sin. I know that in the Church of Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost can come to comfort and to cleanse us as we follow the Master. You have felt that influence today as I have.<br><br>I testify that the keys of the priesthood were restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. They are exercised today by President Gordon B. Hinckley. This is the true Church of Jesus Christ.<br><br>I leave you my witness and my love, and I bless you that you may receive sufficient comfort and succor in your times of need, through all the tests and trials of your life. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Henry B.

<h1>ls and Vestures: “The Lord Pondereth the Hearts” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
On these cold winter mornings I am reminded of an early winter morning a number of years ago when one of my teenagers headed for the front door with his backpack slung over one shoulder. He was in an obvious hurry to get to the school bus. I noticed out the front window that snow was rapidly coming down and that my teenage son was about to step out into the dead of winter in a T-shirt, jeans, and Nikes--an outfit more in tune with awarm spring day.<br><br>"Where is your coat?" I asked, reacting in my typical fatherly manner.<br><br>"Dad, nobody wears coats!" was his simple reply. And with that, the front door swung open and off he went into the cold, snowy day with very little between himself and the elements. I continued watching through the front window as he tiptoed through the piling snow, trying to keep the slush from slipping down into his low-cut sneakers. I worried as he pushed his hands deeply into his pants pockets, trying to cover as much skin as possible with the single layer of cotton denim.<br><br>And then, there they were--all those brave teenagers standing at the corner waiting for the approaching yellow bus, and most without the needed winter coat. I knew the garment well. With its waterproof outer fabric; itssleek, smooth inner lining; and its thick, body heat–capturing interlining, it hung readily in the front closet of each of their homes. But apparently this generation had decided that while this garment offered needed warmth and protection, it would be an embarrassment to actually wear a winter coat to school. Does this sound familiar?<br><br>Because I didn't take the time that morning to stop my teenager and offer a lecture, may I take this opportunity to voice my concern--not only as a parent but also as a costume historian? To aid my argument, let me offer a brief lesson or two from Clothing 101, a mythical class in which I have just officially enrolled each one of you. Welcome to class. And, yes, there will be a quiz at the end of the lecture!<br><br>In his 1952 book <i>Clothes,</i> James Laver--a well-known sociologist, writer, critic, and fashion designer--offered three principles that help determine why people wear clothes. In 1984 Barbara and Cletus Anderson, in their book <i>Costume Design,</i> summarized Laver's three principles this way:<br><br>1. Clothes "are selected to counteract the effects of the cold or damp."<br><br>2. Clothes are assembled "because they lend social status to the wearers and display their importance to the world."<br><br>3. "Clothes are donned to make the wearer look as attractive as possible, within the framework of what is considered attractive at any particular time in history."<sup>1</sup><br><br>We might note that Laver's principles are chronologically ordered by the developmental steps of human maturity. For most of his life, up until my son became a teenager, principle 1 ruled his life, and he was content to wrap up in hat, scarf, mittens, boots, snow pants, and winter coat before heading out into a snowstorm. But somewhere between grade school and middle school, principle 2 came into play. His desire for social status suddenly ruled out the wearing of all his winter attire. I knew that had to be the main reason he was not wearing a coat that morning, because principle 3 had not yet kicked in for this young man--girls were of some interest in his life, but only from a distance, and he still grunted his disapproval at movies whenever the hero and heroine decided to advance their relationship with a kiss.<br><br>Based on Laver's second principle, my teenager had offered a strong statement in support of his motivation for not putting on a needed layer of warmth that cold winter morning: "Nobody wears coats!" In his world, to wear a coat would have made him a "nobody." Now, I knew that was not true; after all, that very same day I wore my winter coat! But at an age when being part of the group was so crucial to his self-worth, the possibility of a bad cold or even pneumonia was a small price to pay.<br><br>The Greek word <i>polis</i> means "city" or "community." Our word <i>politics</i><sup>2</sup> is derived from <i>polis,</i> referring to the close-knit society of the Greek world. One was born into and lived within the structure of one's polis, and it was within this group that one enjoyed moral support and physical protection. In the Greek play <i>Oedipus the King</i> by Sophocles, when the lead royal character comes to realize the great sin he has committed, he condemns himself to be banished from his polis.<sup>3</sup> He knows that no other polis or community will accept him, and he will be left to wander the land without community and without the unity of society. In the Greek mind, this was a fate worse than death itself. To my teenager, his polis was important enough to him that he would suffer the pains of being very, very cold the rest of that day.<br><br>Let me, however, point out that before my teenager left that morning a bit unprepared for the weather, our family had helped prepare him in other, more important ways. It is a family tradition in our home for the entire family to get out of bed in support of whichever member of the family has to leave the house the earliest so that we can have family scriptures and prayer. Sometimes the practice is short, and maybe even hurried, but my wife and I, asparents, sense that a light jacket is better than no coat at all.<br><br>The Apostle Paul taught the Ephesians:<br><br><i>And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;</i><br><br><i>For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:</i><br><br><i>Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>Note that just as Laver gave us three principles for the wearing of clothing based on maturity and understanding, Paul offers us here three principles of progression in the gospel based on maturity and understanding. First we read the list of Church offices in verse 11. Next the three standards that deal with Church organization are enumerated in verse 12. Then we arrive at verse 13. Within this verse are the three crucial principles of spiritual maturity that are key to our individual development and are the main purposes for the Church and all its offices:<br><br>1. A "unity of the faith"<br><br>2. A "knowledge of the Son of God"<br><br>3. A development into "a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ"<br><br>Please note that Paul's list, like that of James Laver, is also chronologically ordered by the developmental steps of human maturity. When we initially participate in Christ's Church, we discover a crucial unity, or community of faith, wherein we are morally and physically sustained by a group of peers in whom we trust and by whom we are trusted. Combining our infant testimonies with this community, we gain strength. We learn at what point we might need the added layering of others' testimonies as we progress through the cold temptations of life. And as our testimony grows, principle 2 takes effect. Through the strengthening of our testimonies and the trials of our faith, our knowledge of the Son of God grows. Within this unity of faith, we find His countenance in those around us. We find His principles exemplified in the actions of those with whom we associate. And as we reciprocate, suddenly we begin to find in ourselves the very traits we admire in others. We increase in our personal knowledge of the Son of God. And, through this knowledge, we begin to become more like that perfect man or woman promised in Paul's principle 3--one who is a "measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ."<br><br>In regard to my teenager, I knew the importance of our family unit as a community of faith that would shield his infant testimony. As a couple, my wife and I had prayed that our example of faith would help strengthen his testimony as he grew more and more in the knowledge of the Son of God. We understood then, as we do now, that such growth is a lifelong process, and we hoped that every environment in which we allowed him to associate would offer the polis of faith he truly needed.<br><br>I assume that this might be at least partially why many of you have chosen to be a student or a faculty member or to fill a staff position at Brigham Young University. This campus offers you a community--or "unity of the faith"--in which you can ask the educational questions you need to ask and stretch the spiritual muscles you need to stretch as you try out that growing testimony you are developing. For many of you, this might be the first time in your life that you have been in such an incredible spiritual polis. This might be a unique opportunity to be around so many members of a community who have the same ideals, the same beliefs, and the same faith you possess.<br><br>To you students, let me add that I believe your parents are also glad you have chosen this particular polis in which to grow. As a parent, I am concerned with any environment in which my own children choose to participate. I know that such participations will become an integral part of each child's progression toward the Apostle Paul's principle 2 and eventually toward principle 3. I have always hoped and prayed that the people my children associate with will help them mature in their knowledge of the Son of God. I wish them to select friends whose countenances likewise reflect theteachings of Christ.<br><br>Yes, I admit that many of those shivering, yet fashion-conscious teenagers at the bus stop were young Christians, just like my son. And that was probably why I didn't worry as much about their lack of winter coats. But, as a costume historian, I did realize that my son's choice to follow the fashion crowd during this crucial time of his life was part of a maturing process that would lead him through another set of principles--those presented by James Laver. I also knew enough about Paul's principles to know how influential one's external expression could become on one's internal spiritual progression. I knew fully well the link between Paul's and James Laver's lists of principles, and I worried a bit, as any parent would.<br><br>I am sure you are asking yourself, "How could not wearing a coat to school denote a process of spiritual decline for this young man?" And I would agree with your initial reaction. But I must mention that at that specific time, I had more than one teenager in my home. In that same house, another young adult was much more involved in Laver's cycle of fashion maturity. The decisions of this individual were well past the lack of a winter coat and had advanced to experimentation with slashes and gashes cut in clothing to creatively reveal the skin beneath; wording and images applied across the chest for the purpose of shocking the viewer; and extremes in hair coloring and fingernail polishes a bit out of the ordinary for the "unity of the faith" in which I had strong beliefs.<br><br>I knew enough about fashion history to acknowledge that my second teenager's internal spiritual progression could be damaged by such external fashion expression.<br><br>In their book <i>Costume Design,</i> the Andersons state:<br><br><i>Social pressures can be very strong influences on behavior and a way to remain socially superior is to dress properly according to the unwritten rules of society. For many years what was considered "socially proper" would keep the members of society in their appropriate niches independent of laws. . . .</i><br><br><i>Fashion dictates with no regard for the individual and no concern for how the style will look on many who copy it. It declares what will be considered beautiful and therefore what will be thought ugly by reason of no longer being fashionable. . . .</i><br><br><i>Clothes express people's attitudes toward themselves and their society, both what they wear and how they wear it.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>May I repeat the final statement? "Clothes express people's attitudes toward themselves and their society." While many may argue that "clothes really do not make the man" or that "one cannot judge a book by its cover," I reply with the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson: "What you <i>are</i> stands over you the while, and thunders so that I cannot hear what you say to the contrary."<sup>6</sup><br><br>The fact remains that clothes really do affect the way in which we judge one another. While the Lord has the profound ability to look past the external and "pondereth the hearts"<sup>7</sup> of His children, we as human beings are very much influenced by the look of the outer vessel. And we are certainly affected by the vestures each individual selects to present him- or herself. The clothing you choose to wear makes a strong statement about your attitude toward yourself and your society. It is one of the strongest statements you make about the polis in which you choose to dwell.<br><br>Incidentally, this is another concept for our Clothing 101 lecture. Throughout history, clothing has not only made the man, it has actually been used as a way for certain societies to control their active polis members. May I share some powerful examples?<br><br>Example 1: The Central American polis of the Aztec nation did not allow the common citizens to wear cotton fabric. This fiber was reserved for select leaders of the society. Further, the ruling kings not only dictated the fibers one could wear but also sanctioned certain garments to be worn only by those who had proved themselves on the battlefield or in other social proving grounds.<sup>8</sup><br><br>Example 2: During the medieval period in Europe, sumptuary laws were passed by the ruling monarchs that dictated fabrics and garments to be worn by the varying classes of citizens. In her book <i>The Cultural Politics of Fur,</i> Julia Emberley states: "Sumptuary legislation . . . during the medieval period . . . was meant not so much to curb extravagance as to preserve certain commodities for the wealthy, ensuring that symbolic displays of wealth were reserved to the property-owning classes."<sup>9</sup><br><br>Example 3: In the British polis of World War II, support for the war effort extracted strong clothing regulations. In 1942 the Utility Clothing Scheme was placed into effect by the Board of Trade throughout Great Britain. This plan determined new clothing rations acceptable for men, women, and children during the war years. Regulations were specific enough to mandate that no woman's day dress could have more than five buttons, 160 inches of stitching, and two inches of hem.<sup>10</sup> Men's suits had like restrictions, including no more than three pockets, no more than three buttons on the center front, and no cuffs allowed on trousers.<sup>11</sup><br><br>We today may not fully understand how much our own polis determines the clothing we choose to wear. I consider myself formally dressed as I stand before you today because I wear a coat and tie. The tie has no real purpose, but I wear it because in the world of my fifth great-grandfather, men had long hair. It was fashionable in his day for hair to be worn pulled back in a ponytail tied with a black satin ribbon. But when he rode his horse, that ponytail would flap up and down in the wind, slapping the back of his neck. Consequently, he learned to wrap that black ribbon around the front of his neck to hold the ponytail tightly in place. This fashion was called the <i>solitaire,</i> because it held the hair solitary.<sup>12</sup> As it turned out, my fifth great-grandfather's polis liked the look of this black ribbon at the front of the neck. So, when fads changed and men cut their hair, the black ribbon remained and evolved into what my contemporary polis calls a tie. And my polis tells me to wear one if I wish to consider myself formally dressed.<br><br>To complete the formal look, I must also wear a suit coat. If you look at the sleeves, you will note that part of this important garment is a row of buttons along each cuff. May Ipoint out that these buttons lack any apparent contemporary utility? That same fifth great-grandfather also wore a coat, yet his sleeves were cut much longer than mine. They were so long, in fact, that he had to fold them back and button them up so they would not fall down over his hands.<sup>13</sup> My polis has decided that I must cut my sleeves to fit the length of my arms, but my great-great-great-great-great-grandfather's buttons are still present! Oddly enough, many of you wear the same fashion each Sunday without much regard to your ancient progenitors who created the original fashion out of necessity but later maintained the fad because of their polis.<br><br>We may not fully understand why our own polis demands certain looks. Yet, as Lord Chesterfield observed, "Dress is a very foolish thing, and yet it is a very foolish thing for a man not to be well dressed, according to his rank and way of life."<sup>14</sup> Perhaps we should be more conscious of the outer symbols we wear and why we wear them, for these symbols strongly comment on our internal beliefs.<br><br>Each of you as students, staff, and faculty at Brigham Young University can easily relate to our fashion discussion because we are part of a campus community that has a university dress code. While our code does not mandate a campus uniform as some other campuses do, its guidelines are nonetheless binding on our respective polis.<br><br>I wish to point out, however, that while many may mock or even ignore our BYU dress code with apparent reference to principles outlined by James Laver, the BYU dress code we follow is based more effectively on the principles outlined by the Apostle Paul. The code by which you students, faculty, and staff select your daily wear is based in a unity of faith. It represents our commitment to a community in which we hope to grow in our knowledge of the Son of God. This makes our personal signature on a document that asks us to agree to abide by such a dress code a statement of our support for the spiritual polis in which we choose to live. What's more, as Paul's ordered chronology of spiritual maturity would suggest, each of us who chooses to follow this code can increase in his or her knowledge of Christ and grow more effectively toward that perfect man as outlined by Paul.<br><br>Jeffrey R. Holland, when he was president of Brigham Young University, emphasized this same concept with these words:<br><br><i>Our individual and collective image has to do with the very mission of the university and the Church which sponsors it. By asking us to maintain a modest, neat, and clean appearance, our Board of Trustees are inviting us to aid them in making a deeper statement to the world about our beliefs, ourconvictions, our civility, and our discipline.</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/jeffrey-r-and-patricia-t-holland_virtus-et-veritas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>15</sup></a><br><br>Truly your honoring of the dress code adds to the educational and spiritual polis of our unique university campus. The external expression of your testimony can help strengthen not only your own faith but also that of each member of this polis who expects to see in you a "measure of the stature of the fulness ofChrist."<br><br>With this comment I have reached the end of our class today. "But Professor Scanlon," you might say, "we have not addressed Laver's third principle!" Unfortunately time does not allow a full discussion of the closely guarded secrets of Laver's third principle on the use of clothing to attract others. Those who wish to discuss this principle will have to take Clothing102 next semester. But, just as a teaser: Men, spend more time on the cut of your hair and the cleanliness of your shoes if you want that all-important date. And women, while formfitting fashion and a little skin might turn a male head, most men tend to marry a female who leaves much more to the imagination in the dating and mating process.<br><br>As promised, our lecture ends today with a quiz. I ask each of you to apply the first two principles in James Laver's list to the clothing you are wearing today. Where do you stand in this progression of maturity and understanding in relation to yourself and your society? Then, once you have answered question number one, please answer question number two. Apply the principles in the Apostle Paul's list to the clothing you are wearing today. Where do you stand in your maturity and understanding in relation to Christ? And let me point out that, as a faculty member at Brigham Young University and as a parent, I am a little more interested in your response to question number two.<br><br>I leave you my witness this day that while the cleansing of the inner vessel is a crucial and lifelong process, the manner in which we prepare and present our outer vessel will affect how others will perceive our contribution to our spiritual polis and our personal knowledge of the Son of God. I also recommend that each of you carefully select the polis with which you make allegiance, for its policies and practices will greatly influence your personal development. And since you currently have chosen to live in the polis of Brigham Young University, I highly recommend that you abide by its fashion consciousness. I testify to you that BYU's code was written under the inspiration of the most perfect of all men. To this I leave my sincere testimony, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Rory R.

<h1>le’s Journey - Bruce C. Hafen - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Oh, how we miss President Hinckley! The entire Church weeps and, in Zechariah's words, even "the land [mourns]."<sup>1</sup> Thousands filed by his casket last week. They said things like "He made me want to be a better person." "He helped me believe in myself." "He made it so easy to follow the prophet." You, and those your age, have felt close to President Hinckley all of your lives. He connected intimately with all of us, which helped us connect to God.<br><br>He was incredible: such magnificent vision, yet such mastery of detail; so clear about right and wrong, yet such compassion; such a sense of history, yet such bold contributions to the future; so powerful in his ideas, yet so practical and unpretentious in his daily walk; so good-humored, yet so wise. I love President Hinckley. And now I bear you my solemn witness that Thomas S. Monson is a prophet of God--chosen, schooled, and prepared by a divine process for over four decades. May the Lord open heaven's windows upon President Monson, President Eyring, and President Uchtdorf.<br><br>A few years ago our teenage daughter was feeling quite unsettled, asking some very honest questions, such as "Why is life so hard?" As we talked over dinner one night, I prayed like a missionary for the right things to say. After all, our children are our most important investigators. In the very moment, I received a prompting about "gravitational pull." I grabbed a paper napkin and drew a sketch I'd never thought of before. It sparked a lively discussion. I felt so close to her that night. She is the child of our covenant, and Iwant to be <i>with her</i> always.<br><br>I'd like to share with you today the ideas from that sketch on the napkin. Let's just pretend that you and I and my wife, Marie, are in some cozy Italian restaurant here in Provo and I've been lucky enough to find a white napkin with no tomato sauce on it. Let's call this sketch "a disciple's journey."<br><h2><b>A Disciple's Journey</b></h2><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br><img class="alignnone wp-image-10411" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/jpg/image001.jpg" alt="image001" width="591" height="445" /><br><br>A disciple moves from darkness into light, which increases from the dim light of the stars to the moon and then to the brightness of the sun. Joseph Smith compared these heavenly bodies with the telestial, terrestrial, and celestial kingdoms. As the temple teaches, we can and should move toward that celestial light during mortality. We need not be <i>of</i> the world, even if we must live <i>in</i> the world.<br><br>Imagine that two vertical lines separate the stars, moon, and sun into three sections. Each line suggests a major transition as we move from one stage to the next. However, our journey is not rigidly sequential. Our experiences may move us back and forth.<br><br>Envision also two circles, each with a center point, located in stage one and in stage three. These circles represent the gravitational pull from the opposing poles of our journey. In the darkness of stage one, he who claims to be the god of this world exerts a constant force to hold us back from moving toward the light. As we cross the first barrier, we will leave the strongest satanic tugging--though he will always try to ensnare us wherever we are inthe journey.<br><br>Reaching out from the center of light in stage three, Jesus also "entices" us with a spiritual gravitational pull toward Him. Think of the father of the prodigal son, praying his son home. When the father saw his son coming from afar, the father "had compassion, and ran" to the boy "and fell on his neck, and kissed him."<sup>2</sup><br><br>I compare that father to Christ, who is so eager for our return that He comes to meet and strengthen us all along our way. Nephi wrote, "It is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do."<sup>3</sup> Christ's running to us is a vivid symbol of that grace. We talk often in the Church about coming to Christ. Perhaps we should talk more about how Christ also comes to us. No matter where we are on that path, we are never lost to Him. We often sing "Who's on the Lord's side? Who?"<sup>4</sup> Let us also sing "Be still, my soul: The Lord is on <i>thy side.</i>"<sup>5</sup> We never have more value in the Lord's sight than when we are feeling completely worthless.<br><br>Various terms describe this process. Mormon called a disciple a "true follower" of Christ<sup>6</sup>--one who follows the Son to return to the Father. Moroni said, "Come unto Christ, and be perfected in him."<sup>7</sup> Jesus asked, "What manner of men ought ye to be? ... Even as I am."<sup>8</sup> Our Primary children sing "I'm trying to be like Jesus."<sup>9</sup> Whatever we call it, this journey isthe gospel's central concern.<br><br>Some non-LDS observers of our Church think we haven't made this concept very clear. One of them said that while Mormons emphasize "Christ's dying for humanity," they don't go on and "link the atonement to that part of the [LDS] 'plan of salvation' that involves progression toward godhood."<sup>10</sup> In other words, she thinks we haven't explained what the Atonement has to do with becoming like Jesus.<br><br>Another prominent observer recently chided us for not explaining in a public way what he called our "doctrine of the perfectibility of mankind into divine form."<sup>11</sup> In fact, however, the Restoration answers these questions with stunning clarity.<br><h2><b>Initiation</b></h2><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br><img class="alignnone wp-image-10412" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/jpg/image003.jpg" alt="image003" width="555" height="416" /><br><br>As an act of will, we must take the first step that initiates our journey. Some people take that initiative through their own desire to find and follow God. Think of Nephi, a believer who wanted to see what his father saw.<sup>12</sup> Think of Abraham, who desired "to be a greater follower of righteousness."<sup>13</sup><br><br>Some who live worldly ways finally decide they've had enough of Satan's darkness, like the prodigal son, who "came to himself" and headed for home.<sup>14 </sup> Some, like Enos or young Alma, start moving when they remember the teachings of their parents. Many others initiate their journey when they accept a missionary's invitation to "come and see."<sup>15</sup><br><br>Often the Lord gives us a nudge by "calling" us, perhaps to serve a mission, inviting us to become what Mormon called "a disciple of Jesus Christ" who is "called of him to declare his word among his people."<sup>16</sup> Mormon referred to his own Church calling as a "gift,"<sup>17</sup> probably because he discovered that his calling gave him experiences that let him truly come to know Christ. However we get started, the choice to begin this journey is an act of will. God Himself cannot and would not force us totake that step.<br><h2><b>Opposition</b></h2><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br><img class="alignnone wp-image-10413" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/jpg/image005.jpg" alt="image005" width="556" height="416" /><br><br>But as soon as you start moving toward the light, the gravitational pull of darkness will immediately try to jerk you back, "for Satan desireth to have you."<sup>18</sup> He will tempt, frighten, and fight you. Missionaries know all about this. In some way, opposition hits virtually every investigator. The first time Adam and Eve taught their children the gospel, for example, Satan came among them, saying, "Don't believe your parents." And so the children, we're told, "believed [them] not, and they loved Satan more than God. And men began from that time forth to be carnal, sensual, and devilish."<sup>19</sup> ("From that time forth" tells us that these children <i>chose</i> to be devilish after the Fall, after they heard that message. They were not born devilish.)<br><br>Satanic opposition does have great power in today's world. Satan holds "a great chain in his hand," which symbolizes such addictions as drugs, alcohol, and pornography--and the prince of darkness looks up and laughs at the poor souls he captures.<sup>20</sup><br><br>But that opposition cannot destroy us. Remember Joseph praying in the grove: an enemy power, he said, bound his tongue so he "could not speak."<sup>21</sup> Remember Moses when he first saw his grand vision: "Satan came tempting him" until Moses feared exceedingly, and "he saw the bitterness of hell."<sup>22</sup> But both Joseph and Moses called upon God, who gave them power to drive Satan away. That is a key insight: Satan may rattle us, but he cannot overcome us, for God can cast him from our presence.<br><br>Lehi said, "It must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things."<sup>23</sup> So wherever you are on your journey, there will always be a reason not to go on. Don't wait until all the obstacles disappear. The purely rational mind will always find a good reason to hold back, for Satan places those obstacles in our path. But opposition can strengthen us, not stop us. The skills of human growth are best "learned slowly against difficulty."<sup>24</sup><br><h2><b>First Sacrifice</b></h2><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br><img class="alignnone wp-image-10414" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/jpg/image007.jpg" alt="image007" width="540" height="404" /><br><br>When an investigator breaks free from the worldly pull enough to repent and make serious covenants with God, he or she is ready for baptism--the clearest symbol of the first barrier of sacrifice. This sacrifice requires, at a minimum, giving up the most obvious sins. As King Lamoni's father said, "I will give away all my sins to know thee."<sup>25</sup> By giving up short-term pleasures, he could find far more lasting satisfactions.<br><br>This sacrifice asks us to live the most basic temporal commandments, like tithing and the Word of Wisdom--which is "adapted to the capacity of the ... weakest of [those who] can be called saints."<sup>26</sup> Often these are physical temptations. In the Judean wilderness, Satan first taunted the hungering Christ to make bread and eat.<sup>27</sup><br><br>For Church members who want to become serious disciples, the sacrament represents this first level of sacrifice. They also commit not only to give away their sins but also to remember Him and to follow Him until they know Him.<br><br>These early sacrifices do fix one's feet on a disciple's path. For example, when Elder Neal A. Maxwell was an 18-year-old infantryman fighting on the island of Okinawa, he faced the most frightening night of his life. As enemy mortar shells began exploding ever closer to his foxhole, he knelt in the mud and pledged his life to the Lord if only he could be spared.<br><br>God answered his prayer. But soon afterward, days of hot, rainy weather turned Okinawa into a giant mud puddle. The supply trucks could seldom bring the soldiers food or water. They became unbearably thirsty. One historian said the only thing that saved those soldiers from thirst was coffee, boiled and hand carried from distant supply points. Neal wrote his parents a card, saying he was keeping all the commandments, but he wrote, "The coffee is tempting some times."<sup>28</sup> That wasn't about the smell. He was constantly thirsty, but he wouldn't drink the coffee. He had committed otherwise. He did find a way to get just a little water. He said he caught rainwater in his helmet to bless his sacrament each week. Young Neal Maxwell knew that God had heard him, and he showed his gratitude by sacrifice. His disciple's journey gained traction in the mud of Okinawa.<br><br>As a young missionary, Elder Gordon Hinckley found himself in a foxhole of a different sort. From the spiritual trenches of England, he became so discouraged that he wrote his father he might as well come home.<br><br>His father wrote back: "Dear Gordon, I have your recent letter. I have only one suggestion: forget yourself and go to work."<sup>29</sup><br><br>Stung by that counsel, Gordon Hinckley threw himself into the work. After his mission, his mission president sent him to tell the First Presidency why they needed better missionary materials. That visit to Church headquarters was supposed to last 15 minutes and ended up lasting over 70 years. Gordon B. Hinckley's entire life was about forgetting himself and going to work. His willingness to sacrifice kept his feet moving on a disciple's path.<br><h2><b>Forgiveness and the Holy Ghost</b></h2><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br><img class="alignnone wp-image-10415" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/jpg/image009.jpg" alt="image009" width="530" height="397" /><br><br>Repentance and forgiveness eliminate the rubbish and the bad habits that can hold us captive in the worldly orbit. But we can receive the Holy Ghost as a constant companion only <i>after</i> being cleansed by water. Christ told the Nephites to "be baptized in my name, [so] that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost."<sup>30</sup> Receiving the Holy Ghost is the baptism by fire, which truly begins the process of becoming like Jesus--meaning, to become saintly, or sanctified.<br><br>Let's clarify a point here that we sometimes miss. Some describe the entire spiritual growth process as faith, repentance, baptism, and the Holy Ghost--as if once we've received the Holy Ghost, the hard work is done and our exaltation is assured, so long as we don't do something seriously wrong. "Endure to the end," we say, as if that means relaxing in some eternal rocking chair. God will just reel us in, like a fish hooked on a line. But it's not quite that simple.<br><br>On the contrary, receiving the Holy Ghost marks the <i>beginning</i> of our real spiritual growth, not the <i>end</i> of it. Baptism and the Holy Ghost only let us enter "in by the gate."<sup>31</sup> Then the Holy Ghost leads us along the "strait and narrow path"<sup>32</sup> of becoming sanctified disciples--not as passive spectators but by our straining every spiritual muscle, drinking in the power of temple ordinances, and feasting actively on Christ's words to nourish us in becoming ever more holy.<sup>33</sup> And the long-term goal of that journey is to become like Him.<br><br>Does the Atonement have anything to do with this higher, developmental part of the journey or is it limited to the forgiveness part? Moroni taught that Christ's grace helps us move well beyond forgiveness toward becoming like Him, or sanctified. He wrote, "Come unto Christ, and be perfected in him."<sup>34</sup><br><br>So, after weeding out our worldly ways, Christ's perfecting grace helps us replace those weeds with the divine flowers of Christlike attributes. You might say He wants to plant a garden in us. But we must satisfy certain conditions for this growth to occur, just as we had to satisfy the condition of repentance in order to receive forgiveness. The next steps in our journey illustrate those conditions.<br><h2><b>Eye Single to God</b></h2><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br><img class="alignnone wp-image-10416" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/jpg/image011.jpg" alt="image011" width="544" height="407" /><br><br>Describing a disciple's journey from darkness into light, the Lord told the early Saints: "And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you."<sup>35</sup> Having an eye single to God is then just one condition we must meet before the Atonement can bless us with the attributes of divinity. As Moroni said, "Touch not the evil gift, nor the unclean thing ... and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; ... then are ye sanctified."<sup>36</sup><br><br>But that is hard to do today, because modern culture is saturated with being double-minded and indulging in unclean things. I heard President Hinckley once say that prosperity leads to indulgence, and indulgence leads to sin. Indulgence means gratifying our vain desires in the proud belief that we deserve to have it all, so we keep one hand on the wall of the temple and one foot on the dance floor atClub Babylon.<br><br>Every day we hear messages of indulgence like "Pampering yourself like thisisn't just indulgent, it's decadent--but you deserve it." I saw a billboard in Utah recently: "Modesty has never been sexier." Talk about double-mindedness. We live in a society that seems to have no higher aim than its own indulgent satisfactions.<br><br>Many people feel they have a right to indulge themselves: eating too much, spending too much, and reveling in creature comforts. But, as one friend said, if you don't get out of your comfort zone, you won't learn. And if you don't learn, you won't grow. And without growth, you won't find joy. That's a high price to pay for indulging in self-satisfied comfort--no growth and no joy.<br><br>Today's flood of pornography usually results from overindulgence. But note this irony. Alma told his son, "Bridle all your passions." Why? So "that ye may be filled with love."<sup>37</sup> Pornography addictions can destroy marriages, shattering the true romantic dream of eternal love. Imagine that! Fake love can destroy real love. What a cheap and dirty trick! And worse, yielding to porn is a classic example of touching the unclean thing, of refusing to deny oneself of ungodliness. This double-mindedness has consequences: We cannot then be perfected in Christ--not because He lacks the power but because we just lack the discipline. Thank heaven repentance can restore discipline.<br><h2><b>Second Sacrifice</b></h2><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br><img class="alignnone wp-image-10417" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/jpg/image013.jpg" alt="image013" width="550" height="412" /><br><br>As we approach the second barrier of sacrifice, we move symbolically from the moon to the sun. All of the moon's light is reflected from the sun--it is borrowed light. Heber C. Kimball used to say that when life's greatest tests come, those who are living on borrowed light--the testimonies of others--will not be able to stand.<sup>38</sup> We need our own access to the light of the Son.<br><br>Baptism represents the first sacrifice. The temple endowment represents the second sacrifice. The first sacrifice was about breaking out of Satan's orbit. The second one is about breaking fully into Christ's orbit, pulled by His gravitational power. The first sacrifice was mostly about giving up temporal things. The second one is about consecrating ourselves spiritually, holding back nothing. As Elder Maxwell said, the only thing we can give the Lord that He didn't already give us is our own will.<sup>39</sup> Seeking to be meek and lowly, disciples gladly offer God their will. As our children sing, "I feel my Savior's love. . . . / He knows I will follow him, / Give all my life to him."<sup>40</sup> And then what happens? In President Benson's words, "When obedience ceases to be an irritant and becomes our quest, in that moment God will endow us with power."<sup>41</sup><br><h2><b>Divine Tutorial</b></h2><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br><img class="alignnone wp-image-10418" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/jpg/image015.jpg" alt="image015" width="538" height="403" /><br><br>As we feel the power of Christ's love pulling us toward Him, we anticipate the joy of His promise: "Be faithful and diligent ..., and I will encircle thee in the arms of my love."<sup>42</sup> He reflected that affection in the way He addressed Joseph Smith. During Joseph's early years, Christ called him "my servant Joseph."<sup>43</sup> But as Joseph's life took paths marked by consecration and hardship, the Lord said, "From henceforth I shall call you friends."<sup>44</sup> What's the difference between a servant and a friend? The Lord had earlier said that a servant does not know what his lord does. But, He said, "I have called you <i>friends;</i> for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you."<sup>45</sup><br><br>So the Lord's "friends" feel His increased confidence in them, but they also discover, paradoxically, that His tutorial asks more of them, not less. Is it possible that the closer we come to Christ, the more aware we will be of what we yet need to do? Yes, for He said, "<i>If</i> men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness [and] <i>if</i> they <i>humble themselves</i> before me ..., then will I make weak things become strong unto them."<sup>46</sup> So if we are becoming more aware of our weaknesses, that doesn't mean we are drifting away from Him; it may well mean that we are drawing closer. Like a good coach, a good tutor will always help his students see their mistakes and correct them. When we understand that, correction is motivating, not discouraging. For because of the Atonement, we can learn from our mistakes without being condemned by them.<br><br>The paradox of this divine tutorial also includes afflictions of some kind. Because Elder Maxwell was such a faithful student of discipleship, I draw again from him: "The very act of choosing to be a disciple ... can bring to us a certain special suffering," because affliction and chastening are "a form of learning as it is administered at the hands of a loving Father."<sup>47</sup> He also said, "If we are serious about our discipleship, Jesus will eventually request each of us to do those very things which are most difficult for us to do."<sup>48</sup> And so, he said, "sometimes the best people ... have the worst experiences ... because they are the most ready to learn."<sup>49</sup><br><br>After Elder Maxwell learned he had the leukemia that eventually took his life, he said, "I should have seen it coming." Why? Because ever since Okinawa he had wanted to become a fully consecrated follower of Jesus--no matter what the price. And the more he desired the gift of charity--to love as Christ loves--the more he sensed how dear the price might be. Christ's love is so deep that He took upon Himself the sins and afflictions of all mankind. Only in that way could He both pay for our sins and empathize with us enough to truly succor us--that is, run to us--with so much empathy that we can have complete confidence that He fully understands our sorrows. So, to love as Christ loves means we will somehow taste suffering ourselves--for the love and the affliction are but two sides of the same coin. Only by experiencing both sides can we understand and love other people with a depth that even approaches Christ's love.<br><h2><b>Sanctification</b></h2><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br><img class="alignnone wp-image-10419" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/jpg/image017.jpg" alt="image017" width="557" height="417" /><br><br>Finally, sanctification is the stage when we are not only with God but like God--for only those who have become like Him can be with Him. Jesus said, "It is enough for the disciple that he <i>be</i> as his master."<sup>50</sup> This state of being is the hope, the vision, and the heart of a disciple's journey. Our deepest desire is, in the words of both John and Mormon, that "when he shall appear, we shall be like him."<sup>51</sup><br><br>Being like Him means we possess His divine attributes, such as charity. Do we develop charity by our own power or is it a gift from God? It is both. In the current BYU vernacular, we must be "fully invested" in Him--as He is fully invested in us. Only then will God "bestow" charity "upon all who are true followers of his Son."<sup>52</sup> We can't develop a Christlike love by ourselves, but we <i>can</i> do all in our power to become a "true follower"--meek, lowly of heart, and submissive to correction and affliction. Then the Comforter, the Holy Ghost, "filleth" us "with hope and perfect love, which ... endureth [forever], when all the saints shall dwell with God."<sup>53</sup><br><br>On that day we will no longer be God's "servants," or even just His "friends." In Liberty Jail, Joseph Smith suffered so much that he learned both the affliction side and the charity side of Christ's love for him and for the Saints. Then Joseph was not just the Lord's <i>servant</i> or even His <i>friend.</i> Rather, God addressed him this way: "<i>My son,</i> peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment."<sup>54</sup> Christ also invites us to grow from servant to friend to God's son or daughter--and then we are joint heirs with Christ. Then we will receive all that the Father hath and be all that the Father is.<br><br>I talked earlier about our daughter. I said I want to be "with her" always. For me, the words <i>with you</i> capture the Atonement's meaning in its simplest terms. If we do our part, Christ makes us "at one" <i>with</i> God, overcoming whatever separates us from Him. He is with me, <i>with you,</i> not only at the end of our lives but every day of our lives. And without Christ we could not be "with" our family and our friends. Once our daughter Emily had to leave her three-year-old boy Clark with a babysitter. As she began leaving, little Clark ran to her and cried poignantly, "Go <i>with</i> you, Mom. <i>With</i> you." No longing runs deeper in usthan our desire to be <i>with</i> those we love.<br><br>"With you" echoes Harriet Beecher Stowe's lines: "Still, still <i>with Thee,</i>" which anticipates our return to God's presence. Still, still <i>with</i> Thee. Still--always; and still--quiet. Like still water, the doctrine of Christ's peace runs deep, and it deserves to be held in the most reverent spaces in our hearts. And for me, "still with Thee" means being not only <i>with</i> Jesus but also <i>with</i> Marie, <i>with</i> our family, always. My heart has no greater desire. On that day of celestial reunion we will fully comprehend what it means to be there, together--something we would never understand without that long, hard journey in the earth school. I believe we will gasp as we realize we are actually there, in <i>that</i> place, sensing "the glorious thought, I am with Thee!"<br><br>Soon after Sister Hinckley's death, President Hinckley confided in all of us at general conference: "Before I married her, she had been the girl of my dreams. ... And now in my old age, she has again become the girl of my dreams."<sup>55</sup> Can you imagine the reunion now, beyond the veil? He is again with his Marjorie; with his gifted mother, Ada, who died when he was 20; and with his father, Bryant, who wrote that life-changing letter about going to work.<br><br>I testify that Gordon B. Hinckley will always be with the girl of his dreams, for I know that Jesus is the Christ, the great Uniter, the Atoning One. Because of what He did, we too can be <i>with</i> Him; <i>with</i> our dearest ones--still, always, to go no more out. I am so grateful for this heavenly gift.<br><br>Let us close now with the hymn "Still, Still with Thee," sung by the BYU Singers--amusical tribute to President and Sister Hinckley and to the supernal doctrine their example taught us with such power: "with you" is forever.<br><br>The choir will sing these words:<br><br><i>Still, still</i> with Thee,<br><i>when purple morning breaketh,</i><br><i>When the bird waketh and the shadows flee;</i><br><i>Fairer than morning, lovelier than the daylight,</i><br><i>Dawns the sweet consciousness, I am with Thee!</i><br><br>. . . . . . . . . . .<br><br><i>So shall it be at last, in that bright morning</i><br><i>When the soul waketh and life's shadows flee;</i><br><i>Oh, in that hour fairer than daylight dawning,</i><br><i>Shall rise the glorious thought, I am</i> with Thee!<sup>56</sup><br><br>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Bruce C.

<h1>the Savior - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Over the past two weeks, we have seen an outpouring of love on the Brigham Young University campus. When we learned of the death of President Gordon B. Hinckley, students set up spontaneous memorials expressing their love for him. And when the reorganization of the First Presidency was announced last week, our hearts reached out in love to President Thomas S. Monson and his counselors.<br><h2><b>Charity: The Love of the Savior</b></h2><br>Love is a central principle in the gospel of Jesus Christ (see Joseph B. Wirthlin, "The Great Commandment," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2007, 28–31). Often asked why people who joined the Church remained loyal to him, the Prophet Joseph Smith explained, "It is because I possess the principle of love. All I can offer the world is a good heart and a good hand" (<i>HC</i> 5:498).<br><br>A young man who knew the Prophet Joseph Smith later recalled an occasion when<br><br><i>Joseph and some of the young men were playing various out-door games, among which was a game of ball. By and by they began to get weary. He saw it, and calling them together he said: "Let us build a log cabin." So off they went, Joseph and the young men, to build a log cabin for a widow woman.</i> [Edwin Holden, in "Recollections of the Prophet Joseph Smith," <i>Juvenile Instructor</i> 27, no. 5 (1 March 1892): 153]<br><br>On other occasions after playing ball with the boys, the Prophet gathered up the players and sent them out to chop and deliver wood to the needy (see Mosiah Lyman Hancock, page 22 of Autobiography, typescript, LDS Church Archives, Salt Lake City; also in <i>They Knew the Prophet,</i> comp. Hyrum L. Andrus and Helen Mae Andrus [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1974], 103).<br><br>This kind love for others is a gift from God called charity (see 1 Corinthians 13). It is the love of the Savior (see Moroni 7:46–47).<br><h2><b>A Pattern of the Savior's Love</b></h2><br>In the worldwide leadership training meeting this past Saturday (9 February 2008), Elder Jeffrey R. Holland shared what he called the parable of the homemade shirt. When he was young his mother would sometimes sew shirts for him. She did her best work when she followed a pattern. Without a pattern, a shirt might end up with errors. Elder Holland drew from this story the parallel that the gospel of Jesus Christ provides essential patterns for our lives to follow. Deviation from the gospel pattern is likely to result in error.<br><br>For example, romantic love is wonderful, but our society distorts romance beyond proportion. It is as if a clean, white shirt has been tie-dyed and tailored to the point of immodesty. It ends up fitting no one. No wonder so many end up disappointed! When it comes to love, we can take our measurements from a higher standard. The perfect pattern of love was taught by the Lord Jesus Christ: "Love one another; as I have loved you" (John 13:34).<br><br>There are countless patterns in the holy scriptures that can teach us about the love of the Savior, but today we will focus on only one pattern:<br><br>1. God first loves us.<br><br>2. We then turn to Him for healing and instruction.<br><br>3. He then sends us to love and serve others.<br><br>Not specific to romantic love, this pattern applies to a variety of circumstances that range from missionary service to marriage.<br><br>Let's turn to the scriptures for three examples of this pattern. First, consider the story of the prophet Enos. He said, "I went to hunt beasts in the forests; and the words which I had often heard my father speak concerning eternal life, and the joy of the saints, sunk deep into my heart" (Enos 1:3).<br><br>First, Enos recognized God's love for him and his people and opened his heart to God. Next, Enos turned to God and was healed. Enos said:<br><br><i>And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul; and all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the night came I did still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens.</i><br><br><i>And there came a voice unto me, saying: Enos, thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed.</i> [Enos 1:4–5]<br><br>Enos prayed for his own soul and received remission of his sins. As soon as he was healed, Enos turned his thoughts to others. He said:<br><br><i>Now, it came to pass that when I had heard these words I began to feel a desire for the welfare of my brethren, the Nephites; wherefore, I did pour out my whole soul unto God for them. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . And I prayed unto him with many long strugglings for my brethren, the Lamanites.</i> [Enos 1:9, 11]<br><br>First, Enos recognized God's love as it had been manifested through His words and through the joy He gave to Enos' people. Then Enos opened his heart to God and received healing forgiveness. When he was healed, Enos turned to serve others.<br><br>A second example of the pattern is found in the prophet Lehi's vision of the tree of life. Here are Lehi's own words:<br><br><i>I beheld myself that I was in a dark and dreary waste.</i><br><br><i>And after I had traveled for the space of many hours in darkness, I began to pray unto the Lord that he would have mercy on me.</i> [1 Nephi 8:7–8]<br><br>First, Lehi was alone, until he remembered the Lord and His loving mercy. Next, Lehi turned to God and received of His love, which is represented by the tree of life. Lehi said, "After I had prayed unto the Lord . . . I beheld a tree, whose fruit was desirable to make one happy. And it came to pass that I did go forth and partake of the fruit thereof" (1 Nephi 8:9–11).<br><br>Lehi came to the tree of life and was filled with joy. This healing prompted him to remember his family. He said:<br><br><i>Wherefore, I began to be desirous that my family should partake of it also. . . .</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that I beckoned unto them; and I also did say unto them with a loud voice that they should come unto me, and partake of the fruit.</i> [1 Nephi 8:12, 15; see also verses 7–11]<br><br>Lehi and his family were in darkness. They were brought to the tree of life, which represents the love of God. Those who partook of the fruit were filled with joy, and they consecrated their lives to the Lord.<br><br>A third example of this pattern comes from the mission of the four sons of Mosiah who left their homes to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ among their enemies, the Lamanites. As a result of this mission, many Lamanites received the Lord's love, turned to Him, were healed, and then consecrated themselves to lives of service and peace (see Alma 26:33). As we can see, the pattern of love works the same for individuals (as in the case of Enos), for families (as in the case of Lehi), and for entire societies (as in the case of the Lamanites who believed the sons of Mosiah).<br><br>In a way, the pattern also follows Elder Oaks' counsel to wisely choose activities based on the classifications of "good, better, and best" (see Dallin H. Oaks, "Good, Better, Best," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2007, 104–8). It is good to believe that the Savior Jesus Christ loves us. It is better to turn to Him and be healed. It is best to love as He loves, giving all we have to others.<br><h2><b>With Hands of Love</b></h2><br>In the scriptures, the term <i>heart</i> sometimes refers to love, but the term <i>hand</i> is also used to signify love. Whereas <i>heart</i> refers to a feeling, <i>hand</i> refers to an act of giving--putting into action our feelings of love. In that sense, the image of an outreached hand symbolizes atype of love spoken of in the scriptures.<br><br>Using His hands, the Lord reaches out to us in love, heals us, and then sets us apart in His service. For example, the Apostle John recorded that after the Resurrection, the Savior appeared to the Apostles, "shewed unto them his hands," and then set them apart, saying, "As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you" (John 20:20–21).<br><br>The same pattern occurred when the Savior appeared to the Nephites (see 3 Nephi 11–28). First, He showed them His hands, then He healed their sick, and then He ordained disciples to minister unto others.<br><h2><b>Recognition and Coming unto Him</b></h2><br>We face many challenges in life. You have experienced heartache and struggles known only to you and God. Says the Lord, "As the clay is in the potter's hand, so are ye in mine hand" (Jeremiah 18:6). For you it might be the darkest night, but "his arm of mercy is extended towards you in the light of the day" (Jacob 6:5).<br><br>No matter what your struggle, you can seek His love. No matter what your heartache, you can feel His love right now, for "he healeth the broken in heart" (Psalm 147:3). And when we are healed, we say, "But now, O Lord, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand" (Isaiah 64:8).<br><br>When we receive God's love, we become willing to submit to His will (see Mosiah 3:19). It is immediately after we say to our Father "Into thine hand I commit my spirit" (Psalm 31:5) that we are taken from the pain of this world and transformed by Him in a "mighty change" of heart (Mosiah 5:2; Alma 5:14).<br><h2><b>Testimony</b></h2><br>In heartache I have cried out for Him. And I have felt the love of the Savior. I know of His grace. He is love (see 1 John 4:7). "The mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting" (Psalm 103:17). Through His Atonement, we are healed (see Isaiah 53:5). And when we are healed, He turns our hearts to others (see Matthew 10:8).<br><br>He reaches out to us. That is how the Savior works. It is His work and His glory (see Moses 1:39). When we submit our will to Him (see James 4:6–8), we receive the greatest gift of all (see Psalm 138:7; 1 Nephi 15:35; Alma 32:42; D&amp;amp;C 14:7).<br><h2><b>Progressing from Receiving to Giving</b></h2><br>We do struggle in this life, but the pattern of our Savior's love accounts for our limitations and growth over time. He works with us according to our abilities and needs, which change across every stage of life.<br><br>As children, we need to receive--we need to be loved. As we grow older we gain a personal witness of God, and we need forgiveness as we hurt ourselves and others. As adults, we shoulder responsibilities in our families and communities. The pattern reflects our own progression--we received as children; when we are healed, we give as adults.<br><br>Our Father in Heaven invites us, His children, to give: "Give, and it shall be given unto you" (Luke 6:38); "Freely ye have received, freely give" (Matthew 10:8). Said the Psalmist, "Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, . . . I will lift up my hands in thy name" (Psalm 63:3–4). Our hands become His when we labor in His name.<br><br>You can lift up your hands to serve. You have gifts to give. What are they? As President Thomas S. Monson has done, you might follow the Savior's pattern of love by visiting "thesick and the afflicted" (D&amp;amp;C 52:40) and "the fatherless and widows" (James 1:27). Whatever your inclinations might be, the BYU Center for Service and Learning offers dozens of service opportunities, at least one of which will be suited to your needs. I hope we overwhelm them with requests! Chances are you already know someone in your family who needs you or someone who needs the truths ofthe gospel.<br><br>Both missionary service and marriage also qualify as service-learning opportunities! Because marriage and missionary service might be on the mind of at least one person here, they deserve further consideration.<br><h2><b>Missions: Labors of Love</b></h2><br>First, missionary service. A member of our ward, Sister Sharon Paulsen, received the missionaries into her home 13 years ago, and the gospel transformed her life. She sought to do all she could to further missionary work. So for 10 years she has served as a cook at the Missionary Training Center--chances are, many of you have been blessed by her service. Although her offering may have begun as the equivalent of five loaves and two fishes (see John 6:9), her hands have become His in feeding the thousands.<br><br>Like the four sons of Mosiah, once we have been healed by the Savior, our desire for others to receive that same joy motivates our actions (see Mosiah 28:1–5). When the love of the Savior is our motive, we become missionaries, full-time or not.<br><br>Said Elder M. Russell Ballard:<br><br><i>Some members say, "I'm afraid to share the gospel because I might offend someone." Experience has shown that people are not offended when the sharing is motivated by the spirit of love and concern. How could anyone be offended when we say something like this: "I love the way my church helps me" and then add whatever the Spirit directs. It's when we appear only to be fulfilling an assignment and we fail to express real interest and love that we offend others.</i> [M. Russell Ballard, "The Essential Role of Member Missionary Work," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2003, 39–40]<br><br>Our niece, who is currently serving in the North Carolina Raleigh Mission, recently shared with us that her goal is to see everyone she encounters as her literal brother or sister. She said that perspective has made all the difference in her work. Missionary service "requires genuine love" (Ballard, "Essential Role," 39). We may be called to serve, but we cannot truly serve without that qualification. Charity and love qualify us for the work (see D&amp;amp;C 4:5).<br><br>Having that qualification, missionaries fulfill the Lord's request: "Let them lift up their voice and declare my word . . . , lifting up holy hands upon them. For I am able to make you holy" (D&amp;amp;C 60:7). Missionaries follow the pattern of the Lord. They help others first to receive His love, then to turn to Him and be healed, and then to commit the remainder of their lives to His service.<br><h2><b>Marriage</b></h2><br>For the person still thinking about marriage, it's now your turn to listen. The thirteenth article of faith makes the claim "If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things." We seek after marriage! But what kind of marriage? We often hear people speak of "eternal marriage" or "temple marriage," but what kind of marriage is that? Said Elder Marlin K. Jensen:<br><br><i>Eternal marriage is godlike marriage. The term</i> eternal <i>describes the quality of marriage as much as its duration. What type of marriage would our God have?</i> [Marlin K. Jensen, "A Union of Love and Understanding," <i>Ensign,</i> October 1994, 51]<br><br>If we have this perspective in mind when we speak of temple marriage, then we will worry less about the reception decorations and focus more on core values, such as those concluding the Young Women theme: "[Being] prepared to strengthen home and family, make and keep sacred covenants, receive the ordinances of the temple, and enjoy the blessings ofexaltation."<br><br>Let me tell you about a young couple wholived that way. Amy met her sweetheart, Curtis, in the Clyde Building on campus, where they both took engineering classes. Curtis was a returned missionary who was serving in his elders quorum. He loved the Savior, and Amy knew it because of the ways he served others and how he lived his life. They were sealed in the Mount Timpanogos Temple, and Curtis continued to serve Amy, and later their daughter, in countless little ways. Family came first, balanced with responsibilities as a student, a counselor in a BYU freshman ward bishopric, and a member of the BYU Ultimate Frisbee team. As Curtis was traveling to Canada with the BYU team, there was an accident and he was killed. Amy and Curtis' marriage is eternal: not because he died but because of how he lived--serving others and honoring his temple covenants.<br><br>Regarding his own marriage, President Gordon B. Hinckley said:<br><br><i>In our long life together I cannot remember a serious quarrel. . . .</i><br><br><i>If every husband and every wife would constantly do whatever might be possible to ensure the comfort and happiness of his or her companion, there would be very little, if any, divorce.</i> [Gordon B. Hinckley, "The Women in Our Lives," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2004, 82, 84]<br><br>Another example of such dedication in marriage comes from a woman I know who was an English major at BYU. She met her sweetheart in Provo and corresponded with him throughout his mission to Germany and then throughout her own mission, also to Germany--three and a half years of writing letters! They were sealed in the Provo Temple a few months before their graduation from BYU. Even though they would be attending graduate school, they desired to have children immediately, but they were unable to do so. The wife later lamented, "My poor husband! For six years he thought marriage meant hearing me cry every night!"<br><br>Eventually they were able to adopt a baby boy. Two years later they adopted a baby girl, then another boy, and later another girl. After so many years of heartache, they were constantly caring for children, but that was not the end. After undergoing additional treatments, they learned they were going to have triplets! Months of bed rest to prevent premature delivery were followed by months of constant devotion to the needs of the tiny infants. The couple then had seven children eight years old and younger! Through years of heartache, this sister had actively sought the love of the Lord. Eventually she was healed, and she dedicated her life to serving her family. That dedication did not begin when she first held a child in her arms. It began when, as BYU students, she and her future husband determined their life's priorities and then went forward, no matter the cost.<br><br>Anciently, devotion to God was demonstrated through daily sacrifices performed in the temple upon a holy altar (see Numbers 28:24). Today, eternal devotion in marriage begins within the temple across a holy altar--and sacrifices are still a daily requirement.<br><br>Marriage "is ordained of God" ("The Family: A Proclamation to the World," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1995, 102), perfectly designed for us to increase in our capacity to love because marriage requires sacrifice. President Howard W. Hunter said, "We need to love one another with the pure love of Christ, . . . and, if necessary, shared suffering, for that is the way God loves us" ("Come to the God of All Truth," <i>Ensign,</i> September 1994, 72).<br><br>There is joy in marriage, joy in missionary service, and joy whenever we reach out with the love of the Lord (see Philippians 2:17, D&amp;amp;C 132:19).<br><h2><b>A Pattern of Love with Christ at the Center</b></h2><br>The pattern of love presented today is but one of many found in the holy scriptures, and, like most patterns, it points us to Christ.<br><br>As we receive God's love, our faith motivates us to repent. The Atonement of Jesus Christ makes healing possible (see Alma 42:15), and we are born again--born of the water and of the Spirit through baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost (see Moses 6:59). The Holy Ghost prompts us to give to others by consecrating our talents and time for their benefit. Priesthood--"the perfect plan of service" (Stephen L Richards, <i>CR,</i> April 1937, 46)--and temple covenants enable eventual sanctification.<br><br>Christ is at the center of the pattern. He is atthe beginning and at the end (see D&amp;amp;C 19:1). He is the pattern of love we follow (see John 14:6).<br><h2><b>Invitation to Apply the Pattern of Love</b></h2><br>Whether we are single, married, or serving as a missionary, we can apply His pattern to our lives through active planning (see L. Tom Perry, "The Great Plan of Our God," BYU devotional, 30 October 2007). Think about your schedule this week. When will you make time to serve others? Many people can be blessed by your love. Who can you help? So what if you receive no valentines? How many valentines will you give? Like the Prophet Joseph Smith, when we possess the principle of love, what we offer is a good heart and a good hand.<br><h2><b>Patterns of Love at BYU</b></h2><br>To my way of thinking, Brigham Young University embodies the pattern of Christ's love. Members of the Church who love the Savior give their tithes at some sacrifice so that our lives will be blessed. Through their giving and through the direction of Christ's servants who administer this institution, we are enabled to serve for a lifetime. This university exists through giving and love. Said Elder Jeffrey R. Holland, "We love you and measure that love as we measure the greatness of this school--by the profundity and power of the gospel of Jesus Christ" ("Unless You're a Mormon," BYUdevotional, 9 September 1986).<br><br>We faculty and staff love you students. We seek to turn you to Christ so that you will give of yourselves to others across your lifetime. That is what we all entered BYU to learn--to "go forth to serve." In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Timothy B.

<h1>g the Door to the Blessings of Abraham - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
What a privilege it is to speak to you, a royal generation, who were chosen before the foundation of the world to come forth at this time to do an important work. I have met many of you during my service in the Church, and I have been impressed by your brightness and goodness. I can picture you now in your gatherings all over the world, from the United States, Mexico, Brazil, and other countries in South America to the Philippines, Japan, Korea, and many European countries. I have even seen you arrive at meetings by the truckload in the Dominican Republic.<br><br>We learn in the Book of Mormon that when the rising generation--that's you--are converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ and keep their covenants, then the future is bright for all of the Lord's people. But when the rising generation fails to gain testimonies and take hold of their responsibilities, then the older, more faithful people begin to lose heart (see Mosiah 26:1–4; see also 1 Nephi 8:23). Thank you for your fine lives and the bright future you will bring to me and so many others.<br><br>We are here tonight primarily because we have a testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. Without that testimony there would be no point in going any further with amessage to you. I know that you have a firm belief in our Heavenly Father and in the Savior and in latter-day prophets or you would not have made the effort to attend this meeting. When we know the restored gospel is true, we embrace all of it and not just the parts that are convenient for us. We believe in the plan of our Heavenly Father and all that the prophets and apostles have taught us. I know that as you participate tonight with an open and prayerful heart, the Spirit will convey to each of you some individualized and important teachings.<br><br>As I pondered and prayed to the Lord to learn what He would have me say to you tonight, my thoughts went often to my 79 nieces and nephews. I have walked with them, sung with them, and heard their testimonies. I love them all. I know that each one of them has desires to make a difference for good in the world and have their lives count for something. Twenty-two of those 79 nieces and nephews are single adults in your age-group. Of those 22, 11 of them are currently serving or have served missions, and others are preparing for missions. Some are preparing for marriage. Some have completed school and are searching for their place in the world. All of them have been or are currently furthering their education.<br><br>These nieces and nephews have unique gifts, and among them are those who have had experience with illness, injury, and tragedy. Knowing that in many ways my nieces and nephews are representative of you, I prepared this message with them in mind. In thinking of them, I think of you. Each of you has been, is, or will be in the same places as these nieces and nephews. I have sought inspiration as to how I could be of help to them with some of their questions, and, in doing so, I hope to also be a help to you. I invite all of you to be part of our extended family this evening. I will speak to you as a loving, caring aunt.<br><h2><b>The Blessings of Abraham</b></h2><br>The prophet Abraham experienced the same season of life you are in. We read about it in the Pearl of Great Price: "In the land of the Chaldeans, at the residence of my fathers, I, Abraham, saw that it was needful for me to obtain another place of residence" (Abraham 1:1). Abraham had approached the time to go out on his own and begin his life as an adult. He said he was "a follower of righteousness" and desired to possess "greater knowledge, and to be a father of many nations, a prince of peace" (verse 2). He knew that there was "greater happiness and peace and rest" (verse 2) for him than he currently had.<br><br>Abraham sought for those blessings. He actively desired them. The Lord told Abraham:<br><br><i>I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee above measure, and make thy name great among all nations, and thou shalt be a blessing unto thy seed after thee, that in their hands they shall bear this ministry and Priesthood unto all nations;</i><br><br><i>And I will bless them through thy name; for as many as receive this Gospel shall be called after thy name, and shall be accounted thy seed, and shall rise up and bless thee, as their father;</i><br><br><i>And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse them that curse thee; and in thee . . . and in thy seed ... , for I give unto thee a promise that this right shall continue in thee, and in thy seed after thee ... shall all the families of the earth be blessed, even with the blessings of the Gospel, which are the blessings of salvation, even of life eternal.</i> [Abraham 2:9–11]<br><br>That covenant was reaffirmed through Joseph Smith to us in section 132 of the Doctrine and Covenants (see verses 30–32). These blessings of greater happiness, peace, and rest are the blessings each of us receive as we make covenants in holy temples and form eternal families. Your patriarchal blessings help you understand your personal lineage toAbraham.<br><br>Church leaders often talk to young single adults about seeking those blessings--blessings that can only be found in forming eternal families. Each of you knows that your future happiness, your eternal progress, and the growth of the Lord's kingdom on the earth depend on you forming strong and happy eternal families.<br><br>As faithful Latter-day Saints of the rising generation, most of you have a testimony of your responsibility to marry and have families. You know that you cannot be full recipients of the blessings of Abraham if you are single. But most of you are not going to get married tomorrow. In fact, most of you have no clue yet whom you will marry. So, when we speak about your responsibility to marry, we might be creating feelings of frustration because this important part of your eternal progress is not occurring on your timetable.<br><br>It reminds me of an experience my husband had while playing on a high school basketball team. The players had prepared well and traveled to the gymnasium of their rival team. They were physically and mentally ready to beat their opponents. They were in the locker room, and the coach had just finished his pep talk. They were bursting with energy and confidence as they ran for the door that led onto the playing floor. It was locked! The ballplayers plowed into each other against the door, and their energy went flat in the locker room before the game ever started.<br><br>Sometimes I think that is what happens to you when we talk to you about marriage and family. We encourage you to get excited about the possibilities, but in reality you may feel you are pushing against a locked door. You do not need to live a life of waiting and wondering. You do not need to lose the momentum and enthusiasm that you now have and that the Lord needs from you in order to build Hiskingdom.<br><br>So, let's then focus on four activities you can be doing right now. These activities can be the keys that will help you unlock the door to the blessings of Abraham. The four activities are serving others, sharing the gospel, participating in temple and family history work, and preparing for your future.<br><br>All of these activities invite the Holy Ghost to be your companion. They keep you in the right places, doing the right things with the right people, and they set you apart as disciples of Jesus Christ. By participating in these four activities with your peers, you will form friendships and connections and have the sociality that may help you find someone to marry in the temple and with whom you can create an eternal family.<br><h2><b>Serving Others</b></h2><br>First, serve others. The teen and young adult years are usually times of great self-interest. There are so many decisions to make, and it is easy to be turned inward. The first thing I, as a caring aunt, would encourage you to do is forget yourself. You should probably be participating in fewer activities that are meant merely to entertain when you could and should be finding ways to make life a little easier for someone else.<br><br>The quickest way to find friends, to find happiness, to feel grateful, and to have the companionship of the Spirit is to get on your knees and ask the Lord, "Who needs my help today?" and then begin helping.<br><br>Not long ago I watched a movie about two young adult men who lived in England in the 1800s. These men asked the question "Who needs my help?" They had witnessed the terrible evil of the slave trade and conceived the idea that they could change the world by eliminating the slave trade. This was the ultimate impossible service project. It would mean that they would have to change the entire economy of their country, not to mention the social and ethical codes as well. But these men said, "We can do this!" They concluded that they were so young they did not know that they couldn't do it! It took them some time to finish this project, but they eventually provided this great service to mankind.<br><br>Today, in every country of this world, there are many important causes that could use <i>your</i> energy and vision. All over the world, cities and parks need to be cleaned up. Schools and orphanages need to be built and staffed with volunteers. Governments need help following correct principles. You have the mental, emotional, and physical strength to do these things.<br><br>Many important causes in history have been led by young people. You could serve as individuals or prayerfully organize yourselves in your callings with your single-adult groups, ward and institute groups, and Relief Societies and priesthood quorums; together you would be able to make a difference for good in the world. Most service opportunities are found very close to home, within your families and wards. You are now old enough and mature enough to lead out in planning and organizing these types of activities. You also know how to receive answers to prayers to learn what the Lord would have you do.<br><br>As you look outward, the Spirit will be with you to guide you in all the life-changing decisions you are making because the Spirit always accompanies righteous service. You will not have any trouble finding places to serve. While you serve with your peers, you will form good friendships and have meaningful social experiences. And because your associations and friendships are expanding, there is an increased likelihood for you to find a spouse and form an eternal family.<br><h2><b>Sharing the Gospel</b></h2><br>Second, share the gospel. This world is full of people who do not yet know the good news of the gospel. You are a specially prepared group who can help righteousness and truth sweep the earth.<br><br>Some of you have had the opportunity to be the first missionaries to use <i>Preach My Gospel.</i> With that in mind, those preparing for missions should be some of the most qualified missionaries the world has ever known. Those who are now preparing for missions are better situated than any other generation to be effective from the first day of their missions. Because of your opportunities to this point, you should arrive ready to serve. You should know how to qualify for and receive the help of the Spirit. Also, those who know how to work hard on a daily basis are much happier during their missions. I have enjoyed very much reading letters from missionary nieces and nephews describing the unique challenges and opportunities of their missions. Their letters overflow with vitality and joy. They write about their missions as if they were experiencing the greatest adventures of their lives.<br><br>That fire of sharing the gospel must continue after a mission, and, of course, you great missionaries would never want to put your gospel-sharing skills on the shelf. Because you are single and do not yet have the responsibility of caring for families, you are perfectly situated to continue to share the gospel. Each of you has friends or family members who are not yet converted to the gospel and do not know God as they should. Nearly every ward and branch in the Church has lists of people who, for one reason or another, have stopped coming to renew covenants at sacrament meeting. Your help is essential in bringing them back. In your callings, as friends, or individually, you can take a more proactive approach to preaching the gospel and thus activating those who may have stopped attending.<br><br>I saw an example of this type of missionary work when I was a young girl in Brazil, where my father was serving as a mission president. A few weeks after one of our Brazilian sisters completed her mission, she told my father that she did not see a gospel family in her future because there were no LDS men in her town tomarry.<br><br>Her mission president said, "You have just completed a mission where you taught and converted people to the gospel. Were you a good missionary?"<br><br>"Yes!" she answered.<br><br>"Do you still have the skills and Spirit to share the gospel?"<br><br>"Yes!" she affirmed.<br><br>"Then I suggest you go back to your town. Go to places where good and worthy young people go. Look for a man who has the appearance of a missionary or a future bishop. Become his friend, share the gospel with him, and convert him. You might find a man to marry if you do this."<br><br>The sister did exactly that. She met a man in her town who was worthy and good. She became his friend and shared the gospel with him, and he was baptized. Later they developed a deeper love for each other, and they were married in the temple. He did become a bishop and a stake president and a mission president and a temple president!<br><br>Now, my young friends, I do not suggest that this is a magic formula for finding a husband or wife. Please remember, as this Brazilian sister did, that prophets have repeatedly counseled you to seek marriage partners only among those who are worthy members of the Church. I related the story to illustrate that when you continue to share the gospel after your missions, you are likely to find worthy friends with whom you can enjoy the blessings of the gospel, and those new members could then be part of your group of potential marriage partners.<br><br>If you were to prayerfully organize yourselves in your callings with your single-adult groups, ward and institute groups, and Relief Societies and priesthood quorums, you could be planning and carrying out missionary activities under the direction of priesthood leaders. You are now old enough and mature enough to lead out in planning and organizing these types of activities. The Church needs your energy in this important work. Many children of our Heavenly Father need the gospel message and do not yet know the truth. You have the skills and the testimony to share the gospel. You have the skills and testimony to move the Lord's work forward. You also know how to receive answers to prayers to learn what the Lord would have you do.<br><br>As you share the gospel, the Spirit will be with you to guide you in all the important decisions you are making because the Spirit always accompanies us when we teach and testify of the truth. While you share the gospel with your peers, you will form good friendships and have meaningful social experiences. And because your associations and friendships are expanding and the Spirit is working with you, there is an increased likelihood for you tofind a spouse and form an eternal family.<br><h2><b>Participating in Temple and Family HistoryWork</b></h2><br>Third, participate in temple and family history work. You are the perfectly prepared force to participate in temple and family history work.<br><br>When you were young men and young women, you were given the charge to work on Duty to God and Personal Progress. You remember that those booklets had the image ofthe temple on them. That is because the First Presidency has chosen the temple to be the symbol for the youth of the Church. Women, ifyou earned your medallion, is the temple still a symbol in your life? Are your eyes still on the temple? Men, could you say the same?<br><br>You know that over the centuries many people have died without knowledge of the gospel. Those people are your near and distant relatives. They are waiting for you to do the necessary research to link your families together and perform saving ordinances on their behalf.<br><br>Temple and family history work is aided by some knowledge of technology. It is apparent that you are a specially prepared generation with the technological talent to do this work. My Grandma Bangerter had a deep testimony and feeling of urgency for family history work. Many years ago, when she was compiling 25,000 names of her family, she had to enter each name by hand on the forms. She would have been so grateful for a computer program to help her be more accurate and efficient. Now she has hundreds of talented young people among her descendants who are capable of assisting her from this side of the veil. Your family needs your help. Your ward or branch needs your help in this important activity.<br><br>Most of the temples of the world are not busy enough. The Lord has promised to plant in your hearts the promises given to the fathers and that your hearts would be turned to the fathers so that the earth would not be utterly wasted at His coming (see D&amp;amp;C 2:2–3). Your technical skills are a partial fulfillment of this prophecy, and I hope you are feeling a sense of urgency about this work. You were born in this age to do temple and family history work.<br><br>There are also personal blessings you receive as a result of participation in temple and family history work. One of these is that you are able to qualify for a temple recommend, which signifies your worthiness before the Lord. A temple recommend is actually a symbol of obedience. When you participate with your peers in this work, you know they are also worthy.<br><br>A much-told family story illustrates the importance of a temple recommend. When one of my sisters was a young single adult, she danced one night with a man whom she thought she would like to know better. When she returned home she told my mother about him. My mother was skeptical and said there was no possible way to know if a man was good just by dancing with him.<br><br>My sister replied, "He has a temple recommend, so he must be pretty good."<br><br>Mother asked, "How do you know he has a recommend? Did you ask as you were dancing, 'So, do you have a recommend?'"<br><br>My sister laughed and said, "No, but he said something about having plans to go to the temple tomorrow with a mission companion, and he must have a recommend to do that."<br><br>Deliberately, my mother asked, "Why is it so important to know that?"<br><br>My sister answered, "Well, if I know a man has a recommend, I know he keeps the Word of Wisdom, I know he pays his tithing, I know he attends his meetings, I know he honors his priesthood, I know he sustains the leaders of the Church, and I know he has a testimony of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. I want to start with a recommend as the basis for any relationship and go from there. When I know a man has a recommend, there are a lot of questions I don't have to ask."<br><br>Recent instruction from the First Presidency clarifies the policy for obtaining temple recommends and receiving endowments. It was reiterated that receiving one's temple endowment is a serious matter that should be extended only to those who are sufficiently prepared and mature enough to keep the covenants they enter into. They also affirmed that single members in their late teens or early twenties who have not received a mission call or who are not engaged to be married in the temple should not be recommended to the temple for their own endowment. Every member who is 12 or older can, however, receive a Limited-Use Recommend to perform baptisms for thedead.<sup>1</sup><br><br>Those of you who are not worthy today of the privilege of carrying a recommend should be working with your bishop or branch president to qualify yourselves for a recommend as soon as possible. Please don't be without this vital document. I testify that the Atonement is real and that sins can be forgiven upon proper repentance.<br><br>You can and should be keeping the temples very busy. Temple and family history work is your work. Much depends on you! The Church needs your energy in this important work. You are the ones who can accomplish so much with your energy and skills.<br><br>As you participate in temple and family history work, you are certain to have the Spirit to comfort you in your challenges and to guide you in all the important decisions you are making. As you participate in this work as individuals, in your ward and institute groups, and in your Relief Societies and priesthood quorums, you will form good friendships and have meaningful social experiences. And because your associations and friendships are expanding and the Spirit is working with you, there is an increased likelihood for you to find a spouse and form an eternal family.<br><h2><b>Preparing for Your Future</b></h2><br>Fourth, prepare for your future. You are in a unique season of life. You should be preparing for future roles and responsibilities. You only get this season once. Embrace it! Enjoy it!<br><br>In the natural course of things, most of you will become husbands and wives. You will be fathers and mothers. You will be Church leaders and teachers. You will be employees and employers. Are you preparing for those responsibilities?<br><br>Many of you are involved in various aspects of education. Latter-day prophets have repeatedly counseled you to get all the education possible for you. You live in an increasingly technical and sophisticated world. Education will help you build the Lord's kingdom and provide for your future family. Because education is so important for the rising generation, the Perpetual Education Fund was established and now benefits more than 30,000 young people worldwide. The Church has also invested many resources in institutes of religion all over the world and in great Church schools and universities. I hope you are following the prophetic counsel to receive all of the education and training that is possible foryou.<br><br>It is true that you will be better able to serve in the Church and build the Lord's kingdom if you have good employment. Mothers and fathers will be better parents as they are educated and know how to solve family problems and manage their homes in wise ways.<br><br>Some of you women are deciding now whether you should marry and have a family or choose a career. You are bright and qualified, and you have opportunities your grandmothers never dreamed of. The possibilities for earning credentials and making a mark for yourselves on the world stage have never been greater. But I hope you are making your decisions with the blessings of Abraham in mind.<br><br>Latter-day Saint women should understand that no matter how many other people they enlist to help them with their home and children, they cannot delegate their role as the primary nurturer and teacher of their families. Righteous motherhood will always stretch every reserve they have to meet the needs of their families. As a daughter of God who has made covenants with Him, each of you carries the vital and indispensable female half of the responsibility for fulfilling the Lord's plan.<br><br>Each of you has the agency to prayerfully and humbly choose how to approach your career opportunities. Every choice has a consequence. You cannot have everything and do everything. You must choose with eternal priorities in mind. I would hope that you will understand that there are no glamorous careers. Every form of employment has its own innate challenges. Many choices available in the world today compete with eternal goals and responsibilities. Many choices could persuade you to delay or limit the number of children you invite into your family. Many choices could rob you of critical time and energy necessary to adequately care for your spouse, your children, and your responsibilities in the Lord's kingdom. These decisions are between you and the Lord. He knows the desires of your heart and your unique situation.<br><br>Most of you in this audience will one day marry. In this season of preparation, are you developing and looking for the right qualities in an eternal companion?<br><br>Some time ago President Gordon B. Hinckley said to the men: "The girl you marry will take a terrible chance on you. She will give her all to the young man she marries. He will largely determine the remainder of her life."<sup>2</sup><br><br>Men, are you becoming the kind of person who could ask a girl to take a chance on you?<br><br>Women, the same could be asked of you. The man you marry will also take a chance on you. In section 25 of the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord gives good counsel for wives to "be . . . a comfort unto . . . thy husband . . . with consoling words, in the spirit of meekness" (D&amp;amp;C 25:5). Are you that kind of woman? The man you marry will largely be happy because of your influence on his happiness.<br><br>Some of you have already found someone you are attracted to, whom you are compatible with, and who has qualities you admire, but perhaps you are fearful of making a commitment because you wonder if tomorrow or next week or next year you will find someone who is even more ideal.<br><br>Because this decision is so important, manyof you worry about making a correct choice. The examples we find portrayed in movies and books about how to choose a spouse do not help us much. They often show this choice as a matter of chance or fate, a magical event. These romances are usually depicted irrationally as the instant discovery of a one and only soul mate.<br><br>Regarding such so-called soul mates, President Spencer W. Kimball said:<br><br><i>"Soul mates" are fiction and an illusion; and while every young man and young woman will seek with all diligence and prayerfulness to find a mate with whom life can be most compatible and beautiful, yet it is certain that almost any good man and any good woman can have happiness and a successful marriage if both are willing to pay the price.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>Prophets have provided some inspired guidelines to help you find a marriage partner. Twenty years ago President Ezra Taft Benson listed some qualities men should look for in a mate. His words are still true:<br><br><i>Now, brethren, do not expect perfection in your choice of a mate. Do not be so particular that you overlook her most important qualities of having a strong testimony, living the principles of the gospel, loving home, wanting to be a mother in Zion, and supporting you in your priesthood responsibilities. . . .</i><br><br><i>And one good yardstick as to whether a person might be the right one for you is this: in her presence, do you think your noblest thoughts, do you aspire to your finest deeds, do you wish you were better than you are?</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>Now let's listen to President Hinckley's counsel to women:<br><br><i>You are hoping to catch that perfect man. I have yet to see one who is perfect. Aim high, but do not aim so high that you totally miss the target. What really matters is that he will love you, that he will respect you, that he will honor you, that he will be absolutely true to you, that he will give you freedom of expression and let you fly in the development of your own talents. He is not going to be perfect, but if he is kind and thoughtful, if he knows how to work and earn a living, if he is honest and full of faith, the chances are that you will not go wrong, that you will be immensely happy.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>Let me ask: If you were to get married tomorrow, are you prepared to be a good spouse? Would you bring to your marriage personal qualities that would make you a good partner? Are you a good communicator? Are you a good problem solver? Do you have skills to create a nurturing climate in your home? Do you have enough faith, hope, and charity to create a marriage that will survive and thrive?<br><br>Men, as your aunt who will now speak plainly to you, I hope you understand that there is no worthy woman who will be charmed by dirty laundry, unpleasant habits, or a sloppy appearance. Yes, a righteous woman will love you for what is in your mind and heart, but she would very much appreciate your sincere efforts to display good manners and thoughtfulness to her. You should also know that there is no mate who will cheerfully overlook selfishness. Please remember that there are no righteous daughters of God who will willingly tolerate a pornography habit in the young men they date and marry. In fact, if a young woman has any hint that a young man she is interested in is involved in pornography in any of its forms, I would tell her to consider it as a flashing red light, which means "stop this relationship." Now is your season to develop righteous and respectful habits and Christlike qualities that will bless your future marriage and family.<br><br>Women, speaking as your aunt who loves you, there is no magical prince who will gladly appreciate unclean or unpleasant habits or a careless appearance in you. Yes, a righteous man will love you for what is in your mind and heart, but he will be even more grateful for a woman who values cleanliness and loveliness in herself and in her surroundings. Righteous men are drawn to women who have radiant countenances. Also, no righteous priesthood holder will willingly tolerate a pornography habit in his wife, nor will he appreciate her displaying and advertising her precious body to other men by the tight or otherwise immodest and inappropriate ways she dresses and conducts herself. Additionally, I have yet to meet a man who enjoys dramatic emotional displays and temper tantrums. There is no mate who will cheerfully overlook selfishness. Now is your season to develop righteous and respectful habits and Christlike qualities such as kindness and long-suffering that will bless your future home and family.<br><br>Please understand what I just said. I want you to know that your imperfections and weaknesses will go with you into your marriage and will be magnified in that setting. Unless you are getting married today, you still have time to eliminate bad habits and develop good habits and qualities that will bless your marriage and family. President Thomas S. Monson has taught, "It is worthwhile to look ahead, to set a course, to be at least partly ready when the moment of decision comes."<sup>6</sup><br><br>Most of you will also be fathers and motherswho will create righteous homes for your families. When I was young, I was taught by my mother that while I was single I needed to learn how to take care of one life and one room so that I would be prepared to take care of several lives and several rooms.<br><br>In the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord gives a pattern for a Spirit-filled home. It should be "a house of prayer, a house of fasting, [and] a house of faith" (D&amp;amp;C 109:8). It should be a house where the Lord's Spirit can abide, where no unclean thing is permitted to enter, and a house of learning where there is a study of the best books, which includes the scriptures (see verse 7).<br><br>That inspires the following questions: Is the home or room where you currently live that kind of house? In your room, do you have prayer, do you fast, and do you read the scriptures? Do you live in a place of order or a place of clutter? Do you allow unclean things to enter it by way of movies, books, or the Internet? Do you fill it with uplifting things--the best things? Is your current home a place where the Spirit of the Lord can abide?<br><br>Additionally, there are some important skills you should develop that will help you be a good father or mother and make a happy home. These skills could include cooking, cleaning, and repairing things that are broken. Wise financial practices are also critical for a happy marriage. This includes careful management of student loans. President Hinckley said, "There is nothing that will cause greater tensions in marriage than grinding debt."<sup>7</sup> Part of your preparation for marriage and family is to employ good financial habits and practices now so that when you marry, you and your spouse can begin your life together without huge financial burdens.<br><br>You are now regarded as adults, and you know how to hold yourselves accountable. I hope you are making the most of this precious gift of time you have to prepare for your future roles and responsibilities. When you are preparing adequately for your future roles and responsibilities, you will have the Spirit to guide you in your important decisions. When you are preparing for your future, you are much more likely to form the friendships that will help you find someone to marry in the temple and create an eternal family.<br><br>Now, my dear nieces and nephews, my friends, I want to express my love and confidence in you. Much depends on you. You have repeatedly been taught your responsibility to seek the blessings of Abraham, which include the formation of eternal families. I urge you not to unnecessarily delay marriage and the bearing of children. Even now, valiant spirit children are waiting for you to invite them into a happy, sealed family.<br><br>You are in the season of life when you should be seeking the blessings of Abraham. Postponing marriage until you have accomplished some other goal, no matter how important the world says it is, only increases your vulnerability to immorality, which could jeopardize your chances of receiving those blessings. Please do not put yourselves at risk for temptation by delaying this natural and important step in your eternal progress. When the decision of whom to marry has been reached, what you need most is faith. Waiting to accomplish other goals, such as getting more education, more money, or more things before marriage, merely delays your promised blessings.<br><br>I have spoken to you tonight as an aunt wholoves you. Your own aunts and uncles have probably also given you advice. I am sure your priesthood leaders, teachers, and advisers have also taken an interest in your future. Ihope that at this important season of your life you are also listening carefully to the counsel of righteous parents, who have eternal responsibility for your welfare.<br><br>President Monson has said:<br><br><i>In making a decision as momentous as whom you will marry, I suggest you seek the help of your parents. Take the time to confide in them, for they will not leave you nor forsake you. They love you dearly and want for a precious daughter or stalwart son the best in life and the ultimate promises of eternity.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>I have spoken tonight about four keys that could help you unlock the door to those blessings: You can and should be serving others. You can and should be sharing the gospel. You can and should be saviors on Mount Zion by participating in temple and family history work. And you can and should be doing all you can to prepare for your future roles and responsibilities.<br><br>The four activities I have described will add to your faith and happiness all of your life. They are marks of discipleship that will strengthen your future marriages and families and invite the Spirit to be with you. As you participate in these activities as individuals, with your friends, and in your quorums, Relief Societies, and institute groups, you will build sociality and friendships that will keep you in the right places doing the right things with the right people, thereby increasing your likelihood to meet people who could be your future marriage partners.<br><br>I testify that this Church is led by apostles and prophets who oversee and direct the affairs of the Lord in all the world. The restored gospel of Jesus Christ is true. Because it is true, much depends on you, the rising generation. As a loving aunt, I hope that you--like Abraham--will be followers of righteousness, that you will seek the blessings of the fathers by making temple covenants and forming eternal families, and that you will thereby find greater knowledge, happiness, peace, and rest. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Julie B.

<h1> of Life - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning. I am thankful for the prayer that has been given and for the beautiful music. I pray that the Spirit of the Lord will continue to be with us.<br><h2><b>My Dad</b></h2><br>I would like to begin with a personal story. In 1988 I was visiting with my brothers and sisters when the conversation drifted to our father, who had passed away many years earlier. We shared our memories of Dad: his ways of doing things, his favorite sayings, our fishing trips (where all he did was bait hooks), and so forth. After enjoying the discussion for 10 or 15 minutes, I was surprised when my youngest sister started to cry. When her emotions settled down, she reminded us that she had been only six years old when our dad passed away. Though she was happy to hear us talk about our memories of Dad, she was saddened because she herself had very few memories ofhim.<br><br>That experience bothered me for several weeks. Being the oldest child in the family, Ihad many memories of my father and could not imagine life without those memories. It bothered me further when I realized that my wife and most of my siblings' spouses would never meet my dad and that my children and their cousins would never know their grandfather. So I enlisted my wife's help, and for the next several months we set about compiling a book about my father. We contacted extended family, found former friends, and called work associates and Church leaders who had interacted with Dad. We asked all of them to write down their memories of him. We made copies of pictures, news articles, and documents that showed his special achievements, trying to put everything we could find about my father in a book. After many months of effort, the book was finished, and we printed copies and gave them to family members as our Christmas gift.<br><br>Although this book is of great value to our family, it does not convey anything more than a glimpse into who my father really is. To fully understand my father as an individual, one would need a much more complete book. There is such a book; the scriptures call it the book of life.<br><br>The book of life is described in the Bible Dictionary as follows: "In one sense the book of life is the sum total of one's thoughts and actions--the record of his life" (s.v. "book of life," 626). I have often desired to read from my father's book of life. As I contemplated what I could learn about him from reading his book of life, I began to wonder about my own book and what was being recorded there.<br><h2><b>Keeping Books</b></h2><br>As an accounting professor, the idea of keeping books is nothing new. One of the many responsibilities of an accountant is to keep the books, or to record the financial activities of organizations. These books are then used by interested parties to analyze the organizations' performances.<br><br>In thinking about my book of life, I wondered if I could apply to it some of the principles accountants use to keep the books of enterprises here on earth. For example, one principle of accounting is that each organization keeps its own set of books. If you want to see what Bank of America is doing, you will not find what you're looking for in the books of Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson. You do not look at the books of Microsoft to see how Barnes &amp;amp; Noble is doing. The books of any enterprise are the records of the activities of that enterprise. The books of J Dawgs, the hot-dog vendor south of campus, look very different from those of McDonald's, even though the two enterprises are in the same industry. The books of an enterprise in India will differ from those of an enterprise in China or Australia--the conditions and opportunities in each country differ. The key is that every enterprise keeps its own books, and each enterprise is evaluated according to what that enterprise has done given its size, location, market, and so forth.<br><br>So it is with a book of life. My book of life will be very different from that of a friend in Atlanta, a cousin in Florida, or a professor in Chile. It will be different from that of President Samuelson, of my bishop, or of my neighbor. My book will even be different from that of my brother, of my father, or of my son. The point is that each one of us has his or her own unique book of life; we need not compare ourselves with others.<br><br>I have always found the parable of the talents to be interesting. In Matthew 25 the parable begins with a lord giving his goods to his servants. Verse 15 states, "And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey."<br><br>Notice that the lord did not give each servant the same amount; he gave to each according to his individual abilities. We know that the first servant worked to increase his five talents to 10, the second servant increased his two talents to four, and the third servant buried his one talent in order to preserve what he had. Of interest to me is the lord's response to the first and second servants.<br><br>In verse 21 the lord tells the first servant the following: "Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord."<br><br>The second servant had started with fewer talents than the first and ended up with only four. But note what the lord says in verse 23: "Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord."<br><br>The response to the second servant is identical to--not proportional to or in any way less than--that received by the first servant. It was not a matter of comparing the second servant to the first servant; it was a matter of each being evaluated for what he did with what he was given. So it is with each one of us. It is not a matter of being compared to others; it is a matter of what we do with what we have beengiven.<br><br>In a very small way, early on in my life I had a taste of this type of judgment. Some of you may have noticed that I came to this earth with a body that has a few odd parts. Fortunately, and at times unfortunately, the competitive spirit I came with far exceeds my physical capabilities. In the eighth grade I took a PE course, and I vowed to get an A in that course. Unfortunately, pull-ups were a problem for me, rope climbing was not good, and several other requirements of the class presented me with major challenges. At the end of the term I received a C for my achievement in the course. I was devastated and just a bit concerned about what my father would say.<br><br>When I got home, Dad looked at the grade and said, "Great! Straight A! I am proud of you."<br><br>You see, the school reported two grades for every class: one grade for achievement (that was the C that I received) and one grade for effort. Dad only looked at the grade for effort. As long as my effort was an "A"-level effort, the level of achievement was not a concern to him. As long as we do the best we can with whatever we are given in this life, our efforts will be accepted by our Heavenly Father. We need not compare ourselves with others.<br><h2><b>The Principle of Balance</b></h2><br>Another principle of accounting that can be applied to our personal book of life is that of balance. Many of you here today have taken Accounting 200. One of the first things students learn in Accounting 200 is that everything is in balance: debits always equal credits. All transactions have a debit and an equally sized credit--no exceptions. If you get a machine, you either give up cash or incur debt. If you recognize revenue, you recognize cash or a receipt. The books are always in balance.<br><br>What about balance in our book of life? I think it is fair to say that at the very basic level we all know that if we do what is right, we will be blessed. And, conversely, we know that if we do not do what is right, we will not be blessed. In the book of life, things must balance--debits equal credits.<br><br>The way God gives us blessings is an example of this concept. D&amp;amp;C 130:20–21 states:<br><br><i>There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which allblessings are predicated--</i><br><br><i>And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.</i><br><br>Obedience brings blessings. Everything is in balance. Debits equal credits.<br><br>Another example of the principle of balance is found in 3 Nephi 14:7–8:<br><br><i>Ask, and it shall be given unto you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</i><br><br><i>For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.</i><br><br>Think of the Word of Wisdom, the sacrament prayer, and other such teachings in which a given action is promised to result in certain blessings. In the book of life, debits equal credits.<br><br>There are times in each of our lives when we may feel that doing what is right does not result in blessings or that our prayers are not being answered or that a particular challenge isjust too much. In essence, we question the existence of balance as it applies to our life.<br><br>I have a young nephew who went to work this last summer on a road-paving crew in order to earn money for his mission. One day a car on the other side of the divided highway crossed the median and all lanes of traffic and pinned my nephew against a concrete barrier. He had been looking the other way and never even saw the car. Although my nephew felt blessed to have escaped death, his left foot was crushed. After months of trying to save the foot, the doctors amputated it last month.<br><br>One might ask, "Why? This is a good young man working to fund a mission so that he can serve the Lord, and, through no fault of his own, he suddenly finds himself in bed for six months trying to heal his foot--only to have it amputated. Why? Where is the balance?"<br><br>We are not alone in these feelings. Sections 121 and 122 of the Doctrine and Covenants were given to the Prophet Joseph Smith while he was in Liberty Jail. In verses 1 through 6 of section 121 the Prophet pleaded with the Lord to remember the Saints in their suffering. In verses 7 and 8 the Lord responded to the Prophet by saying:<br><br><i>My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;</i><br><br><i>And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.</i><br><br>As if to emphasize His point, in section 122 the Lord told the Prophet Joseph that even if he was "called to pass through tribulation," "accused with all manner of false accusations," torn from family and friends, "cast into the pit," sentenced to death, and, above all, chased after by the very depths of hell, he would gain experience and it would be for his good (D&amp;amp;C 122:5–7). Debits equal credits. Although we may not see it, and we experience much pain and suffering in the process, everything in our book of life is, when considered in the eternal sense, in balance.<br><h2><b>Three Reports</b></h2><br>The books of every enterprise have three basic reports. The statement of cash flow describes the liquidity of an enterprise. Any enterprise must have enough cash to make needed payments, regardless of how well the enterprise is doing in other areas, or it will fail. The second report is the income statement. An income statement describes how an enterprise has done financially over a period of time. The third report is the balance sheet. This statement conveys a picture of how the enterprise is doing financially at any point in time. The balance sheet holds the cumulative result of operations over the life of the enterprise. As I think about my book of life, I can clearly see three similar reports.<br><h2><b>A Spiritual Cash Flow</b></h2><br>Like many of you, I have been asked at times to respond to a plea for help or to comfort someone in pain or anguish or to give a priesthood blessing. To respond to requests like these, we need a reservoir of righteousness--a reserve of spiritual cash if you will. When these requests come, it is past time to prepare; you either have the spiritual cash on hand or you don't. There is not a more terrible feeling than to be asked to exercise spirituality when you have not built a reserve. What you may have done in the past or what you may do in the future does not really help when you are faced with the need for the Spirit now.<br><br>How is your spiritual cash flow? The way to build your spiritual reservoir has been clearly outlined: be faithful in your daily prayers and daily scripture study and keep the commandments. Keep your spiritual cash reserve full.<br><h2><b>A Spiritual Income Statement</b></h2><br>All enterprises periodically give an accounting of how they have done over the past year or over some other period of time. All revenues, or inflows, are reported along with all expenses, or outflows. The netting of the revenues and the expenses results in a net income figure. When revenues exceed expenses, there is a net gain; when revenues are less than expenses, there is a net loss.<br><br>How is your spiritual income statement? Hopefully in our personal prayers at the end of each day we are giving an accounting to the Lord of our daily activities. How has the day gone? Are the spiritual revenues greater than the spiritual expenses that day? Regular interviews with parents allow us to give an accounting of what we have been doing since our last discussion. Visiting teaching interviews and priesthood interviews for home teaching give us an opportunity to look at our income statement regarding those responsibilities. All of us have had, I hope, the experience of having an interview with our bishop in which he asked us to give an accounting of our activities. Renewing our temple recommends and attending annual tithing settlements are additional occasions through which we can review our spiritual income statements.<br><br>In business, almost all companies go through cycles of good years and not-so-good years. Some companies begin with a splash, doing extremely well for a few years, and then, because of changes in the economy or challenges in their particular market, they just seem to fade away. Some companies struggle to get going and finally have a major breakthrough. Often these companies are satisfied with their newfound net income and simply ride that success for as long as it will go. The best companies are those that work continually to deal with the challenges that come and show steady positive net income year after year.<br><br>People act in a similar fashion. Some individuals enter a ward with a splash of activity and participation when life is going well, only to withdraw when challenges come. Some individuals are engaged in one activity or position and ride that for the rest of their lives. I have met many less-active members who will spend hours talking about their missionary service as if it justifies their current lack of involvement. Remember, net income is measured for each period of time, and a positive net income one year does not automatically result in a positive net income during any other year. How is your spiritual net income?<br><h2><b>An Eternal Balance Sheet</b></h2><br>The third report found in all organizations is the balance sheet. The balance sheet shows the financial state of an enterprise at any point in time. It shows the assets of the enterprise--assets being cash, inventory, buildings, and land, things that an enterprise uses for its operations. On the other side, the balance sheet shows the liabilities; liabilities are what the enterprise owes to others, such as accounts payable, loans payable, and notes payable. The balance sheet also shows the equity, or total amount invested into and earnings retained in the enterprise by the owners. On every balance sheet, assets equal liabilities plus the owner'sequity.<br><br>As I think of the balance sheet of my life, I doubt that the assets listed include cash, land, buildings, or other such temporal items. The assets in this type of balance sheet can be found in D&amp;amp;C 4:5–6:<br><br><i>And faith, hope, charity and love, with an eye single to the glory of God, qualify him for the work.</i><br><br><i>Remember faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility, diligence.</i><br><br>The sixth section of <i>Preach My Gospel</i> describes these as Christlike attributes (assets) and adds obedience to the list.<br><br>Take a moment to think about someone outside of your family who has been a major influence for good in your life. What is it about this person that you remember? I think of an old Scout leader of mine named Charlie Murray. Brother Murray would spend hours with us boys at camps and working on service projects. I really enjoyed being with him because he was fun and would really tell us what he thought about what we were doing in our lives. How he survived winter camp with the 20-plus Scouts in our troop is still a marvel to me.<br><br>Now consider the person you have identified and think about what makes that individual special. Let me suggest that what makes this person special is his or her level of faith or hope or charity, or the balance of any of the assets in their balance sheet of life. What makes them special is not the amount of money, the size of the home, the amount of property, or the amount of any other of their worldly assets.<br><br>Let me return for a moment to the question I posed earlier about why good people face difficult, sometimes painful, challenges. When all is going well in my life, I find it difficult to develop tolerance or to build my patience or to work on my humility. If things are going well, hope is not a problem, and temperance comes easily. Many, if not most, of the assets in our eternal balance sheet can really only be increased when we are working through challenges and difficulties. Perhaps when we are faced with what seem to be unfair burdens or when our lives seem unduly difficult, we should ask "How do I respond to this so that I build my balance of faith, hope, charity, and so forth?" instead of asking "Why me?" or "Why did this happen?" I do not in any way minimize the challenges we face and the pain we might feel as we undergo trials, but our attitude and perspective can make a significant difference inhow we deal with the struggles of life.<br><br>On the other side of the balance sheet of life are liabilities and the owner's equity. We all have a good idea of what the liabilities are in our books. Every time we fail to keep a commandment, we increase our liability balance.<br><br>The owner's equity section of any balance sheet starts with the contributions of the owners of the enterprise. Consider that everything we have, including life itself, is from the Creator. Further, the blessings we receive throughout our lives come from obedience to His commandments and adherence to the covenants we have made. In essence, whatever equity we started with and any increase that has occurred in it is from our Lord--the Lord is the owner of the owner's equity section of our balance sheet of life. Even more wondrous is that, through the Atonement, Christ has already paid for our liabilities (sins). The scriptures tell us repeatedly that our liabilities will be forgiven us if we repent. For example, Mosiah 26:30 states, "Yea, and as often as my people repent will I forgive them their trespasses against me."<br><br>Do we realize what an incredible blessing this is? The Lord has paid for all our liabilities, and they will be eliminated eternally from our balance sheet of life if we repent and keep the commandments.<br><br>How is your balance sheet in your book of life? How are the balances in your asset accounts of faith, hope, charity, love, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, humility, diligence, and obedience? How is your liability balance, and have you made use of the offer of the Lord to take all liabilities from you?<br><h2><b>Your Book of Life</b></h2><br>At some point we will go before our Father in Heaven to give an accounting of our activities from our time on this earth. Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin stated it this way:<br><br><i>Each of you has an eternal calling from which no Church officer has authority to release you. This is a calling given you by our Heavenly Father Himself. In this eternal calling, as with all other callings, you have a stewardship, and "it is required of the Lord, at the hand of every steward, to render an account of his stewardship, both in time and in eternity."</i> [D&amp;amp;C 72:3] <i>This most important stewardship is the glorious responsibility your Father in Heaven has given you to watch over and care for your own soul.</i><br><br><i>At some future day, you and I will each hear the voice of the Lord calling us forward to render an account of our mortal stewardship.</i> [Joseph B. Wirthlin, "True to the Truth," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1997, 16]<br><br>Keeping a written history of our life on earth is a very important responsibility. Such histories bind generations of families together. I certainly encourage all to write personal histories.<br><br>At the same time, it is important to recognize that we are all, day by day, moment by moment, writing our book of life. Although not written on paper, the entries in this book are just as real and will have an eternal impact.<br><br>When I was born I had a number of physical challenges, the most serious being a deformity of the heart. At the age of nine I had open-heart surgery, which at the time was in an early experimental stage. I was given a 50/50 chance of surviving the surgery and a chance that the surgery would be successful. Obviously I survived the surgery, and I have had no heart problems since.<br><br>Looking back at that time, there were two truths I knew then, and I still know today. The first was that the Lord knew me individually and was watching over me. I knew He loved me, and because of that everything would be okay--regardless of what I had to go through. That knowledge has been a tremendous blessing as I have faced the various challenges in my life.<br><br>The second was that I had been given many blessings and my life has a purpose. Ialso knew that with these blessings came a tremendous responsibility to do all I could to be worthy of that which I had been given.<br><br>The same is true for each of you. The Lord knows you individually and is watching over you. He loves you and wants only the best for you. He is there for you through the challenges of life as you seek Him in prayer. Each of us has a responsibility to live such that our book of life reflects actions taken that will permit us to return to live with Him forever.

<h1>rm and Inform: A Blessing of Higher Education - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I became a seminary teacher in the Church Educational System at a time when a new paradigm for teaching the scriptures was being introduced. Our leaders felt that this new approach, which emphasized teaching each book from the standard works sequentially from beginning to end, would help students better know and love the scriptures. It was exciting to be part of that grand experiment. President Henry B. Eyring, who was then serving as commissioner of Church education, shared his feelings about what these efforts could accomplish. He said:<br><br><i>I have a hunch that four or five years from now you will see more Latter-day Saint youth in our classes pondering the scriptures, talking about them with each other, teaching each other from them, believing that they really do have the answers to thequestions of their hearts.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>I believe that President Eyring's "hunch" has been realized in you. I believe you are a generation that knows and loves the scriptures. Today I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to test that hypothesis--so I am going to give you a test. Here is the test. I am going to begin reciting a passage of scripture. When I stop, I would like you to finish it if you can, speaking out loud so those around you can hear. Let's begin.<br><br>"For behold, this is my work and . . ." (Moses 1:39).<br><br>"I will go and . . ." (1 Nephi 3:7).<br><br>"I, the Lord, will forgive whom . . ." (D&amp;amp;C 64:10).<br><br>"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least . . ." (Matthew 25:40).<br><br>"Adam fell that men . . ." (2 Nephi 2:25).<br><br>"When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye . . ." (Mosiah 2:17).<br><br>"And it came to pass . . ."<br><br>I am teasing, of course, with the last example, but isn't it wonderful to be part of a people who know and love the scriptures? I love the way the scriptures make me feel. I love the perspective and hope they give my life. I love to hear the words. I love the way phrases and passages come to mind when I need strength or direction. I love to hold the scriptures, turn the pages, see the markings and notes, and read the words that feel like comfortable old friends. To me, the scriptures are one of the great manifestations that God loves us.<br><br>I am sure many of you can recall the words that the Book of Mormon prophet Jacob spoke to the people of Nephi about a problem in his day. You remember that he said:<br><br><i>O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not.</i> [2 Nephi 9:28]<br><br>Modern sociological studies indicate that the pattern in which learning undermines faith was not a problem unique to Jacob's people or dispensation. Studies analyzing religiosity and education levels in the United States typically indicate that the most educated Americans are the least likely to participate in religious activities such as prayer, Bible study, and missionary work. However, within individual Christian denominations, the relationship between education and one measure of religiosity--church attendance--appears to be positive, though often only mildly so. Latter-day Saints typically stand out as different in these kinds of studies, for not only is the correlation between education and church attendance very strong for members of our faith, but other measures of religiosity are positively correlated with education as well. For example, if you are a Latter-day Saint, the more education you have, the more likely you are to pray, to study the gospel, to pay tithing, and to feel that your faith is important in your life.<sup>2</sup><br><br>As members of the Church, we are not surprised by these findings, for we understand that a faith confirmed by the Spirit is further confirmed and informed by education. In fact, it is our clear and published expectation that your BYU education should "be (1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building, leading to (4) lifelong learning and service."<sup>3</sup><br><br>My own experience in obtaining higher education has followed typical Latter-day Saint trends. My testimony and understanding of the gospel have been strengthened by what I have learned through my university studies. I have every confidence that yours can be as well. In order for your education to best inform and confirm your testimony of the restored gospel, I believe three important conditions must be met. First, you must have faith; second, you must be obedient; and third, you must be observant. I would like to explain what I mean by each of these, beginning with the condition that you must have faith.<br><h2><b>We Must Have Faith</b></h2><br>We use the word <i>faith</i> to describe a number of different principles and concepts. I would like to share a personal experience to illustrate what I mean by faith in this context. When I was a little boy, I enjoyed pretending to be a superhero. I patterned myself after the most popular hero of the day, Superman. When my mother tied a bath-towel cape around my neck, I was transformed not into Superman but rather into a hero of my own making: I became "Man of the Whole Wide World."<br><br>I spent much time each day pretending to fly around as Man of the Whole Wide World--so much time, in fact, that I eventually had a Korihor experience. Do you remember Korihor? He spent so much time pretending to believe things that were not true that eventually he "verily believed that they were true" (Alma 30:53). Likewise, I began to convince myself that I might really be Man of the Whole Wide World and that perhaps I really could fly.<br><br>One day I decided to find out. I reasoned that if I were really going to fly, I would need to leap from a high altitude. Fortunately I chose the arm of the living room sofa as the high-altitude launching point from which to test my hypothesis. I leaped many times from the sofa, only to land on my feet just a few inches away. Then it occurred to me that when Superman flew, his body was horizontal--parallel to the ground--but when I jumped from the sofa, my body was vertical--perpendicular to the ground. (I did not know the terms then, but I understood the principle.) It seemed to me that in order to really fly, all I needed to do was leap from the sofa and quickly orient my body so that it was flat--parallel to the ground. I only tested this hypothesis once, for the experiment was too painful to repeat. In fact, after conducting the experiment, I came to the sad realization that I was not really Man of the Whole Wide World. But in the process something I had always known in my heart to be true was confirmed: ordinary people cannot fly. I learned that one's education will strengthen one's beliefs, but only if those beliefs are true. In fact, a belief in things that are not true will fall flat on its face.<br><br>Many more profound educational experiences have followed that simple early one. Those experiences have continued to confirm and inform the things I know to be true in my heart while helping me avoid being caught up in the imaginations of men. They have helped me understand that real faith is as Alma defined it to the humble among the Zoramites. He said, "Faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things; therefore if ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen, <i>which are true</i>" (Alma 32:21; emphasis added). Thus, while one may believe that a false principle is true, that belief cannot be real faith, for faith is, by this definition, a belief in things that aretrue.<br><br>It is little wonder, then, that higher education leads to greater faith and devotion among Latter-day Saints, for the restored gospel is true. God lives. Jesus Christ is our Redeemer. Joseph Smith was God's prophet of the Restoration. A belief in these things is faith, for these things are true, and if you have this faith, your education can indeed confirm and inform it.<br><br>This kind of faith--this ability to recognize and believe truth--is identified as a spiritual gift by the Apostle Paul and by Moroni (see 1Corinthians 12:9; Moroni 10:11). Many of you have enjoyed this spiritual gift from a very young age. You have believing hearts and find it easy to recognize and accept the truths of the gospel. For others, having this kind of faith is difficult. Perhaps you have not been taught gospel truths or perhaps you find it difficult to recognize truth when you hear it. Some of us simply struggle to believe. If that sounds like you, do not be discouraged or give up. Remember that the Apostle Paul encouraged us to earnestly seek spiritual gifts (see 1 Corinthians 12:31, footnote 31a). I know that God wants each of us to have the gift of faith and that if you sincerely strive and ask Him for it, God will give you this gift--this wonderful ability to recognize and believe truth--and your education will strengthen that faith.<br><h2><b>We Must Be Obedient</b></h2><br>In addition to having faith, we must be obedient if we want our education to be spiritually strengthening. I would like to share another personal experience to illustrate why this is so. One of the wonderful experiences a young husband can anticipate is that of watching his bride learn how to cook. While some young women enter marriage already skilled in the art of cooking, many do not. For some the learning curve can be very steep.<br><br>My wife, Sister Ball, is a wonderful cook. Over the years she has polished and refined her culinary skills to the point that now I am confident she could walk into a strange kitchen and prepare a delicious and nutritious meal out of whatever she found in the pantry and refrigerator. Still, some of the early meals she prepared for us as a young couple were real gastronomical adventures. But to this day I consider one of her early successes a true miracle in the kitchen. Somehow she managed to transform broccoli into something edible. The rave reviews I gave the dish encouraged her to make the recipe a regular part of our menu.<br><br>At that time we were living in a small town in southeastern Arizona, where I had my first assignment as a seminary teacher. The town had two major roads, appropriately named Poverty Flats and Hog Holler. We lived at the end of Hog Holler Road in a small home sandwiched between a chili field and the desert. The nearest full-service grocery store was more than 30 miles away. Consequently, kitchen commodities often ran short between trips to the store. To compensate, Sister Ball got in the habit of experimenting with substitutes for ingredients that were temporarily unavailable.<br><br>The results of her experiments were very unpredictable. On one occasion she began preparing the remarkable broccoli dish, only to discover that she did not have the cream of mushroom soup the recipe required. She decided to make her own "white sauce" from a little flour and water to substitute for the soup. (What she called "white sauce" I would call "paste.") She reasoned that the soup was white and lumpy, and so was her flour and water concoction. The result of the substitution was a disaster. Without the proper ingredients, the true nature of broccoli was left exposed--it was no longer palatable. Sister Ball learned from that experience that color and texture are no substitutes for taste.<br><br>Following that failure, Sister Ball removed the broccoli dish from her repertoire. She no longer trusted the recipe. However, if you were to ask her about it today, she would confess that the fault was not with the dish but with her, for she had failed to hearken unto the commandments of the recipe. She thought that she could change it or twist it to her own will without consequence.<br><br>In truth, her initial confidence in the recipe was not misplaced, but that confidence could only be confirmed if she diligently abided by the recipe's instructions. So it is with your testimony and understanding of the restored gospel: It will be best confirmed and informed by your education if you diligently follow the recipe by keeping the commandments of God.<br><br>Indeed, the words of Jacob confirm this truth. After lamenting the foolishness of men who thought they were too smart for God, Jacob declared, "But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God" (2 Nephi 9:29). The Savior explained it another way to some disbelieving individuals of His day. He declared, "If any man will do [God's] will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself" (John 7:17).<br><br>So it can be for you. If you will diligently strive to keep the commandments of God as you gain your education, not only will you receive the confirmation of the Spirit but you will also find your testimony and understanding of the restored gospel further confirmed and informed by what you learn in your studies.<br><h2><b>We Must Be Observant</b></h2><br>Finally, you can better obtain an education that is spiritually strengthening if you will be observant. Develop the habit of regularly observing or considering how the things you are learning from your studies can be informed by the gospel and, conversely, how your understanding of the gospel can be informed by the things you are learning. This habit of observation can add a wonderful and exciting dimension to your learning and can lead to the discovery of knowledge and ideas that might otherwise be missed.<br><br>To illustrate this concept, I would like to share one of my favorite examples of how my education has helped me better understand the gospel. Though I am a professor of ancient scripture, I have a bachelor's degree and a PhD in the field of botany. That training has been a wonderful asset to me in my scripture study, especially of Isaiah. By my count, Isaiah uses more than 300 botanical metaphors in his prophecies. One of my favorites, found in Isaiah 28:24–28, beautifully teaches principles fundamental to our faith. It reads:<br><br><i>Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break the clods of his ground?</i><br><br><i>When he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rie in their place?</i><br><br><i>For his God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach him.</i><br><br><i>For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.</i><br><br><i>Bread corn is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing it, nor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it with his horsemen.</i><br><br>Looking at this passage through a botanist's eyes reveals some wonderful principles of the gospel. The passage begins with a question: "Doth the plowman plow all day to sow?" In other words, does a plowman plow the same field over and over again? The answer of course is no. Rather, when he has broken the clods of the ground and "hath made plain [or level] the face thereof," he begins to sow--in this case various kinds of seeds in different ways.<br><br>First he plants "fitches" and "cummin." <i>Fitches</i> likely refers to <i>Nigella sativa,</i> a plant commonly known today as nutmeg flower. This plant has finely incised leaves and grows on a delicate stem to about 12 inches tall. It has a terminal white or pale blue flower that matures into a walnut-sized and -shaped seedpod; at maturity the pod is very brittle and is loaded with tiny seeds that are valued as a pungent spice. The <i>cummin</i> mentioned in this verse is likely the same plant as our modern cumin (<i>Cuminum cyminum</i>). This member of the carrot family grows up to two feet tall and produces clusters of white to pink flowers that, at maturity, yield the spicy seeds that are still valued in kitchens today. Both fitches and cumin have relatively tiny seeds that do not require special spacing in their planting, so the wise farmer plants these seeds by merely casting abroad or throwing (Hebrew <i>zaraq</i>) and scattering (<i>hephitz</i>) them over the ground. Today we call this broadcast seeding. Seeds sown by broadcasting grow close together in dense patches or clusters, which happens to be an ideal condition for fitches and cumin, for if the plants are sown too widely apart they do not compete as well with other vegetation. When planted close together in tight communities, fitches and cumin thrive, creating their own microenvironment that preserves moisture and chokes out competing weeds.<br><br>The farmer next plants three kinds of cereal grains. First, he "[casts] in the principal wheat." Bread wheat (<i>Triticum sp.</i>) was the most important food crop grown anciently and still is today. It is truly the staff of life. Accordingly, this critical crop is planted with special care. The Hebrew term <i>sowrah,</i> translated here as "principal," is better translated as "in rows." Thus, rather than merely throwing out the wheat seeds, the wise farmer "casts"--from the Hebrew <i>sam,</i> meaning to put or place--the seeds in rows. By carefully placing the seeds in rows, the farmer ensures that his precious wheat crop will have adequate spacing for the irrigation, cultivation, and ripening it so needs to thrive.<br><br>Following the wheat, the farmer plants the "appointed barley," or, better translated, "the barley in the appointed place." Barley (<i>Hordium sp.</i>) is an inferior grain to wheat for human consumption--barley bread is the poor man's bread. The redeeming value of barley is that it will grow in places where wheat will not; it is much more tolerant of poor soils, especially saline soils. If a portion of a field has poor drainage--which causes the salinity of the soil to increase--that portion becomes the appointed place for barley. The farmer knows that while precious wheat may not grow there, barley will do just fine.<br><br>Finally, the farmer plants the "rie in [its] place." The Hebrew term <i>gebulto,</i> translated here as "in [its] place," is better translated as "on the edges" or "borders." Thus the farmer seems to be planting the rie around the edges of his field, perhaps to form a living hedge or fence to protect the other crops. The rie planted here is likely a type of spelt wheat that is not free threshing--meaning that the seeds cannot be easily separated from the seed heads. This kind of wheat is a poor grain for human use and is more commonly used for animal fodder, straw, and, in this case, as a protective hedge.<br><br>Can you picture then the farmer's field? In one portion he has a nicely broadcast patch of fitches and in another a broadcast patch of cumin. In the choicest part of his field he has carefully placed rows of wheat. In the poorest sections of the field he has planted barley and then surrounded the entire field with a protective hedge of rie.<br><br>Obviously Isaiah is trying to do something more here than teach us about Old Testament agriculture. I believe Isaiah wants us to liken the farmer to our Heavenly Father and the seeds to ourselves. Have you ever wondered why you were born where and when you were born? Why were you not born 500 years ago in some primitive aboriginal culture in some isolated corner of the world? Is the timing and placing of our birth capricious? For Latter-day Saints, the answer is no. Fundamental to our faith is the understanding that before we came to this earth we lived in a premortal existence with a loving Heavenly Father. We further understand that in that premortal state we had agency and that we grew and developed as we used that agency. Some, as Abraham learned, became noble and great ones (see Abraham 3:22–23). We believe that when it came time for us to experience mortality, a loving Heavenly Father, who knows each of us well, sent us to earth at the time and in the place and in circumstances that would best help us reach our divine potential and help Him maximize His harvest of redeemed souls.<br><br>Therefore, some of you are fitches and cumin. You were born and raised in tight-knit and supportive communities, and you are a vital and contributing part of those communities. Others of you are wheat. You have been placed in exceptionally fertile and promising places because God, who knows your special potential, is counting on you to produce so much. Some of you are barley and rie. You have been placed in some difficult circumstances and have perhaps had to face handicaps and hardships, but God knows you. He knows your needs, your hearts, and your abilities, and He knows you can reach your divine potential, even in the face of great trials. Perhaps it is those very trials that will help you reach your potential, or perhaps He allows you to face those trials so you can help others reach their potential. Some of you may be zucchini: It would not matter where you were planted, you would grow and flourish and produce extraordinary amounts of fruit to be foisted upon unsuspecting neighbors.<br><br>The teaching in this passage does not end with the planting of the seeds but continues through to the harvest. Isaiah observes that "fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin." The "threshing instrument" mentioned here is today known as a threshing sled. This is a toboggan-shaped tool that typically stands about six feet tall and two to three feet wide. On the underside of the sled, rocks or slivers of flint or obsidian are embedded. Anciently, and in some places still today, when a farmer is harvesting his grain, he will cut it close to the ground, tie it into sheaves, and then place the sheaves on an area of hard-beaten earth called a threshing floor. When the threshing floor is covered with sheaves, he will place the threshing sled on top of the sheaves, weigh it down with something, and then have it pulled around over the sheaves. As the threshing sled is pulled over the sheaves, the kernels of grain are knocked out of the seed heads, and the rest of the plant is chopped into chaff. Then on a windy day the farmer will use his winnowing fork to toss the mixture of chaff and grain into the air. As he does so, the lighter chaff is blown away, leaving the clean kernels of grain behind. In the absence of a threshing sled, the farmer may use a heavy cart to thresh the grain.<br><br>But Isaiah observes that threshing sleds and carts are not used on fitches and cumin. Can you see why? These plants are too delicate and the seeds too tiny to withstand the rigors of a threshing sled or the weight of a cart. Using such implements would grind the seeds into oblivion. Rather, Isaiah observes that "fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod."<br><br>I picture the farmer placing a piece of cloth on the ground and then, while holding the plants over it, lightly tapping the seed heads with a stick. As he does so, the fragile seed heads break open and spill their contents onto the cloth. That is all it takes to get the harvest out of fitches and cumin--just a little light tapping with a stick. But imagine what would happen if you tried to thresh wheat in this manner: You could spend an entire day lightly tapping the seed heads and have very little to show for your labors. The wise farmer knows that wheat and other cereals need to be vigorously and rigorously threshed to produce a harvest. As Isaiah explains, "Bread corn is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing it."<br><br>Consider what the threshing represents in this metaphor. Perhaps it refers to the challenges and trials we experience in life that, if properly processed, bring out the harvest, the very best in each of us. Or perhaps the threshing represents opportunities, talents, and callings we are given. Have you ever been threshed by a calling or an opportunity to serve? Thus some of you are like fitches and cumin: it only takes a little nudge or challenge and the goodness just spills out of you. Others of you more likely resemble wheat. You have to be vigorously pushed and challenged before your potential surfaces. The point is that God knows you and loves you and that if you will trust Him and involve Him in your life, then He will see that you have the challenges and opportunities--the threshing--that will help you realize your fullest potential. These are wonderful truths, perhaps taught better in this passage of Isaiah than anywhere else in the scriptures.<br><br>I am so grateful for the ways in which my botanical studies have helped me understand this beautiful metaphor of Isaiah and many other passages of scripture. I believe that when an engineer, a musician, a social scientist, or anyone educated in a given discipline reads the scriptures, they too can gain insights and make discoveries unique to that discipline if they are looking for them and if they are observant. It is exciting to be a part of a community of learners who are doing so and then sharing their insights and discoveries with others. I hope you will develop the habit of being so observant--of regularly considering what your learning can tell you about the gospel and what the gospel can tell you about your learning.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, you have a wonderful opportunity while here at BYU to gain a spiritually strengthening education and to join the ranks of those whose commitment to and understanding of the gospel have been greatly enhanced by their studies. May I invite you to work toward that goal by being faithful, by being obedient, and by being observant. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Terry B.

<h1>lish a Secure Foundation for Life - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I rejoice in the singular privilege of being on this remarkable Brigham Young University campus with each of you. This entire center is charged with an ennobling spirit that originates from your individual purity and righteousness. With great depth of feeling I express my love for each of you and my profound gratitude for who you are and what you will accomplish in your lifetime.<br><br>During the past several years, my life has been powerfully enriched by an assignment that has permitted close collaboration with President Cecil Samuelson and key BYU faculty and administrative staff. Simultaneously, Ihave had the privilege of meeting the student-body leaders at Brigham Young University and some of the outstanding students enrolled here. These experiences have created in me a deep and abiding respect for this unique university and its precious student body. That respect and appreciation has motivated me to strive to prepare a message that I hope will be of lasting value to you personally.<br><br>I will speak as though I am conversing with each one of you individually. You may be just beginning your studies at this university. If so, you might feel intimidated by many around you who seem to be well oriented and accomplishing much of great worth, while you may not be sure of how to make the most of your opportunity here. Or you could be a confident student about ready to graduate, having worked hard to benefit from the knowledge and experience available at this unique campus. Perhaps you find yourself somewhere between these two extremes. My desire is to share insights that can benefit each of you personally, now.<br><br>This message is divided into two parts. First,I will share a scripturally based set of principles intended to provide help at this season of your life. Then, after laying an underpinning with scriptures from the Book of Mormon, I will share counsel regarding an even more significant foundation for your life. As this is done, I feel assured that as you seek to identify this foundation, there will be available to you a greater source of direction--namely, the promptings of the Holy Spirit that can convey a personalized message from the Lord for your guidance. Of all that is communicated today, that direction should receive the highest priority as you try to write or remember what will be shared with you.<br><br>My soul is deeply stirred when I consider the profound, enduring, and beneficial counsel available to each of us through the priceless scriptures the Lord has prompted His prophets to record. One eloquent example of such a passage is this thoughtful, profoundly insightful counsel of Alma given to the people in Gideon:<br><br><i>And now I would that ye should be humble, and be submissive and gentle; easy to be entreated; full of patience and long-suffering; being temperate in all things; being diligent in keeping the commandments of God at all times; asking for whatsoever things ye stand in need, both spiritual and temporal; always returning thanks unto God for whatsoever things ye do receive.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>In that single verse Alma gives an extremely effective formula for success and happiness in life. Let us analyze it to determine how it can benefit you personally.<br><ul><br>	<li>"Ye should be humble." For me that means that you should be completely willing to be taught by the Spirit and committed to apply consistently the lessons learned. Humility is not a condition of weakness but rather the fertile soil in which the seeds of truth can sprout and grow to fortify your life with inspired direction. Humility is an essential ingredient of strong, worthy character.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>"Be submissive and gentle." How rich your life will be as you diligently try to be submissive to wise counsel and gentle in dealing with others. Being stubborn instead of readily applying sound advice is a barrier to spiritual guidance. Harshness in interpersonal relationships isolates one from precious friendships.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>"Easy to be entreated." I consider this to be one of the most vitally important principles taught by Alma. As I have tried sincerely to apply it in my own life, I have been blessed enormously--interpersonal relationships have significantly improved and many of the usual challenges of life have been eliminated. Be "easy to be entreated" in every worthy aspect of your life and you will be amazed at the problems and challenges that will be avoided or dissipated.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>"Full of patience and long-suffering." This is not an easy goal to achieve when you are wronged, unjustly criticized, misunderstood, or ignored. Yet when you sincerely practice this principle, you will qualify for the inspiration and guidance needed to resolve potential problems.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>"Being temperate in all things." Being temperate means to be moderate, to avoid being extreme or excessive. It also signifies being reasonable, equitable, and restrained. However, it does not mean being wishy-washy, without core principles, or void of firmly held righteous convictions. I am reminded of President Spencer W. Kimball, who was kind and understanding, but when others tried to take advantage of that gentle nature, they found that beneath his silk glove of kindness was an iron fist of resolution. Although gentle, he would never yield on a matter of doctrine or principle.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>"Being diligent in keeping the commandments of God at all times." The enhancing content of this principle is found in the phrases "being diligent" and "at all times." You can't be diligent once. One who keeps the commandments only when convenient will not receive the strength and inspiration needed in times of difficulty. Nor does selectively obeying some commandments while ignoring others produce the same power in one's life as does full compliance with the laws of the Lord.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>"Asking for whatsoever things ye stand in need, both spiritual and temporal." The Savior taught: "Whatsoever ye ask the Father in my name it shall be given unto you, that is expedient [meaning beneficial] for you."<sup>2</sup> As you consistently follow the principles we have discussed to this point, you will fortify your ability to pray effectively to the Father and will better qualify for His response. Rather than ask that your desires be fulfilled, I suggest that you seek His will and obey it.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>"Always returning thanks unto God for whatsoever things ye do receive." Sincere gratitude is a marvelous lubricant to ease you over some of the rough spots that will inevitably come into your life. The Lord Himself has declared, "And in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his commandments."<sup>3</sup></li><br></ul><br>My dear friend, I testify that your regular application of the principles just reviewed will garner you greater accomplishment, satisfaction, and peace from your diligent efforts at this university.<br><br>Now I will develop a scriptural background for the most important counsel I want to share with you.<br><br>My own personal pondering and meditation of scriptural references and other fascinating subjects such as physics, astronomy, and the extraordinary complexity of the human body have awakened a profound reverence for the unfathomable depth of the capacities of our Father in Heaven and His Beloved Son Jesus Christ. It is overwhelming to realize that They focus all of this incredible ability on the accomplishment of Their paramount purpose: that we attain sufficient personal growth, development, and progress to inherit the highest and most comprehensive blessings of our Father's plan of happiness.<br><br>I will share something that I should have learned a long time ago but didn't. I have become awakened to the limitless capacity of our Beloved Father and His Holy Son to express love and to feel joy, happiness, and gratitude as well as sorrow, disappointment, and sadness. This extraordinary range of capacity to feel emotion is repeatedly depicted in the scriptures, as the following Book of Mormon passages indicate:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that when Jesus had thus spoken, he cast his eyes round about again on the multitude, and beheld they were in tears, and did look steadfastly upon him as if they would ask him to tarry a little longer with them.</i><br><br><i>And he said unto them: Behold, my bowels are filled with compassion towards you.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>We cannot begin to appreciate how intense that feeling was for the Savior.<br><br><i>Have ye any that are sick among you? Bring them hither. Have ye any that are lame, or blind, orhalt, or maimed, or leprous, or that are withered, or that are deaf, or that are afflicted in any manner? Bring them hither and I will heal them, for I have compassion upon you; my bowels are filled with mercy.</i><br><br><i>For I perceive that ye desire that I should show unto you what I have done unto your brethren at Jerusalem, for I see that your faith is sufficient that Ishould heal you. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . All the multitude . . . did go forth . . . with all them that were afflicted in any manner; and he did heal them every one. . . .</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that he commanded that their little children should be brought.</i><br><br><i>So they brought their little children and set them down upon the ground round about him. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . And Jesus . . . commanded the multitude that they should kneel down upon the ground.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>Now consider the depth of the Savior's feeling expressed in this verse:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that when they had knelt upon the ground, Jesus groaned within himself, and said: Father, I am troubled because of the wickedness of the people of the house of Israel.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>Think of it. The Savior of mankind groaned in agony because of the wickedness of some of the Father's children.<br><br><i>And when he had said these words, he himself also knelt upon the earth; and behold he prayed unto the Father, . . . and the multitude did bear record who heard him. . . .</i><br><br><i>And no tongue can speak, neither can there be written by any man, neither can the hearts of men conceive so great and marvelous things as we both saw and heard Jesus speak; and no one can conceive of the joy which filled our souls at the time we heard him pray for us unto the Father.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end of praying unto the Father, he arose; but so great was the joy of the multitude that they were overcome.</i><br><br><i>And . . . Jesus . . . bade them arise.</i><br><br><i>And they arose from the earth, and he said unto them: Blessed are ye because of your faith. And now behold, my joy is full.</i><br><br><i>And when he had said these words, he wept, and the multitude bare record of it, and he took their little children, one by one, and blessed them, and prayed unto the Father for them.</i><br><br><i>And when he had done this he wept again.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>The depth of how our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ feel when They see us make mistakes or not do the things They know can bring happiness in our lives is beyond our capacity to appreciate, as is the height of Their rejoicing when we are obedient. Therefore, let us resolve to ever live righteously.<br><br>My reverence and inexpressible gratitude for the Atonement of the Holy One of Israel, the Prince of Peace, and our Redeemer continually expands as I strive to understand more about it. I realize that no mortal mind can adequately conceive, nor can human tongue appropriately express, the full significance of all that Jesus Christ has done for our Heavenly Father's children through His Atonement. Yet it is vital that we each learn what we can about it. The Atonement is that essential ingredient of our Father in Heaven's plan of happiness without which that plan would have no significant meaning.<br><br>I strongly believe that there is an imperative need for you to strengthen your understanding of the significance of the Atonement of Jesus Christ so that it will become the secure foundation upon which to build the balance of your life. As the world in which you will live becomes more devoid of foundational standards and principles, and as honor, virtue, and purity are increasingly cast aside for the pursuit of appetite with an attitude of "me first" and "I want the biggest," your understanding of and faith in the Atonement of Jesus Christ will provide much-needed strength and capacity in your life. It will also bring confidence in times of trial and peace in moments ofturmoil.<br><br>I energetically encourage you to establish a personal plan to better understand and appreciate the incomparable, eternal, infinite consequences of the perfect fulfillment by Jesus Christ of His divinely appointed calling as our Savior and Redeemer. Profound personal pondering of the scriptures accompanied by searching, heartfelt prayer will fortify your understanding of and appreciation for the Atonement. Your understanding can be strengthened through related classes as well as by discussions with faculty and students. Your understanding could be enhanced by a pause in your university studies to fulfill a call as a devoted full-time missionary. Whatever path you follow, please establish for yourself a must-be-accomplished goal to acquire a better understanding of the Atonement while you are a student at Brigham Young University.<br><br>This may seem to be a significantly added burden that you cannot realize because of the press of all else you are required to do while enrolled here. However, as an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ--and I do not use those words lightly--I testify that your understanding of the Atonement and the insight it provides for your life will greatly enhance your productive use of all of the knowledge, experience, and skills you acquire at this university.<br><br>I pray that we will remember how deep are the feelings of our Father and of His Perfect Son so that our actions will generate for Them joy--not sorrow and disappointment. I encourage you to increase those things in your life that will please our Father and His Son, for which They would be grateful. And also, if needed, have an awareness of things that can be strengthened in your life so as to avoid personal remorse and concern by Them for you.<br><br>The Atonement is something that none of us can ever adequately appreciate, yet I believe that it is beneficial to try to imagine what it required of both the Father and His willing Son. Three of the things the Savior faced were:<br><br>First, an enormous sense of responsibility, for He realized that except it be done perfectly, not one of His Father's children could return to Him, for they would be forever banished from His presence--there being no way for them to repent for broken laws. His Father's plan would have failed, and each spirit would have been under the eternal control and torment of Satan.<br><br>Second, in His absolutely pure mind and heart He had to personally experience all that mankind would ever encounter, even the consequences of the most depraved, despicable transgressions.<br><br>Third, He had to endure the vicious attack of Satan's hoards while physically and emotionally stressed to the limit. Then, for reasons we cannot fully know, while at the extremity of His capacity, at the time the Savior most needed succor, His Father withdrew His support. The Redeemer shouldered the onerous responsibility completely alone.<br><br>How it must have wrenched His Father with pain to hear His matchless Son cry out, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"<sup>8</sup><br><br>I love our Father and His Beloved Son beyond my power to express. I bear witness that They live. They love you and will make it possible for your every need to be satisfied as you qualify in obedience for all of the blessings They would want you to have on this earth. I know They live. I am an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ and testify of this with every capacity of my being. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Richard G.

<h1>on Life’s Billows”: Take a Friend - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, Vice President Rogers, for your kind introduction. The music was beautiful. Brothers and sisters, honored guests, my esteemed colleagues and staff, and my dear, treasured students: welcome. It is an honor to be speaking to you today.<br><br>Many of you were present on January 15 of this year when President Henry B. Eyring gave his address about the trials that people face over a lifetime. He named three:<br><br><i>First: We can feel overcome with pain and sorrow at the death of a loved one.</i><br><br><i>Second: Each of us will struggle against fierce opposition--some of which comes from dealing with our physical needs and some from enemies.</i><br><br><i>Third: Each of us who live past the age of accountability will feel the need to escape from the effects of sin. </i>["The Power of Deliverance," BYUdevotional, 15 January 2008]<br><br>Every loving parent and every loving adult in this room would like to protect you from the harsh trials that life will present to you, but we know no one who has escaped the difficult vicissitudes of life. We want you to be strong. We want you to know how to manage any difficulty that might come your way. We want you to be resilient when you are faced with life's trials. How do we help you develop those qualities? We can't and shouldn't make all your choices for you--that will not make you strong. So we give to you what wisdom we have gleaned along our paths through life. My task today is to share with you some of thatwisdom.<br><br>Over the past 10 years I have been involved in the lives of people who have experienced the death of a loved one. Helping them address the grief and bereavement and adjustments in their lives has been a tender, spiritual, and inspiring experience. As President Eyring noted, we will all have trials. Some of them will be to adjust to the deaths of loved ones in our lives.<br><br>David Balk's research at Kansas State University reports that 25 percent of college students experienced the death of a family member in the past year and that 30 percent experienced the death of a friend in that same time period (see David E. Balk and Laura C. Vesta, "Psychological Development During Four Years of Bereavement: A Longitudinal Case Study," <i>Death Studies</i> 22, no. 1 [January–February 1998]: 23–41). Mild, moderate, or severe grief can interfere with learning, with interpersonal relationships, and with sleeping, eating, and personal growth. Death is the last taboo of our American society. We can talk about it in the third person, and we can talk about it in movies, textbooks, and literature, but it is still very difficult to talk about it in everyday life. Many people will need a friend or friends during difficult times--they'll need someone they can talk to about the trials they are experiencing.<br><br>I have entitled my talk "'When upon Life's Billows': Take a Friend." Many of you are familiar with Johnson Oatman Jr.'s hymn "Count Your Blessings." The first verse is:<br><br><i>When upon life's billows you are tempest-tossed,</i><br><br><i>When you are discouraged, thinking all is lost,</i><br><br><i>Count your many blessings; name them one by one,</i><br><br><i>And it will surprise you what the Lord has done.</i><br><br>[<i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 241]<br><br>Friendship is one of the greatest blessings we can have. Our friends provide comfort and counsel. They accept--or at least tolerate--our peculiarities and often laugh spontaneously at our jokes. Most of all, they are really quite forgiving of our imperfections.<br><br>A dear friend gave me a bowl decorated with a quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson. It says, "A friend may well be reckoned the masterpiece of Nature" ("Friendship," <i>Essays: First Series</i> [1841]). In truth, a friend may well be a divine masterpiece. Professionally, I have worked as a college faculty member in psychiatric–mental health nursing. I have studied human relationships and health for decades. Research from the past 30 years on social support and health offers strong evidence for a positive relationship between social support and the outcomes of many health-related variables. Friendships, along with kinship or family relationships, are the most researched social relationships. Today Iwant to focus on friendship.<br><br>In particular, I want to talk about four aspects of friendship that I hope will offer some assistance to you throughout your life: (1) make friends, (2) make friends with a wide variety of people, (3) make your spouse your friend, and (4) make Christ your friend.<br><h2><b>Make Friends</b></h2><br>Most of you in this room are young. I hope that you have traversed the rocky road of adolescent friendships and are now ready for mature, reciprocal friendships. Mature relationships are precious. At this time in your lives, developing adult friendships may be complicated by the goal to find "the right one." You are anxious about whether you will ever find your "perfect love," "soul mate," and "lifelong partner." For many of you, one of your goals for your time at BYU is to find a partner. And I am in support of that goal. It will happen for many of you, and it will be a great blessing in your lives.<br><br>But in your search for your partner, I hope that you will have time to make friends--good friends, maybe even lifelong friends. You can learn so much from them. Not all friendships become lifelong relationships, but friends can be the connections between all of us. Recently my ward bishop, Robert Merkley, gave one of the most eloquent and spiritual talks I have ever heard about loving one another and about Christ's love for us. He exhorted those listening to learn to truly love their brothers and sisters here on earth. I believe the Savior's teaching that we must love one another was pervasive and unlimited. Yes, our most important relationships will and should be those in our families, but friendships outside of our families can be very important and beautiful aswell.<br><br>There are scriptures that support the importance of good friendships:<br><ul><br>	<li>Exodus 33:11: "And the Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend."</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>1 Samuel 18:1: "And it came to pass, when hehad made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as hisown soul."</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>Mark 5:19: Christ said to a man whom He had just rid of unclean spirits, "Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee."</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>John 11:5: "Now Jesus loved Martha, and hersister, and Lazarus."</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>John 11:11: "These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him outof sleep."</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>John 11:35: When Jesus came to the grave where Lazarus lay, "Jesus wept."</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>John 15:13: "Greater love hath no man thanthis, that a man lay down his life for hisfriends."</li><br></ul><br>I believe that Jesus' friendships were deep,profound, and of great importance toHim.<br><br>Friendships take time and attention to develop, although I have observed that the process may not take as much time as you might think. I have seen 15 minutes of honest exchange make deep changes in a life. I know long talks can change lives as well. A friend is kind to you, knows and likes you, and wishes the best for you.<br><br>The scriptures talk about loving your neighbor. There may be a difference between a neighbor and a friend, but I don't think anyone would question that the good Samaritan described in Luke 10:29–37 was truly a friend to the man from Jericho. You know the story: Aman from Jericho fell among thieves and wasbeaten. A priest and a Levite both passed the wounded man, and neither offered help.<br><br><i>But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he hadcompassion on him,</i><br><br><i>And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care ofhim.</i><br><br><i>And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.</i><br><br><i>Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?</i><br><br><i>And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.</i> [Luke 10:33–37]<br><br>I think there is a very simple test for determining if someone is a good friend. Does your association with that person make you a better person? Does he or she inspire you to be the best that you can be? Does your friendship with that person sustain you during difficult times? Do you desire to make the world a better place for your friend? Do take time to makefriends.<br><h2><b>Make Friends with a Wide Variety of People</b></h2><br>The second point I would like to make is that we should make friends with all different types of people. There is often a great deal of loneliness on a campus this large. While talking to new people may be easy for some, for others it takes an extraordinary effort. Some people are self-conscious and painfully shy. As a mother I was aware of such diversities in my children, who are different from each other in their abilities to make friends. When they were young, two of my children could keep a room of people engaged and entertained, while the other two were quieter in temperament. One ran into the library and hid under a table when asked to read an essay at school. They have all matured now and all have friends, but, most important of all, they are friends to each other.<br><br>Even with our similarities, we as humans have many differences. If you are gregarious, take the time to befriend a quieter person--you can learn that quietness and silence are great teachers. If you are on the shy side, make the effort to get to know a few others; someone who is more outgoing could teach you how to speak up and be responsive in a group. Learn from each other.<br><br>I have noticed that there are some people who attract a large group of friends. Sometimes they attract more people than they can truly, reasonably spend a lot of time with. Often people who want to be their friend are offended when they do not receive the attention they would like. Don't be offended. Remember: friendships take time and nurturing. There are so many others who would love to have you for a friend and spend time with you. If you take offense that you have been left out or ignored, you will not be ready to see the possibilities for friendships with the people around you.<br><br>In <i>The Weight of Glory, </i>C. S. Lewis wrote:<br><br><i>It is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses, to remember that the dullest and most uninteresting person you talk to may one day be a creature which, if you saw it now, you would be strongly tempted to worship. ... It is in the light of these overwhelming possibilities, it is with the awe and the circumspection proper to them, that we should conduct all our dealings with one another, all friendships, all loves, all play, all politics.</i> <i>There are no</i> ordinary <i>people. You have never talked to a mere mortal. ... Your neighbour is the holiest object presented to your senses.</i> [C. S. Lewis, <i>The Weight of Glory and Other Addresses</i> (New York: Macmillan, 1949), 14–15; emphasis in original]<br><br>Make friends with a wide variety of people.<br><h2><b>Make Your Spouse Your Friend</b></h2><br>The third issue regarding friendship that Iwould like to discuss is that of making your spouse your friend. Some of you may marry someone you have known since you were children together, but most of you will not. You will marry someone you have gotten to know within months, or even a few years, before you marry. While your affection for one another is a good beginning for a strong relationship, it may take more to sustain a lifelong relationship. Hopefully the years will open up a wealth of experiences that you can share. But becoming true friends with each other will take time. Take time to listen to each other's concerns, dreams, and interests; plan things together; and support each other as best you can. Include each other in your everyday lives. Learn to appreciate that your spouse is unique and different from you and seek to understand him or her, even if you disagree. Encourage your spouse to develop his or her talents and interests, but also do things you both enjoy together. Again, remember that it takes time to make and keep a friend.<br><br>My husband and I have nearly raised our children, and now we have more time to nurture our relationship. Boy, was I clever! I married an amazing person--he gets better and better as I get to know him. I enjoy talking to him, listening to him, and just being with him. We don't agree on everything, but we do agree on the important things. I wish you well in making your spouse your best friend.<br><h2><b>Make Christ Your Friend</b></h2><br>The last issue I would like to address about friendship is that precious relationship you have with Christ. Some of you may know the song "What a Friend We Have in Jesus," with words by Joseph M. Scriven and music by Charles C. Converse:<br><br><i>What a friend we have in Jesus,</i><br><br><i>All our sins and griefs to bear!</i><br><br><i>What a privilege to carry</i><br><br><i>Everything to God in prayer!</i><br><br><i>Oh, what peace we often forfeit,</i><br><br><i>Oh, what needless pain we bear,</i><br><br><i>All because we do not carry</i><br><br><i>Everything to God in prayer!</i><br><br>The song implores us to take our grief, our sorrow, and our burdens to the Lord in prayer. He truly is our friend, and we can take our troubles to Him. He can be the friend we need.<br><br>Christ's atoning sacrifice is the essential cornerstone of our lives:<br><br><i>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in himshould not perish, but have everlasting life.</i> [John 3:16]<br><br>Through His atoning sacrifice we are made whole. It is a very unique and transforming experience to know and understand Christ's gift to us. Does it change you to know Him? What have you done because you know Him?<br><br>When I was a little older than most of you students, I moved to Utah from back East. I had made wonderful girlfriends in Boston, and a group of us moved from Boston to the West. (We've stayed in contact--many of us are dear friends today.) One of my friends had taken a position as a schoolteacher in Cokeville, Wyoming, and five of us planned a wonderful outing to visit her there for one day in May. Weplanned to go horseback riding in the afternoon, stay overnight, and return to Salt Lake the next day.<br><br>We arrived in the late morning, and within a short while we got into our friend's very large Cadillac to drive to the riding stables, which were just over a mountain pass about 45minutes away. It was cool in the morning, but by the time we left it was warm and pleasant. Some of us were dressed for riding--wearing boots, long pants, and a coat. Others had sneakers and sweaters. The car easily held all six of us.<br><br>We began the climb over the pass. As we made a turn, we saw an eagle in the road. It took off and soared in slow, arcing circles. It was a spectacular sight--a great omen for a wonderful day ahead, right? As we climbed higher, snow started to dot the sides of the road. The road started turning to mush, and it was getting harder to go forward. Even though we were still going up, we thought we must have been getting close to our destination. Eventually the car would go no farther--it was so mired in mud that we could not move it forward or backward. We tried everything we could think to do.<br><br>Because we were almost there, we got out and started walking toward the stables. We walked for a couple of hours, and it was hard in the muck and snow. We couldn't see any stables, houses, or any kind of shelter, and it was starting to get cold--it even starting snowing. We knew we needed to get back to the car for safety for the night, so we headed back.<br><br>By the time we got there, it was dark. We spent the night in the car. The only food we had was a box of cereal and a few candies, but our spirits were still high. We stayed warm by turning the heater on and off, and we tried to sleep, but, as you can imagine, it did not come easily. We prayed simply and earnestly for help and courage to handle the situation.<br><br>As the sun came up the next morning, we still couldn't get the car out. One person was only wearing sneakers, and her feet had become red and blistered from all the walking the previous day. She was unable to walk easily or quickly. Another friend stayed with her in the car while four of us started to walk back in the direction we had come.<br><br>We had walked for about an hour or two when we came upon two fishermen. They told us that they could not drive us out to the town from where they were because the roads needed to dry before their jeep could get out. They had been camping and had a campfire and food; they generously prepared a wonderful breakfast for us.<br><br>A little later, one of the men took the jeep and went in search of our car. He returned with my other two friends, who had started to walk; they were hobbling as they got out of the car. As these men were feeding my friends, one of them heated a pot of water, and after it was warm he had my friends sit down. He took each of my friends' feet and washed them, putting some salve on their sores and blisters and socks on their feet. The tender comfort and healing efforts of these two men was in similitude of our Savior. I don't know these men. The only piece of information that I remember was that they worked for the <i>Ogden Standard-Examiner.</i> A couple of hours later they drove us to my friend's house, and we returned to Salt Lake later that day.<br><br>As I recall that day, I don't remember being afraid or even worried very much. Three decades later, I remember vividly not the near tragedy but the beautiful image of true compassion--a compassionate man washing the feet of a stranger.<br><br>I am very grateful for my wonderful friends. I ask those of you who know Christ, who believe in Christ, and who have faith in Christ to let His example help you be a friend to others. Make a wide variety of friends. Make your spouse your friend. And, without question, make Christ your friend. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Beth Vaughan Cole was dean of the BYU College of Nursing when this devotional address was given on 8 April 2008.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1> to Love Learning - April 2008 Commencement - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My beloved brothers and sisters, I rejoice with you on this special day. Sister Bednar and I have loved watching you happy graduates and grateful family members celebrate a truly important accomplishment. Cameras are clicking, recorders are running, text messages are flying, and smiles are beaming all over this campus. Tonight and tomorrow convocations will convene, festive meals will be enjoyed, and plans for the future will be discussed. This is a day both for remembering and for making memories.<br><br>I recall with fondness the day I graduated from Brigham Young University with my undergraduate degree. Susan and I were just a few days away from the birth of our first child, I was about to begin work on a master's degree, we were really poor, and together we looked forward with anticipation to the opportunities and challenges of the future. That graduation day for us marked a beginning rather than a conclusion. And as Sister Bednar and I review our lives and look back on that important day, we recognize and acknowledge the guiding hand and tender mercies of the Lord.<br><br>Over the course of my life, I have participated in commencement ceremonies asa student, as a parent, as a professor, as a university president, as a friend, and as a spectator. Ifrankly cannot recall precisely how many commencements I have attended, but it is a very large number. And I readily admit that Igenuinely enjoy commencement day on a university campus.<br><br>My experience in commencement ceremonies has taught me a valuable lesson: graduates and their families care little about and rarely remember anything a commencement speaker says. I certainly believe that truth applies here today.<br><br>My graduation gift to you is a shorter-than-you-expect commencement message that focuses upon the principle of learning to love learning. I want to briefly discuss the importance of learning to love learning in three aspects of our lives. Learning to love learning is central to the gospel of Jesus Christ, is vital to our ongoing spiritual and personal development, and is an absolute necessity in the world in which we do now and will yet live, serve, and work.<br><h2><b>1. Learning to Love Learning Is Central to the Gospel of Jesus Christ</b></h2><br>The overarching purpose of Heavenly Father's great plan of happiness is to provide His spirit children with opportunities to learn. The Atonement of Jesus Christ and the agency afforded to all of the Father's children through His infinite and eternal sacrifice are divinely designed to facilitate our learning. The Savior said, "Learn of me, and listen to my words; walk in the meekness of my Spirit, and you shall have peace in me" (D&amp;amp;C 19:23).<br><br>We are assisted in learning of and listening to the words of Christ by the Holy Ghost, even the third member of the Godhead. The Holy Ghost reveals and witnesses the truth of all things and brings all things to our remembrance (see John 14:26, 16:13; Moroni 10:5; D&amp;amp;C 39:6). The Holy Ghost is the teacher who kindles within us an abiding love of and for learning.<br><br>We repeatedly are admonished in the revelations to ask in faith when we lack knowledge (see James 1:5–6), to "seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118), and to inquire of God that we might receive instruction from His Spirit (see D&amp;amp;C 6:14) and "know mysteries which are great and marvelous" (D&amp;amp;C 6:11). The restored Church of Jesus Christ exists today to help individuals and families learn about and receive the blessings of the Savior's gospel.<br><br>A hierarchy of importance exists among the things you and I can learn. Indeed, all learning is not equally important. The Apostle Paul taught this truth in his second epistle to Timothy as he warned that in the latter days many people would be "ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth" (2 Timothy 3:7).<br><br>Some facts are helpful or interesting to know. Some knowledge is useful to learn and apply. But gospel truths are essential for us to understand and live if we are to become what our Heavenly Father yearns for us to become. The type of learning I am attempting to describe is not merely the accumulation of data and facts and frameworks; rather, it is acquiring and applying knowledge for righteousness.<br><br>The revelations teach us that "the glory of God is intelligence" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36). We typically may think the word <i>intelligence</i> in this scripture denotes innate cognitive ability or a particular gift for academic work. In this verse, however, one of the meanings of <i>intelligence</i> is the application of the knowledge we obtain for righteous purposes. As President David O. McKay taught, the learning "for which the Church stands . . . is the application of knowledge to the development of a noble and Godlike character" (David O. McKay, "True Education," <i>Improvement Era,</i> March 1957, 141).<br><br>You and I are here upon the earth to preparefor eternity, to learn how to learn, tolearn things that are temporally important and eternally essential, and to assist others in learning wisdom and truth (see D&amp;amp;C 97:1). Understanding who we are, where we came from, and why we are upon the earth places upon each of us a great responsibility both to learn how to learn and to learn to love learning.<br><h2><b>2. Learning to Love Learning Is Vital to Our Ongoing Spiritual and Personal Development</b></h2><br>Brigham Young, the man for whom this university appropriately is named, was a learner. Although President Young had only 11 days of formal schooling, he understood the need for learning both the wisdom of God and the things of the world. He was a furniture maker, a missionary, a colonizer, a governor, and the Lord's prophet.<br><br>I marvel at both the way Brigham Young learned and how much he learned. He never ceased learning from the revelations of the Lord, from the scriptures, and from good books. Perhaps President Young was such a consummate learner precisely because he was not constrained unduly by the arbitrary boundaries so often imposed through the structures and processes of formal education. He clearly learned to love learning. He clearly learned how to learn. He ultimately became a powerful disciple and teacher precisely because he first was an effective learner.<br><br>President Brigham Young repeatedly taught that "the object of [our mortal] existence is to learn" (<i>JD</i> 9:167). The following statements by President Young emphasize this truth:<br><br><b>Statement 1.</b> "The religion embraced by the Latter-day Saints, if only slightly understood, prompts them to search diligently after knowledge. There is no other people in existence more eager to see, hear, learn, and understand truth" (<i>JD</i> 8:6).<br><br><b>Statement 2.</b> "Put forth your ability to learn as fast as you can, and gather all the strength of mind and principle of faith you possibly can, and then distribute your knowledge to thepeople" (<i>JD</i> 8:146).<br><br><b>Statement 3.</b> "This work is a progressive work, this doctrine that is taught the Latter-day Saints in its nature is exalting, increasing, expanding and extending broader and broader until we can know as we are known, see as we are seen" (<i>JD</i> 16:165).<br><br><b>Statement 4.</b> "We are in the school [of mortality] and keep learning, and we do not expect to cease learning while we live on earth; and when we pass through the veil, we expect still to continue to learn and increase our fund of information. That may appear a strange idea to some; but it is for the plain and simple reason that we are not capacitated to receive all knowledge at once. We must therefore receive a little here and a little there" (<i>JD</i> 6:286).<br><br><b>Statement 5.</b> "We might ask, when shall we cease to learn? I will give you my opinion about it: never, never" (<i>JD</i> 3:203).<br><br>Brigham Young's acceptance of and conversion to the gospel of Jesus Christ fueled his unceasing curiosity and love of learning. The ongoing spiritual and personal development evidenced in the life of Brigham Young is a worthy example for you and for me.<br><h2><b>3. Learning to Love Learning Is an Absolute Necessity in the World in Which We Do Now and Will Yet Live, Serve, and Work</b></h2><br>Many of you already have posed for graduation pictures with family and friends by the landmark sign located at the entrance to this campus on which the following motto is found: "Enter to learn; go forth to serve." This expression certainly does not imply that everything necessary for a lifetime of meaningful service can or will be obtained during a few short years on this campus. Rather, the spirit of this statement is that students come to receive foundational instruction about learning how to learn and learning to love learning. Furthermore, your desire and capacity to serve have not been "put on hold" during your years of intellectual exploration and development on this campus. As students you have served in many and meaningful ways. Thus, you entered both to learn and to serve.<br><br>May I respectfully suggest an addition to this well-known motto that is too long to put on the sign but important for us to remember: "Enter to learn to love learning and serving; go forth to continue learning and serving." Truly you entered Brigham Young University to learn to love learning and serving. As you now depart from this campus to pursue family, educational, and career opportunities, you are going forth to continue both learning and serving.<br><br>Today as we bask in the satisfaction of worthy accomplishment, each of us certainly realizes that academic assignments, test scores, and a cumulative GPA have not produced a final and polished product. Rather, you have only started to put in place a foundation of learning upon which you can build forever. Much of the data and knowledge obtained through a specific major or program of study may rapidly become outdated and obsolete. The particular topics investigated and learned are not nearly as important as what has been learned about learning. As we press forward in life--spiritually, interpersonally, and professionally--no book of answers is readily available with guidelines and solutions to the great challenges of life. All we have is our capacity tolearn and our love of and for learning.<br><br>I believe a basic test exists of our capacity to learn and the measure of our love of learning. Here is the test: When you and I do not know what to do or how to proceed to achieve a particular outcome--when we are confronted with a problem that has no clear answer and no prescribed pattern for resolution--how do we learn what to do?<br><br>This was precisely the situation in which Nephi found himself as he was commanded to build a ship. "And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me, saying: Thou shalt construct a ship, after the manner which I shall show thee, that I may carry thy people across these waters" (1 Nephi 17:8).<br><br>Nephi was not a sailor. He had been reared in Jerusalem, an inland city, rather than along the borders of the Mediterranean Sea. It seems unlikely that he knew much about or had experience with the tools and skills necessary to build a ship. He may not have ever previously seen an oceangoing vessel. In essence, then, Nephi was commanded and instructed to build something he had never built before in order to go someplace he had never been before.<br><br>Now I doubt any of us will be commanded to build a ship as was Nephi, but each of us will have our spiritual and learning capabilities tested over and over and over again. The ever-accelerating rate of change in our modern world will force us into uncharted territory and demanding circumstances.<br><br>For example, the U.S. Department of Labor estimates that today's graduates will have between 10 and 14 different jobs--by the time they are 38 years old. And the necessary skills to perform successfully in each job assignment will constantly change and evolve.<br><br>For much of my career as a professor, there was no Internet, no Google, no Wikipedia, no YouTube, and no TelePresence. The Internet only began to be widely used by the general public in the mid-1990s. Prior to that time, no courses were taught about and no majors were offered in Internet-related subjects. I remember teaching myself HTML and experimenting with ways student learning could be enhanced through this new and emerging technology. In contrast, most of you have never known and cannot imagine a world without the Internet and its associated technologies. I know I am revealing my advanced age, but the change from my "no Internet world" to your "Internet only world" has occurred within the last 15 years. Can we even begin to imagine how much things will continue to change during the next 15 years?<br><br>Because vast amounts of information are so readily available and sophisticated technologies make possible widespread and even global collaboration, we may be prone to put our trust in "the arm of flesh" (2 Nephi 4:34; see also 28:31) as we grapple with complex challenges and problems. We perhaps might be inclined to rely primarily upon our individual and collective capacity to reason, to innovate, to plan, and to execute. Certainly we must use our God-given abilities to the fullest, employ our best efforts, and exercise appropriate judgment as we encounter the opportunities of life. But our mortal best is never enough.<br><br>President Brigham Young testified that we are never left alone or on our own:<br><br><i>My knowledge is, if you will follow the teachings of Jesus Christ and his Apostles, as recorded in the New Testament, every man and woman will be put in possession of the Holy Ghost. . . . They will know things that are, that will be, and that have been. They will understand things in heaven, things on the earth, and things under the earth, things of time, and things of eternity, according to their several callings and capacities.</i> [<i>JD</i> 1:243]<br><br>I congratulate you on this special day. I pray you have been blessed with a deep and enduring love of learning. Learning to love learning equips us for an ever-changing and unpredictable future. Knowing how to learn prepares us to discern and act upon opportunities that others may not readily recognize. I am confident you will pass the test of learning what to do when you do not know what to do or how to proceed.<br><br>As our sons left home to attend college, to serve as missionaries, and to pursue their personal and professional dreams, Sister Bednar and Ishared with them the following counsel:<br><ul><br> 	<li>Remember that you represent the Savior.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Remember that you represent your family.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Remember that you represent The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.And as you now graduate from BYU, let me add one more item to the list:</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Remember that you represent Brigham Young University.</li><br></ul><br>Today you become alumni of Brigham Young University and have the responsibility to help the world better understand who we are and what we do at this remarkable institution. How you live, what you do, and what you become ultimately define this university. May the Lord bless you as you always remember Him and serve Him with faith and diligence.<br><br>I witness the living reality of God the Eternal Father, of our Savior and Redeemer, even the Lord Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Ghost. I also declare my witness that the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored to the earth in these latter days.<br><br>I pray your love of learning will grow ever deeper, ever richer, and ever more complete, inthe name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>David A. Bednar was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this commencement address was given on 24 April 2008.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>w Go Forth - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My wife's great-uncle and great-aunt are two of the kindest, most spiritual people I know, but financially their life together has often been less than comfortable. He worked as a schoolteacher, and she stayed home with the four children. From a fairly young age, the great-aunt suffered from various medical problems, and medical expenses put an almost unmanageable strain on the family's modest income. One of their few possessions was a beat-up, unreliable old car.<br><br>One day a woman unknown to the family arrived unannounced with the key to a new automobile, donated by an anonymous individual. To this day, this couple still does not know the identity of their benefactor.<br><br>Fellow graduates, think for a moment upon ways in which you have been blessed. Perhaps foremost among our blessings, and far more valuable than an automobile, is an education at one of the finest institutions in the world. Reflect for a moment upon what made this education possible. Many had a portion of their schooling financed by scholarships or grants. Perhaps parents, high school teachers, Church leaders, mentors, or college professors encouraged us in our education or supported us during times of self-doubt or other challenges. All of us have benefited from BYU's renowned reputation, forged by earlier graduates who built careers and communities based on integrity and intellectual achievement.<br><br>Today as we look around us, we see men and women trained "even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118), and we find ourselves prepared to enter the Lord's and society's service in new and thrilling ways. Dividends of many types will certainly accrue as we reap the rewards of our training. Undoubtedly we have been given much, and "unto whom much is given much is required" (D&amp;amp;C 82:3).<br><br>I recently read in the BYU Marriott School alumni magazine an article that related the following inspiring story of a man who lived the spirit of giving:<br><br><i>On 23 December 1999 there was a poor man in Kansas City looking for some warm winter clothing in a Salvation Army thrift shop. He had seventy-five cents in his pocket. Suddenly someone approached him from behind and said, "Excuse me." He turned around, and a man pushed a hundred-dollar bill into his hand, said, "Merry Christmas," and walked away.</i><br><br><i>That wasn't the first time something like this had happened. It had been going on for years, and no one knew the giver's identity. He was only known as Secret Santa. He would walk around during the Christmas season giving money to people who needed food, clothing, or shelter.</i><br><br><i>He came forward in 2006, because he had terminal cancer and was given one month to live. His doctor told him that if he wanted anybody to understand his mission then he should reveal his identity. Secret Santa's real name was Larry Stewart, and he was a very wealthy entrepreneur.</i><br><br><i>He'd given away $1.3 million in hundred-dollar bills, but he had also given away tens of millions of dollars more in traditional philanthropy. . . .</i><br><br><i>When the press asked him why he gave so much, he said, "I'm just doing what the Lord is directing me to do. I'm just a pair of hands and feet. He's using me. He's lighted my path. Part of my daily prayer was, 'Lord, let me be a better servant.' I had no idea this is what he had in mind, but I'm happy. I'm so thrilled he is able to use me in this way."</i> [Arthur C. Brooks, "The Privilege of Giving," <i>Marriott Alumni Magazine,</i> winter 2008, 16–18]<br><br>What a tremendous example of one who used his resources to help meet community needs. For many of us the time is still far distant when we can donate millions of dollars to philanthropic causes, but even the graduate's $10 bill, like the widow's mite, can bless giver and receiver alike.<br><br>In his book <i>Winners Never Cheat,</i> self-made billionaire Jon Huntsman, Sr., devoted an entire chapter to charitable giving. Mr. Huntsman has given hundreds of millions of dollars to worthy causes, including the famous Huntsman Cancer Institute. The avid philanthropist arose from humble beginnings, earning only $320 a month early in his married life, but he and his wife made the conscious decision to give to worthy causes every year. He wrote, "You don't have to be a billionaire to be a philanthropist. . . . All that is required to be a philanthropist is a passion for making a difference" (Jon M. Huntsman, <i>Winners Never Cheat: Everyday Values That We Learned as Children</i> [Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Wharton School Publishing, 2005], 169–70).<br><br>I should note, however, that financial contributions are not the only means by which we may serve others. My wife, a recent BYU graduate, is a superb example to me in this regard. For the past two years she has worked as a special education teacher at a local elementary school. With the upcoming birth of our daughter, she looks forward to early retirement as a public educator and the beginning of a full-time career as a mother. Nonetheless, she's already eager to use her training as an educator to bless the lives of individuals outside of our family. In the fall we'll relocate to Dallas, and my thoughtful wife has already begun searching for voluntary child welfare organizations inwhich she can serve.<br><br>Her example teaches me that ultimately a BYU education isn't about what it can do for us. The real question is: How can the skills and training received at BYU bless the lives of those around us? Examples may include the accounting graduate who provides free income tax return assistance to low-income families, the nursing graduate who volunteers to teach a car seat safety course in the community, the political science graduate who helps citizens register to vote, or the English graduate who tutors disadvantaged children. Each of us is in an exciting position to determine how our individual skills and knowledge may best be used to meet community needs. My friends, there are endless ways in which we may serve and thus meet the call of the Master, who proclaimed that what we do unto the least of God's children, we do unto Him (see Matthew 25:40).<br><br>May we always stay close to Him, may we cherish our BYU experience, and may we seek always to share our blessings with others. Congratulations, fellow graduates, and best wishes for future success and service. Thankyou.<br><br><i>Matthew N. Daley spoke as the representative of his graduating class at BYU commencement on 24 April 2008.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>arken Unto the Counsels of God&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Graduates, families, brothers, sisters, guests, and friends, as we offer our hearty congratulations and commendations on this special day to those of you we honor in these exercises, I also want to add a few words of counsel and even caution. Before doing so, I wish to exert my special privilege in extending our warm welcome and greeting to all of you in attendance today. You honor us with your presence.<br><br>Each graduating class at BYU possesses some significant commonalities with past graduating classes but also some characteristics that make it remarkable in its own right. Let me mention some aggregate statistics you might find interesting.<br><br>As is usually the case, our 6,276 graduates come from all 50 states, five U.S. territories, and 66 other nations. About 30 percent hail from Utah, 13 percent are from California, and 5 percent come from the state of Washington. Other western states are close behind with significant representation. Almost a quarter of the graduates are from the College of Family, Home, and Social Sciences and more than a tenth each come from the College of Humanities and the Marriott School of Management.<br><br>Happily, over half of the individuals in the graduating class are already married, and I'm told the percentage will rise significantly in the days and weeks ahead. About a quarter of the undergraduate degree recipients attended other institutions of higher learning prior to transferring to BYU. Almost half of the graduate degree recipients attended other colleges or universities before enrolling at BYU.<br><br>Our youngest graduate today is 18 years ofage, and the oldest is my age. Both of them, like all of our graduates, have interesting stories that have brought them to this important milepost. Many of our graduates have served missions, some have served with distinction in the military, some have delayed their studies for a season to rear children and support spouses, and some have finished their work in less than four years. All have clearly qualified for the degrees that will be awarded today.<br><br>Given the clear direction of our board of trustees that BYU be primarily an undergraduate teaching institution, it is interesting to see that a large number from our graduating classes go on for additional education and training at some of the other fine universities in the United States and a few in other countries as well. For several years BYU has ranked near tenth place among the more than 4,200 baccalaureate degree–granting institutions in this country for producing students who go on to earn doctorates. We are also near the very top in producing successful candidates for graduate professional schools such as dentistry, law, and medicine.<br><br>Another characteristic that is always impressive to those who become familiar with our graduates is that three-fourths of them have functional facility with a second language. Almost half of our graduates have lived outside of the U.S. for at least one year, with many living abroad longer due to their service as missionaries. The involvement of our students in various kinds of community service and their success in competitions with students from other institutions in the arts, academics, and athletics has likewise been noteworthy andcommendable.<br><br>With all of the wonderful occurrences and experiences of the recent academic year, we also note with great tenderness the recent passing of our beloved prophet and leader President Gordon B. Hinckley. We will ever be grateful for his love and great influence on this campus and on its students, staff, and faculty. We likewise express our deep affection and respect for President Thomas S. Monson, who, as president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also serves as chairman of the BYU Board of Trustees. He and his counselors and the other members of the board provide remarkable support, leadership, and direction to us, and we must always be grateful for the confidence they posit in each of us.<br><br>In a similar vein, we must never forget the faithful tithe payers all around the world who make it possible for the board of trustees to arrive at decisions regarding expenditures so that all we find here is accessible and available for us. I know that I express the gratitude of each student, graduate, faculty member, and others privileged to learn and serve at Brigham Young University. We also express appreciation to the other generous donors and benefactors for their very significant contributions of great variety as well.<br><br>And now, if I may, let me add to my congratulations and commendations just a few words of counsel and caution. I do so not to detract from the great happiness and sense of relief of the occasion but hopefully to arm you further for the real success that is within your grasp if you do not allow yourselves to be distracted from the things of greatest importance in yourlives.<br><br>Today and tomorrow we will appropriately focus in large part on your academic achievements and milestones. Individually and as a group you have done very well and in the eyes of the world will be considered well trained and even well educated. This is as it should be. I am confident, however, that almost all of you understand that academic achievement is only part of the BYU equation.<br><br>You have been given tremendous opportunities for a wide variety of experiences that are also spiritually strengthening. You have met the academic requirements in religious education that are unique to our Church schools. You have encountered great faculty members and fellow students in all of your classes who have not only encouraged the further development of your testimonies but have also demonstrated their own faith in their interactions with you.<br><br>Most of you have participated in student wards and stakes, and all of you have been part of congregations that have provided opportunities for service to others and to God. You have been exposed to prophets and apostles and others of great faith who have delivered instructive and inspirational devotional and forum addresses.<br><br>My list could go on, but the central point is that your BYU education has been much, much more than the mastery of academic subjects or preparation for further education or employment in the workplace, as important as these are. You have been given the extraordinary and unique opportunity to prepare for devoted discipleship and competent leadership to assist you in your families, communities, and professions as well as in your primary quest to obtain eternal life.<br><br>As I think about you and our entire BYU community (including myself), the counsel and caution of Father Lehi's son Jacob constantly rings in my heart and head: "But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God" (2 Nephi 9:29). Your scholastic attainments at BYU are "good," to use the scriptural word, but the prophetic qualifier "if they hearken unto the counsels of God" is essential. In other words, for your learning in your discipline and even in your gospel studies to be "good," you must always listen to and obey the counsel of your Heavenly Father and His duly constituted servants.<br><br>Consider these chilling words of caution and warning. I think they would qualify for what Elder Neal A. Maxwell used to describe as "wintry doctrine":<br><br><i>But wo unto him that has the law given</i> [I would judge that a BYU graduate has received the "law"], <i>yea, that has all the commandments of God, like unto us, and that transgresseth them, and that wasteth the days of his probation, for awful is his state!</i><br><br><i>O that cunning plan of the evil one! O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish.</i> [2 Nephi 9:27–28]<br><br>And then comes the wonderful assurance with the qualification already mentioned: "But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God."<br><br>Jacob's brother Nephi was also concerned about these same issues and about us. In speaking of those who "are lifted up in the pride of their [own] eyes" and have created their own "stumbling block[s]" that have led them away from the truth, listen to 2 Nephi 26:20 with its interesting description of them and what must not happen to any of us: They "preach up unto themselves their own wisdom and their own learning" rather than "hearken[ing] unto the counsels of God."<br><br>As you leave BYU--some for a season and some perhaps forever--it is our hope and prayer that you will leave part of your heart here, just as we hope you will take part of BYU with you. This happens in many ways. We hope and expect you will never be the same because of what you have learned "by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118, 109:7) and what you have become while you were a student at BYU.<br><br>We hope you will remember with great fondness your classmates, roommates, ward members, teachers, Church leaders, and your many friends and associates. We hope you will take with you the high standards of academic rigor and integrity you have honed and learned while here just as you have strengthened, enhanced, and solidified your testimonies of the Father and the Son, of the Restoration of the gospel in our day, and of the great potential you have, together with your family--including for many of you the new family you will help create in the future--of achieving eternal life in the presence of Heavenly Father and His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. When you do this, remembering always to "hearken unto the counsels of God," you will represent your families, BYU, and the Lord's Church with distinction. In the name ofJesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O.

<h1>d Protection Provided by Worthy Music - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a joy for my wife, Wendy, and me to be with you, my dear brothers and sisters. From the BYU Marriott Center in Utah, we are broadcasting to many congregations throughout the world. Thanks to each of you for being with us.<br><br>We extend a special welcome to those who will soon be finishing high school and are attending a CES fireside broadcast for the first time. As you enroll in institutions of higher learning and continue your education, I hope you will participate in institute classes so that you may have this strong spiritual resource to balance your secular learning. You will also have opportunities to attend future CES firesides such as this. Take advantage of those occasions. They will enlighten and encourage you.<br><br>The title of my message tonight is "Power and Protection Provided by Worthy Music." This topic is especially applicable to young adults. As you know, people of your age have made many significant contributions as writers, composers, and connoisseurs of worthy music.<br><h2><b>Power</b></h2><br>The power of worthy music was felt tonight as we sang these words in our opening hymn:<br><br><i>Come, ye children of the Lord,</i><br><br><i>Let us sing with one accord.</i><br><br><i>Let us raise a joyful strain</i><br><br><i>To our Lord who soon will reign.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>Through music we raised our voices in powerful praise and prayer.<br><br>Such a hymn provides a pattern of worship that is pleasing to God. His prophet taught us to "praise the Lord with singing, with music, ... and with a prayer of praise and thanksgiving" (D&amp;amp;C 136:28).<br><br>I would like to express my sincere appreciation to the Ogden Institute of Religion choir. Thank you, Brother Ritchie, Brother Simon, and members of the choir, for your magnificent music. It has not only honored the Lord, but it has also touched our hearts deeply.<br><br>As the choir sang "When I Survey the Wondrous Cross," I was deeply moved. The message focuses on the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Written by the English poet Isaac Watts, those words bear repetition:<br><br><i>When I survey the wondrous cross,</i><br><br><i>On which the Prince of glory died,</i><br><br><i>My richest gain I count but loss,</i><br><br><i>And pour contempt on all my pride.</i><br><br><i>Forbid it, Lord! that I should boast,</i><br><br><i>Save in the death of Christ my God:</i><br><br><i>All the vain things that charm me most,</i><br><br><i>I sacrifice them to His blood.</i><br><br>. . .<br><br><i>Were the whole realm of nature mine,</i><br><br><i>That were a present far too small;</i><br><br><i>Love so amazing, so divine,</i><br><br><i>Demands my soul, my life, my all.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>Indeed, Isaac Watts did demand much from himself. In his lifetime he wrote approximately 600 hymns. Two of his most productive years were between his graduation from school at age 20 and his taking a job teaching when he was 22. At that young age many great hymns flowed from him. Lyrics by Isaac Watts in our book of hymns include, among others, "Joy to the World," "Sweet Is the Work," and "He Died! The Great Redeemer Died."<br><br>Even as a small boy, Isaac Watts had poetic potential.<br><br><i>Once, during family prayers, he began to laugh. Hisfather asked him why.</i> [Isaac] <i>replied that he had heard a sound and opened his eyes to see a mouse climbing a rope in a corner, and had immediately thought,</i><br><br><i>A little mouse for want of stairs</i><br><br><i>ran up a rope to say its prayers.</i><br><br><i>His father thought this irreverent, and proceeded to administer</i> [physical] <i>punishment, in the midst of which Isaac called out,</i><br><br><i>Father, father, mercy take,</i><br><br><i>and I will no more verses make.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>I would like to comment on another song in our hymnbook. The text of "How Great Thou Art" was first written by a young minister in Sweden. His name was Carl Gustav Boberg. He was only 25 years old. After attending a church meeting, he walked two miles along the southeastern coast of Sweden in a thunderstorm. The experience inspired him to write the words, which were later translated into English by Stuart K. Hine:<br><br><i>O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder</i><br><br><i>Consider all the works thy hands have made,</i><br><br><i>I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,</i><br><br><i>Thy pow'r thru-out the universe displayed;</i><br><br><i>Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee,</i><br><br><i>How great thou art! How great thou art!</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>On one occasion I was in a mission conference when a missionary with great compassion, with tears in his eyes, asked me, "Why did the Savior have to suffer so much?" I reached for our hymnbook, turned to this song, and answered his question with this verse:<br><br><i>And when I think that God, his Son not sparing,</i><br><br><i>Sent him to die, I scarce can take it in,</i><br><br><i>That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,</i><br><br><i>He bled and died to take away my sin.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>Jesus suffered so much because of His love for you and me. What a message! Worthy music is powerful. It has power to make us humble, prayerful, and grateful.<br><br>Prophets through all generations have taught the importance of worthy music in our expressions of worship. A few citations from the scriptures may serve to illustrate.<br><br>An Old Testament scripture bids us to "make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise" (Psalm 98:4). In the Hebrew language, those words literally mean to <i>burst</i> forth into song and to <i>shout</i> for joy. Contrast that spirit of enthusiasm with scenes we may see at church when some sing only passively and without a spirit of joy.<br><br>A New Testament scripture counsels me and you to have a well of good music within:<br><br><i>Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;</i><br><br><i>Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</i> [Ephesians 5:19–20]<br><br>Another New Testament verse says, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you . . . ; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord" (Colossians 3:16).<br><br>From the New Testament we also learn that the Lord and His Apostles concluded the Last Supper with a hymn before leaving for the Mount of Olives (see Matthew 26:30). That tradition continues in our day. Each time members of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles meet in the temple, we begin with a hymn. It sets a sweet, spiritual tone for our deliberations.<br><br>The Book of Mormon teaches that one's desire to sing praises to the Lord comes with one's complete conversion to Him. Alma asked this penetrating question:<br><br><i>I say unto you, my brethren, if ye have experienced a change of heart, and if ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel so now?</i> [Alma 5:26]<br><br>Ammon later exclaimed:<br><br><i>Blessed be the name of our God; let us sing to his praise, yea, let us give thanks to his holy name, for he doth work righteousness forever.</i> [Alma 26:8]<br><br>Complete conversion is the key to our experiencing God's greatest blessings. In the Doctrine and Covenants, we read this expression from the Lord:<br><br><i>For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 25:12]<br><br>In the preface to our book of hymns, the First Presidency has provided this statement:<br><br><i>Inspirational music is an essential part of our church meetings. The hymns invite the Spirit of the Lord, create a feeling of reverence, unify us as members, and provide a way for us to offer praises to the Lord.</i><br><br><i>Some of the greatest sermons are preached by the singing of hymns. Hymns move us to repentance and good works, build testimony and faith, comfort the weary, console the mourning, and inspire us to endure to the end.</i><br><br><i>We hope to see an increase of hymn singing in our congregations. We encourage all members, whether musically inclined or not, to join with us in singing the hymns. We hope leaders, teachers, and members who are called upon to speak will turn often to the hymnbook to find sermons presented powerfully and beautifully in verse. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Latter-day Saints should fill their homes with the sound of worthy music. . . .</i><br><br><i>Hymns can also help us withstand the temptations of the adversary. We encourage you to memorize your favorite hymns and study the scriptures that relate to them. Then, if unworthy thoughts enter your mind, sing a hymn to yourself, crowding out the evil with the good.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>Worthy music also has the power to persuade. We learn this lesson from the writings of John Jaques. He was born in England in 1827, a son of Wesleyan Methodist parents. In his youth John earnestly sought the true religion. He studied intensively with Latter-day Saint missionaries and, at the age of 18, became a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br><br><i>John's austere father, upset upon hearing this news, wrote: "I wished you . . . to attend the Wesleyan Chapel. They [the Mormons] do not teach you . . . [to] honor and obey your parents. I... hope you will give up the idea of belonging tosuch a party. . . . It is fiction."</i><br><br><i>John's reply, written March 14, 1847, when he was but twenty years of age, included these words: "Dear Father: I would pray . . . that I may understand the things of the Kingdom of God and carry my ideas to you. . . . Since I [joined the Church] my eyes have been opened, and I have been able to understand the truth. I can bear testimony to the truth . . . of the doctrines . . . in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints."</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>Three years later, at age 23, John Jaques wrote the words to this hymn that we know and love:<br><br><i>Oh say, what is truth? 'Tis the fairest gem</i><br><br><i>That the riches of worlds can produce,</i><br><br><i>And priceless the value of truth will be when</i><br><br><i>The proud monarch's costliest diadem</i><br><br><i>Is counted but dross and refuse.</i><br><br><i>Yes, say, what is truth? 'Tis the brightest prize</i><br><br><i>To which mortals or Gods can aspire.</i><br><br><i>Go search in the depths where it glittering lies,</i><br><br><i>Or ascend in pursuit to the loftiest skies:</i><br><br><i>'Tis an aim for the noblest desire.</i><br><br><i>The sceptre may fall from the despot's grasp</i><br><br><i>When with winds of stern justice he copes.</i><br><br><i>But the pillar of truth will endure to the last,</i><br><br><i>And its firm-rooted bulwarks outstand the rudeblast</i><br><br><i>And the wreck of the fell tyrant's hopes.</i><br><br><i>Then say, what is truth? 'Tis the last and the first,</i><br><br><i>For the limits of time it steps o'er.</i><br><br><i>Tho the heavens depart and the earth's fountains burst,</i><br><br><i>Truth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst,</i><br><br><i>Eternal, unchanged, evermore.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>John stood firm in his conviction of the truth. He remained true and faithful and ultimately served as assistant to the Church historian from 1889 until his death on June 1, 1900.<br><br>Music has a sweet power to promote unity and love in the family. Not only is it an important component of family home evenings, but it can exert a continuing influence for good well beyond times when children are small. For my gift to the family last Christmas, I prepared a compact-disc recording of musical memories. I sat at the piano and recorded a variety of music that I had sung or played to the children through the years. They liked it. Some of the grandchildren told me that the CDwas "cool."<br><br>To illustrate the enduring benefits of worthy music in the home, I have asked our available daughters to sing for you tonight. Since their childhood, they have enjoyed singing together.<br><br>Daughters, I'm going to introduce you. Perhaps each of you can wave to the congregation as I mention your name: Marsha Workman, Wendy Maxfield, Gloria Irion, Brenda Miles, Sylvia Webster, Julie Wittwer, Laurie Marsh, Rosalie Ringwood, and MarjorieHelsten.<br><br>Our son's wife, Britney, would like to have been here, but she is excused. She had a baby 11 days ago. Two other voices are missing--our deceased daughter, Emily, and her angel mother, Dantzel. Perhaps they are looking in from their windows in heaven. Our son, Russell, and I also enjoy singing with them, butwe will not impose that upon you tonight.<br><br>To illustrate the multigenerational merits of worthy music in the home, our daughters will be accompanied by two of their daughters: Katie Irion Owens on the piano and Rachel Miles on the flute. They will sing and play for you "Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee." After their music, I will resume my message.<br><br>[Elder Nelson's daughters and granddaughters sang and played "Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee."]<br><br>Thank you so much, daughters and granddaughters. Wendy and I love you dearly, as do your husbands and your families.<br><br>Many of you folks will be able to influence music that is selected in Church services in the future. A few thoughts may be helpful to you. Remember, music has power to provide spiritual nourishment.<sup>9</sup> It has healing power.<sup>10</sup> It has power to facilitate worship; it allows us to contemplate the Atonement and the Restoration of the gospel with its saving principles and exalting ordinances. Music provides power for us to express prayerful thoughts and bear testimony of sacred truths.<br><br>Music has power to overcome language barriers. In my experience, some of the most moving congregational singing has been rendered in languages that are foreign to me. Yet itspoke strongly to my soul.<br><br>The purpose of music in our Church services is not for performance but for worship. Prayerfully selected compositions and excellent performances are appropriate in our worship services when and if members feel a spirit of worship and of revelation. Church music should be supportive of the Lord and His work and not attract attention to itself.<br><h2><b>Protection</b></h2><br>Worthy music not only has power, but it can also provide protection. For many years President Boyd K. Packer has taught this concept. He has often quoted another statement issued by the First Presidency many years ago:<br><br><i>Music can be used to exalt and inspire or to carry messages of degradation and destruction. It is therefore important that as Latter-day Saints we at all times apply the principles of the gospel and seek the guidance of the Spirit in selecting the music with which we surround ourselves.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>Brethren and sisters, wherever we are, we should carefully choose what we see and hear. Some of you would not knowingly tolerate pornography in your homes, yet you would allow music into your lives that can be just as devastating.<br><br>Many youth listen to music that can be described as loud and fast, becoming louder and faster. It aims to agitate, not to pacify; to excite more than to calm. Beware of that kind of music.<br><br>As you know, continued exposure to loud sounds will, in time, damage delicate organs of hearing. In like manner, if you overindulge in loud music, you will more likely become spiritually deaf. You may not be able to hear the still, small voice. A scripture states:<br><br><i>The Lord your God . . . hath spoken unto you in a still small voice, but ye were past feeling, that ye could not feel his words.</i> [1 Nephi 17:45]<br><br>Do not degrade yourself with the numbing shabbiness and irreverence of music that is not worthy of you. Delete the rubbish from your minds and your iPods. Protect your own personal standards! Be selective! Be wise!<br><br>Do not allow unworthy, raucous music to enter your life. It is <i>not</i> harmless. It can weaken your defense and allow unworthy thoughts into your mind and pave the way to unworthy acts. Please remember:<br><br><i>That which</i> [does] <i>not edify is not of God, and is darkness.</i><br><br><i>That which is of God is light.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 50:23–24]<br><br>Dear brothers and sisters, please fill your minds with worthy sights and sounds. Cultivate your precious gift of the Holy Ghost. Protect it as the priceless gift that it is. Carefully listen for its quiet communication. You will be spiritually stronger if you do. You know the proverb "As [a man] thinketh in his heart, so is he" (Proverbs 23:7). As you control your thoughts, you control your actions. Indeed, worthy music can provide power and protection for your soul.<br><br>For the closing hymn for our fireside tonight, the Ogden LDS Institute of Religion choir will sing "Our Prayer to Thee."<sup>12</sup> I wrote the words to that song as my prayerful feelings for our Father in Heaven. Please receive this prayer as part of my testimony that God is our Father and that we are His children. I know that He lives. Jesus is the Christ and the Head of this Church that bears His holy name. Joseph Smith is the Prophet of this dispensation. President Thomas S. Monson is the Lord's prophet on the earth at this time. I so testify and express my love and blessing for each of you, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Russell M.

<h1>sons on Faith and Fear - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am humbled by the opportunity to speak to you today, and I pray that what I have to say will be helpful to you and pleasing to the Lord. I approach this opportunity with some fear--fear that I might not get the doctrine quite right, fear that you who know me will recognize the extent to which I don't practice what I am going to preach, and fear that because I have more questions about these matters than answers I won't have much to say that is useful. But I'll proceed upon faith. And that, really, is the point of my message today.<br><br>I am, primarily, a teacher of writing. And for me this speaking assignment has been, primarily, a writing assignment. It isn't finished, but time ran out and I had to stop. That's the way it is for me with important writing assignments.<br><br>It may be that the most important writing assignments are the ones we aren't able to finish. We aren't able to finish them because they engage us in a process of learning that doesn't have an end. I started this assignment with a plan for the finished product, but in the process of writing I learned things I hadn't anticipated, and now I'm going to say things that are not what I had initially planned. I had planned to say what I thought you needed to hear. But what I have ended up preparing to say today turns out to be what <i>I</i> need to hear. I think that's what good writing assignments do--they teach the writers themselves the things <i>they</i> need to learn. So I'll be talking to myself today, but I hope there is something in what Ihave to say that will be helpful to you.<br><h2><b>The Relationship Between Faith and Fear</b></h2><br>I have been learning about the relationship between faith and fear. I am beginning to think that the conflict between faith and fear--as much as that between good and evil--is the opposition that structures my experience in this life. Essentially, when I am living in faith, I don't fear change, or changing myself, for the better. But when I am living in fear, I find change and changing--for the better, at least--almost impossible. It is important to learn how to live in faith rather than in fear because the process of changing for the better is at the very foundation of the Father's plan for us. Changing for the better is what we are here in this life to do, and it is what the mission of His Son enables us to do.<br><br>So I want to share with you today what I have been learning about faith and fear. The first lesson I have learned is that, at least in my life, fear works directly against faith. Fear pulls me away from the Lord. To understand why that is, I have been looking at the scriptures to learn more about faith and its relationship to fear, and I want to share with you what I have found there. But I have also learned a second lesson, one that is most important: how to go about the process of rejecting my fears and living my faith, day to day, hour to hour. I want to..share that with you too.<br><h2><b>Lesson 1: Fear Works Against Faith</b></h2><br>I have learned while writing this talk something about how fear works against faith in my life. I've realized that fear weakens my faith more than I had recognized. When my faith is strong, I am happy, confident, and even energetic as I approach each day. I am able to remain calm as difficulties arise, to keep the relative importance of things in perspective, and to feel the comfort and guidance of the Spirit when I most need it. But then there are the times when I am anxious about the problems I face and worried about what is coming next. Those are hard times, lonely times. I don't feel capable of handling what the day will bring. At times like that I am likely to choose badly and make small problems worse by my reactions. I have learned that these are times offear.<br><br>I think fear works a little like a cold virus. Those viruses are all around us all the time. And fairly often I let one in and feel the early symptoms of a cold--a scratchy throat, a stuffy nose, a drop in energy, and telltale grumpiness. I've learned to pay attention to those symptoms, to take some vitamin C, and to get some rest. Most of the time the symptoms pass without slowing me down for very long. Sometimes, though, the virus pulls me down into a bad cold. When that happens I have to work on getting well and wait for the cold to run its course.<br><br>When I was younger I tried to ignore even the worst colds and continued my usual activities. But then one cold developed into pneumonia. It took a lot of time in bed, a lot of penicillin, and about a year of my life to get my strength back. That is how I learned to take every cold seriously and to be on the lookout for the symptoms--pneumonia can be life threatening, you know.<br><br>In my experience, fear is like that cold. Fear is out there all the time, ready for me to let it in. I often find myself a little anxious and worried, a little discouraged and doubtful. I often have moments when I don't feel capable of solving my problems, of meeting my challenges, of overcoming my sorrows. Those are symptoms that need immediate attention. I have learned this as a result of a few extended bouts with fear--times when I was as disabled spiritually and emotionally as I was physically when I had pneumonia. Fear, too, can be life threatening.<br><br>What is the source of fear? I think it is rooted in the assumption (one that comes all too easily to me if I am not paying attention) that I must solve all my problems and face all my challenges alone, using my own resources. That is frightening, because deep in my heart I know how limited those resources are. So when I am fearful, I am also hopeless. And without hope, I find myself paralyzed. Knowing that I am not capable of changing myself or my circumstances for the better, I stand frozen in fear.<br><br>That fear is a failure of faith.<br><h3><strong><i>The Power of Faith</i></strong></h3><br>So I have learned from this writing assignment to take very seriously the power of fear--to watch for its symptoms and to do what I must to address them directly when they come. Fear, coming on in little increments no more disabling than a nagging cough or stuffy nose, has the power to eventually cancel out the faith that would enable me to move ahead with confidence, knowing that with the Lord's help I can indeed change myself and even the circumstances around me for the better.<br><br>But I have also learned to take very seriously the power of faith to overcome and even eliminate fear. I have been learning about that lately from the Book of Mormon, where I have studied some familiar and very concise definitions of faith.<br><br>First, this one from the prophet Moroni:<br><br><i>I would show unto the world that faith is things which are hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith.</i> [Ether 12:6]<br><br>And this second one, from Alma:<br><br><i>Faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things; therefore if ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen, which are true.</i> [Alma 32:21]<br><br>These are clear and explicit definitions that demonstrate an important principle: faith is a <i>choice.</i> Specifically, faith is a choice to believe and then to act upon that belief. And it is a choice to believe and act without the assurance that would follow from what Alma calls "perfect knowledge." That is, faith is a choice to believe and to act upon that belief in the face ofuncertainty.<br><br>But this last idea--that we choose faith in the face of uncertainty--prompts a question. Atsome special times in my life the Spirit has witnessed to me that the restored gospel of Christ is true. Yet day to day I find myself uncertain in the face of my challenges and difficulties and readily subject to doubt and the fear that follows it. I have a testimony of the gospel. Yet, as I try day to day to live that gospel, I find myself having consciously to choose faith. Isn't that a contradiction? Having been given my own witness of truth, shouldn't I be beyond faith?<br><br>Maybe I should be, but I'm not. Why is that?<br><br>I think I've found an answer in a Bible story we all know. On a boat in the dark on a very stormy sea, Jesus was awakened by His frantic companions:<br><br>"Master, carest thou not that we perish?" (Mark 4:38).<br><br>The Lord calmed the storm and then asked them in response, "Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?" (Mark 4:40).<br><br>Indeed, how is it?<br><br>Before we try to answer that, think about this: Why did they <i>need</i> faith?<br><br>They had the Savior present in the boat with them. How could they possibly fear anything? I think they were fearful because, at that moment, the only things they had perfect knowledge of were the intensity of the storm, the fragility of their boat, the depth of the water, and their distance from the shore. At that moment their mortal senses were filled with fear: They could see and hear and feel thethreat of their circumstances.<br><br>They had, in days prior, witnessed for themselves the Savior's power. He had promised them the Father's blessings. Yet their memories of His works and His words and their hope in the future reality of His promises were not, at that moment, nearly so real to them as the storm.<br><br>This story helps me understand something important about faith. Faith is founded upon our memory of divine witnesses and blessings received in the past and upon our hope in divine promises for the future. Founded upon promises of the past and the future, our faith can be vulnerable when experiences in the present seem to contradict both. So even with knowledge of the truth, in the present moments of our day-to-day experience we remain subject to fear and must consciously choose again and again to believe, to remember, to hope, to have faith.<br><br>Here's the problem. I know the gospel of the Restoration is true. But I don't know what today, and much less tomorrow, will bring to me and to those I love. I have felt directly the Lord's love for me, but I don't know how or when the seemingly impossible problems that occupy my thoughts and prayers will be resolved. I know the Lord has promised that He will take care of me and mine, but still, day to day, my life often seems uncertain and painful.<br><br>So I have learned that each day--and, on some days, each moment--I must choose to proceed on the basis of faith, remembering the Lord's past blessings and believing in and acting upon my hope in His promises. I have to do that even when the evidence of present trouble is almost overwhelming. I have to remind myself constantly to choose faith and keep choosing faith in the face of realities that seem to contradict it and to do that for as long as it takes. This is, I think, what Moroni means by a "trial" of faith. I have to remind myself that this choice of faith will, sooner or later, result in answers to my prayers and miracles inmy life.<br><br>Here is another, more comprehensive definition of faith--this one from our Bible Dictionary:<br><br><i>Faith is to hope for things which are not seen, but which are true . . . , and must be centered in Jesus Christ in order to produce salvation. To have faith is to have confidence in something or someone. The Lord has revealed himself and his perfect character, possessing in their fulness all the attributes of love, knowledge, justice, mercy, unchangeableness, power, and every other needful thing, so as to enable the mind of man to place confidence in him without reservation.</i> [Bible Dictionary, s.v. "faith," 669]<br><br>This definition makes explicit something else that is implicit in the brief definitions of faith given to us by Alma and Moroni: The object of our faith--that which we have faith <i>in--</i>is the capacity of the Savior's Atonement to bless us, to heal us, and, as Elder David A. Bednar has emphasized, to enable us to act beyond our abilities (see "In the Strength of the Lord," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2004, 76–78).<br><br>As I have thought about this, I have begun to think that faith might well be the path that the power of the Atonement must travel if it is to transform our lives. It may be only in the moments when I am <i>filled</i> with faith, crowding out my fears, that I make myself available to the healing and enabling power of the Atonement. It may be only then that I can be comforted, restored, and made able to overcome my problems and to change for the better. Put another way, it may be that acting in faith to keep our covenants, sometimes directly in the face of fear, is the very transformation of our souls that the Atonement promises.<br><h2><b>Lesson 2: How to Daily Choose Faith over Fear</b></h2><br>The second lesson I want to discuss is how to actually put those actions of faith into daily practice and how to live each day in a way that draws constantly upon the blessings of the Atonement to dispel fears and enable change for the better. I have learned while preparing this message something about how I can engage myself very actively in the ongoing process of choosing to live with that kind of faith.<br><br>As I said a moment ago, I think faith might open a divine channel through which we can receive the transformative blessings of the Atonement. And I think the opposite might occur as well: Fear closes that channel. To put it bluntly, choosing fear--and fear, like faith, is a choice--may well keep the blessings of the Atonement from reaching us.<br><br>For me, this life is beginning to boil down to an ongoing choice between faith and fear. We choose constantly between faith in the capacity of the Atonement of Jesus Christ to bring us happiness and peace in the Lord's way and in His own time and fear that the trials of this world will put peace, happiness, progress, and answers to our prayers out of our reach. I think both these statements are true, by the way. The Atonement really does have the capacity to bring us happiness, peace, and power to change. And without our constant choice to keep the Atonement active in our lives, peace and happiness and positive change really are out of our reach.<br><br>In a way our situation is the same as that of the Savior's companions that night in the boat in the storm. We have in our experiences, in our scriptures, in our doctrines, and particularly in our covenants His promises of salvation in both this life and the next. But our problems, so insistently and empirically present to us in each moment, are almost always more real to us than those promises. If we choose that reality to live in, we choose fear over faith.<br><br>So what can we do about that? What, exactly, does it take--day by day, hour by hour--to choose faith over fear?<br><br>My youngest daughter and newest son-in-law are patiently therapeutic in their approach to my fearfulness. For my birthday last year they copied in calligraphy a quote from President Hinckley and framed it for my office. It hangs above my desk. This is what it says: "Itisn't as bad as you sometimes think it is. It all works out. Don't worry." I read that every day. Multiple times.<br><br>These are the first three sentences of a statement President Hinckley included in his wife's funeral program on a day that must have been one of the hardest of this good man's life. Here is the full statement:<br><br><i>It isn't as bad as you sometimes think it is. It all works out. Don't worry. I say that to myself every morning. It will all work out. . . . Put your trust in God, and move forward with faith and confidence in the future. The Lord will not forsake us. He will not forsake us. . . . If we will put our trust in Him, if we will pray to Him, if we will live worthy of His blessings, He will hear our prayers.</i> [Gordon B. Hinckley, quoted in Latter-day Counsel, "Excerpts from Addresses of President Gordon B. Hinckley," <i>Ensign,</i> October 2000, 73; see also "Put Your Trust in God," <i>Ensign,</i> February 2006, 63]<br><br>I think this is the answer to my question about how to go about the constant project of choosing faith. This is what faith looks like in daily practice. And if President Hinckley needed to remind himself daily to choose faith over fear, then I should probably be reminding myself even more often.<br><br>President Hinckley wasn't the only prophet who needed a reminder to choose faith instead of fear. Moroni did too. In Ether 12 he described his fear that he was not up to the Lord's assignment to write the gospel of Christ for his descendants. And he was right--he wasn't up to that task, at least not on his own. So he confessed his fears to the Lord and received this lesson in response:<br><br><i>And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</i> [Ether 12:27]<br><br>Could it be that when we find ourselves fearful--that is, when we find ourselves failing to choose faith--we should consider this a sign, a symptom even, of our urgent need to return to the Lord so He can strengthen our faith?<br><br>I think we should.<br><br>So how exactly do we return to Him? The Lord's lesson to Moroni suggests that humility is the way. It suggests that the first step in that turn to the Lord is to recognize that fear is a symptom of weakened faith. The second is to acknowledge this weakness (and our need for the Lord to help us overcome it) by renewing our trust in Him. As we begin to again trust the Lord more than our own capacities, we become humble.<br><br>That is how it worked out for Moroni. He recognized in his fear a lack of trust in the Lord. What did he do? He took his fear to the Lord--precisely what we all should do with our fears. When he did that, the Lord comforted him, taught him, and empowered him beyond his capacity. In humility, Moroni exercised his faith, and that faith enabled him to write of the Lord's plan with marvelous clarity and power.<br><br>Every time I find myself fearful, sooner or later I realize that I am not being particularly humble. I realize I have been trying to live my life and solve my problems on my own terms and with my own capacities--my own intellect, usually--and have forgotten to trust instead the power and plan of the Lord.<br><br>May I comment for a moment on the difficulty of being humble? As President Ezra Taft Benson taught us years ago, "Pride is a 'my will' rather than 'thy will' approach to life. The opposite of pride is humbleness, meekness, submissiveness . . . , or teachableness" ("Cleansing the Inner Vessel," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1986, 6). Pride is reliance on our own judgment, our own capacities, and our own purposes, unsubordinated to the Lord's.<br><br>And may I suggest that a university, even this university, can, if we are not careful, nurture pride? That is because a purpose of a university, even this university, is to enable people to achieve impressive feats of learning and expertise. That is why we are here--students and faculty alike--and these are goals that can, if not managed with humility, bring us topride.<br><br>Perhaps that is why so many of us here struggle with fear. As we increase in learning and skill, as we compete with and compare ourselves with others, we begin to rely on ourselves rather than on the Lord. But deep in our hearts we know how limited we really are. So we work and live in fear.<br><br>The point is that, like faith and fear, humility is also a choice. It is an ongoing choice to be made every moment of every day, sometimes in spite of circumstances that persistently teach us pride.<br><br>Because I need to be reminded to choose humility, I am glad that our daughters gave my wife, Linda, and me a particular Christmas gift a few years ago. We are empty nesters. Our three daughters are married, and so far none of them has chosen to live with us. In fact, only one of them lives anywhere near our time zone. So as the time approached for them to leave us, our two younger daughters gave us dogs.<br><br>I read somewhere that departing adult children do such things out of concern for the parents they feel they are abandoning. They think their parents' lives will be empty and void without them, so they try to replace themselves with pets for their parents to care for. May I suggest to you that this may be a misplaced concern?<br><br>Anyway, Linda and I have come to love these dogs. Each morning and afternoon they greet me with happy anticipation of a walk. So we walk. And as we walk, the dogs teach me lessons about humility. Tommy (a border collie mix) stays with me, but Lucy (a yellow Lab) is a wanderer. She frequently follows her nose off on a trail of her own. It's not that she wants to get away from me. It's just that when she finds an interesting scent, she forgets about me. Sometimes she comes back when I call, but at other times I have to go after her. When I catch up, she stops, wags her tail, and smiles at me. Dogs do smile, you know.<br><br>Tommy, however, is entirely reliable. He walks with me, sometimes going ahead but turning back constantly to be sure he is with me. He always comes when I call. When I need him to stop, like when we come to a busy road, I say "wait" and he waits, no matter how excited he is to proceed. Only when I say "okay" does he rocket ahead with a joyful bark.<br><br>I know people aren't, and shouldn't be, like dogs. So I'm not going to take this analogy very far. But I do learn from these dogs daily lessons in humility.<br><br>Here is one: A trainer once told us that dogs are happiest when they understand clearly their relationship to their master. I think that we, too, are happiest when we understand clearly our relationship with our Master--our Savior--and give our hearts and wills entirely to Him.<br><br>Here is another lesson: I should be like Tommy, staying close to my Master at all times, learning His language, keeping Him in sight, obeying His commandments without hesitation, and always coming when called.<br><br>Here is a third lesson: I should be like Tommy, but I'm more like Lucy. I get distracted by my own agenda and follow my nose off the Lord's path. But when He comes to get me, I should respond to Him as Lucy responds to me when I catch up to her. She is glad to see me, glad to turn and follow me. I should smile when I see Him coming.<br><br>So here is a summary of that second lesson I have learned from this writing assignment--a lesson on how to go about choosing faith instead of fear: If I am humble, if I work constantly to choose attitudes and actions of humility before the Lord, then He will be able to strengthen my faith and eliminate my fears. The healing and enabling power of the Savior's Atonement--of His love, really--will become more real to me than the threats carried by any storm I might otherwise fear. I have learned, simply put, that active and practical humility isthe way we choose faith.<br><h2><b>Staying Humble and Choosing Faith</b></h2><br>So what, exactly, do I need to do each day to be humble enough to fully choose faith? A few years after I began teaching here, President Henry B. Eyring--then Elder Eyring--spoke to the faculty here in the de Jong Concert Hall, and at the end of his remarks he directed us to a scripture. It is a profoundly simple one that I hadn't noticed before but that has since remained very present in my mind. I think this scripture, in words spoken by Mormon and recorded by Moroni, may say all that needs to be said about how to live in humility and choose faith:<br><br><i>And the first fruits of repentance is baptism; and baptism cometh by faith unto the fulfilling the commandments; and the fulfilling the commandments bringeth remission of sins;</i><br><br><i>And the remission of sins bringeth meekness, and lowliness of heart; and because of meekness and lowliness of heart cometh the visitation of the Holy Ghost, which Comforter filleth with hope and perfect love, which love endureth by diligence unto prayer, until the end shall come, when all the saints shall dwell with God.</i> [Moroni 8:25–26]<br><br>I think that's the answer--that's how we stay humble and choose faith. It's a process we should practice throughout all our lives, as regularly as the process of waking and sleeping. By choosing to live our lives within the context of this ongoing process of repentance and renewal, we keep our covenants. And through keeping our covenants we change, andare changed, for the better.<br><br>What about fear? Fear is the primary target of this repentance and renewal process. And fear is the prompting to turn, and return, to the Lord--a process that begins in an act of humility. In humility we choose faith, and faith becomes the channel through which the Lord blesses us with hope and miracles and perfect love.<br><br>So that is what I have learned about faith and fear. Maybe these lessons apply to some of you too. In faith, we are free of fear. In faith, we are blessed with peace that comes in the form of confidence--confidence that as bad things happen, as problems arise, as confusion confronts us, as people hurt or disappoint us, and as people we love suffer, in the midst of all the storms of this life, <i>all is well,</i> as our carillon bells remind us every hour on the hour.<br><br>I am grateful for the peace and the confidence and the strength that comes when my faith refutes my fears. I am grateful for the blessings of the Atonement that strengthen my faith when I turn, and return, in humility to the Lord. I pray that we may each be more humble and so choose greater faith, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Gregory Clark was associate dean of the BYU College of Humanities when this devotional address was given on 6 May 2008.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>orward with a Steadfastness in Christ” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Having a hope in Christ is a theme woven throughout the scriptures. The word <i>hope</i> can imply a simple wish, or it can suggest a declaration founded upon experience and knowledge. The Apostle Paul said, "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen" (Hebrews 11:1). The hope that Paul describes is much richer than and different from a mere wish. Rather, it is related to knowledge, and it leads to a life of diligence. If we take a difficult class and put forth little effort to study or prepare for exams and assignments, we might say, "Ihope I get an A in this class," but in reality that hope is nothing more than a wish--and, deep inside, we know it. If, however, we study effectively, monitor our progress, make corrections when necessary, and do all in our power to perform well in the class, we may be able to declare with assurance, "I have a hope that I will get an A in this class." Such a hope will be well founded, and deep inside we will have confidence that it will come to pass.<br><br>According to Paul, if something exists that we cannot detect with the natural senses, then faith is the evidence that it is real. For those of us who have faith in God and His Son, Jesus Christ, that evidence, born of faith, is very real. Paul said that "faith is the substance of things hoped for," or, in other words, hope is made up of the things in which we have faith. Faith precedes a true enduring hope that motivates us to "press forward with a steadfastness in Christ" (2 Nephi 31:20; see also verse 19).<br><br>A life well founded upon faith in Christ, obedience to His commandments, sincere repentance whenever needed, humility, and meekness solidifies a true hope in Christ and naturally motivates one to demonstrate that faith and hope through diligent service. Following this course, we will experience joy throughout our lives. Elder Richard G. Scott declared:<br><br><i>True, enduring happiness, with the accompanying strength, courage, and capacity to overcome the greatest difficulties, will come as you center your life in Jesus Christ. Obedience to His teachings provides a secure ascent in the journey of life. That takes effort. While there is no guarantee of overnight results, there is the assurance that, in the Lord's time, solutions will come, peace will prevail, and happiness will be yours.</i> [Richard G. Scott, "The Atonement Can Secure Your Peace and Happiness," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2006, 41]<br><br>In the Book of Mormon, Aaron, the missionary companion of Ammon, told King Lamoni's father:<br><br><i>If thou desirest</i> [to know God], <i>if thou wilt bow down before God, yea, if thou wilt repent of all thy sins, and will bow down before God, and call on his name in faith, believing that ye shall receive, then shalt thou receive the hope which thou desirest.</i> [Alma 22:16]<br><br>A life of repentance, obedience, and service that is motivated by a love of God and unshaken faith in Christ will generate a hope in Christ that will extend into the eternities. On the other hand, without "a perfect brightness of hope" in Christ (2 Nephi 31:20), we may desperately cling to the scriptures and living prophets without ever truly believing Christ (see 1 Nephi 8:24–25). When the storms of life blow, our faith may waver. The Apostle Paul declared, "If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable" (1Corinthians 15:19).<br><br>I have been fascinated for years with a portion of the vision of the tree of life recorded in 1 Nephi 8. In this vision Lehi described two groups of people who caught hold of the iron rod as they made their way to partake of the fruit on the tree of life. Remember that the iron rod represents the word of God and the fruit on the tree represents the love of God. One group pressed forward toward the tree, "clinging to the rod of iron" (verse 24), while another group pressed forward "holding fast to the rod of iron" (verse 30). The group that was clinging to the rod made it to the tree and partook of the fruit, but afterward, when the world mocked them, "they were ashamed" (verse 25) and fell away. The group that held fast to the rod as they pressed forward also partook of the fruit but then stayed. What was the difference?<br><br>To me, <i>clinging</i> suggests desperation--it'swhat might be done if there was fear or a lack of hope in their lives. Perhaps they did not really believe Christ or accept the Atonement, so when the world pressed upon them, they became ashamed and fell away. The Apostle Paul taught the Saints in Rome: "Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: . . . and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.... And hope maketh not ashamed" (Romans 5:1–2, 5).<br><br>The group that Lehi saw holding fast to the rod endured to the end. They had an unshaken faith in Christ and a perfect brightness of hope because of the Atonement. When I read the words <i>holding fast</i> in Lehi's description in his vision, I imagine individuals who stand firm against adversity or tribulation because of their hope in Christ. The Apostle Paul counseled the Saints to be "rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation" (Romans 12:12). We don't rejoice if we hope it doesn't rain tomorrow. We do rejoice, however, if we have a hope in Christ, and that hope helps us to be patient in tribulation.<br><br>Nephi, who shared in Lehi's vision of the tree of life and witnessed those who fell away after clinging to the rod of iron, expanded on this thought. He said:<br><br><i>And now, my beloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this strait and narrow path, I would ask if all is done? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for ye have not come thus far save it were by the word of Christ with unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men.</i> [2 Nephi 31:19–20]<br><br>Note that Nephi is telling us that after we have "gotten into this strait and narrow path" we "must press forward" with "unshaken faith," which leads to "a perfect brightness of hope" and "a love of God and of all men," what we may also call charity. "Unshaken faith"--"a perfect brightness of hope" and "alove of God and of all men"--that is the key. What promise do we have if we follow this formula? Nephi goes on to say:<br><br><i>Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.</i><br><br><i>And now, behold, my beloved brethren, this is theway; and there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God.</i> [2 Nephi 31:20–21]<br><br>A hope in Christ will motivate us to repent of our sins. Repentance will expand our capacity to receive and feel the Spirit and to enjoy the companionship of the Holy Ghost. It is through the power of the Holy Ghost that we "may abound in hope" (Romans 15:13). The corollary is also true. Sin causes the Spirit to withdraw--our faith in Christ diminishes, and we lose hope. If life seems hopeless, then we may want to at least consider our own personal worthiness, remembering that even such things as ingratitude constitute sin (see D&amp;amp;C 59:21). If we have fallen short, we can take comfort in knowing that Christ "is mighty to save" (2Nephi 31:19) and that "he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more" (D&amp;amp;C 58:42).<br><br>Attending the temple as frequently as our circumstances will allow is a great way to enter into this upward-lifting spiral of increasing faith and hope. I have considered that one of the great blessings associated with attending the temple is found in D&amp;amp;C 109, the inspired dedicatory prayer of the Kirtland Temple. In it Joseph Smith blessed "all those who shall worship in [the temple]" (verse 14) that when they "transgress . . . , they may speedily repent and return [to God]" (verse 21). What a tremendous blessing to be given a desire to speedily repent so that sin doesn't have time to compound orfester.<br><br>Consider also the pleas of the prophet Ether:<br><br><i>He did cry from the morning, even until the going down of the sun, exhorting the people to believe in God unto repentance . . . , saying unto them that by faith all things are fulfilled--</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a better world, yea, even a place at the right hand of God, which hope cometh of faith.</i> [Ether 12:3–4]<br><br>The natural man, clinging to the word of God but lacking a foundation of sincere repentance, faith, and hope, lacks an eternal perspective and tries to get through the here and now asking "Why me?" when trials arise. As the trials persist or intensify, he is not "willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him" (Mosiah 3:19) and is prone to murmur, saying, "It must not be true, or life wouldn't be so hard." Sons and daughters of God will humbly submit to adversity, knowing that ultimately God is in charge. They will have a hope that they will be better for the experience and that all will be well in the end. The Apostle Paul taught, "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him" (1 Corinthians 2:9).<br><br>C. S. Lewis put it this way:<br><br><i>When a man turns to Christ and seems to be getting on pretty well (in the sense that some of his bad habits are now corrected), he often feels that it would now be natural if things went fairly smoothly. When troubles come along--illnesses, money troubles, new kinds of temptation--he is disappointed. These things, he feels, might have been necessary to rouse him and make him repent in his bad old days; but why now? Because God is forcing him on, or up, to a higher level: putting him into situations where he will have to be very much braver, or more patient, or more loving, than he ever dreamed of being before. It seems to us all unnecessary: but that is because we have not yet had the slightest notion of the tremendous thing He means to make of us.</i> [C. S. Lewis, <i>Mere Christianity</i> (New York: Macmillan, 1960), 159–60]<br><br>This lesson has been taught to my wife and me in some profound ways. My wife has ancestors who were faithful Latter-day Saints going back to the early history of the Church. They were among the pioneers who traveled to the Salt Lake Valley in wagons and handcarts. The faith and dedication of her family have remained strong over the generations. Our two oldest daughters, Kristy and Laycee, were the fourth generation of sister missionaries in the family, following a pattern that started with their great-grandmother Cecil Vance Coombs. Our 14-year-old daughter, McKenzey, has expressed a similar desire to follow in their footsteps when she turns 21. I do not have a genealogical pioneer heritage, but with all members of the Church I share in the spiritual heritage the pioneers left us.<br><br>In our journey through life together, my wife and I have seen some parallels to the journey of the pioneers to the Salt Lake Valley. We started out with very little in the way of material possessions. We had great faith in one another, in our Heavenly Father, and in Christ, and we had a goal of an eternal family. Looking back from my current perspective, life was easy in the early years of our marriage. There were babies to be born, children to be raised, degrees to be earned, a career to be pursued, and callings to be fulfilled. For the most part, the course was a slow, steady, methodical journey across the great plains of life. There were occasional hills of adversity to climb, like the births of our third and fourth children, 10 years apart. Serious complications resulted in the babies being placed in the ICU for days. However, at the top of each hill of adversity we experienced a panoramic view on life, and then there always followed the beautiful, peaceful valleys before we encountered the next hill. Life was good. The sense of progress toward goals was strong. Our love and faith in each other and God continued to grow in a steady, deliberate way, matching our journey.<br><br>As our journey through life progressed, the trail became steeper and the hills bigger, just as in the case of the pioneer trek. Occasionally the Lord provided us with experiences that greatly increased our faith in Him, increasing our understanding of how personally and individually we are each loved and nurtured.<br><br>One major hill we encountered came at about 11:55 a.m. on June 3, 2001. I had stood up to close our ward's fast and testimony meeting when I felt a sharp pain and a tearing sensation followed by the gushing of blood in my left pelvis. The thought came to me quite distinctly: "I just ruptured my femoral artery. I am going to bleed to death in a few minutes." I looked out over the congregation to my family, thinking that it might be the last time I would see them in this life. I debated whether I should say something but decided that I did not want to disrupt the spirit of the meeting. So, after announcing the closing hymn and prayer, I just sat down. Our sacrament meeting was last in the block schedule, and I knew that I had several interviews to conduct and other business that needed to be addressed after the meeting. I was still alive and decided to continue in myduties.<br><br>Nearly six hours later I finally took the time to go to the emergency room. I explained to the nurse at the reception desk that I thought I had ruptured my femoral artery at noon that day. She kind of chuckled and said, "No, you would be dead by now." She asked me to describe the pain and thought it was probably a kidneystone.<br><br>We sat in the waiting room for about 30 minutes. When we were finally taken back to an exam room and were able to see a doctor, I described the pain and said that I thought Ihad ruptured my femoral artery at about noon that day. He gave a little chuckle and said, "You would probably be dead if that were true." He also indicated that he thought it was a kidney stone. He ordered a differential CAT scan to look for the stone.<br><br>A few minutes after the procedure, the doctor came back into the room and said, quite soberly, "There is a large pool of blood in your lower left abdomen." I was rushed to another hospital and prepped for emergency vascular surgery. It turned out that I had actually ruptured my left iliac artery, which is larger than the femoral. The reason I did not bleed to death is that shortly after the aneurysm, a flap of inner arterial lining folded over, occluding the artery above the rupture. Experiences like this provide evidence for the truth that God knows each of us personally. We are cared for as individuals. He knows exactly how to succor us.<br><br>We considered ourselves very blessed of the Lord. However, I remembered the words of C.S. Lewis:<br><br><i>Little people like you and me, if our prayers are sometimes granted, beyond all hope and probability, had better not draw hasty conclusions to our own advantage. If we were stronger, we might be less tenderly treated. If we were braver, we might be sent, with far less help, to defend far more desperate posts in the great battle.</i> [C. S. Lewis, "The Efficacy of Prayer," in <i>The World's Last Night and Other Essays</i> (New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company, 1960), 10–11]<br><br>I chose to speak about hope today because I have learned a lot about it over the past several years. There were other serious health issues, other surgeries, and other miracles. However, our trudge up Rocky Ridge in the face of the icy winds of adversity began on the afternoon of February 1, 2006, when we received the shocking news from Kansas that our daughter Laycee was in a hospital in a coma. She died the next day. We will be eternally thankful for the rescue parties the Lord sent in the form of loving family and friends. Truly they fulfilled the admonition of Alma "to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort" (Mosiah 18:9). We are especially thankful for the anonymous individual who allowed us to purchase a gravestone immediately after Laycee's death. This brought a great deal of comfort.<br><br>It was months before I began to see color in a life that had become gray. I feared that I might forget how to laugh or that I might never feel genuinely happy again. A day still does not go by that I do not think about Laycee several times. She was too well loved to ever be forgotten. Gradually the road became less steep and rocky. However, real healing, for me, did not come until 18 months later, after I climbed one more section of our own Rocky Ridge.<br><br>To set the stage for this experience, I will start by telling you that I have kept a daily journal for years. Writing in my journal is somewhat therapeutic. I record my thoughts and feelings along with events in my life. I also need to tell you that my career has caused me to travel a considerable amount. These trips involved many airline carriers, both foreign and domestic, to nearly every continent in the world. During all of this traveling, I had never lost a bag until one trip about six months after Laycee's death.<br><br>I was on a long trip that took me from Argentina to Chile to Ecuador, back to the U.S. through Miami, and then to Reno before Ireturned home to Provo. All of the bags made it through to Miami; however, somewhere between the nonstop flight from Miami to Reno, one bag was lost. I always put my journal in a carry-on bag so that it is with me at all times--I cherish my journals. However, for reasons that I cannot explain, I inadvertently packed it in a checked bag for the trip from Quito to Reno. As you might have guessed, my journal was in the checked bag that was lost. Against high odds, that bag was never recovered by the airline.<br><br>At the time it was lost, that volume of my journal included daily entries for the six months following Laycee's death. I was devastated. The loss consumed me for months. "Why did this happen?" I wondered. After my experience with the aneurysm, I had firsthand knowledge that God is very much involved in the details of our lives. I knew that God knew where that bag was, but repeated prayers, often accompanied with fasting, did not bring it back.<br><br>Eventually I accepted the fact that the journal was not coming back and that there must be a reason for it. It wasn't until a little over a year later, near the end of a sabbatical leave at the University of Iowa, that I learned the reason for the loss of my journal. I was telling my wise bishop, Val Sheffield, of the loss of the journal--pining over the experience again and wondering why.<br><br>He stopped me and said, "I know why. It's because what you wrote following your daughter's death wasn't right. It didn't accurately represent how you should respond to what happened." He went on, "You need to write how you feel about her death looking back from the perspective you have now; it's amore accurate one."<br><br>I was stunned. He did not know that over the past year I had been engaged in diligent study, pondering, and prayer about faith and hope, but the Lord knew. I went back to my apartment and thought about that for most of the night. I did rewrite my feelings about Laycee's death. It turned out to be a sacred and singular experience. Although I can't recall what I originally wrote in my lost journal, I am confident that it contained much of bitterness and anger. I am now glad that it is gone.<br><br>As my wife and I journey on, the depth and vitality of our faith and hope in Christ grows. We believe Christ when He tells us He has the desire and power to save us. That steadfast faith is the bedrock of our bright hope that through our temple marriage we will realize our goal of an eternal family, which includes Laycee. We have an assurance that the struggles involved in getting back home will seem "but a small moment" (D&amp;amp;C 121:7). We have cleaved together in a way that perhaps is not possible without the extreme heat and pressure of adversity. We can see that good can come from adversity if we have a hope in Christ. However, I think that Elder Neal A. Maxwell put it best when he said:<br><br><i>Those who emerge successfully from their varied and fiery furnaces have experienced the grace of the Lord, which He says is sufficient (see Ether 12:27). Even so, brothers and sisters, such emerging individuals do not rush to line up in front of another fiery furnace in order to get an extra turn!</i> [Neal A. Maxwell, "From Whom All Blessings Flow," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1997, 11–12]<br><br>In our most recent general conference, President Thomas S. Monson said:<br><br><i>Mortality is a period of testing, a time to prove ourselves worthy to return to the presence of our Heavenly Father. In order to be tested, we must sometimes face challenges and difficulties. At times there appears to be no light at the tunnel's end--nodawn to break the night's darkness. We feel surrounded by the pain of broken hearts, the disappointment of shattered dreams, and the despair of vanished hopes. We join in uttering the biblical plea "Is there no balm in Gilead?" We are inclined to view our own personal misfortunes through the distorted prism of pessimism. We feel abandoned, heartbroken, alone. If you find yourself in such a situation, I plead with you to turn to our Heavenly Father in faith. He will lift you and guide you. He will not always take your afflictions from you, but He will comfort and lead you with love through whatever storm you face.</i> [Thomas S. Monson, "Looking Back and Moving Forward," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2008, 90]<br><br>Things do work out in the end if we trust the Lord. We cannot control some events that cause us great pain, but we can always control how we respond to them. We have no lasting power over another's agency, but we can control our own for eternity. We can choose to live in a world of disappointment, frustration, and anger. We can choose to take counsel from our fears, let faith slip away, and allow our hope to diminish, but remember that "God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love" (2 Timothy 1:7). Life is so much sweeter and richer if we have the humility "to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon [us]" (Mosiah 3:19), trusting that "all things shall work together for good to them that walk uprightly" (D&amp;amp;C 100:15).<br><br>Near the end of the book of Alma, there is a great lesson about the significance of how we choose to respond to difficulties. The Nephites and Lamanites had been through years of wars. There had been much loss of life on both sides and much in the way of trials and afflictions. Listen to this assessment of the people after peace was finally reestablished:<br><br><i>But behold, because of the exceedingly great length of the war between the Nephites and the Lamanites many had become hardened, because of the exceedingly great length of the war; and many were softened because of their afflictions, insomuch that they did humble themselves before God, even inthe depth of humility.</i> [Alma 62:41]<br><br>Wouldn't it be better to be among those whose hearts were softened as "they did humble themselves before God"?<br><br>I wish to acknowledge that in the audience of people who are listening to my address today, or who may listen to or read it in the future, there are surely some, perhaps many, who have had far more difficult trials to endure than I have had. I do not wish to trivialize your trials if you fall into that category. I do pray that perhaps something of what I have learned from my experiences about hope may translate to your situation as well. We can all gain great hope and comfort from these words from theLord:<br><br><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye are little children, and ye have not as yet understood how great blessings the Father hath in his own hands and prepared for you;</i><br><br><i>And ye cannot bear all things now; nevertheless, be of good cheer, for I will lead you along. The kingdom is yours and the blessings thereof are yours, and the riches of eternity are yours.</i><br><br><i>And he who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious; and the things of this earth shall be added unto him, even an hundred fold, yea, more.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 78:17–19]<br><br>It is my hope and prayer that we will all remain firm and resolute in following the Savior and developing a steadfast faith in Him, leading to a perfect brightness of hope for what lies ahead, including the eternities. I bear witness that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that the fulness of the gospel has been restored to the earth, and that a prophet, even Thomas S. Monson, once again speaks on the earth. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>David L.

<h1> More About the Shoulder Than About the Wheel - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, I'm grateful to be here. I've been rather sleepless while preparing my remarks. I've felt some concern. But standing here today, seeing you all before me, I feel blessed--blessed to speak from a lectern where saints and scholars and prophets have spoken, and more blessed to come to this campus each day to teach and be taught by wonderful students who are my brothers and sisters and to work with faculty and staff who are reaching for something here that is more than a job.<br><br>Today I want to address my remarks to you who may be feeling tired and a little worn down, who may be struggling with feelings of frustration about being a student at BYU, and who may even be feeling a little cynical about what we're trying to accomplish here. There are some challenging days. There are days when a teacher, an administrator, a classmate, or a roommate does not speak or act as one should in Zion. There are days when you and I do not speak or act as we should in Zion. There are days when we're confused about a policy or process here that seems inconsistent with the principles of Zion. Sometimes we experience a bit of emotional whiplash when our lives get bumped hard by an experience or a challenge that is painful--painful enough that it pulls us up short and we find ourselves saying, "Wait a minute! I thought this was BYU, the Lord's school. I thought it was Heavenly Father's will that I be a BYU student. What in the world is going on here?" You may chuckle--perhaps a bit nervously--at that representation. If you do, it's probably because you have had some experiences along these lines. And so it's to you that I address my remarks.<br><br>BYU is not Zion. Not yet. It is Zion's university--and it is under construction. It is a work in progress. However--and this is the core of my remarks today--here at BYU it is not an academic program or an athletic program or even a missionary or leadership program that is under construction. It is you. You and I are the whole point of it.<br><br>Occasionally it is my great privilege to host colleagues from other universities and other faiths who come to present their academic work in the Marriott School. On several occasions I have begun the day by driving my colleague to a place overlooking campus. From this vantage point we can see BYU as well as the Provo Temple and the Missionary Training Center. My objective is to begin the day with a visual of what BYU is all about. I speak briefly to my guest about you students--who come here to learn and in whom so much hope is placed by the Church, as evidenced by investments made in your education. I talk about how the learning that occurs simultaneously at the MTC and at the temple imbues a larger sense of purpose to us here on campus. I share this because I believe that my guests have good hearts and will reverence the message. I believe that they are impressed by the vision of what they see. I hope that this view is endorsed by what they experience later that day as they meet with faculty and students. Regardless, Iknow that each time I host a colleague in this manner, <i>I</i> am personally very impressed by the vision of it all.<br><br>I have many important memories of my time as a student at BYU. The most important memories involve my wife and the auspicious beginning of our life together in Trailer No.3, a little green trailer in the old Wyview trailer park. I know that all of you are making important memories here, some of which involve long dog days as you work on classes, exams, tight budgets, and other more personal challenges. While some days can seem very long, I can assure you that the years are very short. Many of you will be shocked at how quickly you'll find yourself looking back on this important time and waxing sentimental with someone younger than you--call it an occupational hazard of the BYU experience.<br><br>One particular memory I want to share today is of going to the administration building shortly after returning from my mission and discovering that all of the devotional addresses that BYU President Jeffrey R. Holland and his wife, Patricia Holland, had given while I was gone were printed in pamphlet form. I picked up a copy of each address and took them back home to catch up. One of those devotional talks absolutely connected with me and became a source of inspiration throughout my entire school experience. In fact, I still have that pamphlet today. The title of that talk is "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/jeffrey-r-and-patricia-t-holland_however-long-hard-road/">However Long and Hard the Road</a>." As part of his message, President Holland related some of the wonderful (and arduous) history of the construction of the Salt Lake Temple. I'd like to share some of his remarks with you today, buttressed by Professor Richard Neitzel Holzapfel's wonderful history of that construction, <i>Every Stone a Sermon,</i> which he published in 1992.<br><br>On July 28, 1847, just four days after their arrival in the valley,<br><br><i>while walking along Brother Brigham stopped very suddenly. He stuck his cane in the ground and said, "Right here will stand the great Temple of our God." We drove a stake in the place indicated by him, and that particular spot is situated in the middle of the Temple site.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>The 10-acre lot was designated as the Temple Block. A week later Orson Pratt used the corner of the block as the starting point for laying out the city. Planning for the construction began immediately, but the next six years kept the Saints occupied just trying to survive. Some Saints lost the vision, including William Weeks, the original temple architect, and abandoned the effort. But others gave themselves to the work, including Truman O. Angell, the newly appointed architect, and Daniel H. Wells, who was made supervisor oftheconstruction.<br><br>The groundbreaking ceremony was finally held on February 14, 1853. The previous six years had not been easy for the Saints, to say the least. One anonymous recollection of that time effectively summed up the circumstances in which a mammoth, multimillion-dollar project was about to be launched:<br><br><i>I walked</i> [to the meeting] <i>the morning the ground was broken for the foundation of the Temple ... on the Temple Block. I went through frozen mud and slush with my feet tied up in rags. I had on a pair of pants made out of my wife's skirt--a thin Scotch plaid; also a thin calico shirt and a straw hat. These were all the clothes I had. It was go that way or stay at home. . . . I was not alone in poverty. . . . There were many who were fixed as badly as I was.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>The earth was so frozen that day that Heber C. Kimball had to break up the ground with a pick. "President Young took out the first turf."<sup>3</sup> He "lifted it high up, and said 'get out ofmy way, for I am going to throw this' . . . and declared the ground broken . . . and dismissed the assembly."<sup>4</sup> Rather than departing, many of those gathered then "rushed to the hole to . . . throw a little dirt out."<sup>5</sup><br><br>In the 1983 devotional given jointly with his wife, President Holland commented about the building of the Salt Lake Temple:<br><br><i>Its grounds would cover an eighth of a square mile, and it would be built to stand through eternity. Who cares about the money or stone or timber or glass or gold they don't have? . . .</i><br><br><i>They just marched forth and broke ground for the most massive, permanent, inspiring edifice they could conceive. And they would spend forty years oftheir lives trying to complete it.</i><br><br><i>The work seemed ill-fated from the start. The excavation for the basement required trenches twenty feet wide and sixteen feet deep, much of it through solid gravel. Just digging for the foundation alone required nine thousand man days of labor. Surely someone must have said, "A temple would be fine, but do we really need one this big?" But they kept on digging.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>Setbacks were the one constant in the temple construction effort, one of the best known being the arrival of Johnston's army in 1858, a deployment that had been ordered by the U.S. president based on rumors back East that the Saints were forming a rebellious break-off from the United States. Brigham Young viewed the coming of the army as government-sanctioned mobbery and ordered the temple foundation buried and the city emptied of its inhabitants. After the threat of Johnston's army had passed and the foundation was dug out again, it was determined that the sandstone foundation rock was unstable and that plans to build the temple with adobe walls were ill-advised. Brigham came to the painful decision to tear out the foundation and begin again. This time granite from Little Cottonwood Canyon, 20 miles away, was selected as the construction material for the temple. The first quarry in the canyon was opened in 1860.<br><br>I want to emphasize to you that, in retrospect, the granite work in Little Cottonwood Canyon was amazing and, at the time, must have seemed daunting. Stones, each weighing between two and six tons, were cut out of the mountain using a sledgehammer and a hand drill. Large holes were dug, and wagons were backed into the holes to be level with the ground. Each stone was then let down onto logs and rolled onto a heavily reinforced wagon, which was pulled by four to six oxen. Transporting just one large stone on the 20-mile trip "took as many as four days."<sup>7</sup> Approximately 60 wagons were employed in a constant rotation to move the granite.<sup>8</sup> One reason for so many wagons is that breakdowns happened regularly, and when I say breakdown, I mean <i>breakdown!</i> Once a wagon broke down under the load, the rock, being simply too big to load on flat land, was often unrecoverable and lost to the project.<sup>9</sup> I love President Holland's description of this process:<br><br><i>By mid-1871 . . . the walls of the temple were barely visible above ground. Far more visible was the teamster's route from Cottonwood, strewn with the wreckage of wagons--and dreams--unable to bear the load placed on them. The journals and histories of these teamsters are filled with accounts of broken axles, mud-mired animals, shattered sprockets, and shattered hopes. I do not have any evidence that these men swore, but surely they might have been seen turning a rather steely eye toward heaven. But they believed and kept pulling.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>Brother Paul Smith, a local historian of the Salt Lake Temple construction, reports that still today a number of homeowners in the Sandy area of the Salt Lake Valley have large granite rocks in their yards with chisel marks on them--and some of those homeowners are wondering how in the world those stones came to be there.<sup>11</sup><br><br>At this point in our report from President Holland and Professor Holzapfel, I need to introduce a small character into this story: my great-great-grandfather Robert Henry Swain.<sup>12</sup><br><br>In 1853 Grandpa Henry and his wife were baptized in Kent, England, where he was employed as a policeman and as a member of the queen's local bodyguard. Like many of our ancestors, Grandpa and his wife, Elizabeth, and their children crossed the Atlantic to make the pioneer trek to Utah, but they did not come together. What's unique in Grandpa Henry's story is that when he departed from Liverpool on April 29, 1865, on the ship <i>Belle Wood,</i> he left alone. He and Elizabeth had separated five years earlier. We don't know the circumstances of the divorce, but we do know that Elizabeth was not happy with Henry and had tossed her wedding band into the sea. Grandpa subsequently lost his membership in the Church.<br><br>I imagine that if any of you have been napping, I just captured your attention. What captures my attention and imagination is visualizing Grandpa walking alone into the Great Salt Lake Valley with the William S. S. Willes wagon company on November 11, 1865. I wonder what he was thinking and feeling as he entered the valley. What was this divorced and excommunicated brother to do there? He had no useful skills for the Saints at that time, and he wasn't in a position to provide much priesthood service.<br><br>Grandpa went to work as a stonecutter in Little Cottonwood Canyon and as a stonemason on the temple, where he labored for the next 10 years. And while working on the construction of the temple, a reconstruction of his own life began taking place as he returned to full fellowship in the kingdom. Eventually he became a chief stonemason and established a family occupation that was passed forward to many of his descendants, including my father and my brothers and me. As a result, I have some experience with sweating over brick and stone in the summer and working to keep the tools and materials unfrozen in the winter. It became my own "stay-in-school" program and made the work on my doctoral studies a comparatively painless experience. That said, when I look at my soft, pink hands today, I miss the quality of that work and mourn a little its disappearing legacy as the Swain family line continues to move forward into the information age and acquires new skills in a new economy.<br><br>At this point let me return to President Holland's report on the temple construction. As I do, I want you to imagine Grandpa Henry there in the midst of the process:<br><br><i>The precise design and dimensions of every one of the thousands of stones to be used in that massive structure had to be marked out individually in the architect's office and shaped accordingly. This was a suffocatingly slow process. Just to put</i> one <i>layer of the six hundred hand-sketched, individually squared, and precisely cut stones around the building took nearly three years. That progress was so slow that virtually no one walking by the temple block could ever see any progress at all. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . By mid-1871, fully two decades and untold misery after it had begun, the walls of the temple were barely visible above ground. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . When President Brigham Young died in 1877, the temple was still scarcely twenty feet above the ground. Ten years later, his successor, President John Taylor, and the temple's original architect, Truman O. Angell, were dead as well. The side walls were just up to the square. And now the infamous Edmunds-Tucker Act had already been passed by Congress disincorporating The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. One of the effects of this law was to put the Church into receivership, whereby the U.S. marshall under a November court order seized this temple the Saints had now spent just under forty years of their lives dreaming of, working for, and praying fervently to enjoy. . . .</i><br><br><i>But God was with these modern children of Israel, as he always has been and always will be. They did all they could do and left the rest in his hands.</i><sup>13</sup><br><br>I'll end President Holland's report there. On that cold February day when the frozen ground was broken to start the work, Brigham Young spoke with characteristically poignant humor as he told the recent converts attending the ground dedication to not<br><br><i>be discouraged because they had not had all the privileges that many of the older members had had, of being robbed, and driven and mobbed and plundered of everything they had on earth, for he would promise all who would remain faithful, that they . . . should be proved in all things.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>And so it had been, not surprisingly, a long, hard road.<br><br>The story of the Salt Lake Temple ends well--very well--as you know. On April 6, 1892, the capstone on which the angel Moroni statue resides was laid before 50,000 exultant Saints waving their handkerchiefs, their jubilant Hosanna Shout echoing off of the surrounding hills.<sup>15</sup><br><br>One year later, on April 6, 1893, 40 years after the groundbreaking and laying of the cornerstones, 75,000 Saints (15,000 more than the total population of Salt Lake City at that time) gathered for the dedication ceremonies.<sup>16</sup> President Wilford Woodruff, who as a young apostle had pounded the stake into the ground to mark Brigham Young's cane print in the dirt, presided at the dedication. He and the First Presidency had earlier counseled that everyone planning to attend should first commit themselves to repent and forgive and reconcile all past sins and faults.<sup>17</sup> Elder Franklin D. Richards commented that "it was of more importance for the people to be accepted than for the temple to be accepted."<sup>18</sup><br><br>In closing his report on the events that happened so many years ago, Professor Holzapfel made the significant observation in1992 that these events<br><br><i>were much more than the dedication of a building. They represent the dedication of an entire people to God. As long as the Saints continue to exhibit such devotion, the temple, rising towards heaven like the mountains around it, rests on a foundation more secure than the cornerstones so carefully placed "beneath the reach of mountain floods"--it rests on the foundation of faith, the living rock the early pioneers planted more than one hundred and forty years ago.</i><sup>19</sup><br><br>Two and half years after the temple dedication, on November 18, 1895, Grandpa Henry died of a lung disease attributed to his working so long in the granite dust.<sup>20</sup> I believe, though, that his work on the temple breathed life back into him. Grandpa died surrounded by his large family. He died fully in the faith. Besides a family tradition of brick and stone masonry, he left a legacy of faith for me. Grandpa Henry was built--was remade--into a new creature. C. S. Lewis, drawing from a George MacDonald parable, offered a very insightful description of what Grandpa Henry might have been feeling as he worked in God's stone quarry and worked to repent and to return:<br><br><i>Imagine yourself as a living house. God comes in to rebuild that house. At first, perhaps, you can understand what He is doing. He is getting the drains right and stopping the leaks in the roof and so on: you knew that those jobs needed doing and so you are not surprised. But presently he starts knocking the house about in a way that hurts abominably and does not seem to make sense. What on earth is He up to? The explanation is that He is building quite a different house from the one you thought of--throwing out a new wing here, putting on an extra floor there, running up towers, making courtyards. You thought you were going to be made into a decent little cottage: but He is building a palace. Heintends to come and live in it Himself.</i><sup>21</sup><br><br>More directly, Paul said to the Corinthians, "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?"<sup>22</sup><br><br>At the beginning of this devotional hour we sang together the great old hymn "Put Your Shoulder to the Wheel."<sup>23</sup> He who is omnipotent really does not need us to move the wheel or to build anything for Him. It is not His ultimate objective to cover the world with chapels and temples. That is a means to His end, and I believe we can all easily quote that end, His ultimate objective: "For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man."<sup>24</sup> I believe that He cares more about the shoulder than about the wheel--that wheel is how <i>we</i> are moved to come home to Him. The wheel, the work, is a blessing to us. This is important. <i>The work is a blessing.</i><br><br>I think that sometimes we live as if the gospel life was an exercise in delayed consumption; by giving up fun and leisure now (while the heathen and heretic party on), we'll get ours in the eternities, and it's going to be great watching those heathens and heretics sweat it out while we relax. I think that the parable of the ant and the grasshopper has done us some disservice in this regard. To that end, I would refer you to a very interesting dream/vision that Wilford Woodruff had of meeting Joseph Smith in heaven and of being amazed that the Lord's vineyard work does go on in the spirit world and that it goes on with even more focus than on earth. As I reread this account, I made a personal observation that President Woodruff seemed to be a bit disappointed initially at this report of heaven but was quickly satisfied that this was good doctrine.<sup>25</sup><br><br>As a bishop I occasionally had the opportunity to counsel a brother or a sister who was tired of the hard work of full-time school and a part-time job, or even full-time school and a full-time job, all of this combined with a Church calling and the pressure of keeping commandments, reading scriptures, praying, and attending the temple. As I visited with some of these individuals, they expressed that they just didn't think they could hold on any longer and were not convinced that all the hard work was worth it. On some level I felt like I could relate. As a bishop there were some long dog days in which I dragged myself to the bishop's office, feeling strongly that I simply had nothing to give to the ward members that day and even feeling a little sorry for myself. Thank goodness I have a dear wife who knew how to rough me up a bit and kick me out the door on occasion because--and this is very significant to me--every single evening I left that bishop's office, I felt like I was levitating about six inches off the ground. Isaiah counseled, "But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint."<sup>26</sup><br><br>I want to acknowledge a wonderful group of new accounting majors that it was my privilege to teach this last winter semester. Those who major in Marriott School programs know of the intensity of the junior core year in the School of Accountancy. My course forms part of this core curriculum. My students were all deeply involved in wrapping up the most intense academic year of their lives. They had worked hard, but they had stayed engaged. These were terrific colleagues in the classroom, and Iwas blessed to be a part of their semester. One e-mail sent to me shortly after the close of the semester resonated strongly with me as I prepared these remarks for you. With the permission of a good student, I share with you part of his e-mail.<br><br><i>A few days ago I thought of the junior core when I was reading</i> Press On, <i>a book by Elder Wirthlin. He shared a story of a psychology professor at the University of Chicago who spent 25 years studying what makes people happy. The professor concluded, "The best moments</i> [in our lives] <i>usually occur when a person's body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile." . . . The junior core is similar to serving a mission. Sometimes the days never seem to end; sometimes you wonder what you got yourself into; sometimes you question if all the work is worthwhile if you cannot see the results of your efforts. Then, all of a sudden, it does end. Ironically, you wish it wasn't ending because you look back and see how you've grown, you see the experiences that have pushed and stretched you, and you see the friendships that have developed through months of hard work.</i><sup>27</sup><br><br>I love how this student is teaching me about the concept of long days and short years that seems to be characteristic of good work, of God's work. I believe that my students and I were about Heavenly Father's work in our Accounting 402 classroom. Heavenly Father really doesn't care that much about the debits and the credits, nor does He care about the quizzes and exams. (Though I should hurry to say that this is good knowledge that will empower my students to be effective as good business professionals!) Heavenly Father cares more about the shoulder than He does about the wheel. He cared about what my students were becoming as a result of the work. And, in my limited observation, it seems that many of these students became better temples of Heavenly Father's spirit in the process of struggling, <i>and succeeding,</i> in Accounting 402.<br><br>As I close now, I'd like to make one final observation and I'd like to return to my brothers and sisters who are tired and perhaps a little cynical of the work here at BYU. In my study of the gospel it has been pointed out to me that there are many qualities of God's eternal life that are paradoxes. Sometimes the opposite of an important and profound truth is another important and profound truth.<sup>28</sup> Jesus and His servants occasionally taught in terms of profound paradox, some of which you'll remember:<br><br>"Bridle all your passions, that ye may be filled with love."<sup>29</sup><br><br>"He who seeketh to save his life shall lose it."<sup>30</sup><br><br>And then there is the ultimate and wonderful paradox of God's mercy and justice.<sup>31</sup> Satan, on the other hand, would confuse us with counterfeits. For example, he would try to confuse our testimony that justice and mercy are the same wonderful doctrine with the irrelevant fact that vengeance and indulgence are irreconcilable opposites.<sup>32</sup> I hope that today I haven't confused you with the idea that the objective of this life is to work ourselves to death!<br><br>Jesus taught:<br><br><i>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</i><br><br><i>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</i><br><br><i>For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</i><sup>33</sup><br><br>Alma the Elder personally experienced this wonderful paradox:<br><br><i>And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were made light; yea, the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will ofthe Lord.</i><sup>34</sup><br><br>In my heart I see Grandpa Henry trudging into the Great Salt Lake Valley, laden with his own burdens. The Lord's tender response was not to grant a reprieve and a vacation; rather, Grandpa Henry was invited to "come, follow me"<sup>35</sup> and give himself to the Lord's will and to His work. The blessed work was restful and refreshing, and Grandpa was renewed. The key to finding rest and renewal is to give ourselves wholly and wholeheartedly to God's work and to His will. To resist and to live the half-life is exhausting.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, may we give ourselves to this great work here at BYU and in so doing be built ourselves into the Lord's temple, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Monte R.

<h1>on Which All Blessings Are Predicated - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a privilege to stand before you at this podium today. This is not an occasion that I anticipated or aspired to, but it is indeed a privilege, and I welcome the opportunity to share my testimony of the Savior and some things I have learned about being His disciple.<br><br>On April 8, 2008, I noted, as I always do on that date, the anniversary of my appointment as a faculty member here at BYU, beginning 34years ago on April 8, 1974. I was not among the original group of faculty hired for what was then the new J. Reuben Clark Law School, but I was the first of the "non-originals," and now, with the passage of time, have become the longest continuously serving member of the Law School faculty. I am profoundly grateful for the many students and colleagues--both at the Law School and the university generally--who have enriched my life.<br><br>I first became a student of the law at Duke University School of Law in September 1967--nearly 41 years ago. Only four years earlier I had received my patriarchal blessing, which included the admonition "Study the laws of the temporal affairs of men as well as of their spiritual affairs." I began teaching here at the BYU Law School less than two years after completing law studies at Duke, and when I reread this patriarchal blessing a few years ago, I realized that most of my legal career had indeed centered on the "study" of the law.<br><br>My remarks today will touch on the laws of our temporal affairs as well as on the laws of our spiritual affairs. Our scriptures contain dozens of references to both temporal and spiritual laws. The Lord declared "that all things unto me are spiritual, and not at any time have I given you a law which was temporal" (D&amp;amp;C 29:34). Joseph Smith was urged by the Lord "to obtain a knowledge of history, and of countries, and of kingdoms, of laws of God and man, and all this for the salvation of Zion" (D&amp;amp;C 93:53). And to all of us the Lord commanded: "Let no man break the laws of the land, for he that keepeth the laws of God hath no need to break the laws of the land" (D&amp;amp;C 58:21). And thus we proclaim in the twelfth article of faith our commitment to "obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law."<br><br>The great prophet Lehi taught us that without the law of God there would be no sin, righteousness, happiness, punishment, or misery: "And if these things are not there is no God" (2Nephi 2:13). Alma affirmed this by teaching:<br><br><i>There is a law given, and a punishment affixed, and a repentance granted; which repentance, mercy claimeth; otherwise, justice claimeth the creature and executeth the law, and the law inflicteth the punishment; if not so, the works of justice would be destroyed, and God would cease to be God.</i> [Alma 42:22]<br><br>Whatever else we learn from these scriptures, we learn that one of the important godly attributes is adherence to law.<br><br>However, it is important to realize that the law is not only for inflicting punishment. One of my favorite scriptures is the passage that teaches us how the law is also the gateway toblessings:<br><br><i>There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which allblessings are predicated--</i><br><br><i>And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 130:20–21]<br><br>One of the really important things we should think about each day is the blessings we have received and whether those blessings seem to be coming to us in response to our obedience to laws and commandments of the Lord. We should always remember to express our gratitude for these blessings. I think this is helpful to think about, even though, as King Benjamin put it, we will always be "unprofitable servants" (Mosiah 2:21)--that is, always indebt to our Father inHeaven.<br><br>I don't know that there is a list of specific laws with specific blessings attached to them, but as we go through life we come to understand some of the important cause-and-effect relationships between our conduct and our blessings. Let me mention a few examples that are important to me.<br><h2><b>I. Liberty and the Rule of Law</b></h2><br>Each year at our Law School convocation inthe Provo Tabernacle, we conclude our services by all standing and singing "America the Beautiful." The sights and sounds of that experience have always stirred me, even after participating in this for over 30 years. One of the verses teaches an important law upon which blessings are predicated:<br><br><i>America! America!</i><br><br><i>God mend thine ev'ry flaw,</i><br><br><i>Confirm thy soul in self-control,</i><br><br><i>Thy liberty in law.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>"Thy liberty in law" is a phrase that we might also describe as "the rule of law." After a career of observation and study, it is clear to me that all of our human rights and civil liberties, indeed every blessing emanating from this promised land, are predicated on our success in "obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law," as we declare in our twelfth article of faith. In those nations where the commitment to rule of law is weakest, the suffering of the people is the deepest. Strengthening the commitment to rule of law is not only a national or community undertaking but also a challenge we all face individually. We do not disobey or ignore or flaunt our laws without weakening the fabric of our society. If our laws are not wise, we have well-known processes for addressing those flaws. One of those processes is wise participation in our electoral events. Thus Mosiah II taught:<br><br><i>Therefore, choose you by the voice of this people, judges, that ye may be judged according to the laws which have been given you by our fathers, which are correct, and which were given them by the hand of the Lord.</i><br><br><i>Now it is not common that the voice of the people desireth anything contrary to that which is right; but it is common for the lesser part of the people to desire that which is not right; therefore this shall ye observe and make it your law--to do your business by the voice of the people.</i><br><br><i>And if the time comes that the voice of the people doth choose iniquity, then is the time that the judgments of God will come upon you.</i> [Mosiah 29:25–27]<br><h2><b>II. Blessings Predicated on Health Laws</b></h2><br>Another law upon which important blessings are predicated is found in section 89 of the Doctrine and Covenants, familiar to us as the Word of Wisdom. This revelation "show[s] forth the order and will of God in the temporal salvation of all saints in the last days" (D&amp;amp;C 89:2). It tells us things to avoid and things to do. Then it states what almost sounds like a legal principle:<br><br><i>And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones;</i><br><br><i>And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures;</i><br><br><i>And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint.</i><br><br><i>And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them. Amen.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 89:18–21]<br><br>Everywhere we go we see the negative and positive consequences of this law on the physical condition of our people. Less visible, but more important, is the effect of this law on the spiritual health of the Saints. Our obedience to this law has much to do with whether we are inviting the Spirit into our lives or leading lives that are not welcoming to the Spirit.<br><br>Somewhat related to this law are three minor laws I learned about when I was required to begin military service midway through law school. When I arrived in Vietnam on August 15, 1969, I was assigned to the army's First Infantry Division. Because it was too dangerous to travel on the ground, I was told to get in a helicopter.<br><br>The helicopter was what they called a Huey. A Huey had eight campstool-like canvas seats for passengers like myself. Four of the seats faced forward, and two on each side faced out to the sides. These Hueys had a machine gun mounted on each side. The side doors, like doors on a van, were pulled all the way back sothe machine gunners could operate their guns if needed.<br><br>I took my place on one of the side seats, facing out to the side with a completely clear and open view because the side door had been pulled all the way back. I took my seat with my M-16 automatic rifle in one hand and my steel helmet in the other arm, looking forward to my first ride in a Huey helicopter. In a great roar of its engine and the rush of wind from its rotor blades, the chopper lifted off, rising straight in the air for about 200 feet. Then, as it prepared to turn in the direction of where it was taking me, it leaned over, or banked steeply, to my side, so that I was looking almost straight down out of my open door.<br><br>At that moment I realized (1) that I had forgotten to fasten my seat belt and (2) that both my hands were full of important things that I did not want to drop out of the helicopter: my rifle and my helmet. Then realization number three happened. I started to slide out of my seat and drop out of the turning helicopter.<br><br>What happened next? Just before I fell from the helicopter, my feet discovered that each of these little seats had two little, straight, aluminum legs. My left foot found one of these, and I wrapped my boot tightly around it just as I was about to fall, and I managed to hold on until the helicopter straightened out. You will probably not be surprised to learn that I now always fasten my seat belt when I drive.<br><br>And it was on this occasion that I learned some new things about the law of unintended consequences, about Murphy's Law (if anything can go wrong, it will), and about the law of gravity.<br><h2><b>III. Blessings Predicated on the Law of Obedience</b></h2><br>Indeed, obedience is its own law. Pioneer wagon tracks exemplify to me that principle. In the summer of 1847, enduring tracks were first made by the creaking wagons and the dusty, weary members of the pioneer company of Latter-day Saints blazing the trail to the Salt Lake Valley. The tracks are found in a remote corner of southwestern Wyoming, away from human activity. It was at this spot that Brigham Young fell seriously ill with fever. Over the next 21 years, until 1868, tens of thousands of wagon and handcart wheels and pioneer feet--adult and child--wore down these tracks. Now, over 160 years after that first pioneer wagon train, in places the vegetation still will not grow back and the tracks are still discernible. These faithful emigrants, these "blessed, honored Pioneer[s],"<sup>2</sup> symbolize a commitment to obedience that must forever remain anexample to us.<br><br>Among those many thousands of pioneers were the great-great-grandparents of my wife, Paula. Hans and Maren Rasmussen were prosperous farmers when they accepted the restored gospel in Denmark. They responded eagerly and obediently to the call to come to Zion. After selling their farm, they paid their tithing, made a substantial contribution to the Perpetual Emigration Fund, and then equipped and funded themselves and about 30 other Danish Saints for the journey to Salt Lake City. With a covered wagon, they joined one of the two wagon trains accompanying the ill-fated Willie and Martin Handcart Companies. But they had started their journey too late in the summer of 1856. Among their several children were two-year-old twin girls. Soon after they got started, one of these little girls, named Christina--and known as Stina--came down with a simple childhood infection. She was unable to be treated on the trail and died in June 1856. As if this tragedy were not enough, three months later they were caught in the early and ferocious snow- and windstorms that caused so much terrible suffering for all in the Willie and Martin Companies. They also lost almost all of theirgoods.<br><br>Shortly after arriving in Salt Lake City, the Rasmussens were called to go south and help settle the pioneer community of Ephraim. Soon thereafter they were sent further south to help settle the community of Richfield, where they lived in a dugout. A year later they were sent back to Ephraim.<br><br><i>Here Hans and Maren Rasmussen established their home by digging a dugout to which was added a two-room adobe house later and which was the home where this onetime rich young Danish convert couple spent the remainder of their lives. Here they raised their family, and though they never enjoyed even the luxury of a cookstove, they often gave expression to their joy of having been found worthy to make these sacrifices and to live among the Saints of latter days. They often said they would gladly do it all over again if necessary to enjoy the blessings oftheir deep testimony of the gospel.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>Many, many blessings are predicated upon the law of obedience.<br><h2><b>IV. Blessings Predicated on the Laws of Teaching and Learning by the Spirit</b></h2><br>Another law upon which blessings are predicated is found in the admonition--which sounds like a law--that "the Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith; and if ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach" (D&amp;amp;C 42:14). Our scriptures refer to spiritual gifts of knowledge and wisdom (see D&amp;amp;C 46:13, 15–18; Moroni 10:9–10) and to admonitions to "seek learning . . . by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118, 109:7). I understand from these scriptures that both teaching and learning are gifts of the Spirit and that they are enjoyed as spiritual gifts when we do our very best to invite the Spirit into our lives. Maybe this has always been really obvious to most of you, but there is in fact a connection between spirituality and success in our academic endeavors.<br><br>So what sort of obedience may yield the blessings of enhanced teaching and learning? According to the scriptures:<br><br>1. We should be <i>humble</i>--that is, not prideful in our learning: "And the wise, and the learned, and they that are rich, who are puffed up because of their learning, and their wisdom, and their riches--yea, they are they whom he despiseth" (2 Nephi 9:42).<br><br>2. We should be <i>receptive</i> to the teachings ofthe Spirit: "He that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light" (D&amp;amp;C 50:24).<br><br>3. We should be <i>obedient</i> to the commandments: "When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God. . . . To be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God" (2 Nephi 9:28–29).<br><br>I am sure there are many things we can do to enhance our teaching and learning. Here's one that I have had personal experience with. When I was in my early teens, I made a personal commitment to avoid doing homework on the Sabbath and to do all I could to keep my Sabbath days holy. Despite all of the circumstances that have challenged and continue to challenge that commitment, I know I have been blessed specifically in academic endeavors and in my professional life since then by whatever success I've had in honoring that commitment. This same cause-and-effect relationship pertains to all of our other efforts to obey the commandments and serve our God and fellow beings with faithful diligence.<br><br>Sometimes when I am asked by prospective law students why they should choose BYU Law School over other good law schools they may have opportunity to attend, I am tempted to answer: "Well, at BYU you could have me as one of your teachers, of course." More seriously, perhaps the best answer I can give is this: This is a place where you will be surrounded by faculty and students who are striving to bring the Spirit of God into their lives, and therefore the spiritual gifts of teaching and learning will be found here in great abundance. Certainly it has been my privilege here, for over three decades, to be surrounded by friends and colleagues, both students and faculty, who are persons of great learning and wonderful intellectual attainment and who are also persons of faith and wisdom. Nowhere else on earth will you find that blessing in such abundance.<br><br>So, here are some principles of the law upon which these blessings of teaching and learning are predicated:<br><ul><br>	<li>The gospel of Jesus Christ includes and encompasses all knowledge and all truth.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>Ultimately all knowledge is revealed through the medium of the Holy Ghost.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>Increased spirituality and spiritual power increase access to and mastery of knowledge.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>Teaching and learning are gifts of the Spirit; therefore, greater spirituality and greater spiritual power should help us expand our present abilities to teach and learn.</li><br></ul><br>Because my intellectual powers are enhanced by my spiritual powers, it is no coincidence that my most productive and successful years as a teacher, scholar, and lawyer have been in those years when I have tried my best to give a full measure of service in the intense Church callings of a campus stake presidency, a bishop of my home ward and of a BYU ward, and in the other callings that have come to me. I am edified by the example of my very busy law students who accept and serve faithfully in heavy Church callings while successfully pursuing their law studies.<br><h2><b>V. Blessings Predicated on Humility and Being Not "Weary in Well-Doing"</b></h2><br>As in all else, we are led by the example of the Savior. During His mortal ministry, His disciples tried to protect Him from the press of people who sought His healing blessings. The disciples rebuked those who brought young children in the hope that the Savior would touch them.<br><br><i>But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.</i> [Mark 10:14]<br><br>A similar incident occurred when the Savior visited the Nephites after His Resurrection. In chapter 17 of 3 Nephi we read of the Savior's ministry among the people who had survived the great destruction that had occurred at the time of the Resurrection. After teaching many important doctrines throughout that day, he prepared to leave, saying, "My time is at hand" (3 Nephi 17:1). But then<br><br><i>he cast his eyes round about again on the multitude, and beheld they were in tears, and did look steadfastly upon him as if they would ask him to tarry alittle longer with them.</i><br><br><i>And he said unto them: Behold, my bowels are filled with compassion towards you.</i><br><br><i>Have ye any that are sick among you? . . .</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass . . . all the multitude, with one accord, did go forth with their sick and their afflicted, and their lame, and with their blind, and with their dumb, and with all them that were afflicted in any manner; and he did heal them every one as they were brought forth unto him.</i> [3 Nephi 17:5–7, 9]<br><br>And then He commanded them to bring their little children to Him. After praying,<br><br><i>he wept, . . . and he took their little children, one by one, and blessed them, and prayed unto the Father for them.</i><br><br><i>And when he had done this he wept again.</i> [3Nephi 17:21–22]<br><br>There followed then the marvelous miracle when these little ones were encircled about with fire (verse 24). All of this happened <i>after</i> Jesus had spent a full day teaching the people.<br><br>This reminds me that we have been asked to "be not weary in well-doing" (D&amp;amp;C 64:33), and we have the Savior's example before us. As we seek to be the Savior's true disciples, this is one of our constant challenges. A month ago I was reminded of this Christlike quality as I learned something about the life of Abraham Lincoln.<br><br>In May of this year I had occasion to visit the recently restored Lincoln Cottage, a house about three miles north of the White House, where Abraham Lincoln lived with his family for five months a year during 1862, 1863, and 1864. Each day he rode, usually on horseback, from the White House to this sanctuary, where he could escape from the hot and muggy weather, from the crowds seeking his personal assistance, and from the gloom of the recent death of his son Willie. He accomplished much important work in this "Cottage," not the least of which was his drafting of the Emancipation Proclamation.<br><br>Late one hot summer evening in 1862, Lincoln was at home in the Cottage trying to calm his mind on the eve of a significant Civil War battle about to be fought on the outskirts of Washington, D.C. He was also relieved to be momentarily free of an especially persistent woman who had called on him in the White House that day seeking a promotion for her husband.<br><br>Nevertheless, late that evening another private citizen, having been aided in finding the president by a Treasury Department employee, was admitted to see Mr. Lincoln. His story was poignant and wrenching. A Union officer from New Hampshire had been wounded in recent fighting. The officer's wife and her friend had both made the journey from New Hampshire to locate the wounded soldier and help him recover. As they journeyed by boat back to Washington, the boat collided with another boat at night and 73 passengers drowned, including both ladies. The wounded soldier barely escaped with his life.<br><br>The president's visitor had returned to Washington to locate and return the bodies of these ladies to New Hampshire. He sought access to the area of the disaster, which had been closed because of the pending battle. The Secretary of War had gruffly refused his request, so he was now before the president seeking intervention:<br><br><i>Without making any interruptions, Lincoln listened to the</i> [visitor's] <i>long and tragic story. At the end, however, . . . instead of displaying his legendary generosity, Lincoln reportedly said, "Am I to have no rest? Is there no hour or spot when or where I may escape this constant call? Why do you follow me out here with such business as this? Why do you not go to the War-office, where they have charge of all this matter of papers and transportation?" The embarrassed</i> [visitor] <i>tried to argue his case with the exhausted president, but to no avail. . . .</i> [He was] <i>dismissed curtly and sent back to the city without any relief.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>Lincoln later appeared at the visitor's hotel apologizing. He confessed, "I was a brute last night."<sup>5</sup><br><br>Another version of the story reports:<br><br>[The president said:] <i>"I fear, Sir, that my conduct has been such as to make it appear that Ihad forgotten my humanity." . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . The two men sat down and talked as familiarly as old friends. Great tears rolled down the President's careworn face as he heard the story of the shipwreck. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . He then wrote a mandatory order to</i> [the Secretary of War], <i>requiring him to furnish a pass, transportation to the scene of the disaster, and all necessary assistance to find the bodies. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . The result was that after cruising along the shore in the vicinity of the wreck, and after much inquiry among the inhabitants, the place where the bodies washed ashore and the place of interment were discovered, and they were brought home to their native New-Hampshire.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>Seeking the Spirit in our lives consists of much more than keeping basic commandments. Yes, it is important that we refrain from transgression. But there is a higher law. For me, this higher law is well expressed in two familiar scriptural passages.<br><br>The concluding statement of the thirteenth article of faith proclaims: "If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things."<br><br>And in the marvelous, divine instructions recorded in section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants, we are told:<br><br><i>Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 121:45]<br><br>If we faithfully strive to do these things, Itestify that we will have within our grasp the "law . . . upon which all blessings are predicated," helping us along the way to happiness in this life and exaltation in the next. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>David A. Thomas was a BYU professor at the J. Reuben Clark Law School when this devotional address was given on 3 June 2008.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. "America the Beautiful," <i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no.338.<br><br>2.

<h1>iritual Maps to Navigate Through Life - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I would like to share with you three experiences in my life that have made me grateful for maps.<br><br>My first example: When I moved to Provo six years ago, I purchased a home. Although I looked at many homes in the area, I selected one that was somewhat geographically hard to find. I grew up in Salt Lake Valley, where almost the whole valley follows the same east, west, north, and south coordinates first laid out by Brigham Young. No such universal address system exists across Utah Valley. When one changes city limits, the address coordinate system also changes. That fact, coupled with the unusual boundaries of the cities, makes navigating the streets difficult for those new tothearea.<br><br>Once I was settled in my new home, I had family and friends who were primarily from Salt Lake come to visit. The streets in Utah Valley were as foreign to them as they had been to me. I gave them explicit but complicated directions to my house. But in every single instance, five to 10 minutes before their expected arrival I received a cell-phone call asking for confirmation that they were headed in the right direction. I didn't think about giving them a map to follow.<br><br>My second example: The only magazine Irecall coming through the mail to our home when I was a young child, besides Church magazines, was <i>National Geographic.</i> My maternal grandparents subscribed to the magazine each year as a birthday present for my father. He enjoyed reading about the far reaches of the world, and I enjoyed the exotic pictures and the enclosed maps. My parents kept these magazines for many years, and my siblings and I relied on them for school reports in pre-Internet days. One map of the world my parents posted on our family-room wall. I always enjoyed looking at that map, and in my early years I envisioned myself visiting all of those places. As I grew older I realized I would never visit all of the lands of the earth, but I still had a desire to travel to those I could reach.<br><br>My third example: A few months ago my father's sister--my aunt from Rome, Georgia--passed away. Since both of my parents are deceased, my siblings and I felt strongly that our side of the family needed to be represented at the funeral. The only Utah Praters who could get away from other commitments were me, my sister, and my sister-in-law. My father was raised in and around Rome, and all three of us had been there many times. But on all previous trips either my brother or my father had driven, navigating the city and the country roads. They both knew the territory very well.<br><br>After the three of us had flown into Atlanta, we realized we didn't have a map. We knew we needed to drive in the northwest direction, but we didn't know on what specific roads. Fortunately, awell-seasoned traveler overheard our conversation and gave us clear verbal directions that we could easily follow in our rented car. Since it was very late at night, we were grateful to reach our hotel without delay. The next morning the first thing I did was buy a map. Navigating around Rome, Georgia, wasn't that difficult, but many of the destinations we needed to reach were outside the city boundaries on country roads. A map of the area was most helpful in directing us to where we needed to go.<br><br>These three stories illustrate why I have a gratitude for maps. It was difficult for people to follow my verbal directions to my home because of the complexity of the instructions and the unfamiliar territory in which I resided. I--the person who knew the directions well--was only a phone call away for clarification or reassurance, but a map would have helped them find their way.<br><br>The world map on my family's family-room wall gave me a much broader perspective of life. I learned at an early age that my neighborhood was but a small portion of the whole earth. The world map also gave me aspirations to visit lands near and far.<br><br>In the third story, the map of Rome, Georgia, gave me, my sister, and my sister-in-law specific grounding in where we were, clarity inwhere we wanted to be, and the route to take to reach our destination.<br><br>Not unlike physical maps, we have spiritual maps to help guide and direct us to our ultimate destination--back to our heavenly home. But sometimes we use the wrong maps to measure our progress along life's journey. One such map is a timeline.<br><br>When I graduated from high school I thought I would follow the path of most youngLDS women. Using a timeline framework, I would go to college for two to three years, meet a returned missionary, be married in the temple, return to school to finish my degree, and then start a family. We would have about five children and 25 grandchildren. After my husband retired from his very lucrative business, we would serve a senior mission together and then pass into the next life within six months of one another. This was one map Iwas going to follow--and I did, at least to step one.<br><br>I went to college. The rest of my timeline evaporated. The Lord had other purposes for me and directed me in ways I could not have predicted.<br><br>Rather than timelines, I propose that better spiritual maps exist for us to follow--namely, the scriptures, our patriarchal blessings, priesthood blessings, prayer, and promptings of the Spirit. For the sake of time, I will focus on only the first spiritual map listed: the scriptures.<br><br>One of my favorite sections in the Doctrine and Covenants is section 25, the revelation directed to Emma Smith, the wife of the Prophet Joseph Smith. Although many revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants were given to individuals, the counsel directed to them also applies to us today. As the Lord has said, "What I say unto one I say unto all" (D&amp;amp;C61:36). The guidance given to Emma Smith is one example of the spiritual maps wecan find throughout the scriptures. I will refer to just a few of the verses in this section today.<br><br>One of the first pieces of counsel the Lord gave Emma is in verse 4:<br><br><i>Murmur not because of the things which thou hast not seen, for they are withheld from thee and from the world, which is wisdom in me in a time tocome.</i><br><br>Emma faced many challenges and was asked to endure many things. My challenges, and I'm certain many of yours, pale in comparison to what Emma experienced. If the Lord counseled her not to murmur, how much more does this counsel apply to us?<br><br>The word <i>murmur</i> is defined in the Merriam-Webster online dictionary and thesaurus as "a half-suppressed or muttered complaint" and "an expression of dissatisfaction, pain, or resentment." This definition implies that murmuring is not a boisterous, overt complaint but one that is perhaps stated under our breath or even carried in our heart.<br><br>About what types of things should we not murmur? Elder Neal A. Maxwell said:<br><br><i>Strange as it seems, we sometimes respond better to larger challenges than to the incessant small ones. ... One can be sincerely grateful for his major blessings but regularly murmur over minor irritations. . . . Enduring large tests while failing the seemingly small quizzes just won't do.</i> ["Apply the Atoning Blood of Christ," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1997, 23]<br><br>So, what are our minor irritations? Perhaps we murmur about individuals: for example, a roommate who borrowed your shoes without asking, a spouse who neglected to put the cap back on the toothpaste, a neighbor who is slow in trimming a bush infringing on your yard, an office receptionist who couldn't answer your question, a motorist who cut in front of your car, a paperboy who missed the front porch, or a BYU professor who would not give you that one extra point that would change your grade from a B+ to an A–.<br><br>Or maybe we murmur about events in our lives, such as not getting the English 150 section we wanted or the apartment we had our hearts set on. We might even murmur over more substantial life circumstances, such as not yet finding our eternal companion or being burdened with extenuating family circumstances. Murmuring is not conducive to feeling the Spirit of the Lord and will, in fact, suppressit.<br><br>The Lord's counsel to Emma in verse 10 of section 25 reads: "And verily I say unto thee that thou shalt lay aside the things of this world, and seek for the things of a better." In reference to this scripture, President Gordon B. Hinckley said:<br><br><i>I feel he was not telling Emma that she should not feel concerned about a place to live, food on her table, and clothing. He was saying to her that she should not be obsessed with these things, as so many of us are wont to be. He was telling her to get her thoughts on the higher things of life, the things of righteousness and goodness, matters of charity and love for others, the things of eternity.</i> ["If Thou Art Faithful," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1984, 91]<br><br>Maintaining an eternal perspective can help us in so many ways. It can even help us avoid murmuring. Many of the minor issues in our lives today will all but disappear in time. Having been in university administration positions for several years, I have seen this occur over and over and am guilty of it myself. Students, staff, and faculty often have concerns that are small and petty from an eternal perspective but which seem so traumatic at the time--these concerns dissipate and become forgettable the following week, month, or year.<br><br>Our attitude plays a large role in avoiding murmuring. A poem recited by then Bishop Henry B. Eyring in October 1989 general conference, speaks to this:<br><br><i>Some murmur when their sky is clear</i><br><br><i>And wholly bright to view,</i><br><br><i>If one small speck of dark appear</i><br><br><i>In their great heaven of blue:</i><br><br><i>And some with thankful love are filled,</i><br><br><i>If but one streak of light,</i><br><br><i>One ray of God's good mercy, gild</i><br><br><i>The darkness of their night.</i><br><br>[Richard Chenevix Trench, "Some Murmur When Their Sky Is Clear," in Al Bryant, comp., <i>Sourcebook of Poetry</i> (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan Publishing House, 1968), 396; quoted in Henry B. Eyring, "Remembrance and Gratitude," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1989, 11]<br><br>Returning to section 25, in verse 7 we read that Emma is told, "And thou shalt be ordained under his hand to expound scriptures, and to exhort the church, according as it shall be given thee by my Spirit." Emma Smith was set apart by her husband, Joseph Smith, to be the first Relief Society general president in this dispensation. Emma was to be a leader and a teacher of righteousness and truth. She needed to study the gospel through the scriptures and share her testimony with others. We, too, are asked to become knowledgeable of the gospel through scripture study and to bear testimony of the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Like Emma's calling as the Relief Society general president, we are all called to serve the Lord in formal ways, primarily through our wards and stakes. In October 2007 general conference President Boyd K. Packer reminded us of the lay ministry of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He said:<br><br><i>Everything that is done in the Church . . . is done by ordinary members, the "weak things of the world." . . .</i><br><br><i>There is the natural tendency to look at those who are sustained to presiding positions, to consider them to be higher and of more value in the Church ... than an ordinary member. Somehow we feel they are worth more to the Lord than are we. It just does not work that way! . . .</i><br><br><i>As General Authorities of the Church, we are just the same as you are, and you are just the same as we are. You have the same access to the powers ofrevelation for your families and for your work and for your callings as we do.</i> ["The Weak and the Simple of the Church," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2007, 6, 8, 9]<br><br>You will have many and varied opportunities to continue to serve the Lord. All of you will be called upon to serve in leadership and teaching positions in wards, stakes, and beyond. The gifts and talents you have been given can be used to bless the lives of many people if you will willingly accept and magnify your Church callings. Just like Emma, we need to rely on the scriptures to help and direct us as we fulfill these and other responsibilities.<br><br>In verse 8 of section 25, Emma is told, "Thy time shall be given to writing, and to learning much." She was supposed to study the things of the world and devote time to expressing her thoughts in writing. Of what should we study and of what should we write?<br><br>As BYU students you are currently actively engaged in learning much. At least I hope you are--after all, the BYU motto reads, "Enter to learn; go forth to serve." Hopefully, however, you will not stop learning once you graduate. Learning must be perceived as a lifelong pursuit. Discover ways in which you can continue to have a passion for learning. Read books outside of your discipline. Discover historic sites within walking or short driving distance from your home. Attend community events, such as lectures or concerts. As we read in Doctrine and Covenants 109:8:<br><br><i>Establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God.</i><br><br>Speaking of Emma's responsibility to write, President Hinckley suggested that we "keep journals" and "express [our] thoughts on paper." He said:<br><br><i>Writing is a great discipline. It is a tremendous educational effort. It will assist you in various ways, and you will bless the lives of many--your families and others--now and in the years to come, as you put on paper some of your experiences and some of your musings.</i> ["If Thou Art," 91]<br><br>I have been an inconsistent journal writer. Perhaps that is why I chose to include this in my talk. In some ways I was more consistent as a young adult than I have been as an adult. I recall hearing a radio report in the 1990s that as of that day, 2,000 days were left until the year 2000. In my attempt at becoming a good journal writer once again, I committed to write an entry in my journal every day from that day forth until the turn of the century. That way I would have a guaranteed 2,000 entries in my journal. Once I made the commitment I began and successfully met my goal. However, I was so burned out that I have inconsistently written in my journal ever since. I don't think the goal I set for myself was appropriate, because it didn't entail the spirit of journal writing as it should be.<br><br>Several years after my maternal grandmother passed away, I assisted my mother in transcribing my grandmother's pencil-written journals. My mother read while I typed on the computer. My grandmother lived well into my young-adult years, and I have fond memories of spending time with her both when I was a child and as a young adult. I knew her well. But the events in the journals I was transcribing took place before I was born. I was touched and inspired by her day-to-day activities, particularly the service that she rendered.<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball had 33 black binders on the shelves of his personal study when he was called to be president of the Church. On many occasions he encouraged the Saints to keep personal journals. In October 1979 general conference he said:<br><br><i>We may think there is little of interest or importance in what we personally say or do--but it is remarkable how many of our families, as we pass on down the line, are interested in all that we do and all that we say.</i> ["We Need a Listening Ear," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1979, 5; also "President Kimball Speaks Out on Personal Journals," <i>New Era,</i> December 1980, 26]<br><br>We often remember section 25 for the specific responsibility charged to Emma Smith. In verses 11 and 12 we read:<br><br><i>And it shall be given thee . . . to make a selection of sacred hymns. . . .</i><br><br><i>For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads.</i><br><br>In 1835, five years after section 25 was revealed, the first hymnal was published. Those five years were difficult times for Emma. She had given birth to twins who lived for only three hours and had adopted twins, one of whom died of exposure when a mob invaded the home where they were staying.<br><br>The hymnbook was entitled <i>A Collection of Sacred Hymns, for the Church of the Latter Day Saints.</i> It included 90 hymn texts, 39 of which had been written by Latter-day Saint poets. It was common in that day for hymnbooks to include words only, with no music. This collection of hymns was published in a vest-pocket edition measuring only three inches by four-and-a-half inches.<br><br>Emma's charge was very clear. She was to create the collection of hymns, and she fulfilled her responsibilities dutifully. What is our charge to be? We probably won't receive a revelation from the Lord as direct as that which Emma received. So how are we to know what to do with our lives? What should be our career? Where should we live? How can we best use our gifts and talents to bless the lives of others?<br><br>The scriptures and living prophets can provide us direction in our lives. To speak to God, we pray. To hear God speak to us, we read the scriptures and feel the promptings ofthe Spirit.<br><br>Let me share another personal experience. When I completed my doctoral work and was looking for a full-time university position, I applied all over the United States. The first serious offer I received was from Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. I developed bronchitis on my interview trip. Consequently, I didn't feel as though I had interviewed well. Iwas amazed when they offered me the position and then gave me a week to get back to them. I had to make a decision.<br><br>In Doctrine and Covenants section 9 we are told to not simply ask the Lord what to do but to study it out in our minds, make a decision, and then ask the Lord if our decision is correct (see verses 7–9). I followed this counsel, doing everything in my power to make an informed decision. I learned everything I could about the university and the community, even speaking with local Church leaders and seeking out former students whom I did not know previously. Although I prayed continually throughout the week, I prayed most fervently the morning I needed to return their call with my decision. I told the Lord I had decided to accept their offer. The Spirit witnessed to me rather powerfully that I had made the correct decision, and off I went.<br><br>My experience in Carbondale, Illinois, was wonderful, but after three years I knew it was time for me to move on. So once again I started applying for jobs all over the country. One position open was at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. I remember thinking, "I really don't want to move to Hawaii, but this job announcement describes my skills exactly." So I threw my application in the ring. They offered me an interview and then the job. Again I followed the same process I had followed previously in order to determine if the Lord truly wanted me to move so far away from family and friends. But I did not receive the same strong conviction I had previously received.<br><br>During this time I was reading the Book of Mormon. I came across 2 Nephi 29:7, which reads:<br><br><i>Know ye not that there are more nations than one? Know ye not that I, the Lord your God, have created all men, and that I remember those who are upon the isles of the sea; and that I rule in the heavens above and in the earth beneath; and I bring forth my word unto the children of men, yea, even upon all the nations of the earth?</i><br><br>I felt as though the Lord was speaking directly to me: "Know ye not, Mary Anne, that I remember those who are upon the isles of the sea?" The Lord did not give me the same type of strong confirmation as before, but He spoke to me through the scriptures, saying, "If you choose to do this, you will not be alone--Iwill be with you." That was an answer to myprayers.<br><br>The opening hymn we sang today has particular meaning to me. It did not appear in the first hymnal Emma Smith compiled because it had not yet been written. The story that has been passed down through the years is that Charles L. Walker was bored during a very long sacrament meeting and amused himself by penning the words "Dearest children, God is near you." After the poem was written, John Menzies Macfarlane set the poem to music. Both Brother Walker and Brother Macfarlane were early pioneers who helped settle southern Utah. "Dearest Children, God Is Near You" was first published in the <i>Juvenile Instructor</i> in 1877 and eventually found its way into our hymnal. This hymn is particularly meaningful to me because the music was composed by my Great-Great-Grandfather Macfarlane. Family has conjectured that these two friends may have composed other hymns and songs together, but no others have survived. (See Karen Lynn Davidson, <i>Our Latter-Day Hymns: The Stories and the Messages</i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1988], 125–26.)<br><br>At the time I was asked to be a devotional speaker, I was also asked to select an opening hymn. I was fairly stunned by the invitation, and without much thinking I immediately responded, "Let's sing 'Dearest Children, God Is Near You.'" Once I began writing my talk, I realized that the words to this hymn corresponded nicely to what I wanted to discuss. The hymn provides a map, not unlike section 25, of what we are to do in this life to return to our heavenly home.<br><br><i>Dearest children, God is near you,</i><br><br><i>Watching o'er you day and night,</i><br><br><i>And delights to own and bless you,</i><br><br><i>If you strive to do what's right.</i><br><br><i>He will bless you, He will bless you,</i><br><br><i>If you put your trust in him.</i><br><br><i>Dearest children, holy angels</i><br><br><i>Watch your actions night and day,</i><br><br><i>And they keep a faithful record</i><br><br><i>Of the good and bad you say.</i><br><br><i>Cherish virtue! Cherish virtue!</i><br><br><i>God will bless the pure in heart.</i><br><br><i>Children, God delights to teach you</i><br><br><i>By his Holy Spirit's voice.</i><br><br><i>Quickly heed its holy promptings.</i><br><br><i>Day by day you'll then rejoice.</i><br><br><i>Oh, prove faithful, Oh, prove faithful</i><br><br><i>To your God and Zion's cause.</i><br><br>[<i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 96]<br><br>Earlier I provided three examples of why I am grateful for maps. These physical maps are not unlike the spiritual maps available to all of us. When my family and friends were trying to find my home, I was only a phone call away for clarification or reassurance. We can always reach our Heavenly Father through prayer. The map on my family-room wall as a child helped me see my life in a much broader perspective--similar to the eternal perspective Heavenly Father wishes us to take. And the map of Rome, Georgia, provided specific directions to get to our destination, not unlike the scriptures, patriarchal blessings, other priesthood blessings, and promptings of the Spirit.<br><br>Not only am I grateful for physical maps, Iam grateful that we have been given spiritual maps as well. I leave you with my testimony of Jesus Christ. I know He lives. I know He knows and loves each of us. I know He will help guide and direct our lives if we will but do our part. May we always keep our eye on "the things of eternity" and rely on our spiritual maps as we navigate through this life is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Mary Anne Prater was chair of the BYU Department of Counseling Psychology and Special Education when this devotional address was given on 10 June 2008.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>onal Game Plan - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, I am honored and humbled to stand before you this day. I appreciate the privilege of speaking to you about the gospel of Jesus Christ in our lives. We are blessed to be here at Brigham Young University. It is the Lord's university, and at this season we are very fortunate to be apart of this campus life.<br><br>I am a beneficiary of the BYU experience. When I arrived on campus many years ago, I did not realize how my time here would influence my future. After my mission my spiritual foundation was firm. Brigham Young University continued to build upon that foundation. It added the walls and the roof, which in turn created a gospel home for my family and me. I will always be thankful for my experience here.<br><br>Well, it is the first week of summer term. In fact, it is only the second day of classes. The good news is that you can't be more than two days behind in any of your assignments. As you can tell from my biography, I have always been involved in athletics in one aspect or another: I have participated as an athlete, I have coached, and I am currently serving in athletics administration. Athletics have been a major part of my life. I guess one of the main reasons I take pleasure in athletics is that they closely parallel the game of life. The lessons I have learned through my involvement in athletics have guided me through life's challenges and successes. Allow me to use some comparisons to illustrate my point.<br><br>In athletics one competes against an opponent. The challenger may be the opposing team, yourself, or the clock. In life we have the adversary as our opponent. He creates temptations and discourages us when we are trying our best.<br><br>In athletics one has a head coach, assistant coaches, trainers, strength coaches, and academic advisors. In life we have parents, teachers, counselors, Church leaders, and the Head Coach--the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>In athletics one competes to be challenged or to win an award, trophy, ring, or ribbon. In life we compete for educational pursuits, employment, and worldly possessions. We are also striving to live the commandments for our celestial reward.<br><br>In athletics during a competition there are momentum changes. One moment you are up by 12, then minutes later you could be down by two. In life we have peaks and valleys. We experience trials, heartaches, and sadness. We also experience success, peace, happiness, and joy.<br><br>In athletics there is pressure to perform in front of a stadium full of fans or spectators. In life we feel pressure to act in front of friends, family, and associates.<br><br>In athletics the game may dictate the proper way to manage the clock. In life we are often faced with the pressures of managing our time wisely and prioritizing the tasks at hand.<br><br>In athletics one develops physical endurance through conditioning and practice, and one must deal with injuries. In life we learn to have perseverance, patience, and long-suffering, and we suffer from illnesses of various kinds. We are taught to endure to the end.<br><br>And, lastly, in athletics one has personal goals, team goals, strategies, scouting reports, and game plans. In life we have goals, plans, aspirations, and dreams.<br><br>Both in athletics and in life, one of the most important things we can do is acquire and follow our personal game plan.<br><br>Did you begin this summer term at Brigham Young University with a game plan? If so, what is your game plan? Is your plan to be popular, have the nicest car, get a high grade point average, become the first chair in the orchestra, gain the lead role in a play, join a club or two, attend all your classes, and hand in all your assignments on time?<br><br>Allow me to ask you this question: What do you think your parents' game plan is for you? Let me give you a few ideas, having been a parent for over 20 years. I am sure they want you to do well in your classes, serve a mission, graduate from college, find a good spouse, seal your love in one of God's holy temples, have a great family, secure good employment, be a productive citizen, and of course live happily ever after. Have you adopted any of those strategies into your game plan?<br><br>Let me ask you another question: What is Heavenly Father's game plan for us? I am sure He would like you to implement some of your goals and some of your parents' goals. But His game plan for us is found in Moses 1:39: "For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man." Now that is a game plan. It appears to me that our Father in Heaven has high expectations for all of us. Have we embraced those goals?<br><br>As you begin to formulate your personal game plan, may I give you one piece of advice? Please acquire some strategies from those who love you. Sometimes those who love us may not always present these methods in the right moment or with the right tone, but we must use good discretion when receiving this advice. Those who love us are not perfect, but most of the time the advice they give us is.<br><br>In the short time that I have with you, I would like to share four essential strategies for a successful game plan. I am sure these will not be new to you, but they will be presented as the Spirit has dictated.<br><h2><b>Keep the Commandments</b></h2><br>Let us turn to the scriptures to discuss the first essential element. Lehi--a father and a prophet--spoke to his son Jacob and stated in 2 Nephi 2:25 that "men [and women] are, that they might have joy." So we are here upon this earth that we might have joy. We are here to experience the good things of this life. I think every one of us needs to profit from this blessed feeling. How do we receive this joy? Nephi--a brother, husband, father, and prophet--stated in 2 Nephi 5:10–11:<br><br><i>And we did observe to keep the judgments, and the statutes, and the commandments of the Lord in all things. ...</i><br><br><i>And the Lord was with us; and we did prosper exceedingly.</i><br><br>We receive this joy through keeping God's commandments. As we keep His commandments, we feel true joy and we prosper both temporally and spiritually. King Benjamin said in Mosiah 2:41:<br><br><i>And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual.</i><br><br>I enjoy being in the mountains. As I think about some of my favorite places on this earth, I think about hiking over the Teton Mountains on the Idaho-Wyoming border. The journey is a breathless experience. The hike from Driggs, Idaho, to Jenny Lake, Wyoming, is about 21 miles. The goal is to make it to Jenny Lake in time to catch the last ferry across. If you miss the ferry, you have to walk an additional two miles around the lake to reach your final destination. After walking 21 miles in one day, you can't bear the thought of walking an additional two miles.<br><br>Crossing all that terrain without a map would be a foolish adventure. Even with a map you can lose your way if the map isn't followed properly. As you obey the map, you find your way to your journey's end. If you reach your final destination and catch the last ferryboat leaving the dock that day--and, believe me, that is what you want to do--your joy is full.<br><br>Commandments are our map. They are what we must follow in this game of life. They give us directions, guidelines, and a course of action. Obedience to this path will bring us to our eternal destination. My patriarchal blessing states that "commandments are nothing more than wise instructions from a loving Father." Let me say it again: "Commandments are nothing more than wise instructions from a loving Father." He knows and cares for our earthly existence and wants more than we know for us to return back to His presence. What a reunion that will be! What joy can be greater than making it back to the Father who created us? He sent us off to school to learn the lessons of life, and He wants us back home.<br><br>In athletics we work out our physical bodies in order to compete at the highest level. In life we need to exercise our spiritual muscles. This will give us the strength to overcome temptations and obey the commandments. We need to compete against our physical and spiritual opponent--"the wiles of the devil" (Helaman 3:29, Ephesians 6:11). To secure assistance in obeying the commandments, I firmly believe in the second essential element of your game plan: personal prayer.<br><h2><b>Have Frequent and Fervent Prayer</b></h2><br>Communication with our Father in Heaven is vital for so many aspects in our lives, especially the spiritual one. Alma told his son Helaman:<br><br><i>Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good; yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God; and if ye do these things, ye shall be lifted up at the last day.</i> [Alma 37:37]<br><br>This is good advice from a father to a son.<br><br>Most of us would find it very difficult to set an appointment with some of our most prominent leaders in this world. It commonly requires days, weeks, and sometimes months to schedule an appointment with anyone who has some type of professional title. I suffer from a condition called gout. One February not so long ago I experienced a major attack. I wanted immediate medical attention to receive some type of relief. The earliest appointment the specialist's secretary could make for me was August of that same year--seven months later.<br><br>The greatest aspect of prayer for me is that we can speak to the highest-ranking individual in this universe--God, our Heavenly Father--at any time and in any place we so desire. There is no need for an appointment. He is always there and always listening. And, most important, He is always, always giving us answers to our supplications. Let me repeat this: You need no appointment.<br><br>Elder Richard G. Scott stated:<br><br><i>Prayer is a supernal gift of our Father in Heaven to every soul. Think of it: the absolute Supreme Being, the most all-knowing, all-seeing, all-powerful personage, encourages you and me, as insignificant as we are, to converse with Him as our Father.</i> ["Using the Supernal Gift of Prayer," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2007, 8]<br><br>Most people, young and old, have experienced the wonderful electronic device called the cell phone. You know how frustrating it is when calls are ignored or not answered. Our Father in Heaven always answers our calls. Our reception or signal is always in range. Our prayer plan consists of unlimited minutes.<br><br>I would like to share with you a personal experience I had with prayer when I was in my youth. The setting was my junior year in high school. I was making plans with my friends to attend the junior prom. We already had in mind what we were going to do before and during the prom, but we had not finalized plans for after the prom. It was common, growing up on the East Coast, to drive down to the New Jersey shore and spend the night on the beach as an after-the-prom activity. We had the location mapped out and the cars and drivers prepared to make the trip. As the date approached I thought it would be a good idea to run these plans by my mother. I explained to her what we had planned to do after the prom. She could see that I was filled with enthusiasm but said with no hesitation, "I don't think it is a good idea that you go."<br><br>I said, "What? I have waited 17 years for this event to take place in my life. I am going to the New Jersey shore."<br><br>She replied, "I don't think it is a good idea, but can you do me a favor and pray about it?"<br><br>I said, "Pray about it? Why would Heavenly Father care if I go to the beach after the prom?"<br><br>My mother asked me once again to pray about it. I said okay, and I thought to myself, "Well, this will be easy. I will go downstairs to my room and listen to my music. I will then go back upstairs and tell my mother that Heavenly Father said it's okay to go." So I went downstairs, turned on the music, put on my headphones, and began to relax.<br><br>Halfway through the second song, I began to feel a little guilty. I turned off the music and sat there for a moment pondering the conversation I had had with my mother. I dropped to my knees on the side of my bed and began to pray. I did not know exactly why I was praying, only that I had told my mother that I would. I told Heavenly Father about my prom plans. I then asked if He approved of them. I didn't feel very comfortable with the stupor of thought passing through my mind. I prayed more intently to get the answer I was seeking. I felt like Heavenly Father was saying no. I could not understand what was happening to me and my plans. For some reason this was not turning out as I had wanted.<br><br>I began to ask, "Why? Why no? Why not?" The words came to me that I should read Isaiah 55:8–9. Isaiah? What does Isaiah know about the junior prom? I opened up my Bible and read:<br><br><i>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.</i><br><br><i>For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.</i><br><br>"Wow," I thought to myself, "I have just received personal revelation through prayer." It was not exactly the answer I was looking for, but I had just received an answer. I went upstairs and rehearsed the whole experience to my mother. She smiled and gave me the look only a mother can give. Not one major tragedy happened that night, but several small ones did. Mostly everyone was drinking alcohol and using drugs. Immorality was commonplace amongst my friends. It was not the atmosphere I needed to be in that night. But the most important event was that a 17-year-old boy received an answer to his prayer and gained more faith in his Heavenly Father's game plan.<br><br>Before departing the mission field, I had my final interview with my mission president, Robert A. Harding. He said to me that if I wanted to maintain my spiritual balance in this life, I needed to make sure to have frequent and fervent prayers. He was another Church leader concerned about my game plan.<br><h2><b>Be Inspired by the Scriptures</b></h2><br>The third essential element that is necessary for your personal strategy is dedicating your time to the scriptures. In the Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 4:15, Nephi stated: "For my soul delighteth in the scriptures, and my heart pondereth them, and writeth them for the learning and the profit of my children."<br><br>My brothers and sisters, history does repeat itself. We can learn from the past. The scriptures are the greatest playbooks ever written. Just as a coach gives direction to his team, the scriptures warn us and motivate us to live our lives carefully and in harmony with gospel principles. The scriptures provide answers for our temporal and spiritual well-being. The Spirit will inspire and convert our hearts and testimonies at different moments in our lives. Most of the time He will do it while we are pondering or studying the scriptures. The scriptures take on new meaning at different stages in our lives. The same verse can broaden our insight with new messages that differ from those of many years before.<br><br>As a young father I struggled to keep our family consistent in reading the scriptures on a daily basis. One day I heard a mother of a new missionary give a talk in sacrament meeting. She asked her son before he departed on his mission what was the most important thing he learned in the family. He said, "Mom, it was our family getting together every morning and reading the scriptures. Those were the best lessons I learned." This mother was astonished at his answer. She only remembered him coming to the family scripture reading every morning half asleep with his blanket pulled over his head. She gained a testimony that day, as did I, that the scriptures have tremendous spiritual power and influence over those who spend the time pondering, studying, and reading them.<br><br>In a First Presidency message in 1976, President Spencer W. Kimball said:<br><br><i>I am convinced that each of us, at some time in our lives, must discover the scriptures for ourselves--and not just discover them once, but rediscover them again and again. ...</i><br><br><i>The Lord is not trifling with us when he gives us these things, for "unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required." (Luke 12:48.) Access to these things means responsibility for them. We must study the scriptures according to the Lord's commandment (see 3 Ne. 23:1–5); and we must let them govern our lives.</i> ["First Presidency Message: How Rare a Possession--the Scriptures!" <i>Ensign,</i> September 1976, 4, 5]<br><h2><b>Protect Yourselves from the Adversary</b></h2><br>I would like to conclude with the last essential element. Before we participate in athletics or a competition, we generally use some type of uniform, gear, or equipment. Ephesians 6:11–12 reads:<br><br><i>Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.</i><br><br>[Now listen to this:] <i>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.</i><br><br>Sometimes it is hard enough to compete against an opponent we can see. I believe it is even more difficult to compete against the adversary--one whom we don't see. We need to protect ourselves and be prepared to compete and to battle our nemesis. Elder M. Russell Ballard stated:<br><br><i>I like to think of this spiritual armor not as a solid piece of metal molded to fit the body, but more like chain mail. Chain mail consists of dozens of tiny pieces of steel fastened together to allow the user greater flexibility without losing protection. I say that because it has been my experience, covering many more years than you have yet been privileged to live, that there is not one great and grand thing we can do to arm ourselves spiritually. True spiritual power lies in numerous smaller acts woven together in a fabric of spiritual fortification that protects and shields from all evil.</i> ["Be Strong in the Lord, and in the Power of His Might," BYU devotional, 3 March 2002]<br><br>To me, that is another great apostle of the Lord shouting out signals from the sidelines.<br><br>Allow me to use one last personal story. As a young man I had great dreams of one day playing college football and also playing in the National Football League. I set high goals and expectations for myself to achieve while in high school. I remember going the extra mile during the off-season so that I could compete and perform at my highest level.<br><br>The football season did not go so well. At the end of the season our team had won only two games. After the last game of the year I walked off the field with my head down. I was discouraged, and rightly so. My mother spotted me from a distance and noticed the disappointment in my body language. She came over to me as I tried to walk away from her. She asked me what was wrong. I said, "I am so frustrated. I have worked so hard to make myself better, and we can't win more than two games. I feel like a loser."<br><br>She said to me in that moment words that changed my life for good. She said, "Son, I know that you are disappointed in the results of your team. I know you have put forth much effort in your preparation to be successful. But I promise you: Because you have the gospel in your life, you are on the Lord's team. And if you keep His commandments, you will be a winner in this life."<br><br>Those words have resonated with me and have echoed in my mind for the last 30 years.<br><br>Here is just one more example of one who loved me and gave me direction in a time of need. In the words of Elder Neal A. Maxwell:<br><br><i>Actually, brothers and sisters, Jesus is already victorious in the greatest battle anyway: "In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer;</i> I have overcome the world" <i>(John 16:33). ...</i><br><br><i>... Moreover, though we live in a failing world, we have not been sent here to fail.</i> ["Encircled in the Arms of His Love," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2002, 16, 17; emphasis in original]<br><br>The battle has been won. We know the final outcome. We need to choose whose team we want to be on. Joshua 24:15 states: "Choose you this day whom ye will serve; ... but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord."<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith was an outstanding coach. He said in Doctrine and Covenants 128:22: "Brethren [and sisters], shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren; and on, on to the victory!"<br><br>My dear brothers and sisters, know what your personal game plan is for today and for your future. Incorporate these strategies into your lives. Keep the commandments, have frequent and fervent prayer, be inspired by the scriptures, and protect yourselves from the adversary. I know we have a Redeemer and Savior. He stands at the head of this Church. He knows us personally and loves us individually. He is Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God. In His holy name, even Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>E. J.

<h1>Strength in Christ - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am honored to address all who are listening today. My thoughts are directed primarily to you, my student colleagues, who represent the future of the Church and the hope of families in the world. Today we will consider how the Atonement of Christ can help us become strong in response to our God-given weaknesses. We will discover that our weaknesses are assets because they help us be humble. And when we humbly seek our Heavenly Father and are endowed with grace, we become strong in Christ.<br><br>As a young Primary boy, I learned that Heber J. Grant was truly a great man. He served as president of the Church from 1918 to 1945 and was ordained an apostle at age 25. In general conference in April 2000, President James E. Faust used examples from President Grant's life in his talk "The Power ofSelf-Mastery":<br><br><i>Part of</i> [President Grant's] <i>strength was his great determination for self-mastery. His father died when he was only a year old, and his widowed mother struggled to raise him. He was conscientious in helping her and trying to take care of her.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>President Faust quoted Roderick L. Cameron's description of Heber J. Grant's struggle to become proficient playing baseball:<br><br><i>When he was older and wanted to join a baseball team, he found the other fellows laughing at him and calling him a "sissy" because he could not throw the ball between the bases. His teammates teased him so much that one night he went home and made up his mind that he was going to play with the nine who would win the championship of the Territory of Utah. He purchased a baseball and practiced hour after hour, throwing at a neighbor's old barn. Often his arm would ache so much he could hardly go to sleep at night. He kept on practicing, and kept on improving and advancing from one team to another until he finally did succeed in playing with the</i> [team] <i>who won the championship!</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>Another instance of his self-mastery was his determination to have readable handwriting:<br><br><i>His penmanship was so poor that when two of his</i> [friends] <i>were looking at it one said to the other, "That writing looks like hen tracks." "No," said the other, "it looks as if lightning had struck an inkbottle."</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>Heber realized at that point that he could not be much good to an employer or society if he did not improve his penmanship. He practiced and worked at it persistently. Over the next few years he was offered lucrative jobs because of his superior penmanship, won first prize in a contest against professional penmen, and taught penmanship and bookkeeping at the University of Utah.<br><br>Another challenge for President Grant was singing:<br><br><i>When he was a small child . . . he could not carry a tune. When he was ten, a music instructor worked and worked with him, trying to teach him the simplest song and finally gave up in despair. At the age of twenty-six, when he was an apostle, he asked a Professor Sims if he could teach him how to sing. After listening to him, the professor replied, "Yes, you can learn to sing, but I would like to be forty miles away while you are doing it."</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>This only made him try harder.<br><br>President Grant once said, "I have practiced [the hymn "Praise God, from Whom AllBlessings Flow"] between three and four hundred times, and there are only four lines, and Icannot sing it yet."<sup>5</sup><br><br><i>Once, on a trip to Arizona with Elder Clawson and Elder Kimball,</i> [President Grant] <i>asked them if he could sing one hundred songs on the way. They thought he was joking and said, "Fine, go right ahead." After the first forty, they assured him if he sang the other sixty they would both have a nervous breakdown. He sang the other sixty.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>President Faust concluded that "by practicing all of his life he made some improvement in singing but perhaps not as much as in baseball and penmanship, which he mastered."<sup>7</sup><br><br>I greatly admire President Grant's faith, courage, and determination to work on his weaknesses. And, like our living prophets on earth today, I appreciate the example of President Grant in becoming strong in Christ. President Grant often used a quote attributed to Ralph Waldo Emerson: "That which we persist in doing becomes easier for us to do; not that the nature of the thing itself is changed, but that our power to do is increased."<sup>8</sup><br><br>Reflecting on that quote, I value President Grant's view that our weak nature may not change but that there is a power, even a heavenly power, to do important things in spite of that weakness. If you'll permit, I will speak of my own experience with weakness and of what I have learned from the Lord.<br><br>I have always known that I possess both strengths and weaknesses. Let me tell you about one of my weaknesses. I am often a perfectionist who becomes worried and sometimes obsessed with wanting to do well and look good. Maybe someone who has perfectionist tendencies sounds ideal, since perfectionists are known for conscientious, precise, detailed, and practical work. But while the attributes listed may appear praiseworthy, they can get in the way. Take it from someone who has been there and tried that. The problem with perfectionism is that no one is perfect now, and perfectionism creates unrealistic expectations for ourselves and others. I had to chuckle at a bumper sticker I saw the other day. It read, "I would be perfect--but I can't seem to get the walking on water thing down."<br><br>My weakness is based on the fear of looking bad or performing poorly. For example, as a young boy and teenager I was very tall, but my ball-handling abilities were definitely lacking. In fear of looking bad in front of my peers, I often avoided sports and physical activities unless I knew I could show a little talent--which didn't happen very often. Also, I used to hate making phone calls--not because I was shy, but because I didn't want to say something wrong, sound dumb, or take the chance of being seen in a bad light.<br><br>As a student in college, the attributes of the perfectionist are of benefit when revising a manuscript, yet they have no place when writing a first draft. Fear of looking bad is a pretty common tendency for many of us. But I became obsessed, anxious, and preoccupied with making sure that I was good--really good. These reactions to fear held me back attimes.<br><br>I did not need to feel this way. When my weakness flared, my primary attention was on me and my performance. This inward perspective often prompted me to be critical of my work and of the work of others. It also led to sins that included being selfish, critical of others, frustrated, unloving, and impatient. My self-absorbed fear of looking bad left little room in my heart for love, joy, or peace.<br><br>Can you understand how my weakness caused pressures, stress, and trials not only for myself but also for others? While hard work and personal dedication were helpful in dealing with my weakness, only the Atonement could fully compensate for my weakness. Once I understood this, things began to change.<br><br>Let me explain. With the inspired comment of a priesthood leader, I began to more fully understand this personal weakness--the fear of looking bad. Although it was not easy to acknowledge at the time, it gave me reason to go to the Lord. I asked for help to understand my weakness, and I received many answers through the scriptures. Once the Lord began to help me understand my weakness, I began to understand the help I would need from the Lord to deal with it.<br><br>At first I prayed for the weakness to be taken away--to be removed like sin as one repents. However, it did not go away. Rather, Ibegan to feel peace in knowing the Lord would help me deal with it. I felt humbled and recognized my dependence on the mercy and grace of the Savior. I fully embraced the fact that perfection could not come on my own. Once the consequences of my weaknesses were being resolved and my fears were lessened, I could feel myself becoming more selfless, sensitive, and easygoing. Through the Lord's grace, I do not take myself too seriously, I enjoy helping people feel comfortable and happy, and I feel comfortable being myself.<br><br>I have witnessed how my weakness has helped me to be strong in Christ. For example, while serving as a bishop, I had many opportunities to meet with individuals and counsel with them. Time and time again I felt the Spirit fill my heart and mind with what to say. In these moments, if I had been worried about saying things exactly the right way, with preplanned precision, the flow of the Lord's Spirit would have been stopped. As I relied on the Lord in my weakness, he "loosed my tongue" and "opened my mouth" at the very moments I needed it.<sup>9</sup> Fortunately, through the Lord's tender mercies, He blessed two people in those interviews: the person seeking inspired counsel and me, that my fears would be softened.<br><br>Now, let me just say that although my weakness has not been taken away, it has helped me become strong, because it enables me to turn to the Lord, rely on Him, and recognize the power of the Atonement in my life. For that reason, I have come to refer to my continuing weakness as my "sacred struggle." The power of the Atonement is designed not only to free us from sin but also to strengthen us in the presence of our weakness. I have learned to be grateful for my gifts of weakness and to acknowledge that the Lord has helped me become better, stronger, and happier because ofthem.<br><br>As I have studied the scriptures and learned about strengths and weaknesses, I have noticed a pattern that appears over and over again. Today, let's review a scriptural pattern from the words of Moroni in Ether 12:27 and ponder its application to each of our lives.<br><br>In Ether 12:27 we read:<br><br><i>And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</i><br><br>From this verse, I'd like to share the five A's of finding strength in Christ. As we review the verse, I invite you to consider how you can apply these A's to your own circumstances and to your own weaknesses. Here is the pattern for finding strength in Christ:<br><br>1. Accept Christ's invitation to come to Him.<br><br>2. Ascertain our God-given weaknesses.<br><br>3. Appreciate weaknesses as gifts to help us be humble.<br><br>4. Allow Christ's grace to strengthen and enable us.<br><br>5. Acknowledge that "when I am weak, then am I strong."<sup>10</sup><br><br>Verse 23 is given in response to Moroni's fear that his words will be seen as weak and awkward or that they may be criticized by us when we read them in the latter days: "The Gentiles will mock at these things, because of our weakness in writing."<sup>11</sup><br><br>To this the Lord reassures the prophet, "My grace is sufficient for the meek, that they shall take no advantage of your weakness."<sup>12</sup><br><br>Personally, I think that Moroni is "a literary genius"<sup>13</sup> and among the great heroes of all time. Yet, at the time he lived, Moroni was concerned that his writings would not in some way measure up.<br><h2><b>1. Accept Christ's Invitation to Come to Him</b></h2><br>The first step in finding strength in Christ is to accept Christ's invitation to come to Him. In Ether 12:27 the Lord said that "if men come unto [Him]" He will bless them. The Lord always provides an invitation to us when He wants to bless us. He loves us unconditionally and wants us to choose to come to Him. Coming unto Jesus is the source of being happy and is the test of our existence. So, when we choose to come to Him, He will give us what we need.<br><h2><b>2. Ascertain Our God-Given Weaknesses</b></h2><br>Once we accept Christ's invitation to come to Him, we are ready to ascertain our God-given weaknesses. Remember, in Ether 12:27 the Lord said, "I will show unto them their weakness." With the Lord's help, we must recognize and understand our weakness. Weakness is defined as "the condition of being mortal and lacking ability, strength, or skill."<sup>14</sup> Weaknesses exist because we live in an imperfect state as "natural"--or mortal--men and women. Examples of weakness include being disorganized or short-tempered; having a tendency toward a personality challenge; having a defect or failing in athletics, music, public speaking, or writing; or having challenges with physical or financial circumstances. However, these weaknesses need not be seen as liabilities. In reality, these and other weaknesses can be assets because of what they may do for us.<br><br>Now, let me make a clarification here. There is a difference between weakness and sin. Sin is a conscious act that violates God's law, and sinners often desire to hide or mask their sins from others. Weaknesses are not choices but are hallowed gifts from God, and thus they are not sins. God-given weaknesses do not require repentance, since they are gifts to help us humbly rely on God and love and assist others. Fortunately, the Atonement is always available for you and me when we depend upon Him because of our sins and weaknesses. Thus our weaknesses become another important way for us to rely upon the Lord's Atonement throughout our lives.<br><br>I love the Prophet Joseph Smith. I honor him for his example and his dedication to the Lord and to the Restoration of the gospel. I find great comfort in knowing that even this incredible prophet struggled through his weaknesses. Three years following the young prophet's vision of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, Joseph was humbled by the persecutions he had been experiencing. In fact, he said, "Ioften felt condemned for my weakness and imperfections."<sup>15</sup> So, isn't it wonderful that none of us are exempt from weaknesses? They truly are gifts from God.<br><h2><b>3. Appreciate Weaknesses as Gifts to Help UsBe Humble</b></h2><br>Once we accept Christ's invitation to come to Him and ascertain our God-given weaknesses, the third step in finding strength in Christ is learning to appreciate our weaknesses as gifts to help us be humble. In verse 27 of Ether 12, the Lord said, "I give unto men weakness that they may be humble." We are each blessed by Heavenly Father with gifts of strength and gifts of weakness. Each type of gift is a prized possession. Sometimes we may want only the kinds of gifts that are recognized as strengths. But a life of all strengths would actually be quite dull and would not allow us to grow in the ways the Lord desires.<br><br>It is clear from the scriptures that God gives men weaknesses. Christ knows our weaknesses, and He promises: "He that is weak among you hereafter shall be made strong."<sup>16</sup> However, some may mistakenly believe that if we follow the Lord then everything will become easier and less problematic. Living the gospel does not ensure that we will not experience any pain or challenges, but it does provide an assurance when challenges do come. We may wonder why a loving Heavenly Father wants us to see our weaknesses. Heavenly Father wants to bless us and help us grow. That is the point of mortality. As we see and recognize our weaknesses, we are humbled, and we turn to the Lord for help.<br><br>I am reminded of a humorous story told by Sheri L. Dew. She told of a mother of eight children who one afternoon was briefly frazzled with weakness as she worked with her young children. She called her husband for comfort at that difficult moment.<br><br>With humor in her voice she said to her husband, "Remind me, why <i>did</i> we have eight children?"<br><br>To this he replied, "Because the Lord knew we could have handled seven just fine."<sup>17</sup><br><br>This story may relate to our weaknesses--the Lord gives us weaknesses plus sometimes even a little bit more so that we can grow and stretch and become who He wants us to become.<br><br>We can grumble about our weaknesses and try to ignore them, or we can embrace the challenges to be stretched and to grow. Weaknesses are all about our humility, not about our liabilities. When we actively approach our weaknesses in humility and with grace, our mortal journey will be rewarding, with indescribable glimpses of eternal joy. The key is to be humble, to seek the Lord for help, and to glory in the grace of Jesus Christ!<br><h2><b>4. Allow Christ's Grace to Strengthen and Enable Us</b></h2><br>Now, let's once more read Moroni's counsel in verse 27 in Ether 12:<br><br><i>If men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me.</i><br><br>If we are willing to humble ourselves, the Lord promises, "My grace is sufficient." The key phrase is "my grace is sufficient." In the Bible Dictionary, <i>grace</i> is defined as "an enabling power" and a "divine means of help or strength, given through the bounteous mercy and love of Jesus Christ."<sup>18</sup> The connection between humility and grace is critical, because when there is "'sufficient humility' in us, Christ pours down sufficient grace [to compensate for what we lack]. That grace purges, cleanses, heals, and strengthens."<sup>19</sup><br><br>When Elder David A. Bednar was newly sustained as an apostle, he declared that he was among the weakest of the world. Yet he shared the significance of the Lord's grace:<br><br><i>The enabling and strengthening aspect of the Atonement helps us to see and to do and to become good in ways that we could never recognize or accomplish with our limited mortal capacity.</i><sup>20</sup><br><h2><b>5. Acknowledge That "When I Am Weak, Then Am I Strong"</b></h2><br>The final and fifth step to finding strength in Christ is to acknowledge that "when I am weak, then am I strong." The Lord reminded us in Ether 12, "For if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them." And, just a few verses later, the Lord promised Moroni, "Because thou hast seen thy weakness thou shalt be made strong, even unto the sitting down in the place which I have prepared in the mansions of my Father."<sup>21</sup><br><br>Wow! This is a hopeful and inspiring message! This refining and polishing process is among the most sacred experiences we can hope for. This process is not about being weak or infirm because of weakness. It is about being made strong through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Please remember that humility and grace qualify us for the Atonement. The Prophet Joseph Smith's experience in Liberty Jail illustrates how profound humility leads to profound grace and eternal blessings. For four months the Prophet and several others unjustly experienced severe struggles in the miserable circumstances of the jail. But after Joseph's heartfelt pleading, the Savior comforted him often and reassured him with these words: "Know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good."<sup>22</sup> Thus the Lord focused on blessing each prisoner in his heart and soul--not changing their physical circumstances until several weeks later.<br><br>The role of the Atonement is to transform <i>us,</i> not our weaknesses. We may feel imprisoned at times by our weakness, trial, sin, or pain, but the way the Atonement helps us is by changing <i>us--</i>not necessarily by taking away weaknesses, trials, sin, or pain. The Lord's goal is to strengthen, build, and develop our capacity through the Atonement--a process we may call perfection.<br><br>We learn and grow from our experiences, our weaknesses, and our trials. While we can overcome some weaknesses, most stay with us for many years or throughout mortality. Weaknesses that linger can provide defining moments for us in becoming the men and women God has sent us here to become. Additionally, the Atonement is available to pay for the effect of our weaknesses upon others. Weaknesses manifest between couples or families are probably the most important for us to deal with. That said, it is also important for each of us to be tolerant of others' weaknesses. Thus, in Heavenly Father's glorious plan, our weaknesses and challenges can keep us holding fast to the Lord, feeling supported by the Lord, and experiencing indescribable joy, peace, and love from the Lord.<br><br>So, as a review, the five A's for finding strength in Christ are as follows:<br><br>1. Accept Christ's invitation to come to Him.<br><br>2. Ascertain our God-given weaknesses.<br><br>3. Appreciate weaknesses as gifts to help us be humble.<br><br>4. Allow Christ's grace to strengthen and enable us.<br><br>5. Acknowledge that "when I am weak, then am I strong."<br><br>Now, let me share one of my favorite scriptures pertaining to weaknesses, found in 2 Corinthians 12:7–10. In his letters to the Corinthians, the Apostle Paul shared a personal way to see a weakness that was given tohim by Heavenly Father.<br><br>In verse 7 he provided a descriptive representation of his weakness:<br><br><i>And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh.</i><br><br>In his case, Paul knew that he had received this gift of weakness so that he could be humble. But, because of his metaphor of a thorn, it does not appear that he wanted this weakness to stick around.<br><br>In verse 8 we learn his response to his unwanted gift. As we review this verse, think of its similarity to what Moroni taught in Ether 12. Paul said:<br><br><i>For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.</i><br><br>I take great comfort in knowing that Paul's original feeling was to ask God to help him get rid of this weakness--even to the point of asking Heavenly Father three times to take it away. However, after three pleadings to Heavenly Father, Paul accepted the Lord's answer. In verse 9 we read:<br><br><i>And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.</i> [And now my favorite part:] <i>Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.</i><br><br>Please notice the marvelous transformation that Paul experienced as he humbly approached Heavenly Father with his weakness. Because of the peace, love, comfort, and strength granted him through the Atonement of Christ, he learned to gladly welcome his weaknesses.<br><br>In verse 10, we then learn the following redeeming promise:<br><br><i>Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities . . . : forwhen I am weak, then am I strong.</i><br><br>Paul's powerful example illustrates the wonder and majesty of the Lord in helping each of us become strong through our weaknesses.<br><br>In conclusion, I testify that once you and I come to know our God-given weaknesses, we will begin to see the marvelous plan of the Lord and increasingly view the Atonement in a new and wonderful way. The Atonement is the source of the strength we need. This divine power will become active as we rely on the Savior through humility and grace. Then we can testify, as the Apostle Paul declared, "I take pleasure in infirmities . . . : for when I am weak, then am I strong."<br><br>I encourage you to start today. Accept Christ's invitation to come to Him and begin your own journey and experience of seeing the Atonement's influence on your weaknesses. I encourage each of us to pay attention to the feelings and impressions we have received. If you have not already done so, may I encourage you to write down those spiritual impressions and make a determination to follow the promptings you have received. Paying attention to those impressions is more important than the words you have heard.<br><br>I testify that the Lord is ready now to be a growing part of our lives. He seeks to do this by helping us overcome sin. He seeks to provide comfort and assistance when we face trials, struggles, or challenges. And, as we have considered today, He also seeks to be part of our lives by helping us become strong through our weaknesses.<br><br>I am humbled and profoundly grateful for the grace and love that I have felt when I have turned to the Lord with these needs. With all my heart, I know He lives and has the capacity to lead us back to our Heavenly Father. We can become perfect in Christ and thus be filled with the Lord's blessings of joy, peace, and love. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Michael D. Barnes was a professor of health science when this devotional address was given at BYU on 1 July 2008.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1> Eternal Truths Through Our Relationships with Others - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning to all of you in attendance today. I am most honored to be here, but Imust admit that picking the topic for today and preparing this talk have not been easy tasks. My concerns and prayers have been that I will be able to talk about things that will strengthen testimonies, both yours and mine.<br><br>During spring term I was with a group of Study Abroad nursing students in Australia. I asked them what kinds of devotional speeches were most memorable to them. They said, "Talks with stories." They know I tell a lot of stories as I teach and may have given that answer to make it easy for me. Nonetheless I decided to act on their advice and tell stories. In fact, some of my stories are going to be about nursing students.<br><br>Much of my time here at BYU is spent teaching students how to build therapeutic relationships. Over the years I have come to realize that there isn't much to do with the gospel that isn't about relationships--either our relationships with Heavenly Father and the Savior or with our fellowmen. So today I want to talk about learning eternal truths through our relationships with others.<br><br>Some years ago I was called to teach the four-year-olds in Primary. After a few months of teaching, I began to be somewhat frustrated. The bottom line of every lesson, regardless of the title, was "You are Heavenly Father's child, and He loves you." I thought, "I have given the same lesson a hundred different ways. Surely there is something more these four-year-olds should know." However, as I have grown older and wiser, I have come to realize that the message being taught was the most important lesson they could learn. We don't emphasize that message in Primary only, but in every organization of the Church and in documents available to the entire world. President Henry B. Eyring beautifully explained how our relationship with our Father in Heaven provides the sure foundation for relationships with others in the introduction to his book <i>Because He First Loved Us.</i> President Eyring said:<br><br><i>The first and great commandment is this: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy might, mind, and strength; and in the name of Jesus Christ thou shalt serve him" (D&amp;amp;C 59:5). The restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ through the Prophet Joseph Smith brought many blessings. For me, none is more precious than a knowledge of the loving nature of our Heavenly Father and of His Son, Jesus Christ. When the Holy Ghost confirms that knowledge to us, our hearts are prepared to keep that first and great commandment.</i><br><br><i>Keeping the first commandment always leads to keeping the second, because to love the Father and the Son is to serve those They love. In answer to our prayers for guidance, They send the Holy Ghost to tell us how to help others and to feel at least a part of God's love. So in that service, our love of God increases and the keeping of the second great commandment leads us back to the first, in an ascending circle. In time, our very natures change. We are filled with the love of God, which, even in a world with so much misery and despair, brings us happiness and hope.</i> [Henry B. Eyring, <i>Because He First Loved Us</i> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2002), ix]<br><br>Most of my growing-up years were spent on a ranch in a remote area of Idaho. The two most important dances of the year in our high school were the Christmas formal and the junior prom. When I was a freshman I was asked to the Christmas formal by a very nice boy named Jerry. Even though Jerry was nice, I didn't consider him to be one of the "cool" guys at our school and wasn't sure I wanted to go with him. Luckily it was Friday afternoon as I was hurrying to catch the bus home from school when he stopped me to ask me to the dance. I quickly explained that I had to ask permission from my Dad and would let him know later.<br><br>Most of us lived on ranches some distance from town and didn't have telephones, so I had until Monday to give my answer. At that time the Church had not established guidelines regarding the appropriate age for dating. I was about a month away from turning 15. Ihad been on a couple of dates and had gotten permission for those dates from my mother, but my mother had died in an accident on our ranch some months earlier. A lot of thoughts were going through my head as I rode home on the bus that afternoon. I suspected my dad thought I was too young to date. There were few Latter-day Saints living in our area, and Jerry wasn't one of them. Even though we had never discussed it, I knew Dad would prefer I date members. So I came to the conclusion that,all things considered, Dad would say I couldn't go to the dance with Jerry and I wouldn't have to worry about it anymore.<br><br>However, things didn't go as I expected. Iexplained the situation to Dad, ending with "and so I told him I needed to ask you, and it isokay if you say I can't go."<br><br>After a pause, Dad replied, "Jeannie, I know the boy's father, and he seems like a good man, but I don't know the boy. I won't know most of the boys who will be asking you out. You know the boys in your school and what they are like. You know the kind of person you should be dating. So you are going to have to make those decisions."<br><br>I learned a lot from that short exchange. First, my father trusted me. He trusted that Iknew the difference between good and bad behavior and would make wise choices about dating. Second, in a flash of understanding, which hit me like a ton of bricks, I realized Icouldn't place the responsibility for my decisions or the consequences of those decisions onanyone else.<br><br>Some might consider my father an unwise parent for placing that responsibility on a not-quite 15-year-old. However, my father knew me well. He had spent a good part of each day of my short life with me. He knew how I reacted when, after repeated scolding, he finally spanked me to get me to stop chasing the chickens. He knew I had a mind of my own and that more often than not I preferred to make my own decisions. He also knew I had a testimony of the gospel and wanted to do what was right. Being given the responsibility for dating decisions caused me to focus on the decision I had to make rather than on my need for independence or any rebelliousness I may have felt in reaction to restrictions Dad could have established. I am certain my father felt the burden of being a single parent and had sought the Lord's help through prayer long before our interaction about dating. He also had a clear understanding of the principle of agency. In that brief interchange he removed a source of potential conflict from our relationship and indirectly said to me, "You have your agency; use it wisely." Did I go to the dance? Yes. Did I always make wise decisions about dating? No.<br><br>Just as my father's knowing me made it possible for him to respond in a helpful way, so it is for us as we seek to be helpful to one another. One of the first things students discover when they come to work in a psychiatric setting is that their skills are limited when it comes to communicating in an honest, open, yet nurturing manner. It is not unusual for their limitation to become apparent when a patient of the opposite sex asks for their address or phone number so he or she can contact them for a date after being discharged. Feeling uncomfortable and distressed, students often respond by giving an easy and not totally honest answer, such as "I am married" or "I am engaged" or "I am dating someone." Then they quickly find a reason to leave. When I suggest that their response implied that they would be willing to give the patient their number if they were not otherwise attached, the problems with the response are apparent. Searching for a better response, we usually come up with something like "Your question makes me uncomfortable because I am here to learn how to be a good nurse. Having a personal relationship with a patient would get in the way of my doing that. It sounds like you are wishing you had somebody to spend time with when you get out of the hospital. Can we talk aboutthat?"<br><br>The new response openly expresses the student's feelings and establishes the boundaries of the relationship without rejecting the patient. In order to model that response during future interactions, students must learn to recognize and manage their own feelings so they can listen closely enough to identify the patient's underlying concern. We can't understand others in ways that are meaningful enough to lead to helpful and positive relationships, be they personal or professional, unless we are willing to give our full attention as weinteract.<br><br>In today's world we have technology that allows us to save time and multitask to the max. As you all know, IT stands for information technology. IT equipment is made to communicate information. It does not communicate feelings or nonverbal messages, nor is it a conveyance for spiritual impressions. Although technology allows us to communicate important information that may be spiritual in nature, it does not convey the information essential to the establishment of spiritually significant interpersonal relationships. Often the quickest way isn't the best way. Although the Holy Ghost can and will assist us in coming to truly understand others, the Lord makes it clear over and over again in the scriptures that faith must be yoked with works. Meaningful relationships are built on a lot of work, which includes a willingness to put our self-interest aside and give of our time and attention in order to truly know another.<br><br>Rachel Cornish, a former BYU nursing student, wrote this regarding her newfound understanding of relationships:<br><br><i>Some experiences in life are priceless because their lessons must be lived to be understood. . . . The time spent in Guatemala and the impact will be forever inscribed upon my changed perspective. Knowing about people cannot compare to knowing the people; nor can viewing photographs of places be compared to being there. The difference is in the depth of understanding.</i><br><br>Sometimes it isn't those we know well, such as parents or Church leaders, but the more humble followers of Christ who teach useternal principles. Two days each week I supervise student nurses during their clinical experiences at the Utah State Hospital. One afternoon I was feeling tired and draggy and went to get a handful of Hot Tamales from a little quarter vending machine. At a nearby pop machine was a patient in his mid-30s who had been at the hospital since developing schizophrenia many years before. I'll call him Joe. Even though we had passed each other many times in the halls and on the grounds, Idid not know Joe well. In a tiny manila envelope he carried a few quarters, part of the meager pay he earned for helping with yard work at the hospital.<br><br>As I approached the vending machine I noticed it was almost empty, but I decided there were enough candies to get a handful. Iplaced my quarter in the slot and turned the crank. Nocandy came out.<br><br>Talking to no one in particular, I said, "Dang, that machine stole my quarter!"<br><br>Joe immediately stepped to the machine, saying, "Here, let me help you," and dropped one of his quarters into the machine.<br><br>Protesting, I put my hand out to keep him from turning the crank and said, "No, don't put your quarter in there. The machine doesn't work, and I don't need candy anyway."<br><br>But Joe was quicker than I was. He turned the crank, and out came the candy. I thanked him and tried to repay him, but he refused the quarter and said, "I could see you were really hungry and hallucinating too."<br><br>Some years ago I attended a conference at which an anthropologist told of his experiences living and doing research among the bush people of Africa. I don't remember his name, but I have often thought of his closing remarks. He explained that when a tribesman has a successful hunt, he brings the kill back to the village, takes what is needed for his family, and leaves the rest to be shared by the other members of the village. The speaker ended his discussion of hunting practices with a remark that was almost an afterthought. He said, "I have noticed that the people who have theleast are the most willing to share." Joe, sharing one of his few quarters with me, reminded me of the anthropologist's remark. I wondered, "Am I more like Joe and the bushmen of Africa, willing to share when I see another's need? Or am I like the rich man who asked Jesus how to inherit eternal life, then went away grieved because he had many possessions and was unwilling to sell what he had, give to the poor, and follow Christ?" (See Mark 10:17–22.)<br><br>Over the years I have been inspired and at times moved to tears as I have read or heard students' accounts of eternal truths they have learned as they have come to know and love some of the more humble people of world. The first two quotes are from students who worked with the indigenous people in hospitals and health clinics in the highlands of Guatemala. Emily Isrealson recounts:<br><br><i>When we finished gathering information for our family assessment, we asked the single mother of this humble family of eight--who lived in a mud-floored, stick home with no electricity or running water--what she would say her family needed most. She replied, "I can't think of anything we need. We are greatly blessed. My oldest daughter has a job that gives us enough money to buy our food and allows me to be at home to care for the younger children and teach them about God. There is nothing that we need." I was dumbfounded. From my perspective she had nothing, and then I realized she was right: she had everything that was important.</i><br><br>Amy Cutler said this after participating in a service project:<br><br><i>I have not served them; they have truly served me. . . . As I watched them accept the items, I quickly realized that the humility I saw in them was more service to me than anything I had just given them. Their sweet mannerisms and gentle humility spoke volumes to me about Christ. . . . Although I felt like I would complete a wondrous service project for these sweet Guatemalan people, they have indeed completed a life-changing experience for me. Without knowing it, they have served me with their smiles and greetings and their touch and their patient humility. . . . I now understand better the importance of the priorities in life: faith, a love of God, a hope in Christ, and a love for families.</i><br><br>Some nursing students helped an Ecuadorean family erect their prefab cane house. Students in Ecuador work with a philanthropic organization named Hogar de Cristo that helps impoverished families secure land and the materials for a home through a financial arrangement similar to a mortgage. Even though the students spend their week working in hospitals located in the city and health clinics scattered throughout the large development where these cane homes will be located, they choose to spend their Saturday helping erect a home rather than going sightseeing. They make that choice in part because so many prior students have considered the experience of building the home their most meaningful Ecuadorean experience. Students say it is most meaningful because they get to know and love the family as they are working alongside them. I believe it also has something to do with sacrifice. Building a house is not part of their course requirements--working in the hospitals and clinics is. Just as our pioneer ancestors grew in their love for one another as they worked together to build homes, temples, and cities, we too are blessed with an increase of love as we work together for a good purpose.<br><br>One of the nursing students who went to Australia for Study Abroad wrote in her final paper about an uncomfortable experience she had that helped her to gain a more Christlike perspective. She prefaced her story by saying she had been distressed by a relative's rather crude and derogatory remark about the work she would be doing for the rest of her life because she had chosen to be a nurse. With her permission and in her own words, Jenn Jackson said:<br><br><i>One of the most beautiful moments I had on this trip was watching Amanda--one of the nurses at Best of Care--talk to, touch, and treat a patient. The patient was one who many of the caregivers refused to take on their caseloads because his house was filthy, he owned seven or eight cats, and he was completely unhygienic. There was a horrible odor exuding from who knows where. Not only that, sometimes he was known as being grouchy and critical. With all that being known to Amanda, she took us to his home and introduced us to him. She treated him with the utmost respect, talked to him about his life and his family, sat on his cat-fur–lined sofa, and touched his hand. She then began teaching us about some of the problems he had, and at one point she took off his socks with her bare hands. His legs were disgusting and lined with dead skin. He had gout in his toes and fungus on his nails. I couldn't believe it when she held his foot and touched him without being repulsed. . . .</i><br><br><i>After telling us some things about his feet and legs, she gently put his dirty sock back on, patted his shoulder, wished him a good day, and took us home. As I thought about that experience, I thought about the Savior and how He touched the lepers on their rotten skin, washed the dirty feet of the twelve apostles, and went places that were not always the nicest places in town. The Savior went to people's homes regardless of how rich or poor they were. He touched them, without gloves, regardless of how disgusting they were. He cleansed them regardless of how dirty they were.</i><br><br><i>Now when I think about the statement made by my relative, I don't get frustrated. It is still a completely simplified statement of what I will be doing with the rest of my life, but I realize now that it may not be all that inaccurate. I will be serving my brothers and sisters, Heavenly Father's children, and will be doing for them what they cannot do for themselves, just like the Savior. If the King of Kings and Lord of Lords can humble Himself enough to touch and cleanse the lowest of the low, then I can do it too. I can be a tool in His hands by touching, cleansing, and healing, and there is no disgrace inbeing a tool in the hand of the greatest Healer ofall.</i><br><br>What is nurtured in us and what do we nurture in others when the foundation of our relationships is the knowledge that we are all Heavenly Father's children and He loves us? I pray that each of us will grow in our understanding of eternal truths through loving and serving one another until our very natures are changed and one day we discover His image reflected in our countenances. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Rae Jeanne Memmott was a BYU associate professor of nursing when this devotional was given on 8 July 2008.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>, and Let Us Walk  in the Light of the Lord” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As I drove in to work today, I was reminded of how fortunate I am to teach geology at BYU, both because of the support that the department receives from the university and because of the geological diversity of the state. Nevertheless, there are certain geological features that cannot be seen in Utah.<br><br>Therefore, every year or so, my colleague Tom Morris and I have taken a group of geology students to the Permian Reef complex near Carlsbad, New Mexico. The return trip takes us around the north end of the Oscura Mountains in southern New Mexico and within a few miles of the Trinity Site, the place where the first atomic bomb was detonated. As I stand by the turnoff to the site and look at the bare limestone hills in the near distance, I recall the eyewitness account of navy captain R. A. Larkin and try to imagine what military and civilian participants and unwitting local civilians must have seen and felt in the predawn hours on July 16, 1945. Captain Larkin recalled watching from 20 miles away:<br><br><i>At the moment of detonation I was seated on the ground facing in the general direction of the test setup, with my eyes fixed on the ground immediately in front. . . .</i><br><br><i>My first impression was of sudden brilliant lighting of the surrounding landscape, accompanied by a momentary flash of heat. I remember a feeling of surprise as the illumination, initially quite brilliant, continued to increase for a brief interval. ... The intensity of illumination was such that there was a momentary sensation of blinding, similar to that following a close flash of lightning on a dark night.</i><br><br><i>Within perhaps two seconds after the initial flash, . . . a ball of light about three or four hundred yards in diameter was clearly evident about a thousand feet above the ground. Beneath this ball there appeared to be a column of red flame about 150 or 200 yards in diameter. Flickering red reflections were distinctly seen on the clouds above the ball of light.</i> ["Navy Captain Larkin's Description of the Trinity Test," 27 July 1945; PDF at http://lanl.gov/history/atomicbomb/trinity.shtml]<br><br>The atomic age began in a blinding flash at Trinity on July 16, 1945. Theories about the nature of matter and energy were verified, and a terrible new weapon had been devised. The world into which I was born 11 years later, overshadowed by the nuclear Cold War, was profoundly different from the world into which my parents and my grandparents had been born. After a few moments of reverie, the students, Tom, and I piled into the vans and returned to Provo to resume the day-to-day routines of our post-Trinity, atomic-age lives.<br><br>Other defining moments in recent history include the bombing of Pearl Harbor, best remembered by my parents' generation; the Kennedy assassination, an unforgettable event for my generation; the events of 9/11 for your generation; and, for Latter-day Saints of all generations, the events that transpired in Palmyra, New York, nearly 200 years ago. It is the changes that stemmed from the events in Palmyra that I wish to address today. For just as surely as the event at Trinity changed the world, the events at Palmyra ushered in a new era of human understanding.<br><br>In the Church we know this post-Palmyra era as the latter days, the final dispensation, or the dispensation of the fulness of times. This is an era of unprecedented light and knowledge concerning God and His creations. In Doctrine and Covenants 121:33, the Lord described the unstoppable latter-day outpouring of knowledge in this manner:<br><br><i>As well might man stretch forth his puny arm to stop the Missouri river in its decreed course, or to turn it up stream, as to hinder the Almighty from pouring down knowledge from heaven upon the heads of the Latter-day Saints.</i><br><br>My goal this morning is to help us better appreciate the blessings of this greater light and knowledge in our lives and to better understand the methods by which it has been, and continues to be, obtained. Specifically, I will discuss the methods and roles of two complementary sources of truth: revealed knowledge--or what Saint Thomas Aquinas called "God's words"--and discovered knowledge--or the truths that can be and have been derived from intensive study of God's works. Indeed, in Doctrine and Covenants 88:118 the Lord exhorts us to learn "by study and also by faith."<br><br>Elder Richard G. Scott discussed these two complementary conduits of light in his October 2007 general conference address, entitled "Truth: The Foundation of Correct Decisions." He explained:<br><br><i>There are two ways to find truth--both useful, provided we follow the laws upon which they are predicated. The first is the scientific method. It can require analysis of data to confirm a theory or, alternatively, establish a valid principle through experimentation. The scientific method is a valuable way of seeking truth. However, it has two limitations. First, we never can be sure we have identified absolute truth, though we often draw nearer and nearer to it. Second, sometimes, no matter how earnestly we apply the method, we can get the wrong answer.</i><br><br>He then advocated a second way of seeking truth:<br><br><i>The best way of finding truth is simply to go to the origin of all truth and ask or respond to inspiration</i> [see Jacob 4:8]. <i>For success, two ingredients are essential: first, unwavering faith in the source of all truth; second, a willingness to keep God's commandments to keep open spiritual communication with Him.</i> [Richard G. Scott, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2007/11/truth-the-foundation-of-correct-decisions?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Truth: The Foundation of Correct Decisions</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2007, 90]<br><br>I will address the topic of revealed knowledge by examining the events that occurred at Palmyra, New York, in the 1820s as well as the topic of discovered knowledge by discussing the events that took place at Downe, England, in the middle of the 1800s. These reflections will be followed by a discussion of our responsibilities as beneficiaries of Latter-day light and knowledge. Finally, I will conclude by briefly considering the relationship of the Atonement to these events.<br><h2><b>Revealed Knowledge</b></h2><br>Let's begin with a discussion of revealed truth and light. Two weeks ago my wife, Kathie, and I were in Palmyra with our two teenage children--Geoff, 18, and Amy, 15--to attend the final dress rehearsal of the Hill Cumorah Pageant and to tour key Church history sites. In the quiet setting of the Sacred Grove, we contemplated the visit of the Father and the Son and tried to imagine this dense copse of trees ablaze with the celestial light that descended upon the young boy prophet. As if that supernal event were not enough to contemplate, we then went a few miles down the Canandaigua Road to the glacial drumlin known as the Hill Cumorah, where the Nephite record had been hidden, and from thence north to Palmyra to the E. B. Grandin Press, where the Book of Mormon was published. In each of these places, as well as at the grounds of the newly constructed Palmyra Temple, we felt a sense of reverence and awe. We also pondered the flood of revelation that followed the Prophet from Palmyra to Harmony, Kirtland, Liberty, and Nauvoo.<br><br>We learn much about the revelatory process from counsel given to Oliver Cowdery in sections 8 and 9 of the Doctrine and Covenants and from Oliver Cowdery's own description of his experiences, found in the footnote to Joseph Smith--History 1:71. The Lord had these words for Oliver Cowdery:<br><br><i>But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 9:8]<br><br><i>Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart.</i><br><br><i>Now, behold, this is the spirit of revelation.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 8:2–3]<br><br>As Elder Scott said, revelation is predicated upon "unwavering faith in the source of all truth [and] a willingness to keep God's commandments."<br><br>In a letter to William W. Phelps, Oliver Cowdery described the privilege of participating in the revelatory process as follows, with specific reference to the visit of John the Baptist:<br><br><i>I shall not attempt to paint to you the feelings of this heart, nor the majestic beauty and glory which surrounded us on this occasion; but you will believe me when I say, that earth, nor men, with the eloquence of time, cannot begin to clothe language in as interesting and sublime a manner as this holy personage. No; nor has this earth power to give the joy, to bestow the peace, or comprehend the wisdom which was contained in each sentence as they were delivered by the power of the Holy Spirit! Man may deceive his fellow-men, deception may follow deception, and the children of the wicked one may have power to seduce the foolish and untaught ...; but one touch with the finger of his love, yes, one ray of glory from the upper world, or one word from the mouth of the Savior, from the bosom of eternity, strikes it all into insignificance, and blots it forever from the mind. The assurance that we were in the presence of an angel, the certainty that we heard the voice of Jesus, and the truth unsullied as it flowed from a pure personage, dictated by the will of God, is to me past description, and I shall ever look upon this expression of the Savior's goodness with wonder and thanksgiving while I am permitted to tarry.</i> [Letter to William W. Phelps, 7 September 1834, in footnote, JS--H 1:71; see also <i>HC</i> 1:43]<br><br>What a great description of the revelatory experience at its most profound!<br><br>Unlike the light from the Promethean fireball unleashed at Trinity that dissipated in a matter of a few minutes, the light from Palmyra continues to increase in intensity and influence across the globe to this day. Let us be among those who walk in that light, who live according to Isaiah's invitation: "Come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord" (Isaiah 2:5; also 2 Nephi 12:5).<br><br>See if some of the revelations that I will now read are familiar to you. As you listen, try to imagine what it would have been like to hear these truths for the first time as they came from the Prophet's lips.<br><br><i>The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit. Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 130:22]<br><br>In these few sentences from the Prophet of the Restoration, confusion surrounding the nature of God was dispelled. Continuing on the theme of knowing God, Joseph Smith taught:<br><br><i>Having a knowledge of God, we begin to know how to approach Him, and how to ask so as to receive an answer.</i><br><br><i>When we understand the character of God, and know how to come to Him, he begins to unfold the heavens to us.</i> [<i>HC</i> 6:308]<br><br>See if this one sounds familiar: "For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39).<br><br>And then there is this scripture from Doctrine and Covenants 84:33–34:<br><br><i>For whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which I have spoken, and the magnifying their calling, are sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies.</i><br><br><i>They become the sons of Moses and of Aaron and the seed of Abraham, and the church and kingdom, and the elect of God.</i><br><br>Let me also read from Doctrine and Covenants 130:18–19:<br><br><i>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i><br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i><br><br>On July 12, 1843, almost 102 years to the day before the Trinity detonation, the revelation relating to the new and everlasting covenant, including the eternity of the marriage covenant, was given to the Saints at Nauvoo. What kinds of tangible blessings stem from this revelation? I can conceive of no greater solace upon the death of a loved one than that provided by a sure testimony of the Resurrection and the eternal nature of the family.<br><br>We are told in the Book of Mormon:<br><br><i>Wherefore, redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah; for he is full of grace and truth.</i><br><br><i>Behold, he offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends of the law, unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit; and unto none else can the ends of the law be answered.</i> [2 Nephi 2:6–7]<br><br>And, finally, we have this statement from modern prophets and apostles:<br><br><i>We, the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, solemnly proclaim that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children.</i> ["<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1995/11/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Family: A Proclamation to the World</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1995, 102]<br><br>What gladder tidings could there be from Cumorah or from our modern prophets than the knowledge that we are offspring of a loving God, whose Only Begotten Son willingly descended below all things so that we might dwell as eternal families in His presence? Thecost of this revealed latter-day knowledge was the blood of Joseph and Hyrum Smith andthe sacrifices of the many Saints who have carried the restored knowledge forward to our generation--those whom we remember and honor on Pioneer Day. We are truly blessed to live in an age of continuing revelation.<br><br>I will attempt to illustrate how revealed knowledge blesses our lives with an account of the events that afflicted George Goates' family in 1918. But first I would like to explain why I have chosen this particular story. When I became a deacon, I had no priesthood role model in my home, as my father was not a member of the Church. The Lord, however, blessed me with great priesthood leaders. When I was 12, my bishop and my stake president were J. Richard Clarke and Vaughn J. Featherstone, respectively. President Featherstone was called into the Presiding Bishopric about the time that I became a teacher. Bishop Clarke was called into the Presiding Bishopric a few years later. An account delivered by Bishop Featherstone in a 1973 conference session left an indelible impression on me. Even today, some 35 years after it was delivered across the pulpit in the old Tabernacle, I remember this talk, partly because I knew and loved the speaker and partly because it provided a crystalline example of how individuals are blessed and inspired by latter-day light.<br><br>Bishop Featherstone quoted his good friend Les Goates as follows:<br><br><i>But "as for me and my house," the welfare program began in the Old Field west of Lehi on the Saratoga Road in the autumn of 1918, that terribly climactic year of World War I during which more than 14 million people died of that awful scourge "the black plague," or Spanish influenza.</i><br><br><i>Winter came early that year and froze much of the sugar beet crop in the ground. My dad and brother Francis were desperately trying to get out of the frosty ground one load of beets each day which they would plow out of the ground, cut off the tops, and toss the beets, one at a time, into the huge red beet wagon and then haul the load off to the sugar factory. It was slow and tedious work due to the frost and the lack of farm help, since my brother Floyd and I were in the army and Francis, or Franz, as everybody called him, was too young for the military service.</i><br><br><i>While they were thusly engaged in harvesting the family's only cash crop and were having their evening meal one day, a phone call came through from our eldest brother, George Albert, superintendent of the State Industrial School in Ogden, bearing the tragic news that Kenneth, nine-year-old son of our brother Charles, the school farm manager, had been stricken with the dread "flu," and after only a few hours of violent sickness, had died on his father's lap; and would dad please come to Ogden and bring the boy home and lay him away in the family plot in the Lehi Cemetery.</i><br><br><i>My father cranked up his old flap-curtained Chevrolet and headed for Five Points in Ogden to bring his little grandson home for burial. When he arrived at the home he found "Charl" sprawled across the cold form of his dear one, the ugly brown discharge of the black plague oozing from his ears and nose and virtually burning up with fever.</i><br><br><i>"Take my boy home," muttered the stricken young father, "and lay him away in the family lot and come back for me tomorrow."</i><br><br><i>Father brought Kenneth home, made a coffin in his carpenter shop, and mother and our sisters, Jennie, Emma, and Hazel, placed a cushion and a lining in it, and then dad went with Franz and two kind neighbors to dig the grave. So many were dying the families had to do the grave digging. A brief graveside service was all that was permitted.</i><br><br><i>The folks had scarcely returned from the cemetery when the telephone rang again and George Albert (Bert) was on the line with another terrifying message: Charl had died and two of his beautiful little girls--Vesta, 7, and Elaine, 5--were critically ill, and two babies--Raeldon, 4, and Pauline, 3--had been stricken.</i><br><br><i>Our good cousins, the Larkin undertaking people, were able to get a casket for Charl and they sent him home in a railroad baggage car. Father and young Franz brought the body from the railroad station and placed it on the front porch of our old country home for an impromptu neighborhood viewing but folks were afraid to come near the body of a black plague victim. Father and Francis meanwhile had gone with neighbors to get the grave ready and arrange a short service in which the great, noble spirit of Charles Hyrum Goates was commended into the keeping of his Maker.</i><br><br><i>Next day my sturdy, unconquerable old dad was called on still another of his grim missions--this time to bring home Vesta, the smiling one with the raven hair and big blue eyes.</i><br><br><i>When he arrived at the home he found Juliett, the grief-crazed mother, kneeling at the crib of darling little Elaine, the blue-eyed baby angel with the golden curls. Juliett was sobbing wearily and praying: "Oh, Father in heaven, not this one, please! Let me keep my baby! Do not take any more of my darlings from me!"</i><br><br><i>Before father arrived home with Vesta the dread word had come again. Elaine had gone to join her daddy, brother Kenneth, and sister Vesta. And so it was that father made another heartbreaking journey to bring home and lay away a fourth member of his family, all within the week.</i><br><br><i>The telephone did not ring the evening of the day they laid away Elaine nor were there any more sad tidings of death the next morning. It was assumed that George A. and his courageous companion Della, although afflicted, had been able to save the little ones Raeldon and Pauline. . . .</i><br><br><i>After breakfast dad said to Franz, "Well, son, we had better get down to the field and see if we can get another load of beets out of the ground before they get frozen in any tighter. Hitch up and let's be on our way."</i><br><br><i>Francis drove the four-horse outfit down the driveway and dad climbed aboard. As they drove along the Saratoga Road, they passed wagon after wagon-load of beets being hauled to the factory and driven by neighborhood farmers. As they passed by, each driver would wave a greeting: "Hi ya, Uncle George," "Sure sorry, George," "Tough break, George," "You've got a lot of friends, George."</i><br><br><i>On the last wagon was the town comedian, freckled-faced Jasper Rolfe. He waved a cheery greeting and called out: "That's all of 'em, Uncle George."</i><br><br><i>My dad turned to Francis and said: "I wish it was all of ours."</i><br><br><i>When they arrived at the farm gate, Francis jumped down off the big red beet wagon and opened the gate as we drove onto the field. He pulled up, stopped the team, paused a moment and scanned the field, from left to right and back and forth--and lo and behold, there wasn't a sugar beet on the whole field. Then it dawned upon him what Jasper Rolfe meant when he called out: "That's all of 'em, Uncle George!"</i><br><br><i>Then dad got down off the wagon, picked up a handful of the rich, brown soil he loved so much, and then in his thumbless left hand a beet top, and he looked for a moment at these symbols of his labor, as if he couldn't believe his eyes.</i><br><br><i>Then father sat down on a pile of beet tops--this man who brought four of his loved ones home for burial in the course of only six days; made caskets, dug graves, and even helped with the burial clothing--this amazing man who never faltered, nor flinched, nor wavered throughout this agonizing ordeal--sat down on a pile of beet tops and sobbed like a little child.</i><br><br><i>Then he arose, wiped his eyes with his big, red bandanna handkerchief, looked up at the sky, and said: "Thanks, Father, for the elders of our ward."</i> [Les Goates, quoted in Vaughn J. Featherstone, <i>CR,</i> April 1973, 46–48]<br><br>How real and sustaining was the knowledge of the reality of a loving Heavenly Father at that time in the life of George Goates? How much more difficult would it have been to go through that awful ordeal without the knowledge of the Atonement and the eternal nature of the family? How real and sustaining was the service rendered by the elders of that Lehi ward? How does the sure knowledge of the plan of happiness sustain us and motivate us to service?<br><h2><b>Discovered Knowledge</b></h2><br>Now we will turn our focus to the method of obtaining discovered light and knowledge, or what we also call the scientific method. Although we are offspring of a Divine Father, we are inhabitants of a mortal realm and subject to natural law and process during our mortal probation. Because of this, discovered knowledge is also critical to our happiness, quality of life, and survival. To predict and control our environment, we must understand the pattern, scale, and frequency of processes that operate on earth and in the cosmos.<br><br>To exemplify the process of discovering light and knowledge, let's now travel to the sleepy town of Downe, England, located on the chalk plains of Kent, a half-day's carriage ride from London. In 2005, Kathie and I made a pilgrimage to Down House, the family home of the Darwins. Charles and his wife, Emma, and their two young children moved to Downe in 1842 to escape the filth and pestilence of Victorian London. Eight additional children were born to Charles and Emma at Downe in the next several years, and, true to tragic 19th-century form, they lost three of their children to illnesses in infancy and adolescence: Annie at age 10, Mary Eleanor at three weeks, and baby Charles at age three. Like the Goates family, the Darwins were well-acquainted withthe loss of precious little ones.<br><br>For 40 years Down House was the home, refuge, and anchor of the Darwin family until Charles' own death in 1882. Emma and Charles were faithful companions and loving parents. After Charles' burial in Westminster Abbey, Emma was strengthened in her widowhood by the belief that she and her beloved Charles would be together in the world to come, even though Charles was an avowed agnostic.<br><br>As we toured the house, explored the grounds, and strode the "sand walk"--the famous walking path that defines the northern perimeter of the Darwin estate--Kathie and I felt a reverence for the love, devotion, hopes, and sorrows of the family that once called Down House home.<br><br>We also felt a reverence for the important discoveries made there. At Down House, Darwin continued the study of the patterns of natural history that he had begun as an amateur naturalist aboard the HMS <i>Beagle.</i> Bypatient experimentation over a period of 17 years--which included pigeon breeding, the study of vestigial and homologous organs, plant breeding, a detailed study of barnacles and their reproductive strategies, and correspondence with thousands of individuals--Darwin discovered the process responsible for the diversity and distribution of modern and extinct plants and animals. The light discovered by Darwin at Downe in the mid-1800s continues to illuminate all of modern biology and has led to advances in epidemiology, agriculture, plant breeding, animal husbandry, the correct usage of antibiotics, and conservation biology.<br><br>Millions of lives have been lengthened, improved, and saved over the past 150 years through application of the principles that Darwin discovered and published. For example, the influenza A virus, which includes the Spanish influenza that killed four members of the Goates family in Utah and 40 million worldwide in 1918 and 1919, is now largely prevented from spreading by vaccines. Because the virus that causes the illness mutates continually, the vaccines' virus compositions must be adjusted annually to include the most recent circulating influenza A and B viruses, according to principles of natural selection that Darwin had elucidated. As an aside, February 12 of next year will mark the 200th anniversary of Darwin's birth and the 150th anniversary of the publication of his book <i>On the Origin of Species.</i> I think that we can expect to see much in the popular press and in scientific literature celebrating this twin anniversary.<br><br>By the end of our stay at Down House, Kathie and I both felt that Darwin, like Galileo, Newton, Einstein, and others, had lifted the curtain on creation and permitted us a glimpse of God moving in His majesty. Elder Richard G. Scott said this regarding the process of discovery:<br><br><i>Try as I might, I am not able, even in the smallest degree, to comprehend the extent, depth, and stunning grandeur of what our holy Heavenly Father, Elohim, has permitted to be revealed by the scientific method. . . .</i><br><br><i>With the enormity of what we can in just the smallest way begin to understand and certainly in no way fully comprehend, how grateful we must be that this God of unfathomable capacities is our Father. He is a loving, understanding, compassionate, patient Father. He created us as His children. He treats us as a beloved son or daughter. He makes us feel loved, appreciated, valuable, and dear to Him.</i> [Scott, "Truth: The Foundation," 90, 92]<br><br>The revelations of Palmyra and discoveries at Down House exemplify the two main methods of obtaining latter-day light and knowledge. Through these complementary and ongoing processes--revelation and discovery, both of which require concentration and dedication--we have come to understand the love, methods, and majesty of God and His infinite creations in ways that were unknown to all previous generations. Latter-day discovery tells us that we live on an ancient planet that revolves around a rather average star located about two-thirds of the way out on one arm of a spiral galaxy, which is just one of billions populating a universe so large that it is essentially impossible for us to conceptualize it with our finite minds. Latter-day revelation tells us that the earth was created to accomplish the work and glory of God, namely, to give us a place to obtain bodies and work out our personal salvation.<br><h2><b>Our Personal Responsibility</b></h2><br>So what are we to do with the increased knowledge and light that comes from revelation and discovery? Several answers come to mind, but let me give at least a partial answer by quoting from the BYU mission statement:<br><br><i>All instruction, programs, and services at BYU ... should make their own contribution toward the balanced development of the total person. Such a broadly prepared individual will not only be capable of meeting personal challenge and change but will also bring strength to others in the tasks of home and family life, social relationships, civic duty, and service to mankind. . . .</i><br><br><i>Because the gospel encourages the pursuit of all truth, students at BYU should receive a broad university education. The arts, letters, and sciences provide the core of such an education, which will help students think clearly, communicate effectively, understand important ideas in their own cultural tradition as well as that of others, and establish clear standards of intellectual integrity.</i> [<i>The Mission of Brigham Young University</i> and <i>The Aims of a BYU Education</i> (Provo: BYU, 1996), 1]<br><br>This suggests that we should seek truth through discovery and revelation continually with the intent of using this greater light and knowledge to build the kingdom of God, to save our families, and to be of service to mankind. Each of you will do this in your own way, in concert with your individual gifts, talents, and interests. I pray that each of you will find great fulfillment in applying this restored light in meeting personal challenges, strengthening your families, and serving mankind.<br><br>Insights about the relationship between the secular and sacred as it pertains to our personal responsibilities may be gained from President Spencer W. Kimball's devotional address delivered in 1975. On that occasion he said:<br><br><i>You will . . . do some special things here </i>[at BYU] <i>that are left undone by other institutions.</i><br><br><i>First among these unique features is the fact thateducation on this campus deliberately and persistently concerns itself with "education for eternity," not just for time. The faculty has a double heritage that they must pass along: the secular knowledge that history has washed to the feet of mankind along with the new knowledge brought by scholarly research, and also the vital and revealed truths that have been sent to us from heaven. . . .</i><br><br><i>Your double heritage and dual concerns with the secular and the spiritual require you to be "bilingual." As scholars you must speak with authority and excellence to your professional colleagues in the language of scholarship, and you must also be literate in the language of spiritual things. We must be more bilingual, in that sense, to fulfill our promise in the second century of BYU.</i> [Spencer W. Kimball, "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/spencer-w-kimball_second-century-brigham-young-university/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Second Century of Brigham Young University</a>," BYU devotional address, 10October 1975]<br><h2><b>The Role of the Atonement</b></h2><br>Thus far, we have discussed the importance of events that transpired at the Trinity Site in New Mexico; at Palmyra, New York; and at Downe, England. Let's take one additional journey together: this time to Galilee, Gethsemane, and Golgotha, for without the Savior's infinite and eternal Atonement, none of the other events that we have discussed would ultimately matter. Consider the words tothis well-known sacrament hymn:<br><br><i>There is a green hill far away,</i><br><br><i>Without a city wall,</i><br><br><i>Where the dear Lord was crucified,</i><br><br><i>Who died to save us all.</i><br><br><i>We may not know, we cannot tell,</i><br><br><i>What pains he had to bear,</i><br><br><i>But we believe it was for us</i><br><br><i>He hung and suffered there.</i><br><br><i>. . . </i><br><br><i>Oh, dearly, dearly has he loved!</i><br><br><i>And we must love him too,</i><br><br><i>And trust in his redeeming blood,</i><br><br><i>And try his works to do.</i><br><br>["There Is a Green Hill Far Away," <i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 194]<br><br>The dispensation of the fulness of times began in the spring of 1820 with the appearance of the Father and the Son to Joseph Smith. Since then the post-Palmyra era has been characterized by ongoing revelation and discovery that continues to enrich our lives in tangible and profound ways. That we might impart the light that we have received from both revelation and discovery to the inhabitants of an ever-darkening world by laboring in temples of faith, halls of learning, and fields of service until the Savior returns in perfect light is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Scott M. Ritter was chair of the Department of Geological Sciences when this devotional address was given at BYU on 22 July 2008.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>s of the Heart - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It's a privilege to be with you and among you and feel of your spirits. I pray, as my son did in the opening prayer, that the Spirit will attend us and that we can learn from each other in this conversation we will have today about the Spirit.<br><br>My wife and I have been blessed with eight grandchildren; two of them, Ashley and Brooke, are twins. Two months ago they gave the scripture and prayer in their Primary closing exercises. My son Josh helped Ashley give the scripture.<br><br>During the closing song he whispered to Brooke, "Can you do the prayer by yourself?"<br><br>"No," she said. "I need help."<br><br>"Okay. You do what you can, and I'll help you if you get stuck."<br><br>"Okay," said Brookie.<br><br>The twinners are both capable of fine, fine prayers. In fact, some of their blessings on the food are so long that the food is cold before we get to it. They bless everything.<br><br>In the Primary closing exercises, the song ended, and up went Brooke to the podium. She climbed the three-step stool and pulled the microphone down to her mouth level. She folded her arms, bowed her head, and waited.<br><br>Josh whispered into her ear, "Okay, do what you can."<br><br>Into the microphone she said, "Okay, do what you can." And again she waited, eyes tightly closed.<br><br>Josh whispered into her ear, "No, <i>you</i> do what you can."<br><br>And, sure enough, Brooke said into the microphone, "No, <i>you</i> do what you can."<br><br>Josh looked up, and all the adults in the audience were rocking back and forth in their chairs laughing. Finally he whispered, "Heavenly Father . . ."<br><br>And Brooke said into the microphone, "Heavenly Father, thank you for this day . . . ," and the prayer was on its way.<br><br>This story invites me and the rest of us to think about how, in our prayers, sometimes we say to Heavenly Father, "Okay, do what You can"--in essence asking Him to resolve our challenges. In the silence that follows, perhaps we hear the response of a loving Father speaking to His child: "No, <i>you</i> do what you can, and I'll help you if you get stuck."<br><br>My dear sisters and brothers, today I will share stories that come from my years of service in the Hill Cumorah Pageant. I would like to tell stories that I hope invite us to ponder together and explore in our minds and hearts ways we can discern promptings from Heavenly Father.<br><br>I love the cradle of the Restoration. I have repeatedly worked and walked on the sacred ground of the places that played key roles in bringing the gospel back to this earth. Because of the fruits of those experiences, the gospel of Christ is inextricably woven into the fibers of my soul. I am grateful to have been prompted by the Spirit to speak further of these places today.<br><br>My prayer is that we will seek to know the truths of the restored gospel by finding our own sacred places and listening to the Holy Spirit speak evidences to our hearts. Paul tells us "the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God."<sup>1</sup><br><h2><b>The Seating Area</b></h2><br>In our last April conference, Elder Carlos H. Amado spoke of service. He said:<br><br><i>Those who serve with devotion, even when things don't turn out the way they would like, are not easily discouraged, fatigued, or frustrated because the promise of peace of mind and the companionship of the Holy Spirit will never abandon them.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>There is something in service and sacrifice, especially in the face of adversity, that prepares the heart for hearing the Holy Spirit.<br><br>Seven years ago I was standing at the crest of the Hill Cumorah. It was before the sets were up and before the cast arrived, and I was visiting with a group of tourists. One of them asked where the audience would sit. I pointed to the empty field at the foot of the hill where, in two weeks, 8,000 chairs would be arranged. Looking closely, I noticed something I had not seen before: there was a pattern on the field showing where the seats go--the aisles in between subtly imprinted in the grass. Later Italked to Brother Paine, who, year after year, was in charge of marking out the location of the chairs and supervising their setup. I asked if he had noticed that the grass in the aisles was darker and hardier than the grass where the seats were located. He told me the grass in the aisles was so distinct he could almost mark the field for the chairs without measuring.<br><br>On the day it is marked and the cast members set up the 8,000 chairs, the field is lush and green. During the run of the pageant, thousands and thousands of feet tramp down those aisles. Eleven days later, when those same chairs are placed back into their storage trailers, the field is a modified checkerboard of long green grass where the chairs have been sitting and 10-foot-wide strips of either matted, brown, seemingly dead grass in dry years or muddy bogs in wet years. It grows back stronger every year.<br><br>I believe service and sacrifice, especially when performed in the arms of adversity, strengthen our souls and soften our hearts. Mighty struggle prepares us to hear and follow promptings and enlarges our capacity to follow Christ. We experience peace of mind and the assurance that the Holy Spirit will be our constant companion.<br><br>There is a lovely little poem by Emily Dickinson that captures this principle:<br><br><i>I fit for them--</i><br><br><i>I seek the Dark</i><br><br><i>Till I am thorough fit.</i><br><br><i>The labor is a sober one</i><br><br><i>With this sufficient sweet</i><br><br><i>That abstinence of mine produce</i><br><br><i>A purer food for them, if I succeed,</i><br><br><i>If not I had</i><br><br><i>The transport of the Aim--</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>What does it mean to "fit" for another? Who is "them"? What is "the Dark"? What is this person abstaining from? What is the "purer food"? And what is the nature of this person's "transport"?<br><br>The Savior said, "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit."<sup>4</sup><br><br>Somewhere in the depths of service, sacrifice, and adversity we come to know the transformative powers of the Spirit, and we arechanged. We come to embrace more fully the Atonement and the Lord's love for us.<br><h2><b>The Sacred Grove</b></h2><br>The Savior told His disciples, "The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, . . . shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you."<sup>5</sup><br><br>Each year that I worked on the pageant, Itook along one of our children so they could personally experience the place where it all began. We went to the Sacred Grove whenever we had a chance, especially if we found times when we could be pretty much alone there. It is a truly sacred place where the Spirit witnesses and testimonies are strengthened.<br><br>In July 1984 my son Josh and I spent an hour in the grove. It was less than three weeks before his eighth birthday. We walked and talked in the shadows of the trees. We caught a frog, watched birds wing from leaf to limb, and listened to the warmth well up inside our hearts.<br><br>It was there amongst those trees that the conversation that shaped eternity took place. Embedded in the patterns of their rings and in the seasonal rebirth of their leaves is a testimony. Those trees witnessed a 14-year-old boy struggle against the dark powers of Lucifer. They felt the warm illumination of the Holy Spirit penetrate the darkness. They heard the loving tones of Elohim testify of His Only Begotten Son. They listened as our Savior taught Joseph the tenets of eternal truth. Simple sentences, words spoken to the heart, and the expression of charity and grace opened the floodgates of a new dispensation of light and knowledge.<br><br>Our spirits were with Heavenly Father and Jehovah when this world was created. We saw our Savior's face and heard His voice. We felt His love. We knew then of our Father's plan for the Atonement, and we knew that the Restoration would take place in these latter days. We can know now the truthfulness of these promises as we prepare our hearts to hear the Holy Spirit whisper these things to our remembrance.<br><h2><b>The Joseph Smith Home</b></h2><br>In his most recent conference address, ElderL. Tom Perry talked a little bit about faith. He said:<br><br><i>Faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement turns us to Him. The world teaches that seeing is believing, but our faith in our Lord leads us to believe so we can see Him and the Father's plan for us.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>These polarities fascinate me. At certain times, seeing is believing; at other times and places, believing is seeing.<br><br>For more than 25 years I thought the Joseph Smith home I visited looked as it did when Alvin built it. It had a white clapboard exterior with a house-wide porch on the west, stairs to the second level up the center of the home, and four bedrooms upstairs--one of which had been the room Joseph and Emma shared during the time the Prophet received the plates. Seeing was believing: I remember standing on the landing of the second floor looking out of those windows, seeing the grove, and imagining to myself that the boy Joseph stood in that very spot, looking out of those very windows at the grove, remembering what had happened there.<br><br>Well, extensive research coupled with guidance from the Holy Spirit resulted in a surprising restoration of the house. The porch, the west-facing windows on the second level, and the four upstairs bedrooms are all gone. Now the stairs to the second level are located in the southeast corner of the house. A fireplace complex occupies the center of the home, with hearths in each of the three rooms that surround it. Upstairs there are no bedrooms, just one large room with the fireplace bricks rising through the center. In Joseph's day, it had been divided into sleeping quarters by blankets.<br><br>I am amazed. Things are not necessarily what they seem to be. When it comes to eternal truths, we must rely more upon the witness of the Holy Spirit than upon the evidence of eyes and ears and mind. Believing is seeing.<br><h2><b>Fireflies: From the Temple to the Grove andBack Again</b></h2><br>In April general conference of 2007, Elder Glenn L. Pace gave a talk entitled "Do You Know?" In it he told of when, as a missionary, he taught<br><br><i>an extremely intelligent woman who had a hard time accepting anything until she had nailed down every intellectual loose end. However, at long last we heard her say, "I cannot deny this feeling any longer."</i><br><br><i>She joined the Church . . . , but she gradually</i> [fellaway].<br><br>Fifteen years later, she visited Elder Pace and his family in Salt Lake City. They took her to Temple Square. Elder Pace reported:<br><br><i>As we started up the circular ramp leading to the statue of the Savior, she paused and tearfully said, "Here comes that feeling again. My heart still yearns for what my mind won't accept!"</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>This is a dear story. It reminds me of another sacred place in the land of the Restoration. The Palmyra Temple opened in the year 2000. After the close of the pageant that year, after the cast and crew had gone, and on the day before my return home, I went to the temple. When the session was over, I looked out the west foyer windows, through which the tops of the trees of the Sacred Grove are visible. From one of the most significant manifestations of the restored gospel, the temple, I could see in the setting sun the place where it all began: the Sacred Grove.<br><br>There is a connection between these sacred places: one is the place where Elohim and Jehovah opened the gates to the fulness of times; the other, the fulfillment of the promise, is the place where Jehovah and Elohim visit today. It is Their home: "Holiness to the Lord. The House of the Lord."<br><br>I had been told there were fireflies in the grove at night--though because my previous visits had always been during the day, I had never seen them. On that particular night, over the next 45 minutes fireflies began to flicker. Thousands of them emerged from the undergrowth. For me, it was a mystery. I was astonished. Where did such a population live? The darker the night became, the more fireflies emerged, flickering amongst the dark maples and birches. Silently they told of another world within the one I perceived. I wondered, "What else exists in this universe of ours without my knowledge?" I yearn to know those truths. An eternity exists with a just Father, a compassionate Savior, and a Holy Spirit. Yet I cannot see Them with my eyes!<br><br>The flickering fireflies were beautiful--more often dark than they were light. Their momentary brightness enthralled me. Collectively they were a pulsing, living community throbbing in the spaces between the benevolent trees, dark beyond my capacity to see, silent beyond my ability to hear, and alive in a place whose sacredness is beyond my ability to fully understand.<br><br>Nothing much more happened to the fireflies that night. They didn't stop flickering; they didn't fly away. They continued to create momentary intensities without illuminating anything other than themselves and the awareness of silent tree trunks reaching skyward in the dark. But something more happened to my heart. I knew again there were many more truths I did not comprehend that would require greater faith than I was currently exercising to recognize.<br><br>I left the grove on a trail I hadn't seen before. The path wound around in the direction of the newly built Smith cabin through the trees. Isuspected this trail might be closer to the one Joseph walked in 1820. I paused by the cabin, pondering the visit of Moroni to Joseph. While the household slept, Moroni taught Joseph through the long night of September 21, 1823. Three times he visited, repeating the same message. And no one awoke. The only way anyone but Joseph could know it happened was if they believed.<br><br>Walking back to the temple, I came full circle from 1820 to the year 2000. Today, 188 years later, a beacon radiates the night sky: a light on a hill, seen by thousands, yet comprehended by relatively few.<br><br>I returned to Cumorah's hill, climbed up its face, and stood on the crest. Somewhere near, Moroni had appeared to Joseph, teaching him the doctrines and the gospel and about a civilization long lost to the modern world. From a picture of the hill taken around the end of the 19th century, we can tell that it was basically bare. Accounts suggest that during the years Moroni visited Joseph Smith, there were few trees on the hill. Yet no one saw the visits: a restoration on Cumorah's hill, radiating truth through a young man who could see it, revealing a world of faith and light that shines amongst the dark shadows of doubt anddisbelief.<br><h2><b>Questions</b></h2><br>Now let's explore three questions. First: What does the voice of the Holy Spirit sound like? In Doctrine and Covenants 8:2 the Lord explained, "I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart." At times for me His voice is a warmth that wells up inside. I feel it. At other times it is a clear impression, a vital déj vu, an "aha," or an "of course." Sometimes it is a realization in my mind that I have heard a whisper. What does His voice sound like to you?<br><br>Second question: What can we do to prepare ourselves to hear the Holy Spirit? Several weeks ago, as I was cutting the lawn, our lawn mower stopped working. I took the spark plug out and saw that it was covered with carbon. I cleaned it and put it back in. The mower started right up, and I was feeling that I should have been a small-engine repairman! However, a minute later it coughed to a standstill. Carbon had coated the plug again. So I called some real repair places and found that they each had a three-week backlog.<br><br>A few days later I decided to try fixing it again myself. I remembered from my youth that engines need a proper balance between air and gasoline in order to run. I also remembered that there is a valve somewhere that adjusts this mixture. I decided to look for it.<br><br>The first thing I did was remove the air filter. It was so dirty that no air could get through. After replacing it and cleaning the plug again, the mower worked. My potential career as a repairman was back on track.<br><br>Keeping our "filters" clean is one thing we can do to prepare ourselves to hear the Holy Spirit. Our relationship with the Spirit depends a lot upon what enters into our hearts: what we listen to, think about, read, watch, and do with our time and energy. What we choose to allow to enter into our minds and hearts will influence the way we hear, feel, and understand the promptings of the Spirit.<br><br>Another way to prepare to hear His voice is to balance the mixture between the "air" and the "source." I am quite certain that the voice of the Spirit cannot be discerned through a cacophony of sensory stimulations. We may be really good at multitasking, layering our senses with listening to iPods, watching DVDs, using instant messaging, surfing the Net, and playing virtual games--all while doing our homework. But if we want to hear the promptings of the Holy Spirit, we must dedicate space and time and solitude to that relationship.<br><br>Third question: How can we distinguish between the voice of the Holy Spirit and the voice of the adversary? I have felt and followed the prompting and enticing of both voices. Ibelieve it is possible to distinguish between them by the differences in their characteristics and the differences in their works.<br><br>The Holy Spirit is warm, gentle, quiet, and penetrating. Helaman records how Nephi and Lehi were freed from prison by an earthquake and a fire, after which<br><br><i>they heard this voice, and beheld that it was not a voice of thunder, neither was it a voice of a great tumultuous noise, but behold, it was a still voice of perfect mildness, as if it had been a whisper, and it did pierce even to the very soul.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>The Holy Spirit invites, entices, and persuades us to do good works. In Doctrine and Covenants 11:12, the Lord encourages us to "put [our] trust in that Spirit which leadeth to do good--yea, to do justly, to walk humbly, tojudge righteously."<br><br>Conversely, following the promptings of the adversary results in a cold loneliness. His enticing leads to the depths of despair rather than to the depths of faith. His encouragement leads to pride and self-absorption rather than to service and self-worth. He advocates arrogance rather than meekness. He persuades us to indulge in appetites that result in addictions. The Holy Spirit invites the development of virtues such as endurance, faith, kindness, long-suffering, and patience--all behaviors that preserve agency. While the Holy Ghost testifies of Heavenly Father, Christ, the Holy Spirit, and the Atonement, the adversary denies them all and seeks the glory for himself.<br><br>The adversary wants us to have every worldly thing, that he may own us. The Holy Spirit wants us to lose our lives in service that we may gain all our Father has, that we may befree.<br><br>Elder Scott explained:<br><br><i>When we seek inspiration . . . , the Lord gives gentle promptings. These require us to think, to exercise faith, to work, to struggle at times, and toact.</i><sup>9</sup><br><h2><b>My Testimony: Back to Our Sacred Groves</b></h2><br>Let's come full circle another way. In a book called <i>Here We Stand,</i> Joseph Fielding McConkie wrote:<br><br><i>Everyone is required to do what Joseph Smith did, and that is to receive the personal revelation that the wisdom that brings salvation comes only by the Spirit of revelation, and then each must find his own equivalent of the Sacred Grove and obtain his own answer.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>Through the warmth of the Holy Spirit speaking to my heart, and out of the hallowed ground of sacred places, I bear this testimony:<br><br>1. I testify that Joseph Smith experienced the presence of Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost in the Sacred Grove. He saw Elohim and Jehovah. He heard Their teachings.<br><br>2. I testify that Jesus Christ is our Redeemer. He atoned for our sins, weaknesses, shortcomings, heartaches, and sorrows. He sacrificed His life that we might repent and live again. Because of His Atonement, all broken souls can be healed and all splintered relationships can be repaired if we will but open our hearts, not judge, and exercise faith.<br><br>3. I testify that the Book of Mormon contains the fulness of the everlasting gospel. It stands as another witness for Christ in the world today.<br><br>4. I testify that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God. Through him the gospel and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints were restored to the earth in these latter days. President Monson is a living prophet and the president of the Church today.<br><br>We do not have to physically be in the Sacred Grove to receive guidance and instruction from our Heavenly Father. Nevertheless, we must learn the language of the Spirit for ourselves and find our own sacred places in which we personally come to know the things of God by the Spirit of God. As we daily kneel in prayer, speak to a loving Father, and listen to His answers, we come to recognize the sound of His voice and feel His love for us. Fasting tunes our hearts to the language of the Spirit and opens doors to deeper conversations with our Father. The Primary song says:<br><br><i>I love to see the temple.</i><br><br><i>I'm going there someday</i><br><br><i>To feel the Holy Spirit,</i><br><br><i>To listen and to pray.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>The temple is a place where the language of the heart is spoken freely, where "the substance of things hoped for [and] the evidence of things not seen"<sup>12</sup> are manifest to the heart and soul, and where our minds are quickened. As we become fluent in that language, we will receive further knowledge of the truthfulness of the work of God. We will come to know who we are and why we are here. We will receive evidence that God knows us and cares about us, that we are His children, and that the Holy Spirit can be our guide and companion throughout life.<br><br>I pray we will seek our own sacred places where we can come to know the truths of the restored gospel by listening to the Holy Spirit speak evidences to our yearning hearts. I also pray that as we leave this devotional today, the words of a loving father to his precious child will echo in our hearts: "You do what you can, and I'll help you if you get stuck." In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Rodger Sorensen was chair of the Department of Theatre and Media Arts when this devotional address was given at BYU on 29 July 2008.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. 1 Corinthians 2:11.<br><br>2.

<h1>ne Nature and Life Decisions - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I appreciate the opportunity to share this devotional hour with you and pray that what I have to say might be uplifting and meaningful in your lives. Leading into my topic on our divine nature and life decisions, Iwould like to briefly reminisce about a couple of my experiences as a BYU student. These might be applicable to some of you in the decisions that you are making.<br><br>It was 30 years ago this summer that my wife, Kerstine, and I first met at a family home evening group activity at the Smith Fieldhouse. As the weeks passed, Kerstine would mysteriously show up at my table at the Deseret Towers cafeteria whenever I was eating lunch, which was often at a different time each day. Iquite liked that, but I wasn't really interested in pursuing anything serious until my elders quorum president pulled me aside one day. After listing off some of Kerstine's great qualities, he asked me to help him find a way to enjoy having lunch with her on a regular basis like I was doing. Suddenly I got very interested, and the rest is history.<br><br>Both of us well remember our first few months of marriage--we lived in a studio apartment south of campus that was tucked under Mexican and Italian restaurants and a bakery. We have many interesting memories of the place, including the black, oozy slime that crept out of the shower drain each morning. Our oldest son, David, was conceived shortly after we were married. Morning sickness mixed with the smells wafting down from the eateries above made for particularly poignant memories. Much like now, it was a time of economic uncertainty. We started our lives together in the midst of long gas lines due to oil shortages, two back-to-back recessions, double-digit inflation, and double-digit interest rates. But we moved forward with our family in faith that all would work out.<br><br>At the time, I was teaching Japanese to missionaries at the MTC. Our rent was $110 per month, including utilities. I was making about $250 per month. So we were set--both of us attended BYU until complications with pregnancy and a premature baby postponed Kerstine's schooling until many years later.<br><br>Like many of you now, I was seeking inspiration and struggling to decide what to major in and what career path I should pursue. It wasn't until I started taking child development and psychology classes from wonderful BYU faculty mentors that I discovered my academic passion, which led me to a research and university teaching career.<br><br>After nine years of postmarriage "camping out"--as some relatives used to call it--we left graduate school behind. It has been a fascinating journey over the past couple of decades as I've witnessed and been a part of the scientific enterprise in my discipline. New discoveries that have helped explain how the complex interplay between nature and nurture works to facilitate child and adolescent development for good and for ill have captivated my attention. Yet it is humbling to realize that studies in my discipline only capture a mortal millisecond of eternity in the lives of our Heavenly Father's children. Without an understanding of our spiritual personalities, which existed prior to mortal birth and eternal progression beyond mortality, secular knowledge about human development will always belimited.<br><br>Today I would like to focus on our spiritual personalities as essential parts of our eternal identities. Our divine nature stems from our premortal existence. Understanding who we are from an eternal perspective can help guide us in the decisions that we make every day. Let us first consider what has been revealed about our pre-earth life and our spiritual personalities.<br><h2><b>The Premortal Existence and Our Spiritual Personalities</b></h2><br>Every prophet since Joseph Smith has reiterated the reality of our premortal existence and the eternal identity of our spirits. This is illustrated in a statement by the First Presidency in1912:<br><br><i>All people who come to this earth and are born in mortality, had a pre-existent, spiritual personality, as the sons and daughters of the Eternal Father.</i> [Statement of the First Presidency, 31 January 1912, in "Editor's Table," <i>Improvement Era,</i> March 1912, 417; also "Pre-Existent States," 31 January 1912, in James R. Clark, comp., <i>Messages of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</i> (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1965–75), 4:264; see also Jeremiah 1:5]<br><br>This doctrine was highlighted more recently in "<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1995/11/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Family: A Proclamation to the World</a>":<br><br><i>All human beings--male and female--are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny. Gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose.</i> [<i>Ensign,</i> November 1995, 102]<br><br>Numerous biblical passages afford glimpses of our spiritual origins and eternal potential. For example, the Apostle Paul reminded us that "we are the offspring of God" (Acts 17:29; see also Romans 8:16) and that God is "the Father of spirits" (Hebrews 12:9; see also Ephesians 4:6).<br><br>Some years ago a colleague of mine, who was a devout member of another Christian denomination, was curious about our beliefs. As I answered questions that touched on the plan of salvation, we read together about the Apostle Paul, who stated on Mars Hill in Athens that "we are the offspring of God." After a moment of reflection, he asked, "Do you realize the implications of these passages?"<br><br>I thought I did, but I soon realized he had picked up on something quite profound.<br><br>He said, "It looks like the Apostle Paul is addressing nonmembers of the Church here and referring to them as the literal offspring of God. I have always thought of 'children of God' as only referring to those who accept Jesus Christ as their personal Savior, but this makes me wonder if there isn't more to this."<br><br>Although he declined my invitation to meet with the full-time missionaries, he did do considerable research on his own and concluded that the doctrine of the premortal existence had once been part of his religious tradition and that of many others. This actually made him more committed to his own faith. I learned from him, and later confirmed on my own, that the doctrine of a premortal existence was a common theme that was widely taught and written about by early Christian theologians and scholars until a council in A.D. 543, when it was branded as heresy (see Brent L. Top, <i>The Life Before</i> [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1988], 15–19).<br><br>How blessed we are to have this plain and precious truth not only restored in our day but also elaborated upon by modern revelation in ways that provide direction and meaning to our lives as we consider our divine nature and destiny.<br><h2><b>Gender as Part of Our Eternal Identity</b></h2><br>Gender is also an essential characteristic that originated in the premortal realm. President Boyd K. Packer reminded us:<br><br><i>The scriptures and the teachings of the Apostles and prophets speak of us in premortal life as sons and daughters, spirit children of God. Gender existed before, and did not begin at mortal birth.</i> [Boyd K. Packer, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1993/10/for-time-and-all-eternity?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">For Time and All Eternity</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1993, 21]<br><br>President Packer also encouraged us to<br><br><i>be careful lest you unknowingly foster influences and activities which tend to erase the masculine and feminine differences nature has established.</i> [Boyd K. Packer, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1998/04/the-relief-society?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Relief Society</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1998, 73]<br><br>The origin of gender is a heatedly debated topic in my discipline. Competing theories and research abound that attempt to explain gender origins; they focus on the extent to which they are modifiable, socially constructed, biologically driven, or all of the above. We are blessed with a secure knowledge that gender is a vital part of our eternal identity and purpose. As I contrast this with the confusion and inconclusiveness of the secular data at hand, I am grateful for our understanding of the divine role that gender plays in our eternal progression.<br><h2><b>Decisions and Experiences in Premortality</b></h2><br>As in our mortal existence, we had opportunities to obtain knowledge, to progress, and to make eternally defining decisions in premortality (see Luke 10:18; Jude 1:6; Revelation 12:7; Isaiah 14:12–13). We participated in the Council in Heaven, learned of our Heavenly Father's eternal plan for our destiny, progressed as far as we could without a physical body and mortal experiences, and chose to prove our willingness to keep God's commandments while in a mortal state where there would be no recollection of our premortal experiences. We also learned that our Heavenly Father would provide a Savior so that we could overcome sin and death (see 2 Nephi 9:19–24). Because we are here upon this earth, we kept our first estate. You and I made the decision to follow our Heavenly Father's plan rather than give heed to Satan's plan, which would have resulted in an inability to make choices for ourselves and to learn from our own experiences (see Dallin H. Oaks, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1993/10/the-great-plan-of-happiness?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Great Plan of Happiness</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1993, 72–75).<br><h2><b>Premortal Influences in Mortality</b></h2><br>As we will contemplate shortly, knowledge of our eternal identity and the decisions we made in premortality can help us make wise choices in our mortal existence.<br><br>We also had the opportunity in premortality to develop many talents and abilities that can play an important role in our mortal existence. Consider the following statements:<br><br><i>Being subject to law, and having their agency, all the spirits of men, while yet in the Eternal Presence, developed aptitudes, talents, capacities, and abilities of every sort, kind, and degree. During the long expanse of life which then was, an infinite variety of talents and abilities came into being.</i> [Bruce R. McConkie, <i>The Mortal Messiah: From Bethlehem to Calvary,</i> 4 vols. (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1979–81), 1:23]<br><br><i>Notwithstanding this fact that our recollection of former things was taken away, the character of our lives in the spirit world has much to do with our disposition, desires and mentality here in mortal life. This spirit influences the body to a great extent, just as the body in its desires and cravings has an influence on the spirit. ... Environment and many other causes, however, have great influence on the progress and destiny of man, but we must not lose sight of the fact that the characteristics of the spirit which were developed through many ages of a former existence play a very important part in our progression through mortal life.</i> [Joseph Fielding Smith, "Is Man Immortal?" part 3, <i>Improvement Era,</i> March 1916, 426]<br><br>In this regard, I often think of Cain, whom the scriptures refer to in Moses as one who was a rebel, a liar, and an associate of Lucifer in the premortal existence (see <i>The Mortal Messiah,</i> 23). He was even called "Perdition" from before the world (Moses 5:24). Yet somehow he managed to make good choices that helped him attain mortal birth, and he even began his time in mortality being obedient to the laws of God. Unfortunately, despite the righteous teachings of Adam, he later rebelled and slew Abel (see Bruce R. McConkie, <i>MD,</i> s.v. "Cain," 108–9). We can only speculate as to what might have happened to entice him back to hisformer proclivities.<br><br>Alternatively, the scriptures teach that there were many "noble and great ones" who were good from before the world (Abraham 3:22–23). Nephi was likely one of those valiant ones who exercised his agency in responsible ways. He had "great desires to know of the mysteries of God [and] did not rebel against" his father, as his brethren Laman and Lemuel did (1Nephi 2:16). Yet all three brothers were "born of goodly parents" (1 Nephi 1:1).<br><br>Although we cannot speculate as to the reasons why things played out the way they did for these more and less valiant spirits in mortality, we have a unique opportunity to learn things about ourselves from our premortal decisions and predispositions. Patriarchal blessings can guide our life decisions and often provide glimpses into premortal aspects of our existence in ways that can provide warnings, admonitions, and guidance about our gifts and talents that can bless our lives and those around us.<br><br>In mortality every person is endowed with spiritual gifts and talents that are part of their divine nature that can be refined, developed, and enlarged as a result of earthly experiences (see D&amp;amp;C 46; Moroni 10; 1 Corinthians 12–14). Everyone also has characteristics that are less than complete, as reflected in our lack ofaptitude and talent in some areas. We learn in Ether that weaknesses can foster humility and that weak things can become strong if individuals humble themselves and have faithin God (see Ether 12:17–27). Strengths and weaknesses can serve to provide unique learning experiences, depending on the circumstances individuals find themselves in and the extent to which opportunities areavailed.<br><br>I received my mission call during a time when prospective missionaries had to take a language aptitude test. When my stake president saw my score, he laughed and said, "You won't have to worry about going on a foreign mission. I have never seen such a low score." Imagine my surprise when the call to Japan came. I didn't even know where it was on the map! Learning Japanese was the hardest thing Ihad ever done. Yet, as many of you have experienced, the Lord miraculously prepared away. And it wasn't long before I knew exactly why I had been sent there. Those language skills, the cultural experience, and the converts I worked with have been blessings in my life to this day.<br><br>Regardless of our talents and abilities (or the lack thereof), all individuals also have both goodness and fleshly susceptibilities within them. President David O. McKay summarized the nature of humankind:<br><br><i>Man has a dual nature; one, related to the earthly or animal life; the other, akin to the divine.</i> [<i>CR,</i> April 1949, 13; see also McKay, <i>GI,</i> 347]<br><br>Before baptism and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, all receive the Light of Christ to discern good from evil (see Moroni 7:15–19). We come from the heavenly realm and are born into a world of sin beset with temptations for the "natural man" but also full of spiritual opportunities for growth for the divine (see Mosiah 3:19; 16:5). Being born innocent (see D&amp;amp;C 93:38) is being born neither good nor evil but having the potential for both. The natural man in us grows as a result of sin and our rejection of the promptings of the Spirit, whereas our divine nature is manifest when we heed those spiritual promptings and reject sin (see Mosiah 5:2).<br><br>There has been much to contemplate so far today. To review, we lived in a premortal existence as spirit sons and daughters of heavenly parents. While there, we had opportunities to develop talents, obtain knowledge, and make decisions that play important roles in our mortal existence. In mortality, everyone is endowed with spiritual gifts and talents that are part of our divine natures as well as with opportunities to develop characteristics that are less than complete. We are also born innocent, with the potential to engage in both good and evil, depending on our choices in mortality.<br><h2><b>Mortal Decision Making</b></h2><br>Let's now further consider mortal decision-making opportunities that are part of this mortal experience. As with our premortal existence, our mortal schooling is replete with opportunities to make choices that will either turn us toward or take us away from our divine destiny in our heavenly home. In the Book of Mormon, King Benjamin reminded us: "Watch yourselves, and your thoughts, and your words, and your deeds, and observe the commandments of God, and continue in the faith [so that you] perish not" (Mosiah 4:30).<br><br>We need to be vigilant and avoid making poor choices that can take us down forbidden paths. Remembering who we are as spirit children of God and all that that means can be helpful. Some good choices are easy to make if we have made firm decisions in accordance with our eternal values in advance.<br><br>Several years ago, after attending professional meetings in Europe, I had the pleasure of being bumped to first class on a flight from Paris to the United States. It was an entirely different world from what I normally experience. As I was enjoying the legroom and reclining in luxury, the flight attendants kept bringing wonderful dishes and offering wine to go along with them.<br><br>After I had declined the wine for about the third time, a flight attendant came up behind me, leaned down close to my ear, and teasingly said, "Mr. Hart, no one will ever know."<br><br>Shocked out of my blissful state, and wondering what she knew about me and how, I simply said, "Well, I would know, you would know, and"--pointing overhead--"most important, He would know."<br><br>She said, "Got it," and brought more fruit juice instead. That was an easy choice to make.<br><br>The right choices in other areas are often more difficult to discern, particularly when the choices are between several good options, like what academic major to pursue. And some choices are more pertinent to our salvation than others. For example, who we choose to marry is far more critical than what type of car we decide to buy.<br><br>We need not be left alone in the decisions that we make--big or small--in our mortal schooling experience. President Ezra Taft Benson explained:<br><br><i>Usually the Lord gives us the overall objectives to be accomplished and some guidelines to follow, but he expects us to work out most of the details and methods. The methods and procedures are usually developed through study and prayer and by living so that we can obtain and follow the promptings of the Spirit.</i> [Ezra Taft Benson, <i>CR,</i> April 1965, 121; also in Benson, <i>God, Family, Country: Our Three Great Loyalties</i> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1974), 381]<br><h2><b>Spiritual, Genetic, and Environmental Factors</b></h2><br>As illustrated by many scriptural examples, including that of Lehi's family, it is interesting in mortality to observe that not all children respond similarly to parental or other environmental influences. Part of this may be due to spiritual predispositions, as noted earlier. In terms of adhering to gospel teachings, we see considerable variation in how individuals respond to spiritual influences in this mortal existence. President Brigham Young noted this when hesaid:<br><br><i>Some spirits are more noble than others; some are capable of receiving more than others. There is the same variety in the spirit world that you behold here, yet they are of the same parentage, of one Father, one God.</i> [<i>JD</i> 4:268–69]<br><br>There are also genetic and environmental factors involved. Elder Neal A. Maxwell said:<br><br><i>Of course our genes, circumstances, and environments matter very much, and they shape us significantly. Yet there remains an inner zone in which we are sovereign, unless we abdicate. In this zone lies the essence of our individuality and our personal accountability.</i> ["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1996/10/according-to-the-desire-of-our-hearts?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to the Desire of [Our] Hearts</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1996, 21]<br><br>We will likely need to wait until the eternities to understand how our spiritual personalities specifically interact with genetic and environmental influences in mortality. From an academic perspective, we can only systematically study a small portion of the full equation that involves only the interaction of biological and environmental factors in a millisecond of eternity. Our understanding of this small portion is slowly increasing.<br><br>As an example, it was once simplistically thought that certain parenting practices typically led to desired child and adolescent conformance and behavior. It is true that following certain parenting principles will increase the probability of obtaining desired outcomes for the majority of children and youth. Research shows that parents can make the most difference by teaching moral and religious values that can help their children make wise choices, even in the face of biological urges or peer influences that would have them do otherwise (see W. Andrew Collins and others, "Contemporary Research on Parenting: The Case for Nature and Nurture," <i>American Psychologist</i> 55, no. 2 [February 2000]: 218–32). This is why parents who actively teach righteous living by precept and example, who strive to be connected with their children, who impose appropriate limits on behavior, and who allow appropriate latitude for child decision making are more likely to have well-adjusted children and teens (see Craig H. Hart, Lloyd D. Newell, and Susanne Frost Olsen, "Parenting Skills and Social-Communicative Competence in Childhood," in John O. Greene and Brant R. Burleson, eds., <i>Handbook of Communication and Social Interaction Skills</i> [Mahwah, New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2003], 753–97).<br><br>But there are many exceptions to these statistical trends--often in the same families. More recent multivariate studies have also documented how susceptible children are to certain child-rearing influences, and parental values depend in large part on their personalities, temperamental dispositions, and other biologically based characteristics. Individual characteristics contribute to dynamic parent-child interactions that are influenced by a host of other factors across development, including cultural norms, educational practices, media, and peers, to name a few (see Craig H. Hart, "Why Are Parents Important? Linking Parenting to Childhood Social Skills in Australia, China, Japan, Russia, and the United States," in A. Scott Loveless and Thomas B. Holman, eds., <i>The Family in the New Millennium: World Voices Supporting the "Natural" Clan,</i> 3 vols. [Westport, Connecticut: Praeger, 2007], 1:227–47). Taking all these factors into account does not easily lead to predictable outcomes for all children and youth.<br><br>In his encouragement of parents dealing with the many complexities associated with child rearing, President Brigham Young was well ahead of his time when he suggested that parents "study [children's] dispositions and their temperaments, and deal with them accordingly" (<i>JD</i> 19:221).<br><br>President James E. Faust more recently reminded us that "child rearing is so individualistic. ... What works with one [child] may not work with another" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1990/10/the-greatest-challenge-in-the-world-good-parenting?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Greatest Challenge in the World--Good Parenting</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1990, 34).<br><br>Most parents learn this pretty quickly. I once thought I had figured out how to get one of my daughters to bed when she was young. After experimenting with a number of strategies beyond the bedtime story and prayer routine, I finally discovered that she went happily to bed if I gave her the option of either me turning the light off or letting her do it. That lasted for about two weeks, but it was bliss. When I later tried that strategy with my other daughter at about the same age, she simply responded to my choices of who would turn the light off by defiantly stating that she wasn't going to bed. But I did discover that swimming together into her bedroom on the floor like fish or jumping into the bedroom together like kangaroos did the trick for her--but only for about two weeks. Then it was on to more experiments to figure out what worked next.<br><br>In conclusion, despite all that we have considered today, there is much about our premortal development and how our specific actions in the spirit world influence us in mortality that has not been revealed. Although secular knowledge somewhat explains how genetic-based characteristics and environmental influences interact to influence human development, there is an important spiritual dimension of our beings that cannot be readily probed by scientific means. What a wonderful blessing it will be if we are found worthy to learn from our Heavenly Father about how our spiritual personalities and biology are intertwined, according to His foreknowledge, in preparation for individualized schooling experiences in mortality. We have much to look forward to learning in that celestial university on high.<br><br>Sister Marilyn S. Bateman in an earlier devotional talk put much of what we have contemplated today into perspective when she reminded us that "knowledge of the premortal world provides a context for mortality. This life is the second act of a three-act play" (in Merrill J. and Marilyn S. Bateman, "<a href="http://speeches.byu.edu/talks/amy-harris_how-dead-cats-your-siblings-eighteenth-century-english-clergy-making-lists-ted-talks-evolutionary-biology-susa-young-gates-and-my-mom-can-save-the-world-from-being-utterly-wasted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mortality and Our Eternal Journey</a>," BYU devotional address, 14 January 2003). What a marvelous blessing it is to live in a day when this treasured knowledge has been restored by a prophet of God.<br><br>I testify that we live in a time of continuing revelation from a loving Heavenly Father who is very interested in facilitating our eternal progression back into His presence. It is my hope and prayer that we will be more cognizant of our divine natures, which are rooted in an existence that long preceded our birth into mortality. May we utilize the talents that we have been blessed with to further our Heavenly Father's plan of happiness for our brothers and sisters. And may we make good choices in life that are commensurate with our eternal identity and the decisions that we made in the premortal realm. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Craig H.

<h1>urnish to BYU - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
To those who graduated before you, you owe a debt of gratitude. Because they have used their talents and educations to add to the reputation of the university, you and I can take pride in associating the name Brigham Young University with our own names and reputations. We can write BYU with confidence on applications to graduate schools, on résumés, on job applications, or on paperwork for professional societies.<br><br>The university has long been recognized for producing women and men of integrity. BYU graduates are known as outstanding employees, notable scholars, and respected leaders. You are among those who have been grounded and rooted in the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>President Hinckley in media interviews used to note that we are, as a people, not perfect. He would say, "We make mistakes, and we have failures." Then we would add, "Yes, we do."<br><br>Our claim is not that we have arrived in any state of perfection but that it is before us as a goal. I believe the majority of BYU graduates the world over are worthy citizens and advocates of what is true and right. They are Church members and others who live their religion the best they can and stand by a high standard of morality and conduct. This adds <i>burnish</i> to the name and perception of the university. It is this ideal of burnishing BYU that I hope you will think about.<br><br>Years ago I collected horse brass. Most of the ones I own are copies. A horse brass is about half the size of the back of a man's hand. Made of brass to adorn horse harnesses, they bear family crests, likenesses of royalty, animals, and a myriad other creative symbols. The point is that for the brass to have a sheen and deep glow, it must be polished or burnished. So it is with our lives. When we as individual graduates of this institution grow and progress, we add luster and patina to our alma mater and to the Lord's Church.<br><br>Today you will formally complete this phase of your education. Armed with BYU degrees, you will leave this place that has grown sacred to you because of the academic and spiritual opportunities you have been afforded here. You too carry the responsibility to add burnish to the name Brigham Young University. Itnowbecomes your time to demonstrate to your employers, your graduate school professors, your business colleagues, your neighbors, and your friends what a BYU education truly means.<br><br>You will represent the university and the Church in such a way that people not only will note your talents and your character but also will underline in their memories the fact that you are a product, a graduate, a representative of BYU. As Dr. Kaye Hanson of the Marriott School tells her students, "For the rest of your life, you represent BYU, whether you're a member of the Church or not or whether you want to or not."<br><br>Let me illustrate how some of the graduates of this great school have added significance and burnish to the reputation of the university named after Brigham Young. Each year the Alumni Association accepts applications for its highest designation, the Outstanding Alumnus Award. I have served on a number of selection committees through the years with the arduous task of designating a handful of graduates for this special honor given at Homecoming time. Those who are considered for this designation are from all fields of endeavor--people who have made a difference in their professions, their wards and stakes, their communities, and their families. Often their prominence and contributions have reached national and even international significance. They don't nominate themselves--usually it is professional colleagues, family members, or fellow alumni who recognize the exceptional contribution of a BYU alumnus.<br><br>Stop and think for a moment what your achievements in your chosen profession may be in the next 25 to 30 years. What difference will you have made in your families, in your communities, in the Church, in your professions, or in your service to mankind?<br><br>I want to share with you a few comments made about one of our graduates who, through a life of service, has helped to burnish the Brigham Young University name. This was written by one of her seven children--six sons and one daughter--who nominated their mother for the Service to Family Award:<br><br>[Alice Schindler Cannon] <i>graduated from BYU in 1958 and went to law school at Duke University. Because of a long-distance courtship with our father, she moved to Illinois and graduated from the University of Illinois as a lawyer. During this time they married, and upon graduating our mother decided not to begin a law practice because she was expecting her first child. Her priority was family.</i><br><br>The letters of recommendation noted that tragedy struck this family in 1993 when an accident took their father. It was then that the award nominee assumed the role as head of the household and monitored the family construction business as secretary/treasurer. Her family further notes that she has served in virtually every Church organization and calling, including Relief Society president twice, both stake and ward Young Women president, and Primary president.<br><br>At her daughter's report to the high council after her mission, the stake president asked this outstanding mother and BYU graduate where she had sent her children on their missions. After she replied, with tears in his eyes the stake president noted, "Sister, you have sent your children to all parts of the world to teach the gospel, and the men and women of this world honor your name."<br><br>As a graduate, when you bring quiet or heralded honor to your own lives, you add honor to the university, to the Church, and to our Eternal Father, in whose image we are created. As your reputation grows for the good you do and the service you render, the reputation of BYU grows brighter and brighter. As noted in the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 50:24]<br><br>Let me mention another graduate who will be honored here on campus in October. Michael K. Young has also added luster to BYU. This Distinguished Service Award recipient has served as the president of a university and the dean of a law school, chaired a major commission for the United States government, raised a wonderful family, and served in the Church. He, too, once sat among those graduating from BYU.

<h1>f Transitions: What Should We Seek? - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Graduates, families, brothers, sisters, and friends: I'm grateful to welcome all of you to Brigham Young University on this significant day of celebration for our graduates, their loved ones, our faculty, and the entire university community. As we formally recognize those we individually honor today, we also appreciate that their successes are not solo events and, in virtually every case, are the result of help, support, and encouragement of others in addition to the tremendous personal efforts of those whose names appear on the program of the day. In this we include spouses, parents, children, and other family members; professors, teachers, classmates, friends, Church leaders, faithful tithe payers all around the world, generous donors, and all others who make contributions of a wide variety that result in making the miracles at BYU a reality.<br><br>As you know, commencement is a time oftransitions. This is true for graduating students, of course, but also true for a number of retiring staff, faculty, and administrators. In that regard I specifically mention the coming retirement in the days ahead of Advancement Vice President K. Fred Skousen, who has served BYU so very well in his current role fora decade and as a faculty member and university leader for an additional three decades. We will miss him and the others who have done so much for so many over the years. Today we are happy to welcome incoming Advancement Vice President Kevin J Worthen, who has been serving as dean of the J. Reuben Clark Law School here at BYU.<br><br>Likewise, Elder W. Rolfe Kerr has been called as president of the Logan Utah Temple and has been released as commissioner of Church Education. Our new commissioner and good friend Elder Paul V. Johnson has also joined with us in the official party.<br><br>As is typically the case, this graduating class is outstanding in a number of important ways. More than half are married, and that percentage will continue to increase appreciably in the days ahead. Over a quarter of the undergraduates and almost two-thirds of the graduate students studied at other institutions of higher learning before enrolling at Brigham Young University. All but one state is represented in this class. In addition, five U.S. territories and 61 foreign countries have sent students in this group to BYU.<br><br>Our youngest graduate is just 19 years old, and our eldest reached her 39th birthday about 43 years ago! Sister Hermine Briggs Horman is graduating in general studies. We will have Sister Horman stand and let us recognize her and all those who have made remarkable sacrifices to complete degrees, oftentimes after many years of attending to other important priorities.<br><br>As I stated earlier, commencement is a time of transitions. As we conclude one phase of life, we begin another. We should reflect on and glory in the successes, accomplishments, and growth that have occurred while you studied here. Your progress and contributions have been truly remarkable. We should also now be focusing on where we are going in the future, what we will next accomplish, and how we will best continue to learn and grow.<br><br>Recently I've been impressed to think about the word <i>seek.</i> There are a number of definitions of <i>seek</i>. My dictionary includes notions such as (1) to go in search of or to look for something; (2) to try to discover something; (3) to ask for something; and (4) to try to acquire or gain something (see <i>Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary,</i> 11th ed. [2003], s.v. "seek"). By my count, the word <i>seek</i> occurs 572 times in the scriptures, and when variations on this root word and its synonyms are included, the scriptures are replete with literally thousands of references. Examples of each of the definitions I have mentioned can be found, and perhaps some other meanings as well. Of course these verses contain counsel on both what we should seek and what we should avoid. Let me share a few that I believe deserve our particular attention as we embark on the next phases of our lives and careers.<br><br>Of course there are many things--wonderful, attractive, and worthwhile--that your BYU education has equipped you well to seek after. Listen to these words of the Lord: "But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you" (3 Nephi 13:33; see also Matthew 6:33). Let's be sure we keep our priorities straight. I have great confidence that you know what your priorities and primary loyalties are.<br><br>Often we quote to each other, as the prophets have to us, this important counsel:<br><br><i>And as all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 88:118; seealso D&amp;amp;C 109:7]<br><br>We try to do this at BYU and hope with great confidence that this pattern of continued learning will be yours all of your days.<br><br>Sometimes, for those who have incurred significant debt or have lived at near-poverty levels during the time of the formal university student experience, the following advice, repeated in numerous places in scripture, may not be unduly welcome, however vital and however true:<br><br><i>Seek not for riches but for wisdom, and behold, the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto you, and then shall you be made rich. Behold, he that hath eternal life is rich.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 6:7; see also D&amp;amp;C 11:7]<br><br>I predict that for almost all of you, a day will come when, while reflecting back on the difficult days of being a BYU student or spouse, you will acknowledge your years on campus as some of the most happy and special of your entire life. This will be particularly true as you continue to seek after the correct and most important things.<br><br>Occasionally I meet a student who reports that he or she wants to strike it rich and then will work on other priorities like marriage, family, service in the Church and the community, and the like. Apparently Jacob, the brother of Nephi, also knew those with similar views. Listen to his words:<br><br><i>But before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God.</i><br><br><i>And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to do good--to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted.</i> [Jacob 2:18–19]<br><br>Please be careful about what you seek, because you have become educated and equipped to be successful in achieving what you set out to accomplish and achieve. Please remember that all who have supported and encouraged you in your educational endeavors have done so with not only great love but also with tremendous confidence in your potential to bless your own life and the lives of all of those you touch.<br><br>Our Father in Heaven and His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, do live. This university is part of Their work and Their Plan, and so are you. We are led by prophets and apostles who also have great expectations for you and the contributions you will make. Congratulations and best wishes as you go on with our faith and prayers in behalf of you and yours. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O. Samuelson was president of Brigham Young University when this commencement address was given on 14 August 2008.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>ess in Life - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am immensely grateful for this totally unexpected, extraordinary honor bestowed by Brigham Young University, the executive committee of the board of trustees, and the board and its officers, the First Presidency. I am in awe at the conferral of an honor so immensely significant and so profoundly appreciated. It is one thing to earn a degree through individual effort. For me it is far more significant that the constituted authorities determine that you qualify to receive one. I am at a total loss to find adequate words to convey the depth of my feelings of gratitude. I will ever strive to live so as not to undermine the enduring significance of the conferral of this honorary doctorate today. My beloved companion and I express our gratitude from both sides of the veil.<br><br>One way to begin to express gratitude is by sharing with you students who graduate today some principles that have served me well and may provide meaningful help as you commence your postgraduate life. This day is the beginning of a fascinating journey for each of you. I will explain what I mean with ananalogy.<br><br>In the greenhouse of a nursery, small seedlings are nurtured, carefully nourished, and watched over until they develop into a sapling that is better suited to face the challenges of growth in the world. Brigham Young University has served you in like manner. You have grown here. You have discovered talents and abilities, probably unknown to you previously. You now realize that this is just the beginning of an exciting, invigorating, productive, extraordinarily interesting journey. It is one of ever seeking to learn, to apply, and to share the fruits of your searching for knowledge and experience.<br><br>My message comes from my heart because of the appreciation and love I have for each one of you. My desire is that the counsel given will benefit not only you who graduate but youwho continue your education at this exceptional university.<br><br>To stand at this pulpit in the presence of such a concentration of devoted and righteous graduates, parents, and loved ones is to be profoundly moved with gratitude and appreciation. I am deeply touched as I contemplate what can occur in the coming years from what you graduates of BYU will do with the knowledge and experience gained at this unique university. You have the potential for making critically important contributions throughout the world. You can form eternal families, orient and raise righteous children, strengthen a host of professions, give caring service, and be a potent force for good in a world that desperately needs it. You can share the message of the Restoration by precept and example.<br><br>I warmly congratulate each one of you we honor at this commencement service. Each has met the lofty standards of personal worthiness and academic achievement to qualify to be at this singular university. You have kept strict standards of righteousness. Through many long, arduous days and nights of devoted study, exacting testing, and other rigorous qualifying effort, you have well earned the degree that has been conferred. You have not only attained an outstanding secular education, but you have done it while meeting the highest standards of integrity and spirituality. Iam truly humbled to be in your presence.<br><br>You have accomplished this at an exceptional university that has focused on academic excellence and building strong character in its student body. You are unique among graduating students of the world for having been schooled in a Latter-day Saint Church university. Therefore, we expect of you future accomplishments far beyond those asked of a graduating class elsewhere. Your presence here indicates you are a singular man or woman of great value and potential. We expect you to be righteous, effective leaders; to contribute strongly to society; and to build worthy eternal families. Your preparation here has provided an exceptional foundation for you to realize worthwhile ambitions and to accomplish muchgood.<br><br>You have been supported by noble parents and family and some by a loving spouse. You have been encouraged by a competent faculty where individual instructors have become impressive sources of professional knowledge as well as worthy role models. Often the devoted staff has eased the way through the bewildering challenges of a college education. All of this activity at Brigham Young University has been guided by an exceptionally devoted university president, Cecil Samuelson.<br><br>As your life unfolds, you will encounter challenges that will test severely your strength and ability. You will find that the education you have received at this campus will provide the capacity to resolve some of those challenges. You will confirm that your education is a key to help you open the doors of opportunity. You will likewise prove that it is not, however, a guarantee for success. It must be coupled with hard work, consistency, and devotion to duty.<br><br>If you are wise you will seek inspiration and guidance from a loving Heavenly Father. You will find some challenges that can only be resolved by prayerful communication with Him and by being sensitive to the resulting impressions that come through the Holy Ghost. Faithful obedience to those spiritual promptings will protect, guide, motivate, strengthen, and crown your efforts. You will find success, joy, and happiness for yourselves and great blessings for those whom you love and serve. For the Savior has stated:<br><br><i>Ask the Father in my name, in faith believing that you shall receive, and you shall have the Holy Ghost, which manifesteth all things which are expedient unto the children of men.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 18:18]<br><br>With your graduation you are given increased freedom to act. There is a lessening ofcontrols so that you may be able to make more basic decisions on your own. Some erroneously consider this a release from bondage, a removal of shackles, a breaking of restraints. In the excitement of new freedom, a few use unwisely their agency to select paths that lead them away from the solid moorings of the gospel and the faultless direction of the Holy Spirit. Some are tempted to begin foolish experimentation along forbidden paths even on the day of graduation. May no one in this graduating class cast aside the spiritual heritage that has been acquired over years of diligent study and obedience. The freedom of choice, given in increased measure this day, provides greater opportunity for limitless personal growth and development, as well as for unbounded service to others. It also will yield happiness beyond the power of expression when exercised within the controlled environment that the gospel plan provides.<br><br>I have a few concrete suggestions for you who graduate today. They are simple yet profound. They are drawn from the doctrine of the Lord and personal experience that has brought happiness and success to my dear wife, Jeanene, and to me.<br><h2><b>Use Correct Principles</b></h2><br>Establish a set of guiding principles for your life from the teachings of Jesus Christ. Never compromise them. Difficulties in life begin when small deviations from true principles are made to justify a quick move to greater accomplishment. Over time, that pattern brings failure. Strength comes from making no exceptions to guiding principles. Without such a foundation an individual lives for the moment, making decisions according to popular trends or current circumstances. Such will likely violate eternal truths and lose by rationalization many of the marvelous opportunities of life that bring great achievement andhappiness.<br><h2><b>Exercise Faith</b></h2><br>It is understandable that you feel some anxiety about your future. Because you are exceptional young men and women, the Lord will accelerate your growth by giving you experiences that could stretch your current capacity to the limit. Let your predominant attitude be faith in the Lord, Jesus Christ, confidence in His teachings, trust in His ability to keep His promises, and reliance on His capacity to inspire, motivate, and guide you. Stay close to Him through faith and obedience. Then, through the Holy Ghost, He will help you find the solution to every perplexing problem you will face. The answers to major challenges will likely come after considerable prayer and pondering. Usually, portions of the answer will be given a piece at a time until the full answer is received.<br><h2><b>Work and Pray</b></h2><br>I share an insight for success from an individual from humble background who achieved exceptional spiritual and material attainment in this life. It is to him we owe gratitude for this facility in which we meet, namely J. Willard Marriott, Sr. He said: "Work and prayer are the two greatest words in the English language." Each of you will benefit by carefully applying that counsel in your life.<br><h2><b>Be Disciplined</b></h2><br>Discipline breeds determination. Determination fueled by discipline overcomes the barriers in life that would cause us to fall far short of our true potential. Determination when supported by practiced discipline converts barriers into ladders to greater success, happiness, joy, and accomplishment.<br><br>Rigorous discipline is at the core of all significant attainment. Strict discipline is at the root of significant character development. Discipline is self-strengthening. The more it is exercised, the more capacity is available for its use. An individual who is truly disciplined does not flaunt it; rather, he or she employs it wisely and is generously understanding of those who lack discipline.<br><br>I have learned much about quiet discipline from my precious wife, Jeanene. It was the central hallmark of her character. While understanding and generous with others who did not employ it in their lives, she was strictly disciplined in her own life.<br><h2><b>Radiate a Positive Attitude</b></h2><br>Let your attitude be that of continuing happiness. The challenges you face and the growth experiences you encounter should be like temporary scenes played out on the stage of continuing peace and happiness. Don't become so absorbed in a single event that you can't think of anything else. Challenges are not intended to be the substance of life. It is by understanding and obeying the teachings of God that your life will fulfill its glorious purpose. That perspective keeps challenges confined to their proper place--stepping-stones to further growth and attainment. Life should and can bewondrously beautiful.<br><h2><b>Establish a Home and Family</b></h2><br>Make one of the highest priorities of life the formation of an eternal family, then live to permit the Lord to guide you to that objective while accepting His timing. Some of you have begun to reach that sacred objective as wife and husband. Others are in the process of finding that special eternal companion. Some of you may have feelings that you will not have such a blessing. Do not cheat yourself that way. Live to be led to an eternal companion so that the Lord can bless you.<br><br>Your home should be a haven of peace free of conflict and dissension. It is there where the gospel is most effectively taught and lived. Make the place where you live--no matter how humble or temporary--a clean, righteous, peaceful environment where the Spirit can dwell. Keep the contaminating influence of unacceptable media, Internet, magazines, and the like out of your home.<br><h2><b>Trust in the Lord</b></h2><br>Be obedient to His counsel. Follow His commandments and you will be filled with inspiration and power. You will obtain goals beyond your personal capacity. Do not judge your potential by what you are today but by what you can become under the guidance of the Lord. Those who disobey the commandments of God face the challenges of life alone without the guidance of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>One of the greatest early indicators of career success is deep, self-confidence in your ability to overcome challenges. That self-confidence comes from knowing that you do not walk alone. Your obedience will bring confidence. That confidence will bring appropriate power. You will learn that the Spirit can bless you in every walk of life.<br><br>Material things do not of themselves produce happiness and satisfaction and the joy of attainment on earth. They are not required for your exaltation. It is nobility of character that gives life its full meaning. Such character is the fabric of inner strength and conviction. It is woven from countless righteous decisions, none of which is difficult to make. A consistent righteous life produces an inner power and strength that can be permanently resistant to the eroding influence of sin and transgression.<br><h2><b>Be Honest and Loyal</b></h2><br>Keep your word. Keep your commitments. If your responsibility is to provide an income for a family, acquire work with good leadership in a field that really matters. Give more than is expected. With your background from this university, minimum or average work is simply not acceptable. Admit mistakes when you make them, for we all do. That act builds character and also respect. Accept full responsibility for your actions.<br><br>Live so that you are trusted. Trust opens wide the gate to exceptional opportunity and success. Seek to be challenged in what you do. Don't look for a safe haven where you have no risk, for you will not grow or have real satisfaction. Do not divide your life into separate compartments that apply to profession, Church, and family with different standards for each compartment, as is done in the world. Live consistently one high standard of truth, integrity, and hard work. That pattern will bring you success in every important aspect of life.<br><h2><b>Follow Proper Traditions</b></h2><br>Some traditions fortify families; others severely challenge them. Let the traditions you make part of your home bring blessings by making your first priority your membership in the Church of Jesus Christ and His teachings your foundation for life. Where traditions and customs are in harmony with His teachings, cherish and follow them to preserve your culture and heritage. Where family or national traditions or customs conflict with the teachings of God, simply throw them away.<br><h2><b>Smile</b></h2><br>Everyone has problems, but nobody wants to know about yours. Smile a lot. It's a beautiful way to let sunshine into your life and to spread it to the joy and benefit of others.<br><h2><b>Don't Complain</b></h2><br>There will be times when life just isn't fair. Some others may make unjust decisions that affect you professionally or otherwise. Don't waste time complaining. Life is charged with opportunity when you seek the help of the Lord to find it. Look for the gold nuggets of opportunity around you, mine them, and use them.<br><h2><b>Serve Others</b></h2><br>Immense happiness comes from serving others selflessly. Always have a Church assignment, always. Don't request specific callings but ask to be used so that you are constantly connected to the reality of eternal truth. That effort will keep your life in balance.<br><h2><b>Express Gratitude</b></h2><br>Show gratitude for the blessings of life: the miracle of sight and the other senses, the love of family, the restoration of truth, the wonder of spiritual guidance, and especially the Atonement and the gifts that flow from it. Peace and happiness are the precious fruits of a righteous life. They are only possible because of the Atonement of ourSavior and Redeemer, Jesus Christ.<br><br>Today as you commence the balance of your life, recognize that the Lord has placed the divine influence of the Holy Ghost in your life that will lead you along the individual plan He would have you fulfill here on earth. Through much prayer and pondering seek to identify and carefully follow the influence of that Spirit. Such direction is most easily identified by humbly seeking the will of the Lord.<br><br>As an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ I invoke a blessing upon each one of you, conditioned on your obedience and faith, that the Lord will guide you through the Holy Ghost to make the correct choices in important decisions you now face and that you will feel that guidance in your life as you seek it.<br><br>I testify that with unimaginable suffering and agony at an incalculable price, the Savior has earned His right to be our Intermediary, our Redeemer, our Final Judge. Through faith in Him and our Holy Father and receipt of the required ordinances and covenants, you can earn your right to the blessings of eternal marriage made possible through His Infinite Atonement. You can qualify through continuing obedience for the glorious privilege of eternal life in the celestial kingdom with obedient loved ones. I bear this witness with every capacity that I have. I know it is true. I know the Savior lives. I know He knows each one of you individually. He had an individual plan for you that you will discover a piece at a time as you seek guidance from Him. He is real. Our Father is real. They love you and They will guide you. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Richard G.

<h1>ce This Beginning - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Four years ago I arrived at BYU with lofty expectations. I expected to grow intellectually and spiritually. I expected to be instant friends with my freshman roommates. I expected my classes to be a breeze because I was smart. I expected to graduate unmarried. I expected to broaden my horizons and learn as much as I could. I'm guessing we all had various expectations as we arrived here, some outrageous and some reasonable. If your experience has been like mine, all of your expectations were not met, but I would surmise that our unmet expectations, whatever they were, brought good things to our college experiences, contributing to the people that we've become.<br><br>Some of my expectations were long-standing, dating from when I first started to think about coming to college. As a five- or six-year-old, I remember my astonishment at discovering that doctoral degrees existed in many areas. I could become a doctor in something other than medicine! That became my goal. I settled on a juris doctorate--though at the time I didn't know that that's what law degrees were called--because I wanted to be a United States Supreme Court justice, a position that sounded even more glamorous to my young ears than president. After all, justices do wear robes.<br><br>When I finally said good-bye to my childhood dreams and settled into the world of English literature at BYU, I felt a little apprehensive. I loved what I studied, but at the time I couldn't really think of anything less influential. Maybe some of you had similar experiences, choosing or changing your major because of those feelings. Well, I persevered in English--a subject I have since become very passionate about.<br><br>As I made that choice, a story that botanist Paul Alan Cox tells became very important to me. While on a tour of the Salt Lake Temple, Dr. Cox started wondering how his skills as a scholar of botany could possibly help build the kingdom of God. He couldn't carve stone or do any of the carpentry work that ornamented the Salt Lake Temple, but when he saw the desk where James E. Talmage wrote Jesus the Christ, he had an epiphany. He realized that all professions have their place. He says, "All have a contribution to make in the kingdom." It is my conviction that BYU exists primarily to help us contribute to the kingdom in whatever profession we choose.<br><br>As we leave this place, we must, however, choose to make a difference in the world. BYU allows us to have more influence, more opportunities to increase His kingdom on the earth, including in our professional lives and in our communities, because we have responsibilities not only to our families and our friends but also to humanity.<br><br>Martin Luther King Jr. said, "All labor that uplifts humanity has dignity and importance and should be undertaken with painstaking excellence." As graduates of Brigham Young University, a dedication to humanity and to excellence is something that we should all continue to cultivate. In all aspects of our lives--familial, ecclesiastical, professional, and civic--we should be uplifting as many people as we can, because if we love God, we love those around us. During our time at BYU we have set the stage for a lifetime of learning and service. Independent of major or career choice, if we stick to that path we have forged for ourselves, we can serve our fellow men.<br><br>As we set out on our postgraduate path, we should first show gratitude. Like you, I am grateful for the mentors, professors, classmates, and friends who have guided me and helped me through the maze that is higher education. I am thankful to the BYU Board of Trustees for valuing what we can do with an education and helping us to obtain one. I am thankful to my husband, to my family, to my Savior, and to my Heavenly Father. All of these people deserve our thanks today.<br><br>And now it is time to go and do. Much has been given here, and now much is required. I entered BYU scared to talk to people, overconfident in my own intellectual abilities, and convinced that I didn't need anyone else to succeed. I leave here humbled--although able to hold a somewhat less stilted conversation with someone I've just met. I leave here acutely and thankfully aware of how crucial associates, colleagues, roommates, friends, and family are to leading a successful and happy life. I leave BYU with the knowledge that I'm not nearly as smart as that freshman who arrived four years ago, but I have learned how to think more critically and I have learned how to learn. With the help of others and through hard work, we can and shall accomplish something worthwhile. We leave here with a firm conviction that we have been blessed to be at BYU and that we have a responsibility to God and to those we love and serve to do something of great worth.<br><br>May we be not only relieved but also refreshed and rededicated as we face this beginning before us. Congratulations, graduates. Thank you.<br><br><em>Jessie Leatham Wirkus spoke as the representative of her graduating class at BYU commencement on 14 August 2008.</em><br><br>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.

<h1>hip, Research, Teaching: The BYU Way - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, colleagues and friends, it is always a pleasure to meet together in the BYU Annual University Conference. Each summer at BYU has been for me--and Ihope for you as well--a season for both reflection and refreshment. Not that it is entirely free time, because it is not. Life, with its many attendant responsibilities and tasks, goes on, and we go along with it. However, it is a time when some of the pace of fall and winter semesters slackens just a little and we--figuratively, at least--gird up our loins for the expectations and excitement of another academicyear.<br><br>Our theme this year comes from Psalm 36:9: "In thy light shall we see light." It is a fitting reminder that the "light" that "proceedeth forth from the presence of God to fill the immensity of space" is also "the same light that quickeneth your understandings" (D&amp;amp;C 88:11,12).<br><br>It is the light we each seek in all we do at Brigham Young University--including especially how we learn; how we teach; and how we inquire, create, and research.<br><br>I'll return in a few minutes to this idea of inquiring, creating, and researching in the light of the gospel. It is foundational to our BYU mission and our trusted common stewardship to accumulate and contribute understanding and knowledge both personally and institutionally. In addition, we have the clear charge to share what we learn and know with our students and with each other.<br><br>Each university--and BYU is no exception in this regard--is held somewhat captive by environmental conditions both internal and external to the institution. Externally, for example, is the concern all of us in the American academy have for our students with respect to the seeming crisis in student loan availability. Hopefully some remedies and solutions will be forthcoming soon, but American higher education is watching the situation carefully. Likewise, the shaky economy and this political campaign season--with the prospects of significant changes in our governmental leadership at multiple levels--are examples of issues of interest and concern found on virtually every campus.<br><br>An external environmental matter rather specific for BYU and her sister institutions is the reality of the emergence of the prophetic fulfillment concerning our sponsoring organization, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. You will remember the promise of the Lord given in the preface to the Doctrine and Covenants that power would be given to His servants "to bring [the Church] forth out ofobscurity and out of darkness" (D&amp;amp;C 1:30).<br><br>Most of us believe BYU has had and will have a significant role in this. While I have been tempted to say more about this, I'll defer most of these comments and feelings for another time. I will say this much: Just as Charles Dickens began his famous novel <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> with these phrases--about another place and era--for us this is also "the best of times" and "the worst of times."<br><br>This is the best of times because BYU has never been stronger or enjoyed such positive recognition for its quality, its students, and its faculty. Through BYU Broadcasting, for example, we are able to do more than ever before to get the message of our university and its sponsoring organization out to the world, and it is only the beginning.<br><br>It is the worst of times, in a way, because as a people and as an institution our legitimate weaknesses, foibles, and flaws are more visible than ever before. Also, the vitriol, unfair and misleading miscommunication, and criticism about our sponsoring Church and its members have reached levels in some quarters that seem to rival the dark days of the 19th century. Happily, we are in a better position than ever before to respond, and BYU has a key role in providing solid, credible, data-based responses and defenses.<br><br>Notwithstanding the many additional concerns affecting us that we might discuss today, I would like to focus my comments on an issue that is in some respects general across the academic landscape but also quite specific and unique to Brigham Young University. It is a topic we have mentioned before, and I'm confident that the discourse should and will continue. I am speaking about the institutional and individual concerns, feelings, fears, and expectations that are represented among us with respect to our university citizenship, our efforts and responsibilities in the sphere of our creative and research activities, and what our stated primary focus on teaching and learning at BYU really means.<br><br>However, before I speak further on our conference theme, let me briefly update us on a few topics of ongoing campus interest. Our list today is neither comprehensive nor mentioned in any particular order or priority. Across this large, complex, and busy campus, many important initiatives and efforts are always underway. But developments such as those within BYU Broadcasting, our changing and maturing physical campus, our BYU institutional accreditation, and our special emphasis on integrity at BYU are issues that reach across campus to affect every one of us. Let me mention each briefly in turn, starting with BYU Broadcasting.<br><br>As I hope you know, BYU Broadcasting--and particularly BYU-TV--has become increasingly important to our academic mission and to the Church. We are growing rapidly and cover the entire United States, Latin America, and much of the rest of the world. Recently, for example, BYU-TV came on air in Tonga and has a tremendous following of BYU alumni, Church members, many friends, and also the frankly curious folks who are looking for wholesome and educational offerings.<br><br>Construction will shortly begin on our new BYU Broadcasting building to be located east of the Marriott Center and north of the Bean Museum. The construction costs will be covered by generous donors, and the Church has signaled its commitment to increased quality and quantity in our broadcast programming. By next year at this time you will be witnessing very significant progress on the new facility and also in our offerings.<br><br>Our physical campus, already very beautiful and functional, will continue to improve and be wonderfully refined to meet challenges and opportunities in our changing world. New buildings are not our primary goal or focus, but they are the accompaniment of the continued progress that will be necessary to meet our prophetic destiny. You will notice significant developments in the new Office of Information Technology building currently under construction on the west side of the campus, and we expect, again with the generosity of supportive donors, to have an expansion of the Bean Museum in the near future.<br><br>With increasing demands for student housing, you will soon see the construction of aninth building in our Helaman Halls complex. We are watching very closely the changing demographics and housing situation in our broader university community. Many of you have witnessed the ground shaking and the noise associated with the continuing expansion of our utility tunnel system, which will greatly reduce the interruptions and emergencies related to deterioration in our aging systems across campus.<br><br>The southeast quadrant of campus will be receiving great attention in the not-too-distant future. You will recognize that the Knight Mangum Building has been taken down after a long and multiuse career. We have tremendous needs to become more current in our facilities for life sciences and engineering and technology, and there are also a number of practical and aesthetic issues that require our attention.<br><br>This list is by no means comprehensive. Ourbeautiful campus has never been really finished in the technical sense, and I believe this will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future.<br><br>In July 2008, the secretary of education and the U.S. Department of Education convened a national summit on higher education. As part of the summit, BYU was one of 15 institutions across the country invited to share at the "best practices" showcase. Dr. Gerrit Gong represented BYU so very well in the activity. The "best practices" we were asked to share were our student learning outcomes wiki site and the video our students made about student involvement with learning outcomes.<br><br>To date, our https://learningoutcomes.byu.edu wiki site has received some 272,000 visits by 54,000 unique visitors. Web visits to our site come from every time zone across the world. So, three cheers for each and all who are continuing to align student learning objectives, evidence, and ongoing improvement for each of BYU's 267 degree programs!<br><br>This coming year will see continuing campus conversations at various levels about how we best inquire, teach, and learn in a religiously based university. We are, of course, not unique in a tradition of pursuing inquiry, scholarship, learning, and teaching in an environment where learning is sought by study and also by faith and where our core identity reflects diversity, tolerance, and community. As always, we respect and sustain our BYU Board of Trustees, including the policy guidelines they set and the important principles they teach by which we are entrusted to govern much of what takes place here on a daily basisourselves.<br><br>In recent devotionals, annual university conferences, and other settings, I have talked about "the BYU way," the BYU Honor Code, and the importance of integrity. On occasion I still meet a male BYU student who I suggest should visit closely with either Brother Gillette or Brother Schick. On occasion I still meet a female BYU student who is apparently wearing a little sister's T-shirt or who I wish would remember sacred guidance about adjusting clothes to garments and not vice versa.<br><br>But in general, I commend and thank all of you within the BYU community for your personal commitment and example as we help our students understand and abide by their signed Honor Code commitments. Whether in athletics, academics, housing, or other aspects of what we do, we try very hard to say what we mean and mean what we say with respect to personal integrity.<br><br>Virtually every comprehensive American university gives at least lip service to the triad of citizenship, research, and teaching. Most of us have been to other institutions or are familiar with the different interpretations found throughout the academy about what particular meaning each of these actually has.<br><br>In my own academic discipline, which we do not have at BYU, a majority of the most highly regarded universities consider research to be king. It is understandable, if not fully defensible, to see why this is so. Let me share some of the most obvious reasons.<br><br>First, in many circles the external reputation for excellence is highly correlated with the success and prominence of its research faculty and enterprise.<br><br>Second, for the very successful research-oriented institutions, these activities can be very lucrative. Enormous grants and contracts from the various agencies of government and from wealthy foundations often represent a very significant percentage of the financial support of the university. In addition, spinoff companies, licensing agreements, patents, and the like also generate tremendous dollar benefits for successful sponsoring organizations.<br><br>Given these considerations, which are not really secrets to anyone, it would not be surprising to recognize that someone who generates enough money for the university might be considered a "good citizen" exclusive of any other contributions or considerations. Likewise, such a valuable faculty member bringing in lots of money and recognition might be excused by some for being a poor teacher or even be excused from teaching altogether. We all know this is not the BYUway.<br><br>Other institutions--such as many liberal arts colleges, community colleges, and emerging universities that focus their efforts primarily at the baccalaureate level--do not emphasize or even support research on the part of the faculty. High teaching loads and significant teaching expectations are the norm. Our sister institutions, BYU–Idaho and BYU–Hawaii, largely fit into this framework.<br><br>Brigham Young University fits neither the model of the clearly research-first institutions nor the model of the large cadre of nonresearch schools. As we all know, we have been defined by our board of trustees as a primarily undergraduate teaching university with some graduate programs of distinction and high quality. Likewise, research of superb quality is an important part of our mission with the intent that it supports and enhances our primary responsibilities in teaching and learning.<br><br>Perhaps an example from my previous careers might be a little helpful in understanding how I see some of this. After 20 years in academic medicine, including responsibilities for a university hospital, I made a major professional shift and took a leadership position with a health-care system where I had responsibilities for more than 20 community hospitals. One of the hospitals, LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City, was one with which I had a long history. I was born there, although I don't remember much about that. As a medical student, I worked evenings as an employee in labor and delivery for one year and took some medical school electives there. On occasion I also did consultations and conducted teaching roundsthere.<br><br>It was interesting to me that, at least superficially, LDS Hospital did exactly the same things that the University Hospital did. That is, each institution was involved in patient care, teaching, and research. Each facility had faculty and staff who were involved in all three missions and some other folk who were involved in only one or two. What was different was not so much the ownership--with one being a private, not-for-profit entity and the other a state-owned entity--but rather the highly different emphases or priorities of the operations. While not particularly obvious to outside observers or even to the patients being served, the interests and basic motivations of the two places were quite different.<br><br>The University Hospital, as a direct component of a university, is primarily interested in educating prospective physicians, nurses, and other health professionals and also conducting clinical and basic research. It provides excellent clinical care, but that aspect of the mission is justified because it is necessary to provide this care in a laboratory setting established to support the educational and research missions.<br><br>LDS Hospital, and others, are primarily committed to superior patient care. They also are involved in medical education and research because their leadership believes these activities greatly enhance the quality and scope of the clinical treatments offered to their patients.<br><br>Thus, while both are doing fundamentally the same things, the emphasis and rationale at each institution are quite different. Both hospitals and their staffs clearly understand their priorities, and while each strives for and largely achieves excellence in all three spheres, their primary motivations are significantly different, even though in both cases the three activities are largely synergistic for eachfacility.<br><br>In a similar vein, BYU does roughly the same things as other large comprehensive universities, but the emphases and motivations may be quite different in some important respects. At BYU, our primary and major focus has been and must be on our teaching and learning responsibilities. This is true with respect to both our academics and our spiritually strengthening activities. If we are asked to choose between the interests of our students and anything else, there is really no choice. We do research, serious inquiry, or creative work because it enhances the learning and teaching environment for our students. We do not look at these efforts to provide financial support for the university generally, although we do compete for grants and strive to have these activities be largely self-sustaining. Thus we see these efforts to create or identify new knowledge and to enhance scholarship on the part of the faculty as supportive of, rather than competing with, our involvements with students.<br><br>I hope all members of our faculty are clearly aware of the tremendous support they and the university receive from the Church. I think we are. This is not just because our leaders are generous, as they certainly are, but because they wish us to completely and fully understand and support our mission priorities. An important component of our mission is the teaching of and learning about advancing the frontiers of knowledge and understanding in each of our disciplines. It is our conviction that without our faculty members being personally involved in their own continued learning and investigational activities, they cannot be the best possible teachers, mentors, and models for the outstanding students who come under their influence at BYU.<br><br>Some have questioned whether or not it is reasonable or even possible to accomplish excellence in teaching, inquiry, and citizenship all at the same time. Admittedly this can be and often is daunting. Candidly, it is also being demonstrated as possible by more than a few of our terrific faculty members. Certainly we should not, and do not, have exactly the same quantitative standards for our people as another institution might have for its faculty who have little or no other responsibilities. In this, our BYU-wide productivity does not surprise us. On the other hand, we cannot, and must not, compromise on the qualitative aspects of the creative work that we do here. It must also be acknowledged that accurate assessment of the quality of creative and research work is not possible without sufficient quantity to judge.<br><br>As President Jeffrey R. Holland and others have said, we will not do everything at BYU, but what we do, we will do superbly well. Because you are heavily involved in teaching and mentoring, we will perhaps not see as many journal articles or books published each year as we might see at another excellent university--but the significance of the contributions must always be in the first rank. In almost all of our disciplines it is generally possible, with considerable agreement, to reach some consensus on what constitutes real quality and what observations really contribute.<br><br>A matter of some persistent concern to me, my colleagues in the administration, and I'm sure for the vast majority of you, is that our level of sophistication, including indices of both validity and reliability, in evaluating the quality of our teaching often lags behind what we are accustomed to seeing in our research and creative activities. I believe we are making modest progress in teaching evaluation, although I think we all agree that student evaluations and ratings--a legitimate component of our information gathering--will never be the end all in our efforts to evaluate our teaching objectively and fairly. I'm grateful to all of you who are working with us on these matters and plead for your continued efforts and thought. If there is any place in the world that ought to be at the cutting edge in identifying, assessing, and describing the best in teaching and in creating a productive learning atmosphere, it should be BYU.<br><br>If our premise that learning and teaching for both students and faculty are enhanced and promoted by developing and supporting an environment of processes of shared discovery and creative productivity, then how do we facilitate a transition from the more familiar model that views teaching as merely the transmission of known information from the teacher to the student? Again, some of you are moving in this direction wonderfully well in significantly diverse ways and in markedly different disciplines.<br><br>Likewise, in the BYU-specific case, how do we best accomplish this while incorporating our clear mandate to make all that we do also spiritually strengthening?<br><br>Our April 2008 President's Leadership Retreat focused on notions surrounding "The Best BYU Can Be in 2018" by identifying current trends and trajectories across the university and projecting where they might take us if followed for a decade into the future. Our intent was not to draw any particular conclusions. In fact, we specifically avoided doing so.<br><br>Rather, we wanted to see where we are and may be heading with respect to (1) campus buildings and physical facilities, (2) student advisement and our enriched environment, (3) technology as it may interact with campus learning and teaching, and (4) accreditation and other key issues of how BYU deals with developments in our larger, external environment.<br><br>With the coordinating leadership of Gerrit Gong and John Tanner, we gave each department chair and director, each associate dean, dean, managing and executive director, and President's Council member an electronic clicker. We invited honest, nonbinding, anonymous responses to a number of broad questions. These questions were not rigorously controlled. We did not perform systematic statistical analyses, but we did ask the current BYU leadership for a general sense of their perceptions of our likely future and priorities.<br><br>For example, the first question asked: "What's your favorite flavor of ice cream among the following flavors?"<br><br>You will be interested to know that chocolate garnered 31 percent of cast preferences, followed by rocky road (21 percent), vanilla (18percent), and butter pecan and French vanilla tied at 15 percent each.<br><br>Another question was "How many more years do you plan to work at BYU?"<br><br>Please remember that the responses were anonymous and nonbinding. Interestingly, 31percent of our current campus leadership say they plan to work one to five more years, possibly until 2013. Another 27 percent said they plan to work six to 10 more years, possibly until 2018. This suggests a strong majority (58 percent) of our leadership colleagues may retire in the coming decade. This is a wonderful reminder of how important each year is in our individual and collective seasons of stewardship and contribution.<br><br>I express great gratitude to each of you for all you do to make BYU what it is and continues to become. My reflections on your accomplishments have been inspiring and encouraging to me.<br><br>Where our preferences for ice cream flavors understandably distribute broadly and rather evenly across a sample of popular flavors, we see a much clearer pattern of response to the question "What is the feasibility of including inquiry, creativity, and research in an institution primarily characterized as an undergraduate teaching university?" To that question, 99 percent responded it is "possible"; 92 percent responded it is "practical"; and 100 percent responded it is "desirable."<br><br>The 100-percent affirmation that inquiry, creativity, and research are desirable at an institution primarily characterized as an undergraduate teaching university is nicely supported by a 99-percent response that such is also possible. And the 92-percent response that such is practical is, I believe, an honest recognition that we need to continue working together to make what we believe to be desirable and possible into practical reality.<br><br>Related are three other areas of broad interest and consensus we considered. You may recognize the statement attributed to an Irish poet that "education is not the filling of a pail but the lighting of a fire." A majority (53percent) of our campus leadership say they would like to see more emphasis on "fire"--the fueling of an "aha" curiosity and inquiry for our students.<br><br>As we discussed some of these issues, it was encouraging to me to sense very strong support for continued movement in this direction. Such support is also coupled with a high level of confidence that we can reach the heights and stature we have been challenged to achieve as we fulfill the prophecies of our prophet leaders regarding BYU. You are familiar with them, but it seems useful to reflect on two or three before moving forward.<br><br>President Kimball spoke at BYU often and had obvious love and high expectations for this university. Let me read a couple of paragraphs from his landmark "Education for Eternity" address:<br><br><i>In all the world, the Brigham Young University is the greatest institution of learning. This statement I have made numerous times. I believe it sincerely. There are many criteria by which a university can be judged and appraised and evaluated. The special qualities of Brigham Young University lie not in its bigness; there are a number of much larger universities.</i><br><br><i>It should not be judged by its affluence and the amount of money available for buildings, research, and other facilities. It should not be judged by prestige, for there are more statusful institutions as the world measures status.</i><br><br><i>The uniqueness of Brigham Young University lies in its special role--education for eternity--which it must carry in addition to the usual tasks of a university. This means concern--curricular and behavioral--for not only the "whole man" but for the "eternal man." Where all universities seek to preserve the heritage of knowledge that history has washed to their feet, this faculty has a double heritage--the preserving of knowledge of men and the revealed truths sent from heaven.</i> [Spencer W. Kimball, "Education for Eternity," pre-school address to BYU faculty and staff, 12 September 1967, 1–2]<br><br>President Kimball also said, "Many of us have had dreams and visions of the destiny of this great Church university" ("Education for Eternity," 12). He then went on to quote President John Taylor, who said in 1879:<br><br><i>You will see the day that Zion</i> [including BYU] <i>will be as far ahead of the outside world in everything pertaining to learning of every kind as we are today in regard to religious matters. You mark my words, and write them down, and see if they do not come to pass.</i> [<i>JD</i> 21:100 (13 April 1879)]<br><br>Incidentally, it was the same President John Taylor who said the following to the founders of what is today known as Snow College: "Whatever you do, be choice in your selection of teachers. We do not want infidels to mould the minds of our [students]" (<i>JD</i> 24:168–69 [19 May 1883]). In this I think we have been faithful, currently and historically.<br><br>Recently President Henry B. Eyring mentioned his strong belief, and that of the Brethren, that the most important thing we do at BYU is to attract, recruit, and retain the right faculty. He opined, and I concur, that the faculty has never been better than what we have currently, and for this I express both commendation and appreciation to all involved in this most important activity for BYU now and in the future.<br><br>Another area of broad BYU interest and consensus is that we feel both opportunity and responsibility to help students become "bilingual." As President Spencer W. Kimball, Elder Neal A. Maxwell, and others have so eloquently put it, we want to help equip our students to speak the language of their disciplines and the world while they are learning the language of the gospel as their mother tongue. Our citizenship will always be in the kingdom of the Lord, even though our passports may contain visas allowing travel throughout the world of ideas (see Bruce C. Hafen, "All Those Books, and the Spirit, Too!" BYU Annual University Conference address, 26 August 1991, 2).<br><br>A third area of broad campus interest and consensus is related to the first two. It is that a majority (51 percent) say we need to continue aligning expectations and measures of teaching, scholarship, and citizenship. Where and how do we define each, measure each, and take each into account in decisions made, for example, with respect to faculty rank and status? Some of the most difficult decisions we make relate to rank and status. While each case is individual, and we of course do not comment on individual cases, let me simply say again: At BYU we value teaching. We value scholarship. We value citizenship. We consider each and all to be essential for BYU to achieve the lofty goals established for this special place.<br><br>We are not asking or suggesting that accomplishments should be the same or look the same for everyone. This cannot and should not be the case. But we hope that our entire university community will embrace these values aswell.<br><br>This, then, is our context. We want to help students kindle curiosity and the fire of inquiry and to become "bilingual." And we would like to identify, define, and elaborate a desirable, possible, and practical role for inquiry, creativity, and research integral to learning and teaching at our primarily undergraduate teaching and learning university.<br><br>If you are tracking with me, you might at this juncture ask, "We agree with all that has been said. How are we going to contribute to accomplishing what has been envisioned for BYU?" That is a great question, and a part of me wishes that I could give a clear, succinct, and insightful answer that would make further thought or discussion of the matter unnecessary. Happily, the other part of me realizes, as do most of you, that it is in the processes and activities of thinking, deliberating, discussing, testing, trying, changing, working, praying, and listening to each other and the Spirit that we make the heaven-intended progress that we must make. Learning "line upon line, precept upon precept" (D&amp;amp;C 98:12) is more than a catchy scriptural phrase. It is the process that each of us, and certainly this institution, must go through to reach our eternal goals.<br><br>While I don't, and believe I shouldn't, have an exact, undeviating formula to take us where we need to go, I do have great confidence in the process that most of you understand doctrinally as well as I do. The challenge for the great majority who intellectually and even spiritually understand the process is still the hard work of actual application.<br><br>As a youth, I was never accused of being one with an unusual command of scriptural quotations. In that, at least, I have been consistent throughout my entire life. I do, however, remember vividly a Mutual theme that we all memorized as teens. It has stayed with me for frequent recall ever since. You all know these words of Nephi:<br><br><i>I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</i> [1Nephi 3:7]<br><br>Taking the words of the prophets seriously, as we all do, I'm convinced that we have been "commanded" to do our part in causing BYU to become what it must become to reach its manifest destiny. It was a wise and doctrinally correct Church leader who said something to the effect that it is the responsibility of prophets to prophesy and the responsibility of the rest of us to see that the prophecies are fulfilled.<br><br>As a young missionary, one of the first scriptural passages I memorized was this well-recognized and oft-quoted scripture:<br><br><i>Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</i><br><br><i>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</i> [Proverbs 3:5–6]<br><br>Over the years I believe my understanding of this passage has improved without lessening the comfort or confidence it brought to my young heart and mind. The need to trust in the Lord without reservation or qualification is clear. What I perhaps did not appreciate initially as well as I do today is that we are notto exclude our own understanding. Itis absolutely necessary, as a couple of other passages point out, but we do not lean on it or give it precedence over the direction that comes from God in the context of revelation or inspiration.<br><br>Remember the Lord's rebuke to Oliver Cowdery onthis point and also understand that the principle is much more broad than only scriptural translation:<br><br><i>Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me.</i><br><br><i>But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</i><br><br><i>But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of thought that shall cause you to forget the thing which is wrong.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 9:7–9]<br><br>I would humbly suggest that these doctrinal and scriptural insights have direct application to our work at this university, particularly in dealing with issues like the relationships between teaching, appropriate inquiry or research, and citizenship that may seem to be paradoxical, oxymoronic, or the stuff of conundrums.<br><br>We might profit by considering five principles of gospel foundation that relate inquiry, creativity, and research within an environment of lifelong learning, teaching, and service.<br><br>First, we see the relationship of knowledge and the gospel as very broad, very deep, and very inclusive. We believe all real knowledge is part of the gospel, even while we also caution, as Professor Henry Eyring, the famous chemist father of our current President Henry B. Eyring, related his own father's advice: "In this Church you don't have to believe anything that isn't true" (in Henry Eyring, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1978/10/my-fathers-formula?lang=eng">My Father's Formula</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> October 1978, 29; also in Henry Eyring, <i>Reflections of a Scientist</i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1983], 6–7).<br><br>Second, we are enjoined to "seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118).<br><br>Third, we see reason and revelation as compatible, complementary, and often mutually self-reinforcing.<br><br>Fourth, we recognize that our greatest teachers, the prophets, are also our greatest learners--by definition those who bring forth new understanding of greatest worth. Those who have learned how to inquire properly of the Lord, when appropriately authorized to do so, share what they learn. They teach with great clarity, fervor, testimony, and skill.<br><br>Fifth, we see inquiry, creativity, and research at the heart of an eternal plan where individuals learn by their own study and experiences as part of their relationship with a loving and all-knowing Heavenly Father.<br><br>At BYU there are specific applications of these foundational principles of inquiry, creativity, and research.<br><br>First, knowing that light and knowledge from all fields come from God, we therefore try to establish a focus. As Elder Dallin H. Oaks once put it:<br><br><i>We are concerned with behavior and consider personal worthiness an essential ingredient of our educational enterprise. This concern stems from our knowledge that we learn best when we are in harmony with the commandments of Him who is the source of all truth.</i> ["<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/dallin-h-oaks_formula-success-byu/">The Formula for Success at BYU</a>," BYU devotional address, 11 September 1979]<br><br>This character-based model of inquiry, creativity, and research rewards diligence, faith, study, and devoted effort when included in all aspects of our own learning and teaching and of those of our students as well. This is also why we place such emphasis on ecclesiastical worthiness and endorsement for new and continuing students, faculty, and staff. It is a direct link between the BYU mission, aims, and Honor Code.<br><br>As you are well aware, against the backdrop of general trends in higher education in this and other countries, part of what makes BYU unique is our determined efforts to keep learning, teaching, and moral values connected and tied to religious faith.<br><br>In a recent conversation with a senior government official of another nation, I was asked what makes BYU different from other American universities. He knew of our excellent academic reputation but also admitted to concerns about his perceptions of America's "liberal" or "overly permissive" society. He expressed appreciation for America's remarkable achievements in research and would like to adopt them in his own nation, but he also expressed the strong desire to not lose their own culture and values.<br><br>My efforts to summarize briefly a lengthy conversation on what is unique about BYU in the world of American higher education led me to the explanation I gave to my new friend. I reported that we are established on and absolutely committed to some basic values that do not change at BYU. In addition to those values shared with this man regarding such things as integrity, respect for the importance of family in society, and the necessity of the rule of law is that continued learning for everyone forever is a basic tenet we follow and one we gain from our sponsoring institution, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He seemed pleased with the answer and could see the tremendous value of always learning, always trying to improve, always trying to find a better way, and yet never abandoning the bedrock values and truths that have stood the test of time.<br><br>In an earlier age, the phrase "a gentleman and a scholar" (or "a lady of refinement and education") was meant to praise individuals who appropriately combined societal grace and etiquette with learning. Derek Bok, the former president of Harvard, observed:<br><br><i>Until the Civil War, colleges in the United States were linked to religious bodies and . . . were deliberately organized to pursue two important objectives: training the intellect and building character.</i> [<i>Our Underachieving Colleges: A Candid Look at How Much Students Learn and Why They Should Be Learning More</i> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2006), 12–13]<br><br>We at BYU do not seek to keep the linkage between learning and moral character as merely a matter of tradition. We believe the best learning and teaching are linked causally, not casually, with the foundational principles that infuse inquiry, creativity, and research in the most open and free learning and inquiring environments. Each are means and ends and are ultimately mutually supportive.<br><br>Second, we are based on firm foundational principles and therefore are quite pragmatic in our commitment to prepare students for a vast and rapidly changing world. We want each student to be firmly anchored in enduring gospel values even while they learn to tack with constantly adapting skills and information to meet changing discipline, professional, family, and community demands in a rapidly transforming world.<br><br>Third, we recognize and value the need for academic discipline mastery, the accretive or accumulation process of understanding. Much learning is layered on previous understanding and comes "line upon line, precept upon precept" (D&amp;amp;C 98:12), while most epiphanies come only as a result of the discipline of hard work. Yet we all know that simply learning facts and figures, essential as they are, is also not enough.<br><br>Thus I also want to suggest that each of us considers placing an even greater emphasis on shifting our focus from the transmittal of knowledge to enhanced learning and teaching by active involvement in both the discovery and creation of new knowledge. This builds from a double truth.<br><br>On the one hand, there is no single formula for personal inquiry. Each of us will inquire, create, and research in our own way. Yet, on the other hand, all successful personal inquiry involving knowledge revealed from God reflects the same source of truth. The approaches may be somewhat different, but theultimate source of understanding is the same for all. One of the great missions of this university is for each of us to model in all we do every day with students and others the truth that we must do all we can to inquire, create, research, learn, teach, manage, and serve knowing our best efforts may be rewarded with inspiration and knowledge from God.<br><br>What infuses all of this is also our understanding that inquiry, creativity, and research are ultimately not zero-sum competitive universes. Indeed, they are constituent, component, mutually supportive, and reinforcing parts of learning and teaching.<br><br>Some of this will be enhanced by emphasis on cross-disciplinary, synthetic thinking. This includes integrative, critical, and deep analytical thinking. This becomes sound reasoning and the cultivation of that rare but highly prized quality of good judgment.<br><br>What might be some of the programmatic manifestations of our emphasis on inquiry, creativity, and research as integral to our commitment of appropriately balanced teaching, scholarship, creative works, and citizenship here at BYU?<br><br>First, we recognize that each member of the faculty, staff, administration, and student body has the obligation to learn from those who have gone ahead and to then add to that knowledge. This is the process where we each accumulate and we each contribute. We should not reinvent that which has been done already, even as we recognize in the seemingly familiar, new dimensions or perspectives.<br><br>Second, it is logical and also prophetic that the Latter-day Saints should contribute in every field based on revealed knowledge. What is true for individuals who learn and teach together is also true for peoples and institutions dedicated to learning and teaching: there is mutual understanding, mutual edification or enlargement, and thereby mutual joy and rejoicing over results (see D&amp;amp;C 50). This is because the gospel encompasses everything, because revelation flows in every field, and because no one individual or people should be more intent on learning and bringing forth increased and new knowledge and understanding than the Latter-day Saints.<br><br>Third, the prophecies that the Latter-day Saints will contribute in many fields depend on individuals fulfilling the prophecies and thus making them true. This casts an even greater light on the role of Brigham Young University. Knowing no one generation of scholars will obtain all the light and knowledge the Lord will shine forth as part of continuing revelation underscores the need for us to train each succeeding generation to inquire, create, and research by the light of revelation in addition to their own best efforts.<br><br>BYU scholars will broaden and deepen theknowledge base of the world. Of equal significance, however, is that BYU faculty, staff, and administration will also teach by example the next generation--and through them subsequent generations--how to inquire, create, and research in the light of the gospel.<br><br>We must not think of BYU as only a teaching institution or as only a learning institution. We must think of BYU as a multigenerational learning and teaching institution where inquiry, creativity, and research are part of how and what we as learners and teachers ourselves teach and learn.<br><br>Fourth, learning to love learning is thus also a key. As Elder Bednar taught at last April's commencement, learning how to learn is part of education for eternity. Here, too, there is an interesting paradox. Great BYU professors are always learning. Our danger is not generally professors who are unprepared; rather it is the relatively few faculty members who are content to believe they already know enough. Happily, I think there are not many who may use the same lecture notes and approaches repeatedly with little reference to how the world or their students may be changing.<br><br>You've heard before that it is not what you know but what you know that is no longer true that is dangerous. For most of my life I was sure Pluto was not only a planet but the planet in our solar system farthest from the sun.<br><br>Of course, taken at face value, we derive the logical and true notion that the more we know, the more we don't know--making humility the entry to knowledge but also the consequence of ongoing, continuing inquiry, creativity, and research.<br><br>Fifth, everyone at BYU can see themselves as a learner and teacher. It is in this spirit that we commend those without formal faculty appointments who help students outside the classroom through work experiences. This includes annually some 13,000 student employees who not only receive more than $80 million in student wages but who also have the opportunity to learn life skills. No one is doing a job only to get it done, although such is essential. Every interaction with a student is a way for him or her to be trained. Thank you all for being so careful and so caring as you help our young people acquire valuable skills when they thought they were working only formoney.<br><br>The characteristics of great learners are the same for great teachers. There are "dynamic tensions" or seeming paradoxes that characterize the thinking of great learners, great teachers, and those great at creative works, inquiry, and research. Why don't I dissolve in the bathtub or melt in the sun? Why do babies smile and dogs wag their tails? Why do a few people have perfect pitch or effortlessly wax poetic? Many of us love to teach beginning undergraduates because they often ask basic, seemingly uninformed questions. After they have been "educated" for a few years and become postdocs, the questions more typically come from their reading, which is usually reflective of the thinking already established in the field. In my judgment, one of the marks of the great teacher-learner is the ability to continue to ask the seemingly nave questions in the face of a store of knowledge that might be very impressive to others.<br><br>Sixth, learning, teaching, and research (including creative work and inquiry broadly) at BYU can be self-reinforcing. It includes mentoring not only with students but also between and among faculty members themselves. It may be manifest in student participation in first-rate publications and presentations. It often is demonstrated in new approaches in the classroom where a successful course is made even better with helpful feedback from students and peers. Perhaps the most tangible evidence is the intense satisfaction that comes when one recognizes that she or he has had a role in the tremendous success of a student, knowing that the student, in turn, is likely to continue the multigenerational sequence of substantive learning, teaching, sharing, and inquiry.<br><br>How do we really establish effectual self-examination and self-analysis? Institutionally, we have established processes and procedures for rank and status evaluation and unit reviews. We have made some progress, and all of this must continue to improve.<br><br>We also must ask ourselves individually how we assess our own performances. We do not want vanity or complacency; we do need self-awareness that is capable of change. This, itself, is a process of self-inquiry. It will require hard work, creativity, and perhaps some detailed, consequential personal research. We are likely to be beneficiaries ourselves from such a process, but we are most likely to succeed if our intent is to benefit our students.<br><br>In a broad sense, all of this will be a topic for my fall college visits. Last year I found it inspirational and valuable to hear from colleagues across campus the reasons and accounts of why they and you came to BYU. We heard from members of the LDS faith and from those of other traditions. We heard from those concluding long and productive careers, from those just joining BYU, and from those inbetween.<br><br>In that same spirit, with more details to follow, my hope is that we can as colleagues across campus think faithfully and diligently together about how we can make inquiry, creativity, and research a more effective part of how we not only transmit known information but, more important, how we enhance teaching by participating personally in the process of discovery and the creation of new knowledge. By definition, such occurs whenever real learning and teaching take place--another reason Iso strongly believe we are ultimately describing positive-sum additive elements, not zero-sum competitive elements. To repeat, we are talking about symbiotic, constituent parts of the same universe, not competing universes.<br><br>I end where I began, by thanking you for being part of the great venture and adventure we call Brigham Young University and by looking forward in taking the next steps together as we make ourselves and Brigham Young University the very best we can be.<br><br><i>Cecil O.

<h1> in the Light - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Today I shall bifurcate my talk between status report and message on the conference theme: "In thy light shall we see light" (Psalm 36:9). In doing so, I am reminded of a story from my father-in-law's first tour of duty as mission president. When the assistants would introduce him and my mother-in-law to speak at zone conference, they would often say something like this: "Sister Winder will now give us an inspirational message. She will be followed by instruction from the president." Always ready to see the humor in life and laugh at himself, my father-in-law began to refer to his wife as "the inspiration of the mission" and to himself as "the information." In the past I have leaned toward inspiration over information. Today I would like to correct the balance by focusing on information sharing in this first section of my remarks.<br><h2><b>Report on BYU</b></h2><br>Last year I spoke of BYU as "a house of dreams." I mentioned prophecies and visions that have punctuated our history, including seemingly extravagant prophetic statements made by President Spencer W. Kimball during the university's centennial in 1975. He spoke of BYU's becoming a "refining host" for students who will be "brilliant stars . . . in all the scholarly graces" and an "educational Everest ... because of the unique light BYU can send forth into the educational world."<sup>1</sup> One cannot but wonder how BYU is doing against these lofty expectations, which lie heavily upon us as a call to strenuous effort rather than as an occasion for self-congratulation. It's clear to me that we have not yet fulfilled our "rendezvous with [prophetic] history"<sup>2</sup> of which President Kimball spoke, nor yet scaled the summit of our educational Everest. We still stand on this side of prophecy and labor up steep slopes toward pinnacles of excellence. But it is also clear that we are moving forward and upward. This is encouraging indeed. Let me recount why I feel encouraged.<br><h2><strong><i>Scholarship</i></strong></h2><br>Consider first our progress in scholarship. If one takes the long view, there is no question that since President Kimball's centennial address, BYU has made great strides in scholarship. Publications authored by BYU faculty are reported in the Web of Science, which accesses the Science Citation Index, the Social Science Citation Index, and the Arts and Humanities Citation Index. These include 9,300 scholarly journals in physical and life sciences, engineering, social sciences, and humanities. The trend line at BYU is impressive and bespeaks the scholarly maturation of the faculty (see appendix A).<br><br>Likewise, if we look at our own self-reported data since we began collecting it over a decade ago, we see rising numbers of critically reviewed publications and presentations and juried performances (see appendix B).<br><br>Similarly, over the past few years BYU has experienced modest increases in both the activity and productivity indices across the university as a whole, with dramatic increases in some colleges. Since 2004, the average activity rate across campus has risen from just under 60 percent to 70 percent. And in some units the activity rate--that is the number of faculty who publish or present at least one scholarly or creative work during the year--is now over 90 percent--or nine out of 10 faculty. Our productivity is also up, from just under two to nearly two and a half scholarly and creative products per faculty per year (see appendix C).<br><br>Much more important than these quantitative gains are the indications that faculty appear to be producing qualitatively stronger, more consequential research and creative work. When the data is probed by discipline, deans and chairs often report that faculty are increasingly publishing in high-impact journals and major university presses and that their work is being cited and frequently receiving recognition. I am encouraged by the signs I see of quantitative and qualitative growth in scholarship. I compliment you for the good work you are doing.<br><br>Now, along with this good news, I need also to note a couple of concerns: Our external funding to date in 2008 lags behind where we were at this point in time in each of the past three years. Grant applications are also down. We are not sure why. In addition, performance in scholarly activity and quality is at times uneven both across departments in similar disciplines and within departments. So we still have ample room for improvement.<br><br>Even so, while we have not yet reached our full potential, there is much to celebrate on the research front. Most trend lines are up. More important, we are making strides in embedding student learning firmly into our research and creative activity. One piece of evidence for this may be seen in how we spend research dollars. Though there are no national data to draw on, from the information we have been able to coax out of other universities, it is clear that BYU spends proportionally more of its external funding on students than do other universities--far more. This is by design. Our research model encourages faculty to involve students--both undergraduate and graduate students, who, by the way, often play key roles at BYU in mentoring undergraduates. A remarkable 75 percent of the external funding expended annually on students goes to undergraduates. BYU also supplements external funding for faculty-mentored student research with significant infusions of internal funding from ORCA and MEG grants, donor-funded chairs, and other discretionary college funds.<br><br>I am delighted with the success of our mentored student research initiative at BYU. Let me cite representative statistics on mentoring that I learned about in resource planning from two colleges. The College of Life Sciences reported that 827 students participated in a mentored research project, 531 students coauthored on 234 abstracts and academic presentations, and 301 students were coauthors on 165 peer-reviewed published papers. The College of Physical and Mathematical Sciences reported similar activity with almost 550 undergraduate students participating in a mentored project and over 104 papers with undergraduate student coauthors. Likewise, I was thrilled by the impressive student creative work reported by Stephen Jones, the dean of the College of Fine Arts and Communications. I wish that I had time to share the dean's presentation about the accomplishments of students in animation, communication, visual arts, music, and theater and media arts.<br><br>The achievement of our students from all across campus at times can be as breathtaking as it is heartwarming. Surely many of these students stand in the vanguard of the "brilliant stars" President Kimball predicted would arise from BYU.<br><br>The most exciting news for me in these reports on mentoring is that more and more faculty are seeing their scholarship as an opportunity to hone, polish, and lift their most able students. Mentored research is even taking hold in my own college, the College of Humanities, which does not have a robust indigenous tradition of coauthorship. Notice that there are precious few coauthored poems and novels; scholarly articles and books are also generally written solo. Nevertheless, the College of Humanities is beginning to think about ways to reconceptualize scholarship so as to involve students more directly in faculty research. I applaud this. I myself recently published my first coauthored article with a student and have another nearly completed.<br><h2><strong><i>Teaching</i></strong></h2><br>Note how this brief report on scholarship ineluctably leads to consideration of activities that sound a lot like intense forms of teaching. This is as it should be at BYU, for BYU is a university where research supports teaching. BYU is fast becoming what is sometimes called a "learning university." This new paradigm tends to break down the old antagonism between research and teaching. As Ken Bain observes in his book <i>What the Best College Teachers Do:</i><br><br><i>Rather than thinking in terms of the traditional dichotomy of research and teaching, a separation that often paralyzed higher education in the twentieth century, we can begin to think of ourselves as a learning university concerned with the learning of both faculty (research) and students (teaching) and the ways in which the learning of one can benefit the other.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>I am sometimes asked to describe the relationship between teaching and research at BYU; sometimes the questioner believes that one or the other is being slighted--take your pick which one. At the midyear university leadership conference, I was invited to discuss this issue. I described what I regard as the emerging educational paradigm at BYU asalearning university.<br><br>I contrasted what I call an "instructor" model with a "mentor" pedagogical model. In an instructor model, faculty function primarily as informed dispensers of knowledge to an uninformed recipient, the student. The task of the one is to dispense knowledge, generally acquired previously during an advanced degree. The task of the other is to receive knowledge for the purpose of obtaining a degree. In this model, scholarship and teaching tend to be regarded as two distinct products or activities in one's professional life.<br><br>However, it is otherwise in what I call a mentor model. Mentors see themselves as occupying a continuum with their charges; they are coparticipants in a quest for lifelong learning. One is an apprentice learner and the other a master learner, but both are active learners and see each other primarily in this light. The task of the master is to develop the apprentice not only by instructing but also by modeling learning. In a mentoring model, scholarship and students--or, put another way, learning and learners--are linked "products" or "outcomes" of faculty work.<br><br>Now these paradigms are not mutually exclusive. In many ways the instructor paradigm remains embedded in the mentoring paradigm since formal instruction is still required and since in both paradigms faculty still have to negotiate competing demands on their time occasioned by teaching and research commitments. Still, it is salutary to understand that at BYU our teaching and research missions are intended to be integrated and mutually reinforcing. As the only university in the CES system simultaneously tasked with a teaching and research mission, BYU seeks faculty who are a triple threat in citizenship, teaching, and scholarship. Such faculty will regard pupils as well as publications as a proper, if not indeed principal, product and purpose of their scholarly and creative activity.<br><br>I like the mentored-research initiative because it fits our model so well and because itevidently blesses our students. I am not sure, however, what the campus carrying capacity is for mentored research. In a few areas we may be nearly at capacity. But in the broader definition of mentoring, there is plenty of room for improvement at BYU. If we were mentoring our students better, fewer would report that they knew no faculty well enough to ask him or her to write letters of recommendation. More students would have enriching interactions with faculty outside of class. More would report satisfaction with formal and informal faculty advisement. And likely more students would receive prestigious awards because they had been personally encouraged and coached.<br><br>As I have watched the Olympics, I have been struck with the importance of a great coach in the development of great athletes. Our students--many of them--have the potential to be "brilliant stars," but they too need a faculty coach who sees their potential and who is patient, persistent, demanding, and loving enough to bring it out in them. I am persuaded that we can become a Liang Chow or a Bob Bowman to the promising protégés who come under our influence at a formative age with the potential for greatness. We can be a great coach in the lives of future stars. We can also be great coaches for those who may never star but who will play important roles on the Lord's team. We can be better mentors.<br><br>Nevertheless, I am encouraged by evidence that we are doing well by many students to help them along the path toward advanced degrees. BYU is a major undergraduate incubator for those who go elsewhere for PhDs. Some of you will have seen data from the 2006 National Science Foundation study that identifies BYU as number eight in the world of the top 10 feeder institutions for newly minted PhDs. BYU is number five if one counts only U.S. universities. Among ourselves, we sometimes call this the "PhD Incubator Study."<sup>4</sup> Likewise, we are among themost prolific universities in the country interms of placing students in professional programs--law, business, medicine, dentistry, etc. I am grateful to you for preparing these students academically, as well as to our recently restructured Preprofessional Advisement Center for shepherding them through the application process.<br><br>One way we can help place our students, stimulate faculty, and share BYU's unique light with others is by bringing distinguished visiting scholars to campus to discuss their work and otherwise interact with students and faculty. These contacts have proved very effective in lifting the level of accomplishment for departments that have cultivated them and in sharing the spirit and light that is available here on campus with colleagues who don't know us well. To encourage more of this, my office will provide each department one-time funding for bringing visitors to campus in your disciplines. More information will be available soon through your deans.<br><br>Similarly, we continue to try to upgrade university forums, which together with devotionals form an important part of a BYU education. I note with gratitude that forum attendance is up a bit--though it still falls well below where it should be. Note the list of fall forum and devotional speakers in your program. Some remarkable speakers are scheduled for this year. May I again encourage you to attend forums and devotionals. It will not only enhance your own BYU experience but also enrich your interactions with students and colleagues as you attend together and make the talks part ofclassroom and water-cooler conversations.<br><br>We are also trying to improve classroom teaching. We now give greater attention than ever to faculty peer review of teaching, both in rank and status and in annual faculty stewardship interviews. The Center for Teaching and Learning has actively seized its mandate to improve teaching and learning since it was reorganized a little over a year ago. Its popular Web site and staff are often drawn upon by faculty to improve teaching and learning. Likewise, the new dean of undergraduate education has enthusiastically embraced a charge to deepen learning in our already strong honors and general education programs. I see many forces being mobilized all across campus to improve teaching and learning.<br><br>Happily, we have recently experienced a bump in student teaching evaluations. We are not sure yet how to interpret this. This rise preceded the recent decision to share learning indicators with students, so it could not have been caused by that. It does, however, correspond roughly to the time when the university began to develop learning outcomes for each program and may be related to this campuswide collective effort to define and measure what we want our students to learn in their programs. Under the direction of associate academic vice president Jeff Keith, a university task force will be convened to undertake a careful review of the student ratings instrument. His task force will include representatives from each college and at-large experts in evaluation, measurement, and assessment.<br><h2><strong><i>Assessment</i></strong></h2><br>Speaking of assessment, I echo the president in expressing profound gratitude for your remarkable effort to embrace assessment. Gratefully, BYU satisfied the initial expectations of our regional accrediting body, which came on a return visit. However, I trust that everyone understands that this initial pass does not satisfy the requirement for ongoing assessment and improvement. Assessment is an ongoing expectation, not a one-time event. Remember what I said when we started on this campuswide initiative: Assessment must not become our Potemkin village, a hollow faade designed to impress inspectors. We must build a substantive structure in which we do the daily work of the university. Evidence-based improvement needs to become part of our regular way of doing business. This year is a time for us to consolidate what we have learned and to begin the truly difficult task of adjusting programs according to evidence of student learning.<br><br>I commend you for your ongoing effort in assessment. It is appreciated by more than the Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges. Students have enthusiastically welcomed your effort to state clearly and succinctly what you expect them to learn in each program. Some of you may have seen the video BYU students produced, which was on the BYU News Web site and showcased at the 2008 Higher Education Summit in Chicago. And you heard President Samuelson describe the interest in our wiki site on BYU's learning outcomes. By last month the site had received over a quarter of a million hits.<sup>5</sup><br><br>Well, I feel very much like these remarks are beginning to drift into an information-only talk--the very kind I have eschewed in previous years. To stop the drift, let me end this report section of the talk by mentioning three more developments of general interest and then move to a message on the conference theme.<br><h2><strong><i>Compensation</i></strong></h2><br>I reminded you last year of President Kimball's remark that BYU<br><br><i>is not the place for mercenaries. . . . Your salary, which we hope is adequate, should be incidental andyour grand and magnificent obsession would be the youth and their growth.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>By the same token, President Kimball quoted approvingly President John Taylor's counsel to the founders of what is today known as Snow College:<br><br><i>Procure the services of competent teachers. Some people say, we cannot afford to pay them. You cannot afford not to pay them.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>These twin statements capture the posture of the board toward faculty compensation at BYU. They expect a spirit of sacrifice to attend employment at BYU; at the same time, they provide funding that is both adequate and amazingly stable. Guided by this philosophy, over the past couple of years we have taken steps to reallocate some existing resources toward faculty salaries. Working closely with your deans, we have made targeted adjustments, rewarding superior performance in ways that, in the aggregate, bring overall faculty salaries nearer to board-approved market benchmarks. This has not eliminated the spirit of sacrifice that should attend work at BYU, but it has eased the sacrifice somewhat. We are so blessed, so very blessed.<br><br>I was reminded again of how truly blessed we are when I examined a salary book from BYU's early history showing an annual salary in 1921 for full professors and deans to be $2,633 with modest increases each year following. Then, in the early thirties, it dipped back down <i>below</i> their 1921 salaries--not recovering until the early forties to the same level of salary they had once enjoyed in 1921. We have not yet been called upon to sacrifice to the same extent as our forebears, nor do I expect a salary cut such as was experienced during the Great Depression. Nevertheless, we need to be prepared to face the challenges of our day, whatever they may be, in a manner worthy of our forebears' legacy of sacrifice. I am persuaded that sacrifice and consecration are vital in preserving the Spirit of the Y.<br><h2><strong><i>BYU Broadcasting</i></strong></h2><br>As President Samuelson mentioned this morning, BYU Broadcasting has greatly expanded since the old days when it was essentially a Wasatch Front television and radio station. Its reach is now worldwide. BYU Broadcasting now comprises five radio channels and eight TV channels, including BYU-TV International, which was launched a year ago last March and is broadcast in Spanish and Portuguese. BYU Broadcasting is transmitting light from BYU to the world, touching lives remote from campus with our work.<br><br>This is an exciting time--but also a challenging one. One challenge for those of us whose scholarly and creative work does not lend itself naturally to outreach--as it does in our performance programs--will be to make sure that we continue to do the fundamental and sometimes unglamorous research on which academic outreach must be based and not substitute self-publication for peer-reviewed publication.<br><h2><strong><i>Educating the Soul: Our Zion Tradition of Learningand Faith</i></strong></h2><br>This past week the university (at long last!) opened an exhibit in the Joseph F. Smith Building called "Educating the Soul: Our Zion Tradition of Learning and Faith." It is housed in stunning exhibit space that has not been accessible to the campus or public until now. The gallery is bathed in light, with spectacular views of the campus and mountains. In the second part of my talk I shall share personal reflections about learning in the light prompted by visiting this light-filled exhibit that tells the story of how the Latter-day Saints have sought to see the light of truth both by the natural light of reason and by the spiritual light of revelation. I'll give you a sort of virtual tour. You can take your own actual tours starting immediately after this meeting and thereafter on any weekday.<br><h2><b>A Virtual Tour of the Exhibit</b></h2><br><h2><strong><i>The Savior as the Source of Light</i></strong></h2><br>When I visit the exhibit, I am reminded by its very structure that the Savior is the source of light and truth as well as the Master Teacher whose example must ever guide us here. Even the courtyard fountain consisting of water gushing from massive rocks reminds me of Christ, as does the oculus set in the exact center of the exhibit hall ceiling. Both the sunlight streaming through the oculus and all spatial relationships in the exhibit radiate from this point of light. One enters the exhibit via a circular stairway, literally climbing toward the light radiating from the oculus. As I climb up the stairs, I think of a passage from a poem by the 17th-century poet John Donne about his struggle to find the true church:<br><br><i>On a huge hill,</i><br><i>Cragged, and steep, Truth stands, and he that will</i><br><i>Reach her, about must, and about must go.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>The ascent reminds me that learning by the light of study and faith requires strenuous effort--mental and spiritual. The Lord taught Latter-day Saints this from the first. Yet too often many assume that the Lord will reveal truth merely for the asking--as if Latter-day Saints were somehow excused from the rigorous effort required of others just because we have the gospel. Not so. There must be strenuous effort. LDS scientists, poets, composers, artists, and scholars must pay the same price as anyone else. Likewise, we are deeply indebted to those from all faiths and walks of life who have toiled away in behalf of truth and beauty. The Light of Christ is available to all people, and Latter-day Saints are expected to learn from all those who have brought light into the world. As I ascend the stairs to the gallery, this thought humbles me, inspiring gratitude and determination to work hard.<br><br>Later in the exhibit I observe replicas of textbooks used in the School of the Prophets, reminding me that even a mighty seer and translator submitted himself to the difficult discipline of language study to acquire Hebrew, German, and Greek. I am also moved by the accompanying bowl, towel, and clean linen--reminders that those who entered the School of the Prophets were to be clean. Worthiness and work: in the Lord's curriculum, these twin virtues have ever been prerequisites for learning in the light. Those who would receive light by study and faith must work and must be worthy.<br><br>As I enter the hall, I am drawn to the spectacular view of Y Mountain through a two-story glass wall and to a quiet grouping of furniture in the center of the exhibit. The furniture surrounds a small, graceful statue of Christ as shepherd, set on a table standing on a carpet designed with a vine motif. I recall President Hinckley's admonition to us, as BYU faculty, to be shepherds to our students and the Savior's injunction to graft our lives into the true vine (see John 15:1–6). All these elements of the main gallery--the oculus, the stairway, the carpet, the figure of Christ--attest to the centrality of the Savior in the Latter-day Saint quest to learn in the light.<br><h2><strong><i>Light from Temples and Towering Founders</i></strong></h2><br>Dominating the exhibits in the side halls are two huge murals facing each other: one depicting the Kirtland Temple and the other illustrating the Brigham Young Academy and Maeser Building. These murals introduce the respective themes in the south and north wings. The south wing recounts the story of establishing schools in Zion--starting from the Midwest through the migration of the Saints to these mountains--while the north wing mural tells of the rise of Brigham Young Academy and the early history of BYU. Seeing the murals together, facing each other, causes me to contemplate the relationship between LDS temples and schools. The Kirtland Temple was used as a school and is specifically referred to in scripture as "a house of learning" (D&amp;amp;C 88:119, 109:8). Likewise, the Academy buildings and the Maeser Building, along with other campus edifices, were regularly referred to in our early days as "temples of learning." There are, and ought to be, deep continuities between these houses of learning--LDS temples and Church universities. Note that the Church has always located its colleges and universities near a temple. May the day never come when it appears oxymoronic to think of BYU as a temple of learning bearing a familial resemblance to LDStemples.<br><br>Reflecting on the relationship between temples and the university, I recall a lesson learned through a sacred experience many years ago when I was working on the academic freedom committee. We put this question to the BYU Board of Trustees: Should a temple worthiness standard apply to BYU faculty as it does for all other Church employees? The answer came back emphatically "yes" in spite of the complications this might create around academic freedom-related employment issues. As I pondered the answer, I had the strong impression that the Lord wanted a consecrated faculty at BYU. He was, after all, entrusting large numbers of the youth of Zion to us. Yes, He wanted faculty who would keep the Honor Code. But if they were LDS, He wanted faculty who had made temple covenants--the very covenants that our students are learning to make and keep. This would be critical for BYU to shine with a special light and to play a role in the ongoing rolling forth of the kingdom.<br><br>As I continue to orient myself to the exhibit space, I note that the exhibits in the south wing are introduced by a display about Joseph Smith as God's student while the north wing features a display on Karl G. Maeser. By implication, the stories told in each wing seem to be part of the long shadow of these towering founding figures. Their influence on Church education continues to unfold. This reminds me that the history of education in Zion is not primarily about buildings but about people, such as Brother Joseph and Brother Maeser. Within the exhibit I discover stories, many stories, of people who have given their lives to educating Zion. I am told that these stories are not intended to idolize the founders nor to inflate their accomplishments but to make each observer feel "I can do that" and "I should do that." That is the effect on me.<br><h2><strong><i>Light from Our Pioneer Heritage</i></strong></h2><br>As I walk through the south wing, which tells of the Saints' heroic efforts to establish schools in Kirtland, Nauvoo, and the Great Basin, I am overwhelmed with the epic story of struggle and sacrifice to educate the Saints according to the pattern and principles revealed to the Prophet Joseph. It inspires me to remember the legacy of learning in the light bequeathed us by the early pioneers. After leaving the comfortable red-brick world of Nauvoo--where seemingly every home, store, and community building doubled as a school--the Saints were faced with the challenge of educating the rising generation in barren sagebrush valleys. In such circumstances, one would expect the pioneers to concentrate on mere survival. Instead, from the very first, Latter-day Saint pioneers focused their energies on culture, civilization, and education as well as on the requirements of mere subsistence. Their aim was not merely to survive but to raise up a Zion people, which meant educating and refining a rising generation. They knew, as Elder Holland put it, that<br><br><i>this Church is always only one generation away from extinction. . . . All we would have to do . . . todestroy this work is stop teaching our children forone generation.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>So they taught their children in the light.<br><br>They taught the gospel out of the scriptures, yes, but they also taught "out of the best books" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118). They taught "of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth" . . . ; [and of] wars and the perplexities of the nations" (D&amp;amp;C 88:79). They taught of "languages, tongues, and people" (D&amp;amp;C 90:15). At first they taught arithmetic and grammar in lean-to tents and around campfires, later in log homes and rudimentary schools, and eventually in impressive stake academies that rose high above treeless sagebrush valleys and red sand deserts. These academies would in time form the foundation of both the state and Church systems of higher education. Weber State, Utah State, Snow College, Dixie College, and even the University of Utah all began as Church schools.<br><br>As I take in the displays on education in pioneer Utah, I recall research that I did a few years ago for an article on Shakespeare among the early Latter-day Saints.<sup>10</sup> No other western pioneers were so committed to promulgating not only Shakespeare but also all the arts and sciences. Wallace Stegner, who grew up in a small frontier town on the Canadian prairie, tells of finding his family's two-volume edition of Shakespeare's collected plays tossed unceremoniously in the town dump. He ruefully saw this as a symbol of how much had to be discarded, how much left behind, to settle the West.<sup>11</sup><br><br>By contrast, Latter-day Saints brought with them into the wilderness not only Shakespeare but all the best books they could carry, not to mention musical and scientific instruments. All these would be needed to build up Zion. Upon arriving in the Valley of the Great Salt Lake, the pioneers quickly formed the Deseret Musical and Dramatic Society, built the Social Hall, and later built the finest theater between the Mississippi and San Francisco. Within a few years you could see more Shakespeare in Salt Lake City than anywhere between the Mississippi and the West Coast. Moreover, virtually every Mormon village in the hinterlands had a school stocked with the <i>McGuffey Reader--</i>containing quotes from Shakespeare and other famous writers--and many towns sponsored community musical and dramatic associations. I discovered that within two years of settling Cedar City, Mormon pioneers staged <i>The Merchant of Venice</i> in a log fort using blankets for curtains--a remarkable pioneer prelude to the replica Globe Theater that now stands in the shadow of the red cliffs of the old Iron Mission. This is but one example of how seriously our forebears took the scriptural injunction to seek light and wisdom out of the best books. What would they think of our opportunities to learn in the light?<br><h2><strong><i>Learning in the Light of Testimony</i></strong></h2><br>Knowing the extensive research required for me to uncover the history of Shakespeare in pioneer Utah, I am impressed by the research that informs the displays I peruse. To my knowledge, never before has the story of education in the Church been told in such a comprehensive way. Remarkably, the research, graphic designs, and artwork in the exhibit were executed largely by students. Student researchers sometimes appear in the short videos in the displays, sharing their perspectives on the topic at hand. This format works especially well for me in a video about a well-known academic freedom controversy during the Brimhall administration.<sup>12</sup> It is illuminating to see this controversy presented from a student point of view. The student commentators clearly sympathize with President Brimhall and with the students in the early 1900s caught up in the event--the beautiful white birds Brimhall dreamed of, lured to the ground and rendered incapable of flight. Our current students' reflections on this episode make me realize what was most at stake in the controversy. It was not simply what was being taught but whether it was being taught with testimony or in a cynical attempt to undermine faith. Then and now, BYU students expect to be taught with testimony. They can tolerate significant diversity of viewpoint if they know and feel that their professors are deeply devoted to the Lord and His Church.<br><br>This imperative to teach with testimony hasn't changed over the years. The same fundamentals apply. Students expect to be taught with testimony, no matter the subject, by faculty who are themselves happily grounded in the gospel, no matter their disciplines. Within these parameters, there is considerable room for viewpoint diversity. Walking through this display brings back memories of my days working on BYU's academic freedom statement and of reading the recent biography of Henry Eyring, whose example of integrating science and faith inspired generations of Latter-day Saints. Henry Eyring, though not a BYU faculty member, is exemplary of many faculty here who have taken seriously the integration of one's life as a scholar and saint.<sup>13</sup><br><h2><strong><i>Maeser's Enlightened Plan for Church Schools</i></strong></h2><br>Chief among these at BYU is Karl G. Maeser, whose influence shaped a whole generation of LDS academics: Widtsoe, Talmage, Edwin Hinckley, Alice Louise Reynolds, and a host of others who then went on to extend the Maeser influence across the Church and the generations. The exhibit properly emphasizes Maeser's influence on others. His key contribution was imparting light to others.<br><br>I have long known that Maeser's educational philosophy included welding character and academics. I have often heard anecdotes from his life. What I did not know until visiting the exhibit is that--after receiving the famous charge from Brigham Young to teach nothing, not even the alphabet or times tables, without the Spirit of God<sup>14</sup>--Maeser set down his educational philosophy for the BY Academy in writing, and his plan included a strong commitment to active student learning. The written plan is now lost, but the exhibitors located the desk where Maeser composed it and have sketched out what can be inferred about the contours of Maeser's plan. They write the following:<br><br><i>In the late spring of 1876, shortly after his arrival in Provo, Maeser received word that in a few days Brigham Young would be visiting him. President Young wanted to learn how Maeser planned to implement the charge he had given him.</i><br><br><i>Maeser sat at his desk that night to work out hisideas. Nothing came. Through the next day and the day after, he paced his office and scribbled notes. The third day, in the late afternoon, he dropped, exhausted and disheartened, to his knees.</i><br><br><i>"O Father," he pleaded, "show me the way, help me to make the plans for this great work. I cannot do it of myself."</i><br><br><i>Immediately the confusion of the preceding days was lifted, and within a few hours Maeser had written out the plan for the new school. It had come to him as an answer to prayer.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>The model Maeser developed featured mentoring by faculty who were to be role models of academic rigor and moral rectitude. Maeser's model also featured active learning by students who were expected to take responsibility for their own education and for helping other students learn. Again theexhibitors write:<br><br><i>As "the guiding rule for the teacher,"</i> [Maeser] <i>believed that "whatever can be done by the pupils, the teacher should never do himself." The system engaged the students in the Academy's daily operations, including maintaining department or classroom order, recording student performance, and mentoring younger students. Maeser instructed faculty to identify students who needed help so that competent tutors could be assigned to work with them. . . . Maeser called this the "monitorial system." It helped the students become "responsible for something outside of their own individual concerns, but . . . essential for the comfort and well-being for the whole of the little community (the school or class) of which each of them form a part."</i><sup>16</sup><br><br>Maeser formalized student peer teaching in the following way:<br><br><i>Once a week, </i>[students met in]<i> small groups todiscuss what</i> [they had studied].<i> Each </i>[discussion]<i> group was led by an older student called a repetitor. One BYA instructor observed the effectiveness of this approach: "A free-for-all discussion now took place which did more to arouse interest and rivet conviction than ten times the amount of passive listening would have done."</i><sup>17</sup><br><br>In the run up to this meeting, a phrase kept coming to me from section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants: "teach one another," "teach one another," "teach one another" (verses 77, 118). As I learn about Maeser's system, I feel confirmed in my mind that there is more we can and should do to foster active learning. This appears to be part (albeit an all-but-forgotten part) of our institutional patrimony. In both the School of the Prophets and in the Brigham Young Academy, learners were expected to "teach one another." The BYA instructor said that students learned 10 times as much by discussing and teaching each other than they would have learned by "passive listening." Interestingly, this figure just about duplicates the findings of educational researchers who have evaluated the effectiveness of teaching others on retention rates.<sup>18</sup><br><br>Now I do not regard students teaching other students, or any other mere technique for that matter, as a magic bullet for improving learning. Indeed, I have experienced some pretty ineffective classes where faculty devolved almost all responsibility for instruction to the students. Moreover, I personally still prefer to mix lecture and discussion along with other pedagogical strategies. Nor will it surprise you that, as an English teacher, one of these strategies is writing. I am a strong believer in requiring students to put their ideas into writing and to present them orally for class discussion and critique. Writing and discussing what one thinks--these constitute highly effective, time-tested active learning strategies. As Sir Francis Bacon said of education: "Reading maketh a full man; conference [i.e., conversation] a ready man; and writing an exact man."<sup>19</sup><br><br>I know of no substitute for writing and conversation for teaching critical thinking. But I also know that I learn by teaching. I learned best how to write by teaching others to write. My understanding of literature and scriptures has been immeasurably enhanced by teaching them. And I first learned to appreciate many great books of the Western tradition and many great issues that have engaged the modern world by being invited as a senior at BYU to proctor classes in these subjects for new freshmen. We learn by teaching. It is a powerful way to capture and communicate the light. So Icome away from the Maeser displays thinking about how to strengthen peer tutoring, teaching assistantships, and other opportunities for students to learn by teaching.<br><h2><strong><i>Mentoring: The Means for Passing on the Light</i></strong></h2><br>The final display I want to discuss immediately follows the display on Brother Maeser. This may be my favorite room in the exhibit. It contains rotating displays of faculty and staff at BYU up through the mid-20th century who have augmented and transmitted the light of the Y to students and colleagues. As I peruse some of the panels in the room, Isee some names that I recognize, like James Talmage, who called Karl G. Maeser "my second father,"<sup>20</sup> and Alice Louise Reynolds, who at first feared Maeser but with her sister later came to "love him as we have seldom loved anyone else."<sup>21</sup> I am reminded by these comments that <i>mentor</i> comes from the name of the surrogate father Odysseus appointed to care for his son Telemachus. To be a mentor can involve a profoundly personal and transformative relationship, comparable to that of a surrogate parent.<br><br>I also see the names of others whom I have not heard of like Brigham Thomas Higgs, who introduced the student employment program on campus, and Delbert Brigham Brown, a custodian in the Smith Fieldhouse who became a wise counselor to hundreds of students. Delbert Brown once found a student's wallet with a risqué picture in it. When a young boy came to claim it, Brother Brown took out his own wallet and showed him pictures of his wife and daughters, encouraging the boy with a budding pornography problem to tuck these kinds of pictures into his wallet and into his mind. As I read such stories, I am reminded that many unnamed individuals have kindled the light of the Y, including administrators and staff. As Joseph B. Keeler, one of Maeser's first 29 students and himself an unsung hero of our tradition, observed: "Deep down in the heart of this great school, there are noble deeds untold."<sup>22</sup> I reflect, with gratitude, on the noble deeds of our current staff and administrators who influence students for good. These include secretaries, counselors, bookkeepers, managers, advisors, custodians, and on and on. So many have played and do play formative roles in the lives of students. They brighten the light that emanates from the Y. As I think of this, I am filled with gratitude that the support side of BYU has embraced the "Big, Hairy, Audacious Goal" of giving up their slots to be used to hire additional faculty. This is simply unheard of in the academy, but it falls squarely within the tradition of mentoring honored in this room, which celebrates all mentors, great and small, who have made BYU what it is.<br><br>On the far wall is displayed "Mentoring: The Lifeblood of Our Tradition." The panels remind me that our initiatives in mentoring are not new. BYU has long been blessed by the likes of mentors such as Joseph K. Nicholes, who built a chemistry department of doctorally prepared faculty though he himself was prevented by circumstance from finishing his own PhD at Stanford; and by little Tommy Martin, who began his life as a coal miner in the English midlands and went on to excel as a teacher in the field of soil science. Tommy would select students of high potential and say, "Look here, young man, don't you know that you have some great intellectual possibilities?"<sup>23</sup> and then help them plan their careers and win fellowships. Of his former students, 150 earned advanced degrees in agronomy<sup>24</sup> and 75 were on faculties at universities throughout the United States and Canada.<sup>25</sup> His students became known across the country as "the Thomas L. Martin boys."<sup>26</sup> Reading about Joseph Nicholes, Tommy Martin, Harvey Fletcher, Florence J. Madsen, and many others confirms that we are on the right track in pursuing a mentoring model. Mentoring is a part of our patrimony.<br><br>On the way out of the exhibit, I see video clips of current faculty discussing their experiences at the Y. One particularly touched my heart. It is Mary Farahnakian, from Theatre and Media Arts, telling how she found God at BYU. She said, "I came to BYU not knowing anything, but BYU taught me not the secular education; instead I got my spiritual life. I learned who I am. BYU gave me my God." Herstory captures the experience of countless students and faculty alike, whose relationship to God has been deepened by learning in the light at BYU.<br><h2><strong><i>I Get My Light from God</i></strong></h2><br>As I walk out of the Joseph F. Smith Building and back across campus, I recall a sundial that once stood near the stairs leading down to the fieldhouse. It was a gift from the Class of 1916. Engraved on one side were the words "I get my light from God." For BYU to remain true to its finest traditions, we too must get our light from God. His is the light we are instructed to hold up to the world (see 3 Nephi 18:24). Consequently, if BYU is to shine as a city on the hill, it must ever be with reflected glory. Wemust get our light from God.<br><br>Lost in these thoughts, I look up at the mountains and recall a Scouting event I participated in years ago. Scout troops from all across Utah climbed peaks with large mirrors. In the early morning light, each troop watched for a signal from a troop on another peak. When they saw the light flash, they deployed their own mirror to pass on the signal to other Scouts on other peaks. It was a thrilling sight: light flashing from peak to peak all across the state--much like the image depicted in the movie <i>The Return of the King,</i> when Pippin lights the beacon in Gondor to rally the Riders of Rohan.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, we are like those who stand upon mountain peaks, responsible for transmitting light in these last days darkening with signs of battle before the return of the King. Having seen the light from others who have scaled similar peaks, our task is to reflect light to those on the next peak--over and over, from peak to peak, across the miles and the years until the King returns. We are light bearers in a precious tradition of learning in thelight.<br><br>I use the word <i>tradition</i> deliberately, keenly aware of its etymology. Tradition literally means something that is handed off, from the Latin <i>traditio,</i> "to hand over." As we have seen in the recent Olympic relay races, handoffs can be muffed. Batons are sometimes dropped, just as footballs are sometimes fumbled. So are traditions. Some deserve this fate, but others do not. It takes wisdom, attention, and deliberate effort to identify which traditions to preserve and to successfully pass them on to the next generation. The consequences of failure can be dire. Dropping the baton disqualifies the relay team; fumbling the football turns the initiative over to the opposition. Likewise, intergenerational institutions are always but one generation away from extinction. A successful intergenerational institution, like a 400-meter relay team or a football team, requires good handoffs. The exhibit offers an important means to pass on the best traditions of education in Zion, to keep the flame alive that has lighted the Y over the years. We plan to build it into new faculty and new student orientations and, where appropriate, into the curriculum. I again encourage you to find time to visit the exhibit and learn about our traditions, for we are all players in handing off the BYU tradition to succeeding generations.<br><br>I don't want to muff the handoff. Not infrequently I wonder how I am doing in preserving the traditions at BYU that most deserve preservation, in casting aside unproductive traditions, and in developing new traditions consistent with our mission. Have Iseen clearly what needs to be passed on, what should be developed and what should be discarded in order to burnish BYU as an institution of light? We all occupy our positions on the peaks at BYU only a brief time. May we use our moment in the sun here at BYU to learn in the light and pass on that light to others. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><h2><b>Appendix A: Publications</b></h2><br><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10251" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/png/Tanner_AUC__2008_PP01.png" alt="Tanner_AUC__2008_PP01" width="508" height="362" /><br><h2><b>Appendix B: Scholarly Productivity</b></h2><br><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10252" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/png/Tanner_AUC__2008_PP02.png" alt="Tanner_AUC__2008_PP02" width="564" height="322" /><br><br><b>Appendix C: Productivity</b><br><br><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10253" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/png/Tanner_AUC__2008_PP03.png" alt="Tanner_AUC__2008_PP03" width="518" height="299" /><br><br><i>John S.

<h1>from Liberty Jail: A Prison and a Temple - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My beloved young friends, it is a thrill for Sister Holland and for me to be with you tonight for this worldwide satellite broadcast. It's always a thrill to be in the Marriott Center. I wish it were possible for us to be in each of your individual locations, seeing you personally and being able to shake your hands. We haven't figured out a way to do that yet, but we send our love and greeting to all of you wherever you are in the world. In spite of the vastness of our global audience, we hope all of you are individually able to feel the love we have for you tonight and that each of you can gain something from our message that is applicable in your personal lives.<br><h2><b>The Prophet in Liberty Jail</b></h2><br>One of the great blessings of our assignments as General Authorities is the chance to visit members of the Church in various locations around the world and to glean from the history that our members have experienced across the globe. In that spirit I wish to share with you tonight some feelings that came to me during a Church assignment I had last spring when I was assigned to visit the Platte City stake in western Missouri, here in the United States.<br><br>The Platte City Missouri Stake lies adjacent to the Liberty Missouri Stake, now a very famous location in Church history encompassing several important Church history sites, including the ironically named Liberty Jail. From your study of Church history, you will all know something of the experience the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brethren had while imprisoned in that facility during the winter of 1838–39. This was a terribly difficult time in our history for the Church generally and certainly for the Prophet Joseph himself, who bore the brunt of the persecution in that period. Indeed, I daresay that until his martyrdom five and a half years later, there was no more burdensome time in Joseph's life than this cruel, illegal, and unjustified incarceration in Liberty Jail.<br><br>Time does not permit a detailed discussion of the experiences that led up to this moment in Church history, but suffice it to say that problems of various kinds had been building ever since the Prophet Joseph had received a revelation in July of 1831 designating Missouri as the place "consecrated for the gathering of the saints" and the building up of "the city of Zion" (D&amp;amp;C 57:1, 2). By October of 1838, all-out war seemed inevitable between Mormon and non-Mormon forces confronting each other over these issues. After being driven from several of the counties in the western part of that state and under the presumption they had been invited to discuss ways of defusing the volatile situation that had developed, five leaders of the Church, including the Prophet Joseph, marching under a flag of truce, approached the camp of the Missouri militia near the small settlement of Far West, located in Caldwell County.<br><br>As it turned out, the flag of truce was meaningless, and the Church leaders were immediately put in chains and placed under heavy guard. The morning after this arrest, two more Latter-day Saint leaders, including the Prophet's brother Hyrum, were taken prisoner, making a total of seven in captivity.<br><br>Injustice swiftly moved forward toward potential tragedy when a military "court" convened by officers of that militia ordered that Joseph Smith and the six other prisoners all be taken to the public square at Far West and summarily shot. To his eternal credit, Brigadier General Alexander Doniphan, an officer in the Missouri forces, boldly and courageously refused to carry out the inhumane, unjustifiable order. In a daring stand that could have brought him his own court-martial, he cried out against the commanding officer:<br><br><i>It is cold-blooded murder. I will not obey your order. . . . And if you execute these men, I will hold you responsible before an earthly tribunal, so help me God.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>In showing such courage and integrity, Doniphan not only saved the lives of these seven men but endeared himself forever to Latter-day Saints in every generation.<br><br>Their execution averted, these seven Church leaders were marched on foot from Far West to Independence, then from Independence to Richmond. Parley P. Pratt was remanded to nearby Daviess County for trial there, and the other six prisoners, including Joseph and Hyrum, were sent to Liberty, the county seat ofneighboring Clay County, to await trial there the next spring. They arrived in Liberty on December 1, 1838, just as winter was coming on.<br><br>The jail, one of the few and certainly one of the more forbidding of such structures in that region, was considered escape proof, and it probably was. It had two stories. The top or main floor was accessible to the outside world only by a single small, heavy door. In the middle of that floor was a trapdoor through which prisoners were then lowered into the lower floor or dungeon. The outside walls of the prison were of rough-hewn limestone two feet thick, with inside walls of 12-inch oak logs. These two walls were separated by a 12-inch space filled with loose rock. Combined, these walls made a formidable, virtually impenetrable barrier four feet thick.<br><br>In the dungeon the floor-to-ceiling height was barely six feet, and inasmuch as some of the men, including the Prophet Joseph, were over six feet tall, this meant that when standing they were constantly in a stooped position, and when lying it was mostly upon the rough, bare stones of the prison floor covered here and there by a bit of loose, dirty straw or an occasional dirty straw mat.<br><br>The food given to the prisoners was coarse and sometimes contaminated, so filthy that one of them said they "could not eat it until [they] were driven to it by hunger."<sup>2</sup> On as many as four occasions they had poison administered to them in their food, making them so violently ill that for days they alternated between vomiting and a kind of delirium, not really caring whether they lived or died. In the Prophet Joseph's letters, he spoke of the jail being a<br><br><i>hell, surrounded with demons . . . where we are compelled to hear nothing but blasphemous oaths, and witness a scene of blasphemy, and drunkenness and hypocrisy, and debaucheries of every description.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>"We have . . . not blankets sufficient to keep us warm," he said, "and when we have a fire, we are obliged to have almost a constant smoke."<sup>4</sup> "Our souls have been bowed down"<sup>5</sup> and "my nerve trembles from long confinement."<sup>6</sup> "Pen, or tongue, or angels," Joseph wrote, could not adequately describe "the malice of hell" that he suffered there.<sup>7</sup> And all of this occurred during what, by some accounts, was considered then the coldest winter on record in the state of Missouri.<br><br>It is not my purpose to make this a speech about the sorrow and difficulty these men confronted in Liberty Jail, so let me put a few photos on the screen and conclude this little introductory portion of my message. I promise I have something else in mind to say.<br><br>[A photo of Liberty Jail was shown.] Here is a photo of the jail pretty much as it stood at the time Joseph and his brethren were incarcerated there.<br><br>[Another photo of Liberty Jail was shown.] Here is a photo taken some years later when officers and historians from the Church visited the location. I'm not sure if that fellow on top is trying to get out or get in.<br><br>[A photo of a model of Liberty Jail interior reconstruction was shown.] Here is a cross section of the Church's reconstruction of the prison, which can now be seen at our visitors' center there. Note the two-story arrangement with a rope and bucket, the only link between the dungeon and the upper floor.<br><br>[A picture of the painting <i>Joseph in Liberty Jail</i> by Liz Lemon Swindle was shown.] Here is a painting by Liz Lemon Swindle showing Joseph in prayer. Note the forlorn, longing look on Joseph's face.<br><br>[A picture of the painting <i>Joseph Smith in Liberty Jail</i> by Greg Olsen was shown.] And here's a portrayal by Greg Olsen showing how Joseph may have written some of the revelations that came during this imprisonment.<br><br>[A photo of the Toronto Ontario Canada Temple was shown.] And this is my final photo, which leads me to the <i>real</i> message Ihave come to give tonight.<br><h2><b>A Prison-Temple Experience</b></h2><br>Most of us, most of the time, speak of the facility at Liberty as a "jail" or a "prison"--and certainly it was that. But Elder Brigham H. Roberts, in recording the history of the Church, spoke of the facility as a temple, or, more accurately, a "prison-temple."<sup>8</sup> Elder Neal A. Maxwell used the same phrasing in some of his writings.<sup>9</sup> Certainly it lacked the purity, the beauty, the comfort, and the cleanliness of our true temples, our dedicated temples. The speech and behavior of the guards and criminals who came there was anything but templelike. In fact, the restricting brutality and injustice of this experience at Liberty would make it seem the very antithesis of the liberating, merciful spirit of our temples and the ordinances that are performed in them. So in what sense could Liberty Jail be called a "temple"--or at least a kind of temple--in the development of Joseph Smith personally and in his role as a prophet? And what does such a title tell us about God's love and teachings, including where and when that love and those teachings are made manifest?<br><br>As we think on these things, does it strike us that spiritual experience, revelatory experience, sacred experience can come to every one of us in all the many and varied stages and circumstances of our lives if we want it, if we hold on and pray on, and if we keep our faith strong through our difficulties? We love and cherish our dedicated temples and the essential, exalting ordinances that are performed there. We thank heaven and the presiding Brethren that more and more of them are being built, giving more and more of us greater access to them. They are truly the holiest, most sacred structures in the kingdom of God, to which we all ought to go as worthily and as often as possible.<br><br>But tonight's message is that when you have to, you can have sacred, revelatory, profoundly instructive experience with the Lord in <i>any</i> situation you are in. Indeed, let me say that even a little stronger: You can have sacred, revelatory, profoundly instructive experience with the Lord <i>in the most miserable experiences of your life--</i>in the worst settings, while enduring the most painful injustices, when facing the most insurmountable odds and opposition you have ever faced.<br><br>Now let's talk about those propositions for a moment. Every one of us, in one way or another, great or small, dramatic or incidental, is going to spend a little time in Liberty Jail--spiritually speaking. We will face things we do not want to face for reasons that may not have been our fault. Indeed, we may face difficult circumstances for reasons that were absolutely right and proper, reasons that came <i>because</i> we were trying to keep the commandments of the Lord. We may face persecution; we may endure heartache and separation from loved ones; we may be hungry and cold and forlorn. Yes, before our lives are over we may all be given a little taste of what the prophets faced often in their lives. But the lessons of the winter of 1838–39 teach us that <i>every</i> experience can become a <i>redemptive</i> experience if we remain bonded to our Father in Heaven through that difficulty. These difficult lessons teach us that man's extremity is God's opportunity, and if we will be humble and faithful, if we will be believing and not curse God for our problems, He can turn the unfair and inhumane and debilitating prisons of our lives into temples--or at least into a circumstance that can bring comfort and revelation, divine companionship and peace.<br><br>Let me push this just a little further. I've just said that hard times <i>can</i> happen to us. President Joseph Fielding Smith, grandnephew of the Prophet Joseph and grandson of the incarcerated Hyrum, said something even stronger than that when he dedicated the Liberty Jail Visitors' Center in 1963. Alluding to the kind of history we've reviewed tonight and looking on the scene where his grandfather and granduncle were so unjustly held, he said perhaps such things <i>have</i> to happen--not only can they happen, perhaps they have to. Said he:<br><br><i>As I have read the history of those days, the days that went before and days that came after, I have reached the conclusion that the hardships, the persecution, the almost universal opposition</i> [toward the Church at that time] <i>were</i> necessary. <i>At any rate they became school teachers to our people. They helped to make</i> [them] <i>strong.</i><sup>10</sup><br><h2><b>Lessons from Liberty Jail</b></h2><br>Well, without trying to determine which of these kinds of experiences in our life are "mandatory" and which are "optional" but still good for us, may I suggest just a very few of the lessons learned at Liberty--those experiences that were "school teachers" to Joseph and can be to us, experiences that contribute so much to our education in mortality and our exaltation in eternity.<br><br>In selecting these lessons I note yet another kind of blessing that came out of this adversity. To make the points that I am now going to try to make in my message to you, I have drawn directly upon the revelatory words that came from the lips of Joseph Smith during this heartbreaking time, words that we now have canonized as sacred scripture in the Doctrine and Covenants. I guess we're not supposed to have favorite scriptures, and I have enough of them that you won't be able to pin me down to one or two, but certainly any list of my favorite scriptures would have to include those written from the darkness of Liberty Jail.<br><br>So what we instantly learn is that God was not only teaching Joseph Smith in that prison circumstance but He was teaching <i>all</i> of us, for generations yet to come. What a scriptural gift! And what a high price was paid for it! But how empty would our lives as Latter-day Saints be if we did not have sections 121, 122, and 123 of the Doctrine and Covenants. If you have not read them recently, I want you to read them tonight, or tomorrow at the latest--no later. That is your homework assignment, and I will be checking on you! They are contained in total on a mere six pages of text, but those six pages will touch your heart with their beauty and their power. And they will remind you that God often "moves in a mysterious way His wonders to perform."<sup>11</sup> In any case, He certainly turned adversity into blessing in giving us those sacred writings and reflections, so pure, noble, and Christian in both tone and content, yet produced in such an impure, ignoble, and unchristian setting.<br><h2><b>1. Everyone Faces Trying Times</b></h2><br>Now then, three lessons from Liberty Jail: May I suggest that the first of these is inherent in what I've already said--that everyone, including (and perhaps especially) the righteous, will be called upon to face trying times. When that happens we can sometimes fear God has abandoned us, and we might be left, at least for a time, to wonder when our troubles will ever end. As individuals, as families, as communities, and as nations, probably everyone has had or will have an occasion to feel as Joseph Smith felt when he asked why such sorrow had to come and how long its darkness and damage would remain. We identify with him when he cries from the depth and discouragement of his confinement:<br><br><i>O God, where art thou? . . .</i><br><br><i>How long shall thy hand be stayed . . . ?</i><br><br><i>Yea, O Lord, how long shall</i> [thy people] <i>suffer . . . before . . . thy bowels be moved with compassion toward them?</i> [D&amp;amp;C 121:1–3]<br><br>That is a painful, personal cry--a cry from the heart, a spiritual loneliness we may all have occasion to feel at some time in our lives.<br><br>Perhaps you have had such moments already in your young lives. If so, I hope you have not had too many. But whenever these moments of our extremity come, we must not succumb to the fear that God has abandoned us or that He does not hear our prayers. He <i>does</i> hear us. He <i>does</i> see us. He <i>does</i> love us. When we are in dire circumstances and want to cry "Where art Thou?" it is imperative that we remember He is right there with us--where He has always been! We must continue to believe, continue to have faith, continue to pray and plead with heaven, even if we feel for a time our prayers are not heard and that God has somehow gone away. He <i>is</i> there. Our prayers <i>are</i> heard. And when we weep He and the angels of heaven weep with us.<br><br>When lonely, cold, hard times come, we have to endure, we have to continue, we have to persist. That was the Savior's message in the parable of the importuning widow (see Luke 18:1–8; see also Luke 11:5–10). Keep knocking on that door. Keep pleading. In the meantime, know that God hears your cries and knows your distress. He is your Father, and you are His child.<br><br>When what has to be has been and when what lessons to be learned have been learned, it will be for us as it was for the Prophet Joseph. Just at the time he felt most alone and distant from heaven's ear was the very time he received the wonderful ministration of the Spirit and wonderful, glorious answers that came from his Father in Heaven. Into this dismal dungeon and this depressing time, thevoice of God came, saying:<br><br><i>My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;</i><br><br><i>And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 121:7–8]<br><br>Even though seemingly unjust circumstances may be heaped upon us and even though unkind and unmerited things may bedone to us--perhaps by those we consider enemies but also, in some cases, by those whom we thought were friends--nevertheless, through it all, <i>God is with us.</i> That is why we had our marvelous choir sing tonight Sarah Adams' traditional, old Christian hymn "Nearer, My God, to Thee" with that seldom-sung fourth verse, which they sang sobeautifully:<br><br><i>Out of my stony griefs</i><br><br><i>Bethel I'll raise;</i><br><br>So by my woes <i>to be</i><br><br><i>Nearer, my God, to thee.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>We are not alone in our little prisons here. When suffering, we may in fact be nearer to God than we've ever been in our entire lives. <i>That</i> knowledge can turn every such situation into a would-be temple.<br><br>Regarding our earthly journey, the Lord has promised:<br><br><i>I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, tobear you up.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 84:88]<br><br>That is an everlasting declaration of God's love and care for us, including--and perhaps especially--in times of trouble.<br><h2><b>2. Even the Worthy Will Suffer</b></h2><br>Secondly, we need to realize that just because difficult things happen--sometimes unfair and seemingly unjustified things--it does not mean that we are unrighteous or that we are unworthy of blessings or that God is disappointed in us. Of course sinfulness does bring suffering, and the only answer to that behavior is repentance. But sometimes suffering comes to the righteous, too. You will recall that from the depths of Liberty Jail when Joseph was reminded that he had indeed been "cast . . . into trouble," had passed through tribulation and been falsely accused, had been torn away from his family and cast into a pit, into the hands of murderers, nevertheless, he was to remember that <i>the same thing had happened to the Savior of the world,</i> and because He was triumphant, so shall we be (see D&amp;amp;C 122:4–7). In giving us this sober reminder of what the Savior went through, the revelation from Liberty Jail records: "The Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou greater than he?" (D&amp;amp;C 122:8).<br><br>No. Joseph was not greater than the Savior, and neither are we. And when we promise to follow the Savior, to walk in His footsteps and be His disciples, we are promising to go where that divine path leads us. And the path of salvation has always led one way or another through Gethsemane. So if the Savior faced such injustices and discouragements, such persecutions, unrighteousness, and suffering, we cannot expect that we are not going to face some of that if we still intend to call ourselves His true disciples and faithful followers. And it certainly underscores the fact that the righteous--in the Savior's case, the personification of righteousness--can be totally worthy before God and still suffer.<br><br>In fact, it ought to be a matter of great doctrinal consolation to us that Jesus, in the course of the Atonement, experienced all of the heartache and sorrow, all of the disappointments and injustices that the entire family of man had experienced and would experience from Adam and Eve to the end of the world in order that we would not have to face them so severely or so deeply. However heavy our load might be, it would be a lot heavier if the Savior had not gone that way before us and carried that burden with us and for us.<br><br>Very early in the Prophet Joseph's ministry, the Savior taught him this doctrine. After speaking of sufferings so exquisite to feel and so hard to bear, Jesus said:<br><br><i>I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they</i> [and that means you and I and everyone] <i>might not suffer if they would repent.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 19:16]<br><br>In our moments of pain and trial, I guess we would shudder to think it could be worse, but the answer to that is clearly that it <i>could</i> be worse and it <i>would</i> be worse. Only through our faith and repentance and obedience to the gospel that provided the sacred Atonement is it kept from <i>being</i> worse.<br><br>Furthermore, we note that not only has the Savior suffered, in His case entirely innocently, but so have most of the prophets and other great men and women recorded in the scriptures. Name an Old Testament or Book of Mormon prophet, name a New Testament Apostle, name virtually any of the leaders in any dispensation, including our own, and you name someone who has had trouble.<br><br>My point? If you are having a bad day, you've got a lot of company--very, very good company. The best company that has ever lived.<br><br>Now, don't misunderstand. We don't have to look for sorrow. We don't have to seek to be martyrs. Trouble has a way of finding us even without our looking for it. But when it is obvious that a little time in Liberty Jail waits before you (spiritually speaking), remember these first two truths taught to Joseph in that prison-temple. First, God has <i>not</i> forgotten you, and second, the Savior has been where you have been, allowing Him to provide for your deliverance and your comfort.<br><br>As the prophet Isaiah wrote, the Lord has "graven thee upon the palms of [His] hands" (Isaiah 49:16), permanently written right there in scar tissue with Roman nails as the writing instrument. Having paid that price in the suffering that They have paid for you, the Father and the Son will never forget nor forsake you in your suffering. (See Isaiah 49:14–16; see also 1 Nephi 21:14–16.) They have planned, prepared, and guaranteed your victory if you desire it, so be believing and "endure it well" (D&amp;amp;C 121:8). In the end it "shall be for thy good" (D&amp;amp;C 122:7), and you will see "everlasting dominion" flow unto you forever and ever "without compulsory means" (D&amp;amp;C 121:46).<br><h2><b>3. Remain Calm, Patient, Charitable, andForgiving</b></h2><br>Thirdly, and tonight lastly, may I remind us all that in the midst of these difficult feelings when one could justifiably be angry or reactionary or vengeful, wanting to return an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, the Lord reminds us from the Liberty Jail prison-temple that<br><br><i>the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only</i> [or "except"] <i>upon the principles of righteousness.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 121:36]<br><br>Therefore, even when we face such distressing circumstances in our life and there is something in us that wants to strike out at God or man or friend or foe, we must remember that "no power or influence <i>can</i> or <i>ought</i> to be maintained [except] by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned; . . . without hypocrisy, and without guile" (D&amp;amp;C 121:41–42; emphasis added).<br><br>It has always been a wonderful testimony to me of the Prophet Joseph's greatness and the greatness of all of our prophets, including and especially the Savior of the world in His magnificence, that in the midst of such distress and difficulty they could remain calm and patient, charitable, and forgiving--that they could even talk that way, let alone live that way. But they could, and they did. They remembered their covenants, they disciplined themselves, and they knew that we must live the gospel at all times, not just when it is convenient and not just when things are going well. Indeed, they knew that the real test of our faith and our Christian discipleship is when things are <i>not</i> going smoothly. That is when we get to see what we're made of and how strong our commitment to the gospel really is.<br><br>Surely the classic example of this is that in the most painful hours of the Crucifixion the Savior could say, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do" (Luke 23:34). That is a hard thing to ask when we're hurting. That is a hard thing to do when we've been offended or are tired or stressed out or suffering innocently. But that is when Christian behavior may matter the most. Remember, "the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled [except] upon the principles of righteousness." And do we need the powers ofheaven with us at such times! As Joseph wastaught in this prison-temple, even in distress and sorrow we must "let [our] bowels ... be full of charity towards all men . . . ; then [and only then] shall [our] confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and . . . the Holy Ghost shall be [our] constant companion" (D&amp;amp;C 121:45–46).<br><br>Remaining true to our Christian principles is the only way divine influence can help us. The Spirit has a near-impossible task to get through to a heart that is filled with hate or anger or vengeance or self-pity. Those are all antithetical to the Spirit of the Lord. On the other hand, the Spirit finds instant access to a heart striving to be charitable and forgiving, long-suffering and kind--principles of true discipleship. What a testimony that gospel principles are to apply at all times and in all situations and that if we strive to remain faithful, the triumph of a Christian life can never be vanquished, no matter how grim the circumstance might be. How I love the majesty of these elegant, celestial teachings taught, ironically, in such adespicable setting and time.<br><h2><b>Do All Things Cheerfully</b></h2><br>As a valedictory to the lessons from Liberty Jail, I refer to the last verse of the last section of these three we have been referring to tonight. In this final canonized statement of the Liberty Jail experience, the Lord says to us through His prophet, Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>Therefore, dearly beloved brethren</i> [and sisters, when we are in even the most troubling of times], <i>let us</i> cheerfully <i>do all things that lie in our power; and then may we stand still, with the utmost assurance, to see the salvation of God, and for his arm to be revealed.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 123:17; emphasis added]<br><br>What a tremendously optimistic and faithful concluding declaration to be issued from a prison-temple! When he wrote those lines, Joseph did not know when he would be released or if he would ever be released. There was every indication that his enemies were still planning to take his life. Furthermore, his wife and children were alone, frightened, often hungry, wondering how they would fend for themselves without their husband and father. The Saints, too, were without homes and without their prophet. They were leaving Missouri, heading for Illinois, but who knew what tragedies were awaiting them there? Surely, to say it again, it was the bleakest and darkest of times.<br><br>Yet in these cold, lonely hours, Joseph says let us do all we can <i>and do it cheerfully.</i> And then we can justifiably turn to the Lord, wait upon His mercy, and see His arm revealed in our behalf.<br><br>What a magnificent attitude to maintain in good times or bad, in sorrow or in joy!<br><h2><b>Blessing and Testimony</b></h2><br>My beloved young friends, as part of my concluding testimony to you tonight, I wish to give you a blessing. It seems to me that as our apostolic witnesses are taken into the world, we have two opportunities and, indeed, perhaps obligations. One is to testify and bear witness, as I have been trying to do and will conclude in doing. The other is to bless--as the ancient Apostles did when the Savior invited them to do as He had done, except that it would be in all the world.<br><br>So for every one of you in attendance tonight--here in this vast auditorium or in other locations around the world--I bless every one of you, each one of you in your individual circumstances, as if my hands were on your head. I offer that to you as honestly as I offer my testimony. I bless you in the name of the Lord that God does love you, does hear your prayers, is at your side, and will never leave you.<br><br>I bless the brethren that you--that we--will be worthy of the priesthood we bear, that we will live true to the discipleship to which we have been called, in that great order, the Holy Priesthood, after the Order of the Son of God. I bless you that we will really be like the Master--that we will think more like He thinks, that we will talk more like He talks, and that we will do more of what He did. I bless you brethren as you strive to be faithful that you will have all the blessings of the priesthood, many of which we have quoted tonight from these very sections from the Doctrine andCovenants.<br><br>I bless the sisters within this audience and within the sound of my voice. I would have you know how much we cherish you, how much God cherishes you, and how much the flag of faith has been flown by the sisters of this Church from the beginning. In every generation, it would seem, from the beginning of time down to the present hour and beyond, so often it has been the women in our lives--our grandmothers, our mothers, our wives, our daughters, our sisters, our granddaughters--who have taken that torch of faith and that banner of beautiful living and have carried gospel principles wherever it would take them, against whatever hardship, into their own little equivalent of Liberty Jails and difficult times. Sisters, we love you and honor you and bless you. We ask that every righteous desire of your heart, tonight and forever, be answered upon your head and that you will walk away from this devotional with the understanding and the knowledge firmly in your heart as to how much God and heaven and the presiding Brethren of this Church love you and honor you.<br><br>I salute you young adults of this Church in this great CES congregation and say that the future is in your hands. Those of us of my generation have to, in the very near future, pass the baton to you. God bless you to face those times with the valor, the honesty, and the integrity we have spoken of here tonight.<br><br>In closing, I testify that the Father and the Son do live. And I testify that They are close, perhaps even closest via the Holy Spirit, when we are experiencing difficult times. Itestify (and as our closing musical number, "My Kindness Shall Not Depart from Thee," will testify, quoting the prophet Isaiah) that heaven's kindness will <i>never</i> depart from you, regardless of what happens (see Isaiah 54:7–10; see also 3 Nephi 22:7–10). I testify that bad days come to an end, that faith always triumphs, and that heavenly promises are always kept. I testify that God is our Father, that Jesus is the Christ, that this is the true and living gospel--found in this, the true and living Church. I testify that President Thomas S. Monson is a prophet of God, our prophet for this hour and this day. I love him and sustain him as I know you do. In the words of the Liberty Jail prison-temple experience, my young friends, "Hold on thy way. . . . Fear not ... , for God shall be with you forever and ever" (D&amp;amp;C 122:9). In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Jeffrey R.

<h1>ation of Learning -Cecil O. Samuelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is my great pleasure to welcome you formally to another exciting fall semester. I hope and anticipate that this academic year will be a wonderfully productive and happy experience for all of us. Today I would like to talk with you--in a way possible only at a place like Brigham Young University--about learning. Because of our doctrine, we can understand much about how we may learn, what things we can learn, and why we must always continue to learn.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith declared to the world:<br><br><i>We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.</i> [Articles of Faith 1:9]<br><br>The doctrine of continuing and even continuous revelation is a fundamental and distinctive tenet of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In it we find the seeds of the Restoration and also the basis for our understanding concerning the importance of learning. In fact, in the face of obvious differences between revelation from heaven and the kind of learning more common to our university experiences, we also find some significant commonalities of which we should be constantly aware.<br><br>Typically, when we talk of revelation we are thinking of communication coming from God, either directly (as was the case with Joseph Smith and the First Vision) from an angelic minister (such as Moroni and the visitor from beyond the veil to Alma the Younger), or via the Holy Ghost, who speaks directly to our hearts and minds. While it is certainly appropriate to focus on the methods and means of the communication, it is also essential to understand that revelation and inspiration are, in a very real sense, an important source of learning and teaching.<br><br>Pause for a moment and think of all the truths Joseph Smith learned in his sacred interview at age 14. While he was a quick learner and demonstratively learned in various ways throughout his entire life, I would posit that this initial experience was perhaps the most intense and productive tutorial he ever experienced. In addition to the doctrinal clarity and understanding that came, he left the grove with the clear expectation that his life would be forever one of continuous learning and increasing understanding (see JS--H 1:26).<br><br>Often at BYU we follow well-developed traditions common throughout the entire academic world. At our commencements we celebrate what has been learned and what has been achieved and give formal recognition to these accomplishments by the conferral of degrees and other honors. There is nothing inappropriate in this unless we mistake these scholarly attainments for end points rather than as advantaged starting positions for further learning. You know these scriptural verses verywell:<br><br><i>The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 93:36]<br><br><i>It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 131:6]<br><br><i>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i><br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 130:18–19]<br><br>To be true to our restored doctrine then, we must always "seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118; see also D&amp;amp;C 109:7).<br><br>While it is perfectly appropriate to recognize the joy of accomplishment when we have learned something important, we must always remember that we have so much more to learn. Forgive me as I take a quick trip down my own memory lane as a potential case study of what I mean.<br><br>At age 17 I graduated from high school with a record good enough that I began university study on a scholarship. I knew I didn't know everything but thought I knew quite a bit.<br><br>In 1960 I entered military service because at that time it was a necessary prelude to missionary service. I learned to march, fire and clean a weapon, and pass inspection from a sharp-eyed sergeant. After basic training I went to cook and baker school and graduated with an impressive certificate in which the U.S. Army described my experience as "eight weeks of the finest food service training in the world." I also really learned a lot about the world outside of Utah, in addition to a little about cooking, and thought I was quite knowledgeable and no longer sheltered.<br><br>In 1961 I arrived in the mission field and began to understand better that I had much more to learn, even though the pace of learning was perhaps the fastest yet of my still-young life.<br><br>In 1964 Sharon and I got married, and my ignorance of many important things became more obvious to me in the face of intense learning of yet another kind. Particularly when our children began to arrive, I became aware of things I had never imagined.<br><br>In 1966 I graduated from university with a baccalaureate degree and understood that I had many more years of school ahead if I wanted to meet my ultimate professional learning and educational goals.<br><br>In 1970 I was awarded both master's and medical degrees and was entitled to add, for me, the coveted MD to my signature. I already knew that I still had much to learn over the next few years if I were to be a "real" physician and not one in name only. In the immediate weeks and months of my medical internship and residency training, I began to realize how important it was to know clearly what I did not know. I occasionally saw very bright and knowledgeable people make horrible mistakes that caused harm to patients because they did not understand when to call for help or when to find someone who might better understand the problem of the person they were treating.<br><br>In 1973 I received my first faculty appointment. I recall both the exhilaration of finally reaching a long-sought-for goal and the tremendous trepidation that my knowledge and skills did not match my opportunities and responsibilities. In a few years my anxiety waned slightly when I was promoted to associate professor and granted tenure. Still, in my heart of hearts I knew I was interacting with people who were brighter and more informed than was I.<br><br>In the early 1980s I achieved the single professional goal I set out to achieve when Idecided to pursue an academic career while still a student in medical school. I was promoted to full professor of internal medicine. Shortly thereafter I was appointed dean of the School of Medicine, following an interim season in that role. While I honestly felt qualified in the sense that I had met or exceeded all of the published and expected criteria for this senior rank, I also recognized more than ever that what I knew was only a small part of what was then known in my chosen field of specialty. This was without even considering all that was not known that we and others were attempting to learn through our research efforts.<br><br>In 1990 I had the unique opportunity to leave full-time academic work to enter the delivery side of health care and become directly involved in business leadership. I thought I knew something about administration and working with people, particularly doctors and other health professionals, but I had never taken a single course in accounting, business, or finance. It was at that time that I became a BYU student of sorts. I engaged then dean of the Marriott School and now recently retired BYU advancement vice president Fred Skousen to teach me some accounting. I also asked professor and later dean of the Marriott School Ned Hill to teach me something about finance, bonds, and insurance. Don't worry, they didn't give me a BYU degree! They just taught me a lot that continues to be helpfultoday.<br><br>In 1994 I was unexpectedly called to be a General Authority. While the learning curve was the steepest ever, the tutors of all kinds were also superb. Again, the challenge of knowing what I did not know was tremendous, and the responsibility to learn what I needed to know was immense. With each assignment in this calling, the opportunity to learn has been great and the need to do so was and is immediate. The stark realization came to me then that as I learned more and more, it seemed like I knew less and less.<br><br>Years ago, while I was serving as a full-time missionary, Elder Harold B. Lee said the following in general conference:<br><br><i>It is a wonderful thing for us in our younger years to remember what old age brings. Chauncey Depew, who as a United States Congressman on his ninetieth birthday was asked about his philosophy of life. He replied that when he was a young man his greatest ambition had been to display his intelligence, but the older he grew the greater was his anxiety to conceal his ignorance. It was indeed the beginning of learning when as Moses said, after the great and soul-stirring revelation of the personality of God, "Now, for this cause I know that man is nothing, which thing I had never supposed" (Moses 1:10). That was in the beginning of his wisdom.</i> [Harold B. Lee, <i>CR,</i> April 1962, 29]<br><br>It is useful and also necessary for each of us to ask ourself, if it has already occurred, "When was the beginning of our own wisdom?" If this is still in our future, however, we should ask ourself, "When will the beginning of our wisdom take place?"<br><br>Each of your experiences will be unique and quite different from mine in the particulars but will be and should be very similar in the general case. A most important learning opportunity will be ours when we find ourselves in a situation where we understand how little we really know and how much we yet have to learn if we are truly to become credible disciples of the Father and the Son.<br><br>In 2003, perhaps as great a surprise as I have ever experienced occurred for me when I was called as president of Brigham Young University. In some respects, all of the previous challenges to learn paled in significance. One of the blessings--and perhaps also one of the curses--of university life for the president is that on virtually every issue or matter that arises, there are always several people who know more than does the nominal leader. Likewise, almost all at BYU are very willing to teach and to share, and so the opportunities for learning, gaining understanding, and mastering how to learn better are unexcelled. What a blessing to be in an environment where the practice of the doctrine is reflexive, at least with respect to the constant quest for learning.<br><br>I recognize the risk of sharing even this much biographical chronology, because it will likely cause each of you to think about how old I am even when it is so obvious already. At each commencement since my arrival at BYU, I have greeted graduates whose parents were students of mine in days of yore. On the other hand, while I enjoy going to Church headquarters regularly for a variety of reasons to meet with the senior Brethren, I take especial and secret delight in recognizing that in those circles I am still one of the younger ones. I suppose these reactions could be viewed as something of a paradox: being among the oldest and also being among the youngest.<br><br>Let me suggest another paradox, or at least a seeming paradox in the eyes of much of the world. It applies generally to BYU and specifically to our allegiance to both scholarly learning and learning by revelation. Conventional wisdom in the academy broadly is that scholarship and faith are of entirely different species and never the twain shall meet. Revealed understanding--that which has been achieved "by study and also by faith"--teaches us that in fact these notions and their related endeavors are closely related and even intertwined, although most do not recognize it to be so and many refuse to acknowledge this essential truth.<br><br>Our BYU founding namesake and prophet, Brigham Young, often taught of this special relationship. Listen to these words:<br><br><i>The revelations of the Lord Jesus Christ to the human family is all the learning we can ever possess. Much of this knowledge is obtained from books, which have been written by men who have contemplated deeply on various subjects, and the revelations of Jesus have opened their minds,</i> whether they knew it or acknowledged it or not. [<i>JD</i> 12:116; emphasis added]<br><br>Always the prophet-teacher, Brigham Young had remarkably strong feelings about scholarship, even though he personally, by your standards, had so little formal education. He said:<br><br><i>It matters not what the subject be, if it tends to improve the mind, exalt the feelings, and enlarge the capacity. The truth that is in all the arts and sciences forms a part of our religion.</i> [<i>JD</i> 1:335]<br><br>Those of you with expertise in education and learning theory will attest to the reality that different people learn in different ways. Some of you students can almost completely assimilate what is taught in a well-crafted lecture, and some learn well only by being able to read from good notes, a laptop computer, or a textbook. Fundamental differences in approaches to knowledge, to understanding, and even to what knowledge is do exist in secular and spiritual spheres as well. While these differences are usually emphasized, their similarities are greater than commonly acknowledged.<br><br>In science, to use the term broadly, truth is usually accepted tentatively with the expectation that we are always awaiting the "better answer." Today's theory, while perhaps the best explanation we currently have, will give way to tomorrow's hypothesis, which will incorporate new data not now available.<br><br>In the spiritual and sacred sphere, there are absolute truths that are, have been, and will always be (see Jacob 4:13). Our understanding of those things we now know will be improved as we learn more, but the truths themselves do not change. Thus we learn "line upon line, precept upon precept" by revelation (see D&amp;amp;C 98:12). As our understanding improves, however, the fundamental doctrinal truths remain unchanged. The common thread between secular and spiritual learning is not in the content or in the discipline but in the reality that we can and we must continue to learn.<br><br>Meanwhile, we must never become like those described by the Apostle Paul who are "ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth" (2 Timothy 3:7). It is in our continuous learning "by study and also by faith" that we are able to assimilate what we learn in all spheres and come to an understanding of those things we seek that are of the greatest importance (see Articles of Faith 1:13).<br><br>These facts of highest rank include that God is truly our Heavenly Father. Jesus Christ, the Firstborn in the spirit world, is literally His Son, our Savior and Redeemer, whose Atonement is real, absolute, and endless. Joseph Smith actually saw and was instructed by the Father and the Son and is the prophet of the Restoration. The Restoration of the gospel itself is real, and its truths--such as the fundamental nature and importance of the family now and forever--have been clarified so that all with truly learning hearts may understand. Thomas S. Monson is our prophet-leader today. Of these things I testify that we must all learn and know. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O.

<h1>e Children - Sharon G. Samuelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
We are grateful to be with you as we begin a new fall semester together. We hope that the summer has been as good for you as it has been for us.<br><br>The year 2008 has been very special for our family. Since the end of April we have added four new grandchildren, who, frankly, have been the focus of our thoughts and prayers. While absolutely wonderful in the broad sense, we have had a few challenges and concerns that accompany the perilous adventure of our mortal experiences.<br><br>Although I will share a little about our situation, I want to emphasize what a great blessing it has been for us to have these four little ones born into the families of three of our children. Our situation is not unlike many of yours: A few of you might already know--and a few of you will yet learn--that children don't always come when you put in the order. Often there is significant disappointment, frustration, and even grief. We have been very fortunate, but we recognize that there are many, including some in our own community, who have notand will not have the blessing of children in this life.<br><br>Happily, the scriptures and prophets have promised that if we do our very best in keeping our covenants and the commandments, all of the blessings Heavenly Father has promised His children will be made available to us eventually, including intact families, even if they are not experienced in this life.<br><br>In late April, twins were born to our elder daughter, Becki, and her husband, David. This was a special blessing, because these two went through their entire BYU experience unable to have children. Finally, with some special help, they had a beautiful little girl born 18 months before the birth of their twins. These two little ones were so anxious to begin their mortal sojourn that they arrived at 30 weeks. These precious premature babies spent a couple of months in the newborn intensive care unit of their local hospital, and after a number of slightly frightening adventures are now home and doing well.<br><br>The births of the other two grandchildren were less eventful in terms of timing and challenges, but all are loved by their parents, older siblings, and especially their grandparents! I mention these personal accounts because they have provoked not only tender feelings of love and gratitude but also concerns, prayers, and considerations about our grandchildren's lives and particularly about our responsibilities tothem.<br><br>We pray that at some point in the not-too-distant future all of you will experience the joy and growth that come from being parents and that eventually you will also have the tremendous blessings we now enjoy as grandparents. In that spirit I would like to share with you some of my reflections with the hope and faith that they will be of some benefit to you as you think about your exciting futures.<br><br>First, I am now able to bear a strong testimony that children, in fact, "are an heritage of the Lord" (Psalm 127:3; see also "The Family: A Proclamation to the World," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1995, 102). What is meant by "an heritage"? It is something that comes as the result of inheritance or especially a unique gift, tradition, or responsibility. Since we understand that we are all, including our biological babies and children, spiritual progeny of our Heavenly Father, we also must understand that He shares in the responsibility to love, nurture, teach, protect, and encourage His own most precious possessions: His literal spirit children.<br><br>Thus, while we commonly think of children born or adopted into our families as our own, we need to consider carefully this fundamental truth: We are really agents of God the Father in providing these precious little ones the very best mortal experiences possible. This means, of course, that there is much more to our parenting responsibility than feeding, clothing, and making sure that proper dental and medical care are provided. And while music, dance, athletic, and other lessons and experiences are desirable in moderation--and when possible and practical--there is still much more that is expected and required.<br><br>Let me share some of these needs of our little ones and the resultant responsibilities of parents that deserve our very best attention. All might be found under the heading "Teach the Children."<br><br>In the first chapter of the book of Mosiah, wefind an account of the parenting efforts of King Benjamin with his three sons. Let me share part of it with you as I focus on verses2through 7:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that he had three sons; and he called their names Mosiah, and Helorum, and Helaman. And he caused that they should be taught in all the language of his fathers, that thereby they might become men of understanding; and that they might know concerning the prophecies which had been spoken by the mouths of their fathers, which were delivered them by the hand of the Lord.</i><br><br><i>And he also taught them concerning the records which were engraven on the plates of brass, saying: My sons, I would that ye should remember that were it not for these plates, which contain these records and these commandments, we must have suffered in ignorance, even at this present time, notknowing the mysteries of God.</i><br><br><i>For it were not possible that our father, Lehi, could have remembered all these things, to have taught them to his children, except it were for the help of these plates; for he having been taught in the language of the Egyptians therefore he could read these engravings, and teach them to his children, that thereby they could teach them to their children, and so fulfilling the commandments of God, even down to this present time.</i><br><br><i>I say unto you, my sons, were it not for these things, which have been kept and preserved by the hand of God, that we might read and understand of his mysteries, and have his commandments always before our eyes, that even our fathers would have dwindled in unbelief. . . .</i><br><br><i>O my sons, I would that ye should remember that these sayings are true, and also that these records are true. And behold, also the plates of Nephi, which contain the records and the sayings ofour fathers from the time they left Jerusalem untilnow, and they are true; and we can know of their surety because we have them before our eyes.</i><br><br><i>And now, my sons, I would that ye should remember to search them diligently, that ye may profit thereby; and I would that ye should keep the commandments of God, that ye may prosper in the land according to the promises which the Lord made unto our fathers.</i> [Mosiah 1:2–7]<br><br>I believe this is a wonderful summary of what we as parents, grandparents, and teachers of children and young people need to do. As I conclude, let me refer again to six parenting guidelines from King Benjamin.<br><br>First, he saw that his children were properly educated in language, reading, and the world around them.<br><br>Second, he saw that his sons were taught about the prophecies and teachings of the prophets of God.<br><br>Third, he not only taught these youngsters from the scriptures but also taught them about the scriptures and why they are vital and necessary for everyone.<br><br>Fourth, he not only consciously and thoroughly taught them about these truths but also had confidence that they, in turn, would be able to teach their children--his grandchildren--the same truths.<br><br>Fifth, he bore strong, direct, and specific testimony of the truthfulness of the things he taught them.<br><br>And sixth, he taught them the importance of keeping the commandments of God so that they might receive the special blessings Heavenly Father had in store for them.<br><br>I believe this is a wonderful and applicable pattern for all of us to follow as we prepare to teach our children, whether we have them now or whether that remarkable blessing and responsibility comes to us in the future.<br><br>I have a testimony that assisting our Father in Heaven in teaching children to love and serve the Lord is one of the most important blessings and responsibilities He has given us. The Savior loved and taught the little children, and we are to follow His example. The adversary recognizes the power in good families and is attacking them. I am confident that each of you, whether a parent at this point or not, can and must teach your children, your siblings, and other children with whom you have contact to walk uprightly before the Lord. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Sharon G. Samuelson, wife of BYU president Cecil O.

<h1> of Kalaupapa - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, aloha! Before we get started, I thought I needed to explain my red tie, because when I got up this morning, my 16-year-old son, Freddie, said, "Hey, Dad, why are you wearing that [University of Utah] tie to the devotional?" (He's an avid BYU Cougar fan.) I pointed out that on the very bottom it says BYU–Hawaii. So aloha to you.<br><br>I express gratitude to the BYU administration for this opportunity to address you this morning. My remarks are dedicated to my mother, who taught me that every human being is a child of God, that He loves all His children, and that we should love them as well, regardless of race or religion. Although my parents and sister are not Latter-day Saints, they have always been a great support to me.<br><h2><b>Genesis of the Kalaupapa Experience</b></h2><br>In December 2003 I went to Hawaii to do research and invited my wife, JoAnna, to go with me, because I knew we would have a few days at the end of my workweek to also celebrate our 24th wedding anniversary. My research focused on the LDS history of Laie, on the island of Oahu, but I asked JoAnna where she would like to go on the Hawaiian Islands for our anniversary celebration. She replied that her priority would be to visit the Kalaupapa leprosy settlement on the north shore of the island of Molokai. We had been reading about this unique place, and I thought her suggestion was perfect. Our trip included a precarious mule ride down the steep 2,000-foot cliffs of the Molokai Range, which eventually spilled us out onto a four-mile peninsula of sacred space, a transforming terra firma known as Kalaupapa.<br><br>The literal translation of <i>Kalaupapa</i> may be rendered "flat plain" or "flat leaf."<sup>1</sup> In either case, it is surely a leveling experience for all who cross the boundaries of their own professed beliefs and ethnicity into a larger realm of brotherhood and compassion, for it is here that religious denominations and cultural divides dissolve--where the love of God and mankind manifest themselves in a magnificent way. This smooth, beautiful peninsula seems most appropriate to symbolize the universal love of a Supreme Being who embraces all four corners of the earth. Structures erected in this region for more than a century include places of worship for Protestants, Catholics, and Latter-day Saints, as well as a small Buddhist temple. It is a place that not only includes a variety of Christian strains but also extends beyond this realm, embracing an array of other views. In a world made up of thousands of religious varieties, the unconditional love and spirit of acceptance that exist on Kalaupapa truly stand as an example to us all.<br><br>After passing through some of the most beautiful landscape our eyes had ever beheld, we met LDS Church member Kuulei Bell at the Kalaupapa post office. At that time Kuulei was employed as the Kalaupapa postal clerk. We had a wonderful visit, and it was then that I determined to write a history of the Latter-day Saints in this region. Nearly five years have come and gone since that time, and I am still researching and writing that history. However, after my first visit, I decided that a larger story of Kalaupapa must also be told, the story of valiant patients and volunteers who worked together and inspired each other despite their differing faiths. JoAnna and I went away from our first encounter with this small settlement feeling much the way Elder Matthew Cowley felt when he encountered Kalaupapa in the mid-20th century:<br><br><i>I went there apprehending that I would be depressed. I left knowing that I had been exalted. I had expected that my heart, which is not too strong, would be torn with sympathy, but I went away with a feeling that it had been healed. . . .</i><br><br><i>I went . . . appreciating my friends, loving my enemies, worshiping God, and with a heart purged of all pettiness. This is a transformation for me and for it I am indebted to the . . . Saints of Kalaupapa.</i><sup>2</sup><br><h2><b>Establishment of Kalaupapa</b></h2><br>As 1865 dawned, the Hawaiian government's concern over the disease of leprosy had escalated to the point that King KamehamehaV signed a document intent on preventing the spread of this malicious malady. The writ designated a self-contained region surrounded by natural borders for victims on the eastern portion of the Kalaupapa peninsula, a place called Kalawao. The following year the first patients began arriving.<sup>3</sup><br><h2><b>Understanding the Disease</b></h2><br>Millions of people worldwide are still infected with leprosy, which affects primarily the skin and nerves. However, less than 5 percent of our human population is susceptible to its devastation. In 1873 a Norwegian physician named Dr. Gerhardt Hansen discovered the cause of this sickness, a bacillus, <i>Mycobacterium leprae,</i> and, as a result, the illness began to be referred to as Hansen's disease. In 1981 this name was officially adopted in Hawaii as the medical term for leprosy, which usage patients prefer, since the term <i>leprosy</i> possesses a negative stigma in biblical literature, intimating that its victims were unclean.<sup>4</sup> Between 1866 and 1969, over 8,000 people were forcibly removed to the Kalaupapa peninsula. By 1969 drugs were developed that arrested the disease, and patients were again free to move abroad as they wished.<sup>5</sup><br><br>In 1980 Kalaupapa was named a national park. Today about two dozen patients still live in the settlement or in Honolulu at the Hale Mohalu Hospital; with their passing, the park will eventually extend its influence throughout the entire region.<br><h2><b>Damien and Napela</b></h2><br>In the same year that Dr. Hansen made his medical discovery, two ecclesiastical leaders from different faiths first made their appearance on the Kalaupapa peninsula. One was a Latter-day Saint named Jonathan Hawaii Napela; the other was a Belgian priest, Father Damien J. de Veuster, who will be canonized by the Roman Catholic Church in the coming year.<sup>6</sup> Napela was born on the island of Maui in 1813, became a district judge in 1848, and converted to Mormonism in 1852. He was a tremendous aid to early LDS missionary work on the Hawaiian Islands as he fed and housed the elders, helped them learn Hawaiian, and aided George Q. Cannon with the translation of the Book of Mormon into Hawaiian. Though Cannon taught Napela the restored gospel, Napela on several occasions taught Cannon and the Utah elders a greater dimension of faith.<br><br>Perhaps his greatest contribution to humankind is his example as a loving husband. When his wife, Kitty, contracted leprosy, or Hansen's disease, Jonathan chose to remain with her in the settlement and act as her <i>kokua,</i> a Hawaiian word meaning "helper." Consequently, Jonathan wrote a letter in Hawaiian to the Board of Health, pleading that he might be allowed to stay with his wife:<br><br><i>On August 3, 1843, I took my wife as my legally married wife and on that same day I vowed before God to care for my wife in health and sickness, and until death do us part. . . .</i><br><br><i>I am 60 years old and do not have much longer to live. During the brief time remaining, I want to be with my wife. My wife has also lived a long life, but with this disease, it will quickly shorten her life. Such is the reason for this petition.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>Luckily, Jonathan's request was granted, and he spent the remaining years of his life at Kalaupapa with Kitty. While here, Napela encountered yet another way to serve those around him. Not long after his arrival, he was called to act as the leader of the LDS Church on the Kalaupapa peninsula, a calling he held from 1873 until his death in 1879 from the effects of Hansen's disease.<sup>8</sup><br><br>Perhaps not coincidentally, Father Damien arrived at Kalaupapa in the same year the Napelas did. This Belgian priest would eventually gain international fame because of his demonstration of faith and attitude of selfless service on the island, best captured by his own words: "Suppose the disease does get my body, God will give me another one on resurrection day."<sup>9</sup> From the day of his arrival in 1873 until his death at age 49, his concern was for all the patients, regardless of race or religion. However, the core of his heart seemed to belong to the orphaned children, whom he often led in singing. His Christian service on the Kalaupapa peninsula serves as an important reminder of Elder Orson F. Whitney's words, offered in a 1921 general conference address:<br><br>[God] <i>is using not only his covenant people, but other peoples as well, to consummate a work, stupendous, magnificent, and altogether too arduous for this little handful of Saints to accomplish by and of themselves. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Other good and great men</i> [and women] <i>have been sent by the Almighty into many nations, to give them, not the fulness of the Gospel, but that portion of truth that they were able to receive and wisely use.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>Soon after their arrival at the settlement, Jonathan Napela and Father Damien became acquainted. Both had come to Kalaupapa to serve, and both contracted Hansen's disease as a result of their charity. Damien was 27 years younger than Napela, and the cultural background of each was very different, yet both were firmly committed to their religious orientations. Though ecclesiastical leaders of different faiths, they became dear friends. In fact, one of their contemporaries who lived at Kalaupapa wrote, "After Father Damien arrived in the Leper Settlement, . . . Mr. J.Napela . . . and Father Damien were the best of friends."<sup>11</sup> What makes this relationship particularly unusual is the fact that at this time heated rivalries existed between faiths as they vied for island converts.<sup>12</sup> Yet at Kalaupapa, there seems to have developed a different kind of spiritual terrain nourished by the relationship between these two great men and their commitment to improve the decadent moral conditions they encountered upon their arrival at the settlement.<br><h2><b>Conditions at Kalaupapa in 1873</b></h2><br>Reporting to the Board of Health on the depraved situation of the patients, Damien wrote:<br><br><i>They numbered eight hundred and sixteen. Some of them were old acquaintances of mine, from Hawaii, where I was previously stationed. . . . To the majority I was a stranger. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . They all were living at Kalawao. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . They passed their time with playing cards, hula . . . , drinking . . . alcohol. . . .</i><br><br><i>Their clothes in general were far from being clean and decent. . . .</i><br><br><i>The miserable condition of the settlement at that time gave it the name of a living graveyard.</i><sup>13</sup><br><br>Damien further noted, "Many an unfortunate woman had to become a prostitute to obtain friends who would take care of her, and the children, when well and strong, were used as servants."<sup>14</sup> Such conditions created a need for these men to unite hands with those patients who desired to improve their spiritual environment.<sup>15</sup><br><h2><b>Suffering Influences Spirituality atKalaupapa</b></h2><br>Through the influence of Damien, Napela, and a number of other avid Christians, reformation soon made headway. Over the years, response to Kalaupapa softened under the strain of the suffering that transpired there. One former patient named Bernard noted that Kalaupapa used to be viewed as "a devil's island, a gateway to hell, worse than a prison." Yet he added, "Today it is a gateway to heaven. There is a spirituality to the place. All the sufferings of those whose blood has touched the land--the effect is so powerful even the rain cannot wash it away."<sup>16</sup> Another patient named Makia Malo noted, "They thought it was hell and we thought it was heaven."<sup>17</sup><br><br>In interviews, some patients have related how their spirituality has been affected by their Kalaupapa experience, especially as it pertains to prayer. For example, one patient named Nancy Toleno said:<br><br><i>We were nurtured . . . not just by a Protestant or a Mormon or even Catholic nuns. Everyone worked together. . . . Everyone needed prayers, there were prayers. And I was thankful that I was very close, very close to God. . . . Someone asked, "Do you ask God why?" I said, "No, I don't." I just say, "Maybe it's a wake-up call." I thank Him. . . . I want people to know, really know the love in the hearts of the people of Kalaupapa. . . . We've got hearts. We've got hearts</i>.<sup>18</sup><br><br>Another patient, who came to Kalaupapa atage 14 in 1936, also shared her experience ofprayer and the importance of expressing gratitude to God, even in times of adversity:<br><br><i>God knows best for us. . . . You must keep your faith no matter what comes into your life. You must still be able to thank the Lord for the many other blessings that we receive and keep this faith all the time, no matter what comes into our life. Yeah, 'cause I feel religion is not thanking God when everything is good; religion is thanking God when everything isn't going right.</i><sup>19</sup><br><br>This vertical relationship with the heavens seems to have also affected the horizontal relationships among the patients themselves. Furthermore, several people who have had contact with the Kalaupapa patients have spoken of the unifying effects that appear to be inherent in the suffering of this disease. For example, in his book <i>Travels to Hawaii,</i> Robert Louis Stevenson wrote of his visit to Kalaupapa, explaining, "They were strangers to each other, collected by common calamity."<sup>20</sup> Protestant writer Ethel M. Damon noted, "Surely the isolation of suffering has tended toward obliterating the barriers of difference in religious observance."<sup>21</sup> Reverend James Drew further observed, "They are brothers and sisters here. . . . Leprosy has made sure of that."<sup>22</sup><br><br>One Asian patient named Paul Harada echoed this same theme:<br><br><i>The more we suffer, the more strength we have. The more suffering, the closer we are to one another. Life is that way. If you haven't suffered, then you don't know what joy is. The others may know something about joy, but those who have gone through hell and high water, I think they feel the joy deeper.</i><sup>23</sup><br><br>In referring to the Kalaupapa community, this same patient said, "We are all friends," and he told me that there was an "ecumenical philosophy" in the community.<sup>24</sup><br><h2><b>Ecumenical Philosophy at Kalaupapa</b></h2><br>In a number of interviews conducted over the past several years, I have certainly seen and heard indications of the ecumenical attitude at Kalaupapa. For example, Latter-day Saint patient Kuulei Bell related that at times she was recruited to sing in the Catholic choir. Not only has Kuulei sung with a Catholic choir, but she and her dear friend and fellow patient, Lucy Kaona, have made many trips to Father Damien's church in Kalawao (St. Philomena), three miles from Kalaupapa, to enjoy the chapel's acoustics and especially to sing to Father Damien as a tribute to his charitable service.<sup>25</sup><br><br>Another example of ecumenism was related in a humorous way by Richard Marks--a former patient, a Catholic, and the sheriff of Kalaupapa for nearly two decades (with a record of no arrests). In describing the Catholic mass in Kalaupapa at Christmastime, Marks explained, "The Protestants and the Mormons came early and they took the back seats so we had to sit up front."<sup>26</sup> Another Catholic patient, affectionately known by his friends as "Boogie," noted, "We know all about the things we [the patients] went through. . . . I think that's one [reason we feel like a family]. ... When we have a function going on, the whole community just comes together."<sup>27</sup><br><br>Apparently this kind of attitude prevailed throughout the 20th century. Latter-day Saint convert Mary Sing recalled, "When I came [to Kalaupapa in 1917] everybody was living just like a family. Nobody says anything bad about the other religion. Everybody was together. See, they respected, you know, each church." Mary added, "If the Catholic had any party, ... they wait for the Mormon people to get through with their service. . . . And so [it] is with the Protestant, everybody was made happy."<sup>28</sup><br><br>One patient, Edwin Lelepali, known affectionately as "Pali" and a very active member of the Protestant community, recalled, "Us and the Catholic Church and the Mormon Church, we're always getting together. When it is something big, we always join together and enjoy it."<sup>29</sup> One memorable ecumenical service occurred soon after the Lion's Club erected a cross at the Kauhako Crater, shortly before the Easter celebration of 1948. One author wrote of the assemblage of different Christian faiths: "The two Mormon Elders assisted Pastor Alice in the service; many Roman Catholics were present. . . . The people sang as never before, their joyous message carrying on the wind even to the sufferers in the hospital at Kalaupapa."<sup>30</sup><br><br>Perhaps the most impressive piece of Kalaupapa's interfaith collaborative work is the construction of various places of worship. For example, Pali expressed his joy and gratitude when members of the settlement joined in 1966 to help restore the Siloama chapel: "We had the Protestants, we had the Catholics, we had the Mormons all chip in to build this Church. ... They wanted to help this Church. . . . When you came here you could feel the spirit of love. It was special working with them. . . . It was just beautiful. I can never thank them enough. It was wonderful."<sup>31</sup> When asked if the same was true when a 20th-century Catholic church was erected, he added that everyone joined in "to help raise some funds for the Church. ... Everybody would help out and that's how it was in Kalaupapa. That's what's so different about Kalaupapa. When somebody needs help, everybody's there." Finally, this patient explained, "This is our family. . . . I don't care what religion. . . . That's how we felt. When they need help, we [are] there, see? ... We always go. You don't have to ask us, we just come out and help. That's how we were brought up here in Kalaupapa. Somehow that great love for everybody brought us together."<sup>32</sup><br><br>The same spirit of love and collaboration that existed during the construction of the Catholic and Protestant churches was also evident in 1965 when a new Latter-day Saint chapel was built to replace the older 1904 chapel, which had deteriorated. When the building was dedicated at the close of the year and the work hours tallied, it was discovered that those of other faiths had actually donated <i>more</i> hours in its construction than the Latter-day Saints had. "All worked hard, and some of those with disabilities had their hands wired to the wheelbarrows that they might do their share."<sup>33</sup> The entire settlement joined in celebration over the knowledge that their LDS friends had a new chapel to worship in.<br><h2><b>Telling the Kalaupapa Story</b></h2><br>In early 2005 I learned that both BYU–Hawaii and Chaminade, a Catholic university in Honolulu, were celebrating their jubilee anniversaries. I approached the presidents of both schools (BYU–Hawaii President Eric B. Shumway and Chaminade President Sue Wesselkamper) about the idea of a joint celebration on each campus and explained that it seemed natural to share this wonderful interfaith story that seemed to have commenced with the friendship between Damien and Napela. They listened attentively and agreed toit.<br><br>One important factor that no doubt aided in the acceptance of the proposal was when I initially met with President Wesselkamper and another Chaminade administrator and asked if we could begin our meeting by reading some of the comforting words that had been recently spoken by President Gordon B. Hinckley at the April 2005 general conference regarding the passing of Pope John Paul II. On this occasion President Hinckley stated:<br><br><i>I extend to our Catholic neighbors and friends our heartfelt sympathy at this time of great sorrow. Pope John Paul II has worked tirelessly to advance the cause of Christianity, to lift the burdens of the poor, and to speak fearlessly in behalf of moral values and human dignity. He will be greatly missed, particularly by the very many who have looked to him for leadership.</i><sup>34</sup><br><br>I believe these inspired words helped strengthen a friendship with Chaminade and open the way for the proposal that came to fruition during the fall of 2005. During this period I presented the Kalaupapa story of interfaith collaboration to students and faculty on both campuses as part of the jubilee celebrations. In addition, over the past three years as an Evans Professor of Religious Understanding, I have had the opportunity to share this edifying story at several conferences and with numerous students attending many universities. This story has also encouraged a brotherhood with leaders of different faiths. However, the most tender part of my experience has been getting to know the Kalaupapa community and to feel the spirit of the patients, who are now my friends. A 60-minute documentary directed by Ethan Vincent titled <i>The Soul of Kalaupapa</i> will be released next year to tell their story and will be shown at the World Parliament of Religions, to be held in Melbourne, Australia, in December 2009.<br><h2><b>My Conclusion Is the Message of Inclusion</b></h2><br>The charity and uncommon service rendered at Kalaupapa serves as a reminder of the importance of erecting bridges instead of barriers, finding common ground instead of battleground, and valuing one another regardless of ethnicity and religiosity. To me it provides a vivid illustration of the need for Latter-day Saints to not only join hands but also to look outside the circle of our faith's community and take Elder M. Russell Ballard's charge seriously to "love one another. Be kind to one another despite our deepest differences."<sup>35</sup> Such an ecumenical philosophy of inclusiveness seems to be desperately needed in a world that suffers from societal diseases such as selfishness, pride, bigotry, and prejudice. In addition, it is hoped that this short treatise on the Kalaupapa settlement will serve as a reminder of the acute need for each of us to generate light instead of heat and to apply the maxim "In essentials unity, in non-essentials liberty, and in all things charity."<sup>36</sup><br><br>I testify that I know that God lives and that He loves all of His children. I testify that "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."<sup>37</sup> In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Fred E.

Father Damien, originally named Joseph de Veuster, was born January 3, 1840, in Tremeloo, Belgium. A priest in the Society of the Sacred Hearts of Joseph and Mary, Damien was ordained at Honolulu in 1864. He then spent several years working among the native Hawaiians on the big island of Hawaii. Members of his parish contracted the disease and were sent to Kalawao on the Kalaupapa peninsula. His heart was instilled with a desire to labor among the leprosy settlement, and when the opportunity presented itself, he quickly volunteered.

Writing in 1873, the same year that Damien and Napela met, Charles de Varigny wrote that the native Hawaiian "believes the Catholic priest when he describes the Protestant missionary as a wolf in sheep's clothing; but he also believes the Protestant minister who speaks of the Catholic priest as an idolator, and of his ritual tainted with paganism" (quoted in Tayman, <i>The Colony,</i> 91).<br><br>13.

It should be understood that not all the patients were in this immoral state. Linda Greene writes, "While in the settlement's earliest days lawlessness and vice resulting from frustration and despair were rampant, there was also a group of people who had been avid churchgoers in their former lives" (<i>Exile in Paradise,</i> 55). A group of 35 of these Protestant patients at the close of 1866 formed a church called the Church of the Healing Spring. In fact, it would be a Protestant minister (Pastor Heulu) and his deacons who would pave the way for Damien, as many in the settlement first shunned him upon arrival. When Father Damien was shunned when he arrived at the colony, these Protestants urged their congregation and all patients to accept him. See Ethel M.

<h1>Case Someone Asks, I Will Be Ready - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning, brothers and sisters. My wife and I are greatly honored to be with you enthusiastic students at this wonderful university. I have titled my message "Just in Case Someone Asks, I Will Be Ready."<br><br>As a teenager I found a simple thought that had guided Abraham Lincoln's life. President Lincoln was asked how he was able to become the president of the United States. His self-effacing answer was, "I kept preparing myself just in case."<sup>1</sup> This down-to-earth phrase inspired me, and I began looking for ways that could prepare me to be ready for the future.<br><br>For example, as a young missionary in Brazil, I decided to learn to speak and read Portuguese 100 percent. Returning home from my mission, I didn't think I would be using Portuguese again. But two years later I took the medical school entrance exam, and, lo and behold, my Portuguese was extremely helpful because Portuguese is a strongly influenced Latin-based language--as are many medical terms. Twenty years later I returned to So Paulo, Brazil, with my family as a mission president, and 35 years after that original decision, my wife and I returned to serve in the Area Presidency in the north of Brazil. Even today the joy of speaking another language without having to interpret word for word in my mind is a mystery and a blessing.<br><br>Another example: I, like many other Church members listening to Elder Neal A. Maxwell's talks, noted that he would regularly cite from John Bartlett's <i>Familiar Quotations.</i> So I started to read Bartlett's <i>Familiar Quotations</i> to be prepared just in case someone asked <i>me</i> to give a talk in church.<br><br>Thomas Edison said, "Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work."<sup>2</sup> Likewise, Benjamin Disraeli said, "The great secret of success in life is for a man to be ready when his opportunity comes."<sup>3</sup> President Henry B. Eyring has often recalled important counsel his father gave him. That counsel was, "Hal, ... you ought to find something that you love so much that when you don't have to think about anything, that's what you think about."<sup>4</sup> For me that means we will be prepared for inspiration on a specific topic if we have been seriously contemplating it. Some, on the other hand, may conclude that it is too hard to always be preparing or to do such focused thinking. But doing hard things builds confidence and strengthens character. We learn much from those who lean hard against us.<br><br>To prepare just in case someone asks becomes even more important as the world becomes more complex. One approach in preparing ourselves is to simplify and find the "kernel" truths and thoughts. A "kernel operator" in mathematics transforms the original unwieldy and perhaps confusing problem into an easier solution. In computer technology the kernel is the central component of most operating systems. It is the core or nucleus that makes things work. In medicine this same key concept is incorporated in the word <i>pathognomonic.</i> A pathognomonic sign is a particular sign whose presence means that beyond any doubt a particular disease is present. For example, if so-called Koplik's spots are present in the mouth, a doctor's diagnosis of measles is certain. This is also similar to the well-known mathematical statement of proof: <i>If and only if</i> the necessary and sufficient condition A is met; <i>then</i> condition B is true.<br><br>To prepare and simplify our lives is like finding those kernel operators, determining the necessary and sufficient conditions or discovering the pathognomonic signs so we can have confidence in our actions and do the right things for the right reasons. We know the scriptures are very clear about certain laws, bounds, and conditions as well: "And unto every kingdom is given a law; and unto every law there are certain bounds also and conditions."<sup>5</sup> Also, "There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated."<sup>6</sup><br><br>Embracing key scriptures and doctrines can help us simplify and prepare for life's important decisions. The words God uses in the scriptures and the words of the living prophets will help us find our way, especially today.<br><br>One such kernel scripture comes from the words of the prophet Micah and gives great strength and clarity of direction. In Micah 6:6–8 we read:<br><br><i>Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?</i><br><br><i>Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?</i><br><br><i>He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thyGod?</i><br><br>The Lord tells us what is good and what pleases Him.<sup>7</sup> Certainly a core message here teaches us "to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God." Note that the Lord gives us only three things to remember; this kernel, therefore, simplifies our direction and gives great clarity to our actions.<br><br><b>First,</b> we notice that the Lord <i>requires</i> us to do justly. The Old Testament Hebrew word for <i>just</i> means to do right,<sup>8</sup> to do righteousness, or to "have a . . . just weight"<sup>9</sup> or balance<sup>10</sup> when measuring something.<sup>11</sup> In today's vernacular, to do justly may also mean to be fair in our treatment of one another. In Portuguese, for example, the words <i>just</i> and <i>fair</i> are the same word: <i>justo.</i> Doing "that which [is] right in the sight of the Lord"<sup>12</sup> helps us become a justperson.<br><br>A just man's character, how he thinks and how he desires to learn all that he can, is described in Proverbs, chapter 9: "Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase inlearning."<sup>13</sup><br><br>We recall Elder David A. Bednar's recent comment: "Learning to love learning is central to the gospel of Jesus Christ."<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/david-a-bednar_learning-love-learning/"><sup>14</sup></a> Hence, the things we put into our soul mold our unique character and individual identity. For all of our efforts in learning the truth and doing "that which [is] right in the sight of the Lord," the Lord promises this wonderful blessing:<br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his</i> diligence and obedience <i>than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>The end result and blessings of being just are worth every effort. As we read in section 76 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the just "shall have part in the first resurrection."<sup>16</sup><br><br>[They] <i>are sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise....</i><br><br><i>They are . . . given all things.</i><br><br><i>They . . . have received of his fulness, and of hisglory. . . .</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, . . . they are gods, even the sons ofGod. . . .</i><br><br>[And] <i>these shall dwell in the presence of God and his Christ forever and ever.</i><sup>17</sup><br><br><b>Second,</b> as we saw in Micah 6:8, the Lord <i>requires</i> us "to love mercy." <i>Mercy</i> from the Old Testament Hebrew word has the connotation of gentleness, kindliness, grace, forgiveness, and compassion upon anyone.<sup>18</sup> These are attributes of God. Certainly we desire God's mercy toward us and are happy, like Enoch, to know that "mercy shall go before [His] face and have no end."<sup>19</sup> But the Lord also gives to us the commandment "Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful"<sup>20</sup> and tells us, "Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy."<sup>21</sup><br><br>Daily life seems to teach us that the foundation and enabling power for doing justly comes from a heart full of compassion. Notice the Savior's instruction to the Nephites: "What manner of men ought ye to be? Verily . . . , even as I am."<sup>22</sup> These words came <i>after</i> the Lord had taught the principles of compassion, grace, and mercy. The Lord encourages us to rely on His grace, saying:<br><br><i>My grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me;</i> [now notice the "necessary and sufficient" condition He gives us] <i>for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</i><sup>23</sup><br><br><b>Third,</b> we are told in Micah 6:8 that the Lord <i>requires</i> us "to walk humbly with . . . God." The Old Testament Hebrew word <i>humble</i> connotes to bow down, to bow our heads, or "to be low in situation."<sup>24</sup> We recall Enoch feeling overwhelmed with the Lord's command to call his people to repentance: "And when Enoch had heard these words, he bowed himself to the earth, before the Lord."<sup>25</sup> Enoch prostrated himself before the Lord; then he was ready for the Lord's instruction. It seems very significant that when we bow our heads in prayer, we also get ourselves ready for the Lord's instruction to our hearts and minds.<br><br>There are many things that cause us to "bow our head," humbling us every day. At times we may actually control situations. For example, an engineer controls the construction of a bridge or building; a doctor controls a surgical procedure--both see positive outcomes. They may conclude that their skill guaranteed the outcome. But at other times we experience circumstances in our lives seemingly beyond our control, such as getting a bad case of the flu on the day of our biggest final exam or our car breaking down on the way to an important interview. The unexpected seemingly occurs at the worst possible time.<br><br>Many in the world conclude that because of this apparent randomness, no one is in control--and, further, that no one can know the future. But the scriptures and the prophets affirm that God is not only master of the universe but "is in the details"<sup>26</sup> and "know[s] the end from the beginning."<sup>27</sup> He "knoweth all things, for all things are present before [His] eyes."<sup>28</sup> It has been said, "The great act of faith is when man decides that he is not God."<sup>29</sup> When we so decide and accept the limits of our external control, we are powerfully sustained by faith in God. We trust His timing and have confidence in His plan.<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell observed: "Because we are eternal beings, time is not our natural dimension. . . . Life is so designed that we constantly feel time . . . and its prickly presence."<sup>30</sup><br><br>We feel this "prickly presence" when unexpected, undesired circumstances irritate us; yet it is those events that mold our character. Perhaps the difficult situations in our lives teach us what it is that we may truly control: ourselves, our thoughts, our words, our deeds,<sup>31</sup> and our reaction to life's unexpected events. President James E. Faust reminded us, "It's not so much what happens to us but how we deal with what happens to us."<sup>32</sup> Recognizing our personal responsibility and exercising self-control make repentance possible and strengthen our character. Each day tests how we will react to unexpected circumstances, for the same set of circumstances can bring either resentment or gratitude.<br><br>Another test may be how we react when those who don't live God's commandments seem to get ahead in the world while we, trying very hard to serve the Lord, don't seem to have much outward success. But in 3 Nephi, chapter 24, the Lord reorients us, saying:<br><br><i>Your words have been stout against me, saith the Lord. Yet ye say: What have we spoken against thee?</i><br><br><i>Ye have said: It is vain to serve God, and what doth it profit that we have kept his ordinances and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord ofHosts?</i><br><br><i>And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.</i><br><br><i>Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another, and the Lord hearkened and heard; and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name.</i><br><br><i>And they shall be mine, saith the Lord of Hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.</i><sup>33</sup><br><br>Hence, even though we may set goals, establish procedures, make plans, and act nobly, we may not control the immediate results. We must continue, however, to seek thegood, establish the right, and walk humbly in the full faith that God <i>guarantees</i> the just and merciful outcome.<br><br>The courage to vigorously move ahead thusly was echoed by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow:<br><br><i>The heights by great men reached and kept</i><br><br><i>Were not attained by sudden flight,</i><br><br><i>But they, while their companions slept,</i><br><br><i>Were toiling upward in the night.</i><sup>34</sup><br><br>Or, as stated simply by President Harold B. Lee, "It is the pursuit of easy things that makes men weak."<sup>35</sup> The pursuit of hard things makes men strong.<br><br>A key scripture from the Book of Mormon can help in our personal preparation: "For every man receiveth wages of him whom he listeth to obey."<sup>36</sup> This scripture is pointing to the fact that the master to whom we incline will be the one who will reward us--either we incline to the Savior, who will grant us eternal life, or we lean toward Satan, from whom we will receive spiritual death.<sup>37</sup><br><br>We recognize the verb <i>list</i> means to tilt, incline, or move off center just a little bit. It is like when we slightly move off center in a canoe. The canoe quickly lists and finally tips us overboard.<sup>38</sup> <i>Listing</i> may also connote leaning first to one side and then leaning to the other side. We know the result of rocking back and forth in a canoe--overboard we go again! The Apostle James wisely taught, "A double minded man is unstable in all his ways."<sup>39</sup><br><br>Similarly, the Lord said to John the Revelator:<br><br><i>I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.</i><br><br><i>So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.</i><sup>40</sup><br><br><i>Listing</i> may also suggest being carried awayon the subtle "ever learning"<sup>41</sup> breeze. The Apostle Paul described our day as follows: "In the last days . . . men shall be lovers of their own selves, . . . ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth."<sup>42</sup><br><br>Ever learning may be interesting, but we cannot sample from every intriguing corner of life. We are reminded: "It is not a matter of <i>if</i> [we will accept divine truth]. It is a matter of <i>when.</i>"<sup>43</sup> We are told in Philippians that "every knee should bow . . . and . . . every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord."<sup>44</sup><br><br>At times we can't discern whether we are tilting or not. Hence we need guides--especially the Holy Ghost--to point out the slight adjustments we need to make in our lives as we begin to tip or list; thusly, we do not waste time and can more safely reach our ultimate goal. The Book of Mormon prophet Jacob counseled those who "are pure in heart" to "look unto God with firmness of mind, and pray unto him with exceeding faith, . . . and receive the pleasing word of God, and feast upon his love; for yemay, if your minds are firm, forever."<sup>45</sup><br><br>Mahatma Gandhi gave some salient guide points as well. He said sin is the following:<br><ul><br> 	<li>Politics without principle</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Wealth without work</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Pleasure without conscience</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Knowledge without character</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Commerce without morality</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Science without humanity</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Worship without sacrifice<sup>46</sup></li><br></ul><br>Indeed, we too can learn much by observation, and we can learn even more by allowing our guides to give us suggestions. President James E. Faust said:<br><br><i>Learning by experience has value, but the "school of hard knocks" is deserving of its name. Progression comes faster and easier by learning from our parents, those who love us, and our teachers. We can also learn from the mistakes of others, observing the consequences of their wrong choices.</i><sup>47</sup><br><br>So, we simply need to catch ourselves before we tilt too far. Those studying electrical engineering know that feedback loops prevent circuits from becoming unstable. Even experienced pilots will encounter sensory illusions or worse if they make slow-banking turns without visual references. The hair cells of the human vestibular apparatus can't discern the correct bearing, and the pilot quickly loses his sense of reality. Like those visual references maintaining stability, our guides can become "a lamp unto [our] feet,"<sup>48</sup> helping us see the important signposts before we list too far. We can then make the slight adjustments to any listing. Although humbling, we will receive yet another promise: "Because thou hast seen thy weakness, thou shalt be made strong."<sup>49</sup> How encouraging! The Lord wants us to see our own weaknesses, and then His "grace is sufficient" for us all as we come to Him.<br><br>When we understand and accept true principles, our decisions do become clearer and less confusing. Thus, acceptance of the truths can make us free<sup>50</sup>--free from ambivalence, ambiguity, tentativeness, excuse making, and ignorance. Accepting truths requires obeying the feelings of the Spirit, having self-discipline, and then courageously living "that which [is] right in the sight of the Lord." Describing this type of courage, Elder Neal A. Maxwell said:<br><br><i>It will take the same kind of spunk the Spartans displayed at Thermopylae when they tenaciously held a small mountain pass against overwhelming numbers of Persians. . . . The Spartans were told that if they did not give up, the Persians had so many archers in their army that they would darken the skies with their arrows. The Spartans said simply, "So much the better, we will fight in the shade!"</i><sup>51</sup><br><br>With this type of courage, we can accept a true principle as it really is, without debate, sidestepping, or hesitancy. Thus, by following the impressions of the Holy Ghost, we will find solutions<sup>52</sup> and wisely use our precious gift of time. The power in truth gives complete commitment to our lives and clarity to our decisions. We gain the certainty that our "course [in] life . . . is according to [God's] will,<sup>53</sup> and our divine character emerges.<br><br>As the restored truths sink into our soul, we become more keenly aware that <i>only</i> the power of the redemption and the resurrection of Jesus Christ can and does preserve our individual divine identity. It is this power that requires that the grave "<i>must</i> deliver up the spirits [and <i>must</i>] deliver up the body; . . . and all men <i>become </i>incorruptible, and immortal, ... living souls."<sup>54</sup> In fact, these restored truths and doctrinal declarations create an intensification of our individual identity and a greater awareness and gratitude for the power of the redemption of the Son of God.<br><br>President James E. Faust said, "Without turning back to the word of our Creator, no one is wise enough to sort out what ethical, spiritual, and moral values should be taught to the next generation."<sup>55</sup><br><br>May we search for, find, and embrace the kernel truths, thus simplifying our lives so that our decisions can be "yea, yea" or "nay, nay."<sup>56</sup> We want to be ready when the Lord asks--for <i>He will ask. </i>He said to John the Revelator, "To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne."<sup>57</sup> The Lord is so gracious. He further prepares us for that day, saying:<br><br><i>I give unto you these sayings that you may understand and know how to worship, and know what you worship, that you may come unto the Father in my name, and in due time receive of his fulness.</i><sup>58</sup><br><br>May we also move from grace to grace, as did the Lord, and in due time receive of the fulness of the Father is my prayer for all. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Robert R.

<h1>ner of Men and Women  Ought Ye to Be? - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Sister Burton and I, along with some of our family, including three Brigham Young University students and a Utah State University student, and a pretty friend, Crystal Ming, who is attending at the institute of religion at the University of Washington, are delighted to be with you this Sabbath evening. Barbara and I dearly love to associate with the rising generation. We love your exuberance. We love your faithfulness. We love you for what you have accomplished in your young lives and for what you will yet accomplish as you serve with great distinction our Father in Heaven and one another. We love you for the virtue and goodness that shows in your faces and accompanies your very presence here this evening.<br><br>Two weeks ago Sister Burton and I participated in a devotional for temple workers at the Nauvoo Temple. Most of those marvelous people are several generations older than most of you. We felt the presence of a wonderful spirit on that occasion in that glorious house. We feel that same sweet spirit as we visit with you tonight. Nevertheless, you are a bit intimidating as you gather in large numbers, both in this remarkable building on this beautiful campus and in many other places throughout the world via satellite and technology.<br><br>I will never forget my first speaking experience at a general conference. The invitation I received to speak indicated that I was to speak for 14 minutes in the Sunday morning session and to follow President Howard W. Hunter. Needless to say, the circumstances were very intimidating for me on that occasion as well. A week or so before the general conference, I met Elder Russell M. Nelson in the hall, and he inquired about how my talk was progressing. Iconfided to Elder Nelson that I was struggling with my preparation, and then it occurred to me that the only reason he knew I was speaking was because his invitation must have indicated that he was to follow me. So, armed with that very vital little piece of information, I boldly asked Elder Nelson why someone as green and scared as I would be placed between President Hunter and himself. He thought for a moment, and then, with that ever-present twinkle he always has in his eye, he said, "Bishop, the only reason I can think of is that you have been placed there by inspiration to make us look good." The intimidation level rose to an all-time high after that little exchange.<br><h2><b>"Will You Ever Make Something ofYourself?"</b></h2><br>Nearly a half century ago, just prior to my missionary experience in Australia, I had the great blessing to work for about four years in a golf shop for an extraordinary Scottish golf professional. His name was Alex McCafferty. He was not of our faith, and though he had lived among Latter-day Saint people for well over 25 years, he did not really understand our doctrine or the gospel. He was a splendid man to work for, and I will be ever grateful for his generosity and his many kindnesses. His patient tutoring in the fine points of the game of golf helped me become successful in some of my youthful competitive experiences and also allowed me to enjoy a lifetime of recreational golf. On occasion his language, wrapped in a very heavy Scottish accent, could be just a little bit colorful. When my work didn't meet Alex's expectations or when I made a mistake in serving a patron, he would, in a very soft but very firm Scottish voice, utter an expletive followed by the same question: "David, my boy, will you ever make something of yourself?"<br><br>I still remember the exact words Alex used when I finally gathered the courage to inform him that I had accepted a call from a prophet of God to serve for two years as a missionary in Australia; hence, I would be leaving his employ. On this occasion his response was preceded by several expletives and then the declaration, "David, my boy, you'll never make anything of yourself by fluttering around the world speaking about religion."<br><br>A day or two before I departed for my mission, I stopped by to say good-bye to my good friend Alex. As I shook his hand and offered expressions of appreciation, he drew me close and placed in my hand an envelope. We both had a tear or two in our eyes as I quickly walked to my car. I drove for just a fewminutes to a nearby park where, in the solitude of the surroundings, I read his note and found he had placed a goodly sum of money in the envelope to help me finance mymission.<br><br>About one year later, while I was serving in Adelaide, Australia, I received a note from Alex. The note said: "David, my boy, they tell me a missionary needs a new suit after one year. Please, with this money, buy you a suit made of the finest Scottish wool."<br><br>A few days after returning from Australia, I stopped by the golf course to renew our acquaintance. Alex asked if I was ready to play golf. I told him my days of serious golf were over, as I had sold my clubs and car to help defray the costs of my mission and, in addition, it was long past time when I really needed to get serious about my education.<br><br>He replied, starting with the usual expletive: "David, my boy, you will never make something of yourself if you don't play golf. You go right into that golf shop and pick out a set of clubs of your choice."<br><br>I did just that, and after nearly 50 years I still have those clubs. Of course I didn't appreciate Alex's colorful language, but I will ever be grateful for the lessons of honesty, integrity, and generosity that I learned while in his employ.<br><br>Over the years I have often reflected on Alex's question: Will you ever make something of yourself? Alex was, in his own way, expressing his displeasure with me. He was questioning my capacity to follow directions; he was questioning my attention to the tasks at hand and my job commitment. He was also questioning whether there was a desire on my part to be a successful, productive, and contributing adult. I have pondered those questions over and over again. I must admit that they were great questions then and they still remain great questions today. I am still a work in progress. I have also concluded that Alex was questioning my life's achievements and not so much life's journey. His question, however, does beg the question, What constitutes success in this life?<br><h2><b>Acquire Christlike Attributes</b></h2><br>Perhaps a better question for us to focus on is not whether we will make something of ourselves and, therefore, be successful in the eyes of the world but rather the question posed by the Savior Himself: "Therefore, what manner of men [and women] ought ye to be?" You recall that the response was, in His words, "Verily I say unto you, even as I am" (3 Nephi 27:27). Further, the Savior indicated, "For that which ye have seen me do even that shall ye do" (v. 21).<br><br>What manner of men and women ought ye to be? In my ponderings, I continue to ask: What are the attributes of a Christlike life? What is the appropriate pattern to use in coping with the challenges of life? What does it mean to be "even as I am"? I certainly don't know all that is expected, but attributes like love of God and fellowmen, compassion, example, obedience, service, and keeping covenants may be just a few.<br><br>Recently an acquaintance of ours, and a good, close friend of our daughter and son-in-law, passed away after a gallant and prolonged battle with a brain tumor. Just prior to his passing, one of his friends sent a bit of prose poetry expressing his feelings to our friend's wife. With their permission I share its contents, not for its literary excellence, but rather for the feeling conveyed. It starts:<br><br>[Dear] <i>Diane,</i><br><i>Please tell Harold "thank you,"</i><br><i>For changing my life,</i><br><i>And showing me an example</i><br><i>Of priesthood leadership,</i><br><i>Of caring for the one,</i><br><i>Of selfless, tireless service,</i><br><i>And true, Christlike love.</i><br><br><i>Please tell Harold of the many memories</i><br><i>That I carry with me each day</i><br><i>That strengthen me,</i><br><i>And guide me--</i><br><i>Memories he gave me</i><br><i>When I served with him. ...</i><br><br><i>Please tell Harold how his example,</i><br><i>As a loving husband</i><br><i>And kind father,</i><br><i>As a faithful servant of the Lord,</i><br><i>Full of humor,</i><br><i>Full of vision,</i><br><i>Has given me a standard to reach for</i><br><i>And has blessed the lives of my own wife andchildren.</i><br><br><i>Please tell Harold it was a great honor</i><br><i>To have known him in this mortal life</i><br><i>And to have served with him.</i><br><br><i>Please tell Harold of the tears I shed,</i><br><i>And the pain in my heart,</i><br><i>To know he will soon return</i><br><i>And report.</i><br><br><i>Please tell Harold I love him</i><br><i>For his kindness,</i><br><i>His example,</i><br><i>And his friendship.</i><br><br><i>Please tell Harold I will miss him</i><br><i>But will eagerly prepare myself</i><br><i>To rejoice with him again</i><br><i>In the heavenly courts of the Most High God.</i><br><br><i>Please tell Harold I will serve the Lord</i><br><i>With all my heart, might, mind, and strength</i><br><i>In memory of his example,</i><br><i>And dedication,</i><br><i>And devotion to the Lord.</i><br><br><i>Please tell Harold ...</i><br><i>Thank you.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>The "please tell Harold" attributes may also be worthy of our incorporating in <i>our</i> lives. When virtues such as example, priesthood power, caring for the one, service, love, being a loving husband and father, kindness, friendship, devotion, and dedication can be ascribed to us, as they were so beautifully to Harold, certainly our lives can be deemed Christlike, hence, fulfilling and successful.<br><br>President Thomas S. Monson often refers to his Scottish heritage and his experiences as a young boy living in close proximity to his Scottish grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. I have to wonder how many times he heard something similar to "Tommy, my boy, are you ever going to amount to something?" Isuspect that as a boy with a very wide variety of interests, a very creative and imaginative mind, and a whole lot of energy, he may have been asked that question more than just a few times.<br><br>President Monson's life gives us a pattern to follow in our own lives. This is particularly true in what I call his private ministry. His public ministry, on the other hand, is an open book, filled with outstanding service at the ward, stake, mission, and general Church levels. I doubt there has been anyone in this dispensation more devoted to each of his ecclesiastical assignments than President Thomas S. Monson.<br><br>From time to time we get a glimpse into his private ministry. Serving, being concerned, reaching out and blessing the one, and offering encouragement and comfort--these are all integral parts of his private ministry.<br><br>Recently a lovely neighbor across the street from me required a short stay in a rehabilitation facility. When my wife, Barbara, and I visited her, she couldn't wait to tell us that President Monson had dropped by their sacrament meeting.<br><br>"He was so close," she exclaimed, "that Icould reach out and touch him."<br><br>Oh how thrilled she was to feel that the president of the Church was concerned about her.<br><br>President Monson lives by the creed he often teaches: The five most important words in the English language are <i>I am proud of you.</i> The four most important are <i>What is your opinion?</i> The three most important are <i>If you please.</i> The two most important are <i>Thank you.</i> The least important is <i>I.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>The Savior often used parables to teach important lessons. Likewise, President Monson loves to use stories to illustrate his teachings. President Henry B. Eyring, reflecting on President Monson's use of stories, said that you will think you have heard the story before, but if you are patient and listen intently, you will find the stories are not the same because the Spirit will prompt you to receive the message in a different way.<br><br>One of the stories President Monson uses comes from his days as a deacon. He and the other members of his quorum were apparently assigned to be Eskimos in the ward's road show. President Monson's sister was playing the part of Lady Liberty. When his sister came down with a severe case of laryngitis just at the critical performance time, it was feared that she would not be able to speak her lines and the show would be impaired. The "Eskimos" decided to do something about this situation. They gathered in the room in the basement of their meetinghouse and knelt in prayer. They sought the Lord's intervening Spirit in behalf of President Monson's sister. At the appointed time, Lady Liberty was able to deliver her lines with a clear voice. President Monson's sister remembered the experience as being a miracle in her life and was grateful for those Eskimos.<br><br>This very simple story reminds us that President Monson has always been a person of great faith and a person of prayer. He uses those great gifts to bless the lives of many today. He is an example of what manner of men and women we ought to be--people of faith and people of prayer. Prayer is essential to our own personal strength and conviction. Remember Nephi's question to his disbelieving brethren: "Have ye inquired of the Lord?" (1Nephi 15:8). President Monson's life of service is a pattern we could use to define and structure our own lives.<br><h2><b>Pray for Help in Making Decisions</b></h2><br>Many of you are at a stage of life when you will be making decisions that will shape your earthly lives as well as your eternal lives. Some of you are in the process of making decisions about your education. Others of you may be contemplating a mission. Many may be endeavoring to decide what you wish to do for a career or life's work. Perhaps some of you may be trying to decide if someone is the right person to be your eternal companion. These decisions will be much easier if you take them before the Lord in prayer.<br><br>A few of you may be struggling with sin and are trying to decide if you wish to be cleansed by the atoning power of Jesus Christ. Some of you may be faltering in your testimonies of the gospel and trying to determine what can be done to reverse the direction. Decisions about these and other important matters will have a huge impact on what manner of men and women you will be and what you will accomplish during your lifetime, or, using my friend Alex's words, what you will make of yourselves.<br><br>Life's really critical and life-shaping decisions are usually very difficult to make. There are always those little ifs, ands, or buts that tend to complicate and delay the answer. I have often wished that there was a magic pill we could take that would cause us to always make the optimal decision. But lacking that magic pill, may I offer just one suggestion to aid you in your decision-making process? Seek the participation of our Father in Heaven through humble prayer, and then have the faith and determination to follow His counsel as conveyed by the Holy Spirit. The Lord asks that we study things out in our minds and then ask Him. He promises, "I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right" (D&amp;amp;C 9:8). The manner of men and women you will become will be enhanced as you listen to and obey the still, small voice. Remember, part of listening is "feel[ing] that it is right."<br><br>In the United States, we've just concluded another baseball season. The World Series has ended, and a new champion has been crowned. Well over 50 years ago, a very fine athlete began playing left field for the Boston Red Sox. His career in baseball was interrupted on at least two different occasions by calls to serve in the military as a fighter pilot. The media referred to him as the "Splendid Splinter" because he was very thin in stature but very adept at hitting a baseball. His major claim to fame as it relates to sports is that he was the very last major league player to have a batting average over .400 for the entire year. This means he was successful in getting on base because of hitting the baseball more than four times for each 10 times he was up to bat. No one has been able to duplicate his feat in the last half century. That player's name was Ted Williams.<br><br>Many years after Ted completed his baseball career, the public learned something very interesting about him--his eyesight, as it turned out, was better than 20/20. And with this excellent and extraordinary eyesight, Ted had just a little advantage in that he could see the ball a little better than other players and had an additional microsecond to determine if he should swing at the pitch. He could see if the ball was spinning or if the ball was going to curve in or out of the strike zone.<br><br>We who have been baptized and have received the gift of the Holy Ghost as a constant companion also have an advantage when it comes to making difficult decisions. Just as success in real estate matters is described as "location, location, location," taking advantage of the Holy Ghost is listen, listen, listen!<br><h2><b>Don't Be Discouraged</b></h2><br>I sometimes worry and am somewhat embarrassed, frankly, that my generation has burdened your generation with issues and challenges that we should have resolved. While much progress has been made in making life better, longer, safer, and more fulfilling, there remains much to lament relating to greed, relationships, and environment, to name just a few. We are facing the uncertainties that arise out of the turbulent times we are in. It could be very easy to be discouraged and perhaps even be a little depressed as we think about the array of potential impacts. The uncertainties of the job market coupled with significant economic dislocation all add to the uneasiness of our day. Nations continue to contend against one another.<br><br>In spite of all of this, my young friends, we need not fear nor take counsel from our fears. The scriptures remind us that if we are <i>prepared,</i> if we are <i>obedient,</i> and if we are <i>members</i> of the Lord's Church, we need not fear what the future holds. "The righteous need not fear" (1 Nephi 22:22; see also Alma 1:4; D&amp;amp;C 10:55). What manner of men and women we will be, in part, will be influenced by how well we handle the fearsome and unforeseen aspects of life. Realizing that real life is made up of struggles, problems, mistakes, opportunities, and lessons, please remember the old Chinese proverb that says, "The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor man perfected without trials." Stated in the Lord's terms, "For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things" (2Nephi 2:11).<br><br>In spite of all the world's uncertainties and shortcomings, there is so very much to be grateful for and very excited about. I am an optimist. I have come to believe that 2008 is the most exciting time in the history of the world to be alive and have the supernal blessing of having the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ available to us. My very spine tingles as I watch the gospel being established in the hearts and minds of Father in Heaven's children around this globe.<br><br>I suspect few, if any, of you know what occurs at Church headquarters each year on the first Friday of December. That is the day traditionally set aside for the convening of the Council on the Disposition of the Tithes, as directed by the Lord in section 120 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Under the direction of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve and the Presiding Bishopric all meet together to determine how the resources of the Church will be used in the coming year. It's exciting to see what comes out of that meeting. It's exciting to see the many new places of worship that are authorized and constructed. The number of new temples continues to grow. Bishops all over the world are provided the resources to seek out and help the poor. Missionaries in more than 350 missions are sustained. Projects to accelerate the work of temples are approved. Funds are set aside to facilitate higher education and religious education. The work of the Lord marches on to achieve its prophetic destiny.<br><br>I take courage when I think of the great statement of faith made by the Prophet Joseph Smith: "No unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing."<sup>3</sup> Isn't it exciting to realize that you and I will have the opportunity to be at the forefront of this miracle that is destined to occur? What manner of men and women you will be will in part be a function of your devotion and assistance in moving His kingdom forward. Along with devotion, much self-discipline is required. Jim Rohn, a noted motivational speaker, said, "Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment."<sup>4</sup><br><br>I love sacred music, particularly hymns of praise or motivation. One such hymn we often sing is "Come, Let Us Anew." The words were penned in the 1700s by Charles Wesley, and the music is attributed to James Lucas. This marvelous and outstanding choir from the Utah State University will sing this beautiful hymn for us as we conclude our evening together. Latter-day Saints gather in sacrament meetings, devotionals, and other settings to sing, pray, and renew covenants and commitment, as well as to offer mutual encouragement one to another. We get a synergistic type of renewal when we meet together. Music plays an important role in this process. It has the capacity to soothe our souls and sensitize our spirits on heavenly things. The Lord has reminded us that "the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me" (D&amp;amp;C 25:12). Please take note of the lyrics of this hymn of encouragement:<br><br><i>Come, let us anew our journey pursue,</i><br><i>Roll round with the year,</i><br><i>And never stand still till the Master appear.</i><br><i>His adorable will let us gladly fulfill,</i><br><i>And our talents improve</i><br><i>By the patience of hope and the labor of love. ...</i><br><br><i>Our life as a dream, our time as a stream</i><br><i>Glide swiftly away,</i><br><i>And the fugitive moment refuses to stay;</i><br><i>For the arrow is flown and the moments are gone.</i><br><i>The millennial year</i><br><i>Presses on to our view, and eternity's here. . . .</i><br><br><i>Oh, that each in the day of His coming may say,</i><br><i>"I have fought my way thru;</i><br><i>I have finished the work thou didst give me to do."</i><br><i>Oh, that each from his Lord may receive the glad word:</i><br><i>"Well and faithfully done;</i><br><i>Enter into my joy and sit down on my throne."</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>The message of encouragement conveyed in this hymn is clear. It suggests that in our quest to become as the Savior suggested, "even as I am," we must often renew our enthusiasm and never stand still in our good works until the Master appears. If we delay, time will pass us by and the fugitive moment will forever be gone. Each of us, in the day of His coming, will want to report, "I have fought my way thru; I have finished the work thou didst give me to do." And great will be the feeling when in response we hear, "Well and faithfully done; enter into my joy and sit down on my throne." This can be our lot if our objective is to be the manner of men and women the great I Am suggests we be.<br><br>Often members of our Church are critically scrutinized and sometimes held to a higher standard than our friends of other faiths. Have you ever noticed that often in reporting the news the media will resort to headlines like "Mormon Bishop Commits ... ," "Former LDS Missionary Involved in ... ," or "Mormon Mom Indicted for ..."? What we do in our anonymity is just as important as what we do when observed in public. Often there are eyes watching us from many unseen vantage points. In many ways we live in a glass house.<br><br>A few months ago I was repairing a broken water line. In the process, my clothes got wet and muddy and my arms were covered in grease. When I discovered that I needed a small part to repair the line, rather than taking the time to clean myself up, I jumped in the car and drove to Home Depot. As I was carefully examining the array of parts to make sure that I purchased the right size with the right thread spacing, a man I did not know walked down the aisle and passed behind me. As he walked a few feet beyond me, I heard him say, "That doesn't look like the Presiding Bishop to me." Iwas embarrassed beyond words because I had failed to live up to the standard expected. This time I asked myself critically, "David, my boy, are you ever going to learn?"<br><h2><b>Focus on What Is Most Important</b></h2><br>Ambition and hard work are vital ingredients in achieving worthy objectives. You are a generation of great promise. You have been endowed with many God-given gifts. You're bright; you're intelligent. Those of you who use your intelligence to achieve well-conceived goals are destined to be successful. But those of you who are intelligent, goal-oriented, and ambitious will likely be the manner of men and women our Father in Heaven is depending upon to move His kingdom forward.<br><br>Near the end of my mission, the World Cup Golf Tournament was held at the Royal Melbourne golf course in Melbourne, Australia, and amateur golfers were given an opportunity to play with a professional in the pretournament practice rounds. On the very last day of my mission, I was able to participate in this practice round, although I won't bore you with the details of how that occurred. When it was my turn to draw from the hat the name of the professional I was to play with that day, I drew the name of Arnold Palmer. Talk about intimidation associated with speaking at general conference! That level of intimidation was only a very small part of the amount I felt the second I saw "Arnold Palmer" on my slip. I, of course, hadn't had a golf club in my hands for over two years, and I was, to use the vernacular of today, totally stressed out!<br><br>I don't remember much about the round of golf except that I played very poorly. On the 17th hole we hit our tee shots. We walked a few feet, and I hit my second shot, and shortly thereafter my third before we arrived at Mr. Palmer's ball. The young Australian man caddying for Mr. Palmer was trying very, very hard to please him. I overheard the caddy tell Mr. Palmer that on the left the topography sloped, with a stream meandering down and hidden from view. He then said that on the right the grass had been allowed to grow very, very long and was really difficult to swing a club through.<br><br>Mr. Palmer very precisely placed his club back into the bag and quietly but firmly said to the young caddy, "Please don't clutter my mind with what is out on the right, and I'm not terribly interested in what is on the left. The only piece of information that I require from you is the exact distance from this ball to the flag on the green."<br><br>My, that was a powerful learning experience for me. I suddenly realized the criticality of focusing on what is important and not being distracted by what may be on the left or what might be on the right. Focus is so essential in achieving our goals. Too many of us are concerned about what's on the right and what's on the left, and we fail to adequately focus on the principal objective that is right down the middle. When we fail to focus on the right things, it is difficult to become the manner of men and women that we desperately want to be. In this endeavor, remember that the Lord has promised: "I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up" (D&amp;amp;C 84:88).<br><br>I pray that we will always endeavor in our lives to focus on matters of most importance. I testify that we are on the Lord's errand. We are blessed to be led by living prophets. I have been blessed to have served under the direction of four prophets of this dispensation. I think I know something about prophets and testify that Thomas Spencer Monson is a prophet of God in every sense of the word.<br><br>I know we have a loving and living Father in Heaven. We are His sons and daughters. I'm grateful for His Only Begotten Son, who is our Savior, who atoned for our sins. For all of you who may feel lost, or feel you are devoid of hope, or feel that sin has impaired your progress, I testify that His Atonement is available and His mercy endureth forever. Iknow that Joseph Smith was the prophet of the Restoration.<br><br>I take this opportunity to invoke the blessings of heaven upon each one of you. This blessing I invoke, praying that you may be responsive and determined to be the manner of men and women our Father in Heaven wishes for you to be, and I do so by the authority vested in me and in the holy name of Jesus Christ, our Savior and our Redeemer, amen.<br><br><i>H.

<h1>ope, and You - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am grateful to be with you today. I know that I am in the presence of a most outstanding group of young people--you who are earnestly striving to achieve in both your spiritual and temporal lives. As I look into your faces, I see goodness, optimism, determination, and hope for the future. I am particularly grateful to be with you at such an important time when you are preparing for your life that will shortly go beyond the safety and sanctuary of school--a life that some of you may see as bleak and concerning and that others will see as full of excitement and opportunity. As I pondered andprayed about what I might say to you today, I could not dismiss the promptings to talk to you about what lies ahead as you move into the world that you will soon become a part of. I pray for the Lord's inspiration as I visit with you. I begin by relating a personal experience.<br><br>Some 30 years ago I was working for a corporation headquartered in the United States that had international operations. We had recently hired a Jewish man to run our European businesses. It was known by many in the corporation that as a young boy he had been torn from the safety and the love of his family and thrust into a Nazi concentration camp for the duration of World War II. Since he and I shared some responsibilities for our European operations, we occasionally traveled to Europe together. On one such trip, after we had become well acquainted and I felt it not inappropriate, I inquired about his terrible experiences during those several years of his life.<br><br>As I remember the details, he told me that when he was five years old, his father, mother, and older sister had already been taken by the Gestapo. He and his grandmother were traveling by train to find refuge when the Gestapo boarded and searched the train. He and his grandmother were discovered and taken ­separate ways, and he never again saw his grandmother. In fact, he never again saw any of his family members.<br><br>It is not my intent to describe the already known atrocities that occurred to those so confined but to relate a lesson my co-worker taught me while enduring those terrible years. As he concluded recounting his experiences, and after several minutes of contemplative silence, he then asked me this question: "Do you know what the most powerful force in the world is?"<br><br>Without hesitation I answered, "Love. Love conquers all. If only your persecutors had love for you and for their fellow man, you would not have suffered as you did."<br><br>He responded, "No, it is not love. All those years I was in the concentration camp, I had love. I had love for my mother, father, and sister. I had love for my grandmother. But that love did not sustain me. It did not keep me alive." And then he said, "Hope. Hope is the most powerful force. It was hope that kept me alive. It was hope that I would survive. It was hope for freedom. It was hope that I would someday be reunited with my loved ones."<br><br>His declaration of hope turned my mind to another experience I had as a young missionary in the New York area. After a long and tiring day of being rejected at one home after another, we finally came to a house where we were invited in. It was apparent that the lady of the house was grieving. She began the conversation by explaining that she was Jewish and that she had just lost her husband. She wanted to hear our belief about life after death. She wanted to know every detail. Would her husband be resurrected? What would he be like? Would she be resurrected? Would they see each other again? Would there be suffering? Would there be happiness?<br><br>The situation offered us an opportunity to teach and bear witness of Jesus Christ and the hope that comes from His sacrifice that was given to all mankind. We were able to explain from the Book of Mormon that Christ broke the bands of death, that all shall be raised from the dead, and that spirit and body would be reunited in its perfect frame. While we were never invited back to this lady's home, Ibelieve we gave her some hope. It was also a great reminder to two young missionaries of the love Christ has for us and the power of His infinite, eternal sacrifice that gives us eternal hope.<br><br>The suffering and the misery shown through this sister's questioning brought to mind the profound declaration of the Apostle Paul when he declared:<br><br><i>If in this life only we have hope in Christ, weareof all men most miserable.</i><br><br><i> But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.</i> [1Corinthians 15:19–20]<br><br>The scriptures often group faith, hope, and charity together. For the next few minutes I would like to talk not about faith, hope, and charity but about faith, hope, and you. I would like to talk about how the powerful twin forces of faith and hope can affect your future. The Apostle Paul, Alma, and many other prophets saw hope as the result of exercising faith. Alma explained: "Therefore if ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen, which are true" (Alma 32:21). And Moroni, in one of his final addresses, explained:<br><br><i>I would speak unto you concerning hope. How is it that ye can attain unto faith, save ye shall have hope?</i><br><br><i> And what is it ye shall hope for? . . . That ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ.</i> [Moroni 7:40–41]<br><br>And Paul further declared, "We are saved byhope" (Romans 8:24). Like the ­lifesaving motivation to a young Jewish boy in a concentration camp, hope becomes the catalyst for works that bring us to the lifesaving ordinances.<br><br>Hope is the reward we all seek: hope for a young boy held in a prison camp, hope for a Jewish lady who had just lost her beloved husband, hope that each of you have for now and for the future, hope for the families you have or will have.<br><br>However, our hope can become blurred as we live in troubled times. We live in a world today of isms--agnosticism, secularism, ­atheism, pessimism, and other isms. And today we certainly live in a time of great pessimism and concern. We face challenges both economically and spiritually. The stock market, a rather reliable index of public sentiment, has had distressing declines in value. The unemployment rate has risen from the comfortable levels we enjoyed in the past. Homes are foreclosing at an alarming rate, unusually high energy costs are affecting all of us, and so forth. But we have been through economic downturns before. Perhaps most alarming is a retreat toward a godless society as more people are moving away from faith in Deity and the establishment of basic moral values that have become the basis of a righteous life and are challenging our religious beliefs and our lifestyle.<br><br>The evidence of the decline in moral values is readily available as we see the continued rise of pornography, the rampant use of illegal drugs, cohabitating outside of marriage, and every other degenerate practice known to man.<br><br>There are two well-known and often-quoted prophecies in the Book of Mormon pertaining to our day--yes, pertaining to you and pertaining to me. First is this scripture:<br><br><i>For behold, at that day</i> [our day] <i>shall he</i> [being Satan] <i>rage in the hearts of the children of men, and stir them up to anger against that which is good.</i><br><br><i> And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security.</i> [2 Nephi 28:20–21]<br><br>And the second scripture states:<br><br><i>Wo unto them that call evil good, and good evil,that put darkness for light, and light for darkness, that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!</i> [2 Nephi 15:20]<br><br>These two scriptures indicate that Satan will "stir them up to anger against that which is good" and will "call evil good, and good evil." And this is what we face today. The righteous are accused of being intolerant and without compassion. Those attempting to live the time-honored teachings of Christ are often considered out of touch and uninformed. Those staying true to our most sacred principles are ridiculed and sometimes even persecuted. And much sin has now been accepted as mainstream, enlightened, and good. And you can name the sins.<br><br>From the beginning Satan has attempted todestroy our hope in Christ by thwarting the plan of salvation--or the great plan of happiness as referred to by Alma (see Alma 42:8). And Satan's work continues even today. He doesn't take the whole congregation all at once, but he works on each individually--one by one. He will be there during personal or family tragedy. He will be there when we are discouraged or despondent. And he will be there during the hours of confusion and questioning. He is the ultimate pessimist. He is the instigator of much discouragement. He is the father of all lies. He will use the Internet and the media, and he will use the already confused or misguided. He has his soldiers, both seen and unseen.<br><br>I review this rather dismal background not to further add to discouragement and disillusionment but as a warning as we face the forces in today's world. And yet we have every reason for optimism. We are the people of hope. We are the disseminators of hope. This is our mission. Based upon our faith, we have hope in things seen and hope in things unseen but felt. We have hope for the now in our lives. We have hope for the foreseeable and unforeseeable future. And we have hope for the eternities that lie ahead. Our hope is based upon truth, knowledge, faith, and revelation given to us by the Holy Ghost. And our victory over the obstacles of life comes from our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and our sure knowledge of His plan. This gives us hope, as eloquently explained by the prophets of old, as well as by our current prophets.<br><br>The prophet Nephi declared, "Men are, that they might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25). The Prophet Joseph Smith stated, "Happiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it" (<i>HC</i> 5:134). When the Prophet Joseph made that statement, he was only reiterating and emphasizing the fundamental purpose of our coming to the earth as declared by our Heavenly Father. However, while we hope for happiness--the personal and real measure of success--the achievement of that objective must be earned. As the Prophet Joseph Smith declared, our happiness "will be the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it." Alma explained that faith must be nurtured, even to a perfect knowledge (see Alma 32:34). Our responsibility is first to tend our own faith and then to spread our faith and our hope to others. We cannot allow ourselves to become distracted by the fluctuation of the economic barometers. We cannot allow ourselves to become distracted by attacks on the doctrine or leaders of the Church. We cannot allow ourselves to abandon faith-based principles because our faith cannot be measured ina test tube or counted in centimeters or grams. We need to hold to the iron rod and rely on the sure knowledge that comes from personal revelation. Then we keep the hope alive not only for ourselves but also for our posterity. And then our hope becomes a certainty.<br><br>In a CES fireside just a few years ago, President Boyd K. Packer instructed, "You young people, move ahead in your lives. It is a marvelous time to be alive" ("The Instrument of Your Mind and the Foundation of Your Character," 2 February 2003). President Thomas S. Monson recently confirmed that "opportunities are limitless, many things are right, and we have much to be grateful for" (General Authority training, 30 September 2008; see also "An Attitude of Gratitude," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1992, 54).<br><br>Yes, what a wonderful time to be living. What great opportunities lie ahead. I envy you. You have every reason for great hope as you enter the years ahead.<br><br>I have met people who have lost all hope because of serious sin or transgression. Repentance, they feel, is beyond their reach and forgiveness outside of their grasp. Such do not understand the cleansing power of the Atonement. Or, if they do understand, they have not internalized the meaning of Christ's suffering in Gethsemane--a suffering so great that Christ bled from every pore; a suffering so great that the Savior, even the Son of God, asked if it were possible that He be released from His divine assignment; a suffering so great that an angel of the Lord came down and stood beside the Savior. For any of us to give up hope for the cleansing and purifying of our lives is to disavow the depth, power, and extent of His suffering in our behalf.<br><br>A few years ago I had a stake conference on the East Coast. While at the conference I had the assignment to interview a young 21-year-old man to determine his worthiness and preparation to serve a mission. Now, you are aware that General Authorities do not usually interview potential missionaries for worthiness. So this was an unusual and special situation. During my flight to the East, I read some background information regarding the reasons for my interview. As I read this information, my heart ached for this boy and for his family. He had committed almost every transgression there was. I believe he invented some transgressions. I wondered why I would be asked to visit one with such a background. I had already concluded that it would be most unusual for me to approve him as a missionary.<br><br>After the Saturday evening session of conference, I retired to the stake president's office for the interview. As I was waiting with the door open, a handsome young man with a wonderful countenance and a glow about him approached. I wondered how I could excuse myself because it was apparent he wanted to talk to me and I had an appointment with a very troubled young man. When he reached me, he stuck out his hand and introduced himself. This was the young man I was to interview.<br><br>In the privacy of the office, I asked just one question: "Why am I interviewing you tonight?"<br><br>He then began to recount his sordid past--every transgression. When he was through, he began to explain the steps and the personal suffering he had gone through to prepare for this very interview. He then talked about the Atonement--the infinite power of the Atonement. He bore his testimony of the Atonement and expressed his love for the Savior. And then he said, "I believe the Savior's personal suffering in Gethsemane and His sacrifice upon the cross was powerful enough to rescue even a man like me."<br><br>Moved by the humility and testimony ofthisyoung man, and moved by the Spirit, I placed my hand on his shoulder and said, "When I get back to Salt Lake City, I am going to recommend you serve a mission as a representative of Jesus Christ." And then I said, "Iam only going to ask one thing of you. When you get into the mission field, I want you to be the best missionary in the entire Church. That is all."<br><br>Three or four months later, Sister Edgley and I were speaking at the Missionary Training Center. At the conclusion of the devotional, Iwas standing in front of the podium visiting with missionaries when I saw a young man with a familiar face walking toward me.<br><br>When he reached me, he stuck out his hand and asked, "Do you remember me?"<br><br>Somewhat embarrassed, I said, "I'm sorry, I know I should know you, but I just don't remember."<br><br>And then he said, "Let me tell you who I am. I am the best missionary in the Missionary Training Center." And I believed him.<br><br>This young man's hope was based not only upon a knowledge and testimony of the Atonement but also upon a personalization of this gift. He understood that it was for him personally! Yes, he knew the power of the Atonement and the hope it gives when all might seem lost or hopeless.<br><br>I have met people who have felt the trials they face are insurmountable and the weight is unbearable. They can't find the strength or hope to carry on, and thus they have just given up. They have literally become nonfunctional. Perhaps such people do not understand the meaning of the word <i>infinite</i> as it applies to the Atonement. They have not internalized the Atonement. They have not internalized that it was not only for sin but also for personal suffering, for pain, for disappointment, for failures, and for the tragedy that we will all experience at some time. They may understand the doctrine. They may even believe the doctrine, but they can't see it as it applies to them. They may feel unworthy or they may feel they are too distant from the Savior, and they suffer great pain.<br><br>I have met people who have no sense of self-worth. They feel that they don't measure up, that they are totally incapable, and that they are either a failure or destined to be a failure. To them, hope is only an illusive ideal far beyond their reach. Perhaps such people do not understand what it means to be a child of God, created in the image and likeness of the Only Begotten and endowed with the power and comfort of the Holy Ghost. Such people, perhaps, do not understand the divine nature of their very being, and they suffer great pain.<br><br>I have met young men and young women who were afraid to start their marriages because of unsuccessful marriages they have witnessed or because of an uncertain or a perceived frightening future. Such people do not understand the meaning of walking by faith in eternal companionships, and they suffer great pain.<br><br>I have personally observed many who have emerged from their sorrows and a state of hopelessness as they find and apply the reassuring principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. They have gained an understanding of the Atonement and their relationship with God and received the gift of the Holy Ghost with its accompanying power. And then I have seen these same people rise up out of the chains of addiction. I've seen them emerge from the shadows of low self-esteem. I have seen them conquer doubt and uncertainty. And I have seen them press forward in the hope of Christ and live happy, productive lives.<br><br>Sometimes things can look bleak, discouraging, and dark, and in the midst of our prayers and searching we end up without a comforting answer of hope or optimism. Yet we must move forward with faith and hope.<br><br>Sometimes our faith and hope become challenged as we stand at crossroads with life-defining decisions that must be made. And yet after intense study, prayer, and fasting, we still don't get the burning in our bosom that gives the comfort and assurances that we hoped for. Still, we must move forward with optimism and hope, even into the unknown and the ­currently unseen. I have personally anguished over decisions with fasting and prayer without receiving the prayed-for assurances. Of necessity I had to move forward into the unknown. But I have learned from such experiences that when one does all he can to seek assurances and then moves into the darkness with faith and hope, the confirmation as to the correctness of the decision eventually comes--sometimes days later and sometimes years later, but it comes.<br><br>As Nephi recounted his journey to retrieve the plates of Laban, he stated: "And I was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which I should do" (1 Nephi 4:6). And we read Moroni saying in the book of Ether: "Wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith" (Ether 12:6). This is what we call pressing forward with faith. This is one of the ways the Lord tests us. This is one of the ways we prove ourselves.<br><br>And so I conclude where I started. Hope is a most powerful influence in our lives. Yes indeed, we do live in a troubled and challenging world. But we live in one of the greatest periods of time in all the history of the entire world. It is a time that I believe every prophet since the creation of the earth prophesied of and looked forward to. We have every reason to be optimistic and full of hope--hope for this life, hope for our children, and hope for the eternities to come. And so I say never, never, never let Satan's power of belittlement, discouragement, or disillusionment direct your lives. Never, never, never lose hope. And never, never, never give up believing in yourself.<br><br>Christ said:<br><br><i>I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that ­abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.</i> [John 15:5]<br><br>And it was the Apostle Paul who said, "If God be for us, who can be against us?" (Romans 8:31).<br><br>I would add to Paul's declaration of hope: Since God is for us; since Christ atoned; if we really understand our divinity as a child of God; and if we truly carry the Holy Ghost asacompanion--how can we not be full ofhope?<br><br>Our opportunity is not only to move ­forward with gratitude, faith, and hope; ours isalso the opportunity to be ­carriers of­optimism and of faith and to spread the hope of the gospel to others throughout the world. After all, that is what Jesus died for. Wecan and we do move forward with great faith and assurances. And I bear my humble witness to you that Christ is real. HisAtonement is real. And we have hope inChrist in this life and in the life to come. Isay these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Richard C.

<h1>tion of the Whole Soul - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Across the eastern face of the new Joseph F. Smith Building, which was dedicated three years ago, runs a 200-foot curved glass curtain. This curtain encloses a grand gallery on the second and third floors. In this gallery, a permanent multimedia exhibit opened its doors this fall. The exhibit is entitled Education in Zion, and its theme is how our Zion tradition of learning and faith has always been focused on the education of the whole soul.<br><br>For dozens of us who worked on the exhibit--all but a few were BYU students and recent graduates--this project has been like a secret passageway to a remarkable treasure. I think of it as an inheritance that we did not know was ours. We discovered this treasure in the stories of the people who founded this school. Under the guidance of God, these people created a kind of education that in certain very important ways is different from anything the world has to offer. To tell you more about this inheritance, I will share a few of their stories with you.<br><br>At some point after the Saints had begun settling in the Mountain West, Brigham Young foresaw the need for schools that would cover the primary grades up through what we now call high school and would teach both the academic subjects and the principles of our religion.<sup>1</sup><br><br>In the spring of 1876 Brigham Young called Karl G. Maeser to preside at the first of these schools, the Brigham Young Academy in Provo--which, at that time, was already in its first term under the interim principal, Warren Dusenberry. During his interview with Maeser, President Young gave Maeser the now famous charge "that you ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God."<sup>2</sup><br><br>Maeser could scarcely have been better prepared for the job. He had obtained a world-class education in his native Saxony, served three missions after his conversion, and administered and taught in schools in Salt Lake City for about adecade and a half.<br><br>Maeser took over the academy at the beginning of its second term in late April. Before he left Salt Lake City for Provo, the Territorial School Association gave him a magnificent desk in recognition of his service<sup>3</sup>--a desk that will figure importantly in our story.<br><br>On a Friday afternoon at the end of the first week of school, Maeser received word that in three days President Young would be in Provo. The prophet wanted to see Maeser's plans for a program that would fulfill the charge to teach every subject by the Spirit of God.<br><br>So under the pressure of the prophet's pending arrival, Maeser sat at his desk through that Friday night trying to develop an educational plan that would incorporate President Young's momentous conception of the Spirit's role in true education. Nothing came. All through Saturday he worked, into the night, and then again on Sunday until the afternoon turned into evening. Finally he dropped, disheartened, to his knees, pleading, "O Father, show me the way, help me to make the plans for this great work. I cannot do it of myself."<sup>4</sup> Immediately the confusion of the preceding days was lifted, and within an hour or two Maeser had written out the plan for the new school. It had come to him as an answer toprayer.<br><br>Maeser's plan ingeniously worked out many ways in which the students would grow morally and spiritually in the very same educational process that developed them intellectually.<sup>5</sup> One of the factors that would make this process work was Maeser's determination to have the teachers do nothing that the students were able to do. Students participated in the academic planning meetings, conducted discussion sessions following the theology classes, assisted administratively, and looked out for one another in a program much like our home and visiting teaching programs today. In this school each would serve the others, and all would progress together.<br><br>This educational program became the model for a great system of Church schools, many of which were called <i>academies.</i> Over a span of more than 40 years, this system produced tens of thousands of Latter-day Saint leaders and faithful members. By and large, those who first developed the seminary and institute programs all over the world came from these schools.<br><br>I love to contemplate these two momentous steps in the development of what is today the worldwide Church Educational System of seminaries, institutes, and schools of higher education. The first of these steps was a prophet's instruction for the operation of a school he was founding, which was to give place to the Spirit of God in everything, and the second was a revelation in answer to the prayer of a very good and able servant, which that servant gratefully wrote down while sitting at the desk that he had been given for faithful service to the children ofZion.<br><br>Whatever the details of the plan Maeser recorded that day, they included the Spirit of God. As James E. Talmage wrote while still a student, "all our discipline, all our studies are conducted according to the spirit of the living God."<sup>6</sup> Student recollections of the period suggest that the Spirit was most noticeably manifest in the love and unity that prevailed in the school and that this love emanated especially from Brother Maeser. Many stories describe how he lifted and nurtured people. "He knew how to touch a boy's heart like no one else that I've ever known," said Bryant S. Hinckley. "Ihave seen men come from the farm and ranch and stay there six months and go home with an entirely new light in their eye."<sup>7</sup><br><br>Maeser had not always possessed this gift of love, at least not in such abundance. Apparently it came to him when President Young called him to preside at the academy. George S. Reynolds, the First Presidency's secretary, was present and said that he would never forget the Spirit that filled the office that day. Prior to his calling, Maeser had a wide reputation in Salt Lake schools for severity; for example, he once boxed young Reed Smoot on the ear for coming to school unprepared. But it was this same Reed Smoot who later, and gratefully, attended Brigham Young Academy as one of Maeser's first students and who as an older man said that Maeser's "whole nature changed" at the time of his calling.<sup>8</sup> Without this transformation, it is doubtful that Maeser could have instilled a nurturing spirit in his students, which surely he did. I'll tell you about a few of them.<br><br>Joseph B. Keeler, one of Maeser's first students, later managed the school's finances and physical facilities while teaching eight classes per term. He was widely known for his splendid example, for listening, and for finding ways to help students in need.<sup>9</sup> One day he overheard BYU's fourth president, George H. Brimhall, expel a very uncooperative repeat offender. As the student was leaving, Keeler drew him into his office in order, he said, to "take care of the details." He asked about the young man's plans, which included going into business. Then, explaining that withdrawing from school would take a few days, Keeler offered the young man work in the office "to finish out the week." The week became a month, and then more. The young man stayed in school. He graduated with honors and became an upright businessman. Years later, he attributed his "success in life to that great man."<sup>10</sup><br><br>As a faculty member, Alice Louise Reynolds obtained most of her advanced education studying with some of the world's finest literature teachers during leaves from her teaching position. She brought back and shared with her students, who flocked to her classes, whatever she had discovered that had enriched her life.<sup>11</sup> She was a person of uncommon intellectual standards who taught her students to bring together "all the beauty and all the uplift there is in art" with "all the reverence and all the holiness and beauty there is in religion."<sup>12</sup> I think she was able to awaken both the faith and the intellect of her students because she had blended them so well in her own life. Similarly she could buildf the confidence of her students because she believed in them so much herself.<br><br>Brigham T. Higgs taught carpentry classes and supervised the school's maintenance. He was the first to hire students for this purpose. Though he arrived at the academy too late to work under Brother Maeser, he quickly came to exemplify the school's nurturing spirit. He would meet with the student workers daily before dawn and instruct them not only in their duties but also about the value of work and virtuous living. "Don't be a scrub,"<sup>13</sup> he would say, meaning someone who does less than his best. He believed a father should "be the kind of man he would be proud to have his son become."<sup>14</sup> He would visit their boarding houses to make sure their living conditions were adequate and bring food to the ones who were struggling. President George H. Brimhall once said that no one had been more valuable to the university than B. T. Higgs, and a number of Higgs' students praised him as their greatest inspiration.<br><br>Partly because of the influence of these and other educational pioneers as the years rolled by, more Latter-day Saint students who went to major universities for advanced schooling stayed in the Church, and many of these returned to build up Zion, reared their own families, and became leaders among their people. Many taught in the Church's quorums, auxiliaries, and schools. Then these faithful ones' students, who were even more numerous, did the same. Each succeeding generation was better prepared academically and spiritually than its predecessors. Thus a branching, expanding, educational genealogy runs through our history as well as the history of other Church educational schools and programs. Sadly, we have records of relatively few individuals kindling in others the flame of learning, but I am sure that this lighting of others' lamps happened many thousands of times in our history and that all the stories are written in the book of life.<br><br>The stories I have shared clearly illustrate two of the characteristics of education in the kingdom of God that make it different from anything to be found in the world.<br><br>First, as already indicated, it is an education of the whole soul. We saw in the story of Brother Maeser the limitations of a person with extraordinary talent whose development was deficient in some essential respect.<br><br>Second, if we are living as the gospel requires, when we ourselves are learning, we are unwilling to leave others behind. An essential part of our growth comes in helping others grow. And then those we help in turn help others--among them, in many instances, our own posterity. This draws us close to one another, even across generations, and we become united, a Zion people. Fundamentally, education in the kingdom of God is different because it operates on the Zion principle of love.<br><br>The Zion tradition of learning did not begin with Brigham Young and Karl G. Maeser. In this dispensation, it goes back to Joseph Smith. His was truly an education of the whole soul, divinely orchestrated. Heavenly teachers were his instructors and models.<sup>15</sup> His scriptural translations and revisions gave him great knowledge of God's dealings with Israel and developed his ability to obtain revelation. In the tribulations he passed through, he grew in virtue, leadership, compassion, and wisdom. God was developing not just Joseph's mind but his whole being.<br><br>Joseph also exemplified the second characteristic of a Zion education in that his constant labor was to help the Saints come to gain the same knowledge and enjoy the same holy experiences that he had obtained. He did not reserve any privileges for himself alone. The instructions for the first School of the Prophets were given by the Lord, and they are in all respects expressive of Joseph's heart. They outline the way the participants were to build each other up and thus advance together.<br><br>The school met in Kirtland in an 11-by-14-foot room above Newell Whitney's store and included the most seasoned Church leaders.They were instructed to study subjects that would develop all their gifts and talents, from the doctrines of the kingdom to the affairs of the world, so that they, like Joseph, could be prepared to help build up a Zion people. And they were told how to conduct themselves in the school, which brought a dimension to their learning and growth that otherwise would have been absent. For example, everyone was to come repentant; humble; reverent; invigorated after a good night's sleep; clean and wearing fresh clothing; fasting; free of pride, envy, and fault-finding; and bonded together by love. The learning itself was to be collaborative, with each given a chance to teach the others and then listen carefully while the others taught, so "that all may be edified of all, and that every man may have an equal privilege."<sup>16</sup> The pattern of their preparation and study together, which is rooted in the order of the priesthood, would enable them to grow in many directions.<br><br>You can see that in these instructions the Lord was building up His beloved servants by asking them to build up one another. Following this divine example, Joseph, Brigham Young, and their successors sought diligently to bring the kind of education that began in the School of the Prophets to as many Latter-day Saints as possible. I haven't time to speak of details, but I will just say that throughout the next century, as the Church grew, they established priesthood quorums,<sup>17</sup> priesthood auxiliaries, community schools, stake academies, colleges, a university, and eventually the seminaries and institutes. They kept at the work even in desperately impoverished circumstances, when many others thought education should be postponed.<br><br>They understood very clearly the urgency that Elder Jeffrey R. Holland expressed when he presided at this school in 1981. "This Church," he said, "is always only one generation away from extinction. . . . All we would have to do . . . to destroy this work is stop teaching our children for one generation."<sup>18</sup> It was not primarily for themselves but for the children of the future, for Zion, that these visionary leaders and their faithful associates worked so hard. There's almost nothing we can name that has absorbed as much of the latter-day prophets' attention, energy, and care as the education of this people.<br><br>You may have thought that you are here at this university to take a certain series of courses, obtain a degree, and then leave learning behind. If so, you do not fully understand. God desires the flourishing of your whole soul for the glories He has in mind for you, including an eternal family with children who will shine as jewels in His crown and yours, and that is why He intends to bless you, if you will exert yourself, with a soul-stretching education.<br><br>It is also why He has provided this school, together with all the rest of Church education. I caution you against making the mistake of supposing these resources to be merely human institutions. In 1885, when the Brigham Young Academy's financial challenges were particularly trying, a faculty member, who also happened to be Brigham Young's daughter, sought President John Taylor's help. President Taylor told her that her father, who had passed on some years before, had come to him "in the silence of the night" and said "that the school being taught by Brother Maeser was accepted in the heavens and was a part of the great plan of life and salvation; . . . and that Christ himself was directing, and had a care over this school."<sup>19</sup><br><br>Brigham Young founded the Academy because he was alarmed that educational institutions were rapidly forgetting their religious heritage and rearing children to embrace an increasingly secular and increasingly atheistic culture. Only a different kind of school could avoid this fate--a school in which all teaching and learning would be done by the Spirit of God. Maeser once put it this way: the new Academy simply had to have "the spirit of the Latter-day Work" running through it "like a golden thread."<sup>20</sup><br><br>Maeser's successors shared that conviction. Our fourth president, Franklin S. Harris, said at his inauguration in 1921, "There has grown out of the history of [this] institution . . . a certain fire that must be kept burning. . . . The first task of the future is to preserve . . . this spirit that comes to us from the past."<sup>21</sup><br><br>This is our task also.<br><br>We should not expect this task to be easier than what the founders had to do. As in Brigham Young's time, we live surrounded by a secular culture that seems more and more threatening. I suppose that most of us unwittingly bring elements of this culture into our community of learning. We import tinges of its contempt for simple religious faith, its frivolous and often angry mental life, its demand for rights without responsibility, its tolerance for wasted time, its sickening vulgarity, its pride in gaining advantage over others, and much more. When we help or allow such attitudes to encroach upon this community, we subtly but surely lend ourselves to the devil's project of making this school over in the image of the world, which is something President Spencer W. Kimball said must not happen.<sup>22</sup><br><br>We can overcome such dangers not by becoming a cultural police force but by actively building up a far better way of life. When men and women are "anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will [to] bring to pass much righteousness,"<sup>23</sup> they make it very hard for the attitudes and habits of a carnal and violent world to get a foothold. By building others up and thus building Zion, we overcome evil with good.<br><br>I think of Florence Jepperson Madsen, who had gained great prominence as a contralto soloist in Boston and New York. When she came to BYU in 1920, she and her husband, Franklin, established a great musical tradition by hiring fine faculty and mounting splendid productions. Beyond that, she organized and directed over 2,000 groups of singing mothers throughout the Church. We cannot count the students who carried their enhanced musical talents and enthusiasm wherever they went. It was said that no LDS woman did more to bring beauty and harmony into this world.<br><br>I think of Sidney B. Sperry, who, beginning in the late 1920s, helped to pioneer the blending of scholarship with the teaching of scripture. It was a time when the faith of young Latter-day Saints was being shaken by scholars' naturalistic explanations of spiritual events recorded in the Bible. Sperry used these scholars' findings, though not their irreligious speculations, to deepen religious understanding. By this means, over the course of nearly 40 years, he brought gospel scholarship into the lives of Church education teachers and students and a wide audience of Church members. Among those who learned from him were many who later shaped religious instruction in the Church Educational System.<br><br>I ask myself, what if people such as these had not built up this school and the rest of the Church Educational System? What would we be learning? Would our attitudes, aspirations, and relationships be at all different from those who are part of the secular culture around us? Would we care about God? Would we have any idea of His plan of happiness? What would we be like if the teachers of our teachers, going back very far, had not been men and women such as Karl Maeser, Alice Louise Reynolds, and Sidney Sperry? Remember, the way "to destroy this work"--and to cheat the children of the future of everything we hold dear--"is [to] stop teaching [them the gospel, our precious way of life,] for [just] one generation."<br><br>Today I have spoken of the importance to us of our educational ancestors. So many of us have given this topic so little thought that I supposed it helpful to tell you that for many of us who have learned about their lives, they have become an unexpected treasure. We soon realized as we worked on the exhibit that we were not just recounting the stories of bygone men and women. We were coming to know these people, as if in person. Even across the years we could feel their influence spiritually. Their example seemed to gently pull us aside and show how we could be doing better. They became part of our work.<br><br>In the process, we sought the Lord's Spirit so that our efforts, like theirs, might enlighten, edify, and encourage others. Thus we joined our hands and hearts with theirs, and we became part of their work.<br><br>This has seemed to me a very real inheritance in Zion. We have been given a place among eternal friends who did eternal work for souls they had yet to meet. I learned from these noble people that laboring <i>in</i> Zion <i>for</i> Zion, in whatever capacity, gives us the privilege of using all our talents, gifts, and learning to build up a Zion way of living together, a holy culture, a desparately needed alternative to a perishing world! In that Zion culture, the major formative influence upon our posterity will come from well-prepared, good, and faithful people.<br><br>I have been closely associated with three great universities and can tell you that, for me, the life of learning does not get any sweeter than this. The inheritance I have described is also yours to claim if you desire.<br><br>On two high, facing walls, one on the north and the other on the south of the exhibit gallery, are two remarkable, 18-foot-high murals painted by one of our students. The one on the south depicts the Kirtland Temple, the first temple of the dispensation, which, like all temples, was to be a house of learning. It is labeled <i>The Temple, a Holy School.</i> The mural on the north depicts Brigham Young University in President George H. Brimhall's time, with the Academy Building in the foreground and the newly constructed Maeser Building further in the background on Temple Hill. Its title is <i>The School, a Temple of Learning.</i><br><br>I have learned from the lives of our founders that this school does indeed deserve the name "A Temple of Learning."<br><br>I pray this may continue to be so. I bear witness in the name of Jesus Christ that the work of this university and of the entire Church Educational System is His work, for He commanded, "Feed my lambs. . . . Feed my sheep."<sup>24</sup> Amen.<br><br><i>C. Terry Warner was a BYU professor of philosophy when this devotional address was given on 11 November 2008.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1>to Keeping Commitments - Sarah Westerberg - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
When I first came to this land, I quickly learned that a number of everyday words had different meanings here. Biscuits became cookies, petrol became gas, and chips became fries. It was through my work with a group of wonderful student employees in the tutoring program that I was introduced to a new meaning of the word <i>flaky.</i> Previously I had only come across this word in connection with the qualities of pastry or piecrust. But my student employees used it to describe a fellow student. They said that the student had not shown up for a meeting because he was flaky. When I asked for clarification about this use of the word, they explained that being flaky meant someone was unreliable and did not keep their commitments.<br><br>We have all observed flakiness in some form or other, whether it's when someone gets stood up for a date, when someone takes a different job two weeks after committing to work for a whole semester, or when someone does not choose to keep sacred covenants and chooses a path different from the one the Savior would have us choose. Whatever the degree of flakiness, any commitment that is broken results in remorse. Flakiness is the antithesis of commitment.<br><br>Commitment, in its most basic form, is doing what you say you will do. Elder F. Burton Howard said of commitment:<br><br><i>The Church does have many needs, and one of them is for more people who will just do what they have agreed to do. People who will show up for work and stay all day; who will quietly, patiently, and consistently do what they have agreed to do--for as long as it takes--and who will not stop until they have finished.</i> ["Commitment," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1996, 27–28]<br><br>Whether your commitments are in the form of promises, pledges, covenants, callings, contracts, or your word of honor, they must be kept. Whether they are commitments that are spiritual in nature, legal contracts, or seemingly trivial temporal things, they must be kept. Karl G. Maeser's statement about chalk circles demonstrates the importance of keeping our commitments well. He said:<br><br><i>I have been asked what I mean by word of honor. Iwill tell you. Place me behind prison walls--walls of stone ever so high, ever so thick, reaching ever so far into the ground--there is a possibility that in some way or another I may be able to escape, but stand me on that floor and draw a chalk line around me and have me give my word of honor never to cross it. Can I get out of that circle? No, never! I'd die first!</i> [In Alma P. Burton, <i>Karl G. Maeser: Mormon Educator</i> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1953), 71]<br><br>In an increasingly flaky and crusty world, it seems that the word <i>commitment</i> has been progressively modified so that in many contexts its meaning no longer resembles what it used to. We hear people talk of casual commitments, partial commitments, or half-hearted commitments. But anything less than complete, absolute, or total commitment is as bad as no commitment at all. Elder Theodore M. Burton said:<br><br><i>When I speak then of total commitment, I do not refer to a momentary dedication. . . . I refer to a daily or continuing spirit of devotion and dedication which comes from keeping all the commandments of God every day.</i> ["The Need for Total Commitment," <i>Ensign,</i> January 1974, 115]<br><br>Achieving total commitment may seem daunting. Today I would like to focus on some basic principles that may help us to avoid flakiness (outside of the kitchen). I will discuss six guidelines that I hope will be both useful and inspirational to you as you strive to keep your commitments in all areas of your life.<br><h2><b>1. Know Your Commitments</b></h2><br>The first guideline is <i>know which commitments you have made.</i> It goes without saying that commitments are of particular importance to us, as we are a covenant people. Living the gospel requires that we make and keep covenants and commitments.<br><br>A faculty friend of mine recently told me that she had asked her class to list the commitments they had made. She was surprised when she was met with blank stares and silence. The students needed help in articulating the commitments they had made. It is difficult to think about keeping commitments if you aren't really sure what you have committed to.<br><br>She posed the question again and then prompted the students by saying, "Okay, let's start with baptismal covenants." Then they began to realize that we have many commitments in common.<br><br>We have committed to take upon us Christ'sname. This should completely change every thought we have and every action we take. We recommit every Sunday, through the ordinance of the sacrament, to always remember Him. This commitment should translate into powerful righteous behaviors in our life. As we attend the temple, we make additional covenants to do the Lord's will and to increase our ability to make and keep sacred commitments.<br><br>At Brigham Young University we commit to keep the Honor Code. Most often we hear about aspects of the Honor Code such as dress and grooming standards, chastity, and integrity. One important feature of the Honor Code that is often overlooked is the promise to help others keep their commitment to the Honor Code as well. Support for others who are also trying to keep the Honor Code begins with ourpersonal example and keeping our own commitments. I recently heard of a female student who consistently wore short shorts in her physical education class. Another student in the class asked her if she would like to borrow some longer, knee-length shorts, and the student realized that she needed to wear longer shorts and comply with the dress and grooming standard. Helping our peers to keep their Honor Code commitments should always be accomplished in a spirit of love and kindness.<br><br>Many of us have committed to serve in Church callings in our various wards and stakes. Don't take these commitments lightly. The BYU wards and stakes are the training ground for future Church leaders. Committing to do home and visiting teaching now will prepare you and enable you to become a valuable and powerful instrument in the Lord's hands.<br><br>Other commitments you may have chosen to make include attending the weekly devotional in the Marriott Center, being on time for the 8:00 a.m. class you elected to take, reading the Book of Mormon daily, or praying morning and night.<br><br>Know which commitments you have made and reflect upon them often. Ask the Lord to help you keep them in the forefront of your mind. This will help you to remember both your commitments and the Lord more readily.<br><h2><b>2. Decide Now</b></h2><br>Once we know what our commitments are, we need to keep them by following the second point: <i>decide now.</i> Increasingly I hear from people who are seeking to justify breaking a commitment. They will say, "I have to do what is right for me" or "I'm just too tired" or "It's just not working out for me" and, especially, "Iam just too busy." It's bad enough when such rationalizations are used when temporal commitments are broken, but we must not be fooled into thinking we can disregard our promises to the Lord so casually. We must decide now to keep our commitments. Then, when faced with a temptation or an opportunity to compromise, we will not waver, because the decision has already been made. A covenant people must not waver.<br><br>Elder Richard G. Scott counseled us to make our commitment keeping automatic. He said:<br><br><i>I commend you who are automatic, who have committed to be true to the Lord and to live by faith when you cannot see the end from the beginning.</i> ["Making the Right Decisions," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1991, 34]<br><br>Decide now that you will keep your commitments so that when challenges arise, you will continue steadfast, without hesitation. That is not to imply that you are blindly following; rather, it means that you have already done the important thinking, soul searching, and praying to allow you to respond in this manner.<br><br>Great strength comes from commitments that are made well in advance. In chapter 14 of Luke we can read about one of the numerous occasions when the Savior was teaching His disciples. He was constantly trying to develop commitment patterns in them and strengthen them because He knew what trials and challenges they would have to face after He was gone. Verse 28 of the Joseph Smith Translation reads, "Settle this in your hearts, that ye will do the things which I shall teach, and command you." The Savior was encouraging His disciples to decide now. We know the disciples were not strangers to deciding "now," based on their response to Jesus when He called them to the work: they left their fishing nets immediately and followed Him.<br><br>My husband and I are committed to raising our children in the gospel, and part of that commitment involves holding family home evening. We have already decided that we will have family home evening every Monday night. So when our four-year-old, William, inevitably answers the call to come to family home evening with the suggestion "Let's play light sabers instead," we are not swayed or moved because we have already decided to have family home evening.<br><br>Elder M. Russell Ballard said, "Have you made the commitment to do anything the Lord asks, and are you disciplined enough to fulfill that commitment, even at a time that may not be particularly opportune or pleasant?" ("The Power of Commitment," <i>New Era,</i> November 1989, 6). Commitment is never to be postponed for convenience or pleasure. It is easier to keep commitments when we have decided before we reach the crisis point or when the critical mass of peer pressure occurs.<br><h2><b>3. Follow the Master</b></h2><br>The scriptures are replete with examples of ancient prophets and leaders who kept their commitments in the face of great adversity and trials. Nephi built a ship without any prior shipbuilding experience because he had committed to do whatever the Lord asked of him. The Anti-Nephi-Lehies, parents of the 2,000 stripling warriors, kept their commitments although it meant sending their sons to battle. Joshua declared that he and his family were committed to serving the Lord in spite of what others thought. The sons of Mosiah were committed to preaching the gospel to the Lamanites even though it was dangerous work. Joseph resisted the advances of Potiphar's wife and kept himself morally clean even though it meant being thrown into prison.<br><br>The quintessential example of commitment, however, is our Savior, Jesus Christ. This presents our third point, which is <i>follow the Master.</i> His devotion to His Father was perfect and complete, and He was totally committed to doing the Father's will in all things. President Howard W. Hunter said:<br><br><i>We must keep the commandments of our Lord. If we can pattern our life after the Master, and take His teaching and example as the supreme pattern for our own, we will not find it difficult to be temple worthy, to be consistent and loyal in every walk of life, for we will be committed to a single, sacred standard of conduct and belief.</i> ["The Great Symbol of Our Membership," <i>Ensign,</i> October 1994, 5]<br><br>Early in 2002, my mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer. A few days later, my husband was also diagnosed with cancer. These were some dark, difficult days for us as we tried to handle the challenges we faced. It would have been easy to do what Job was encouraged to do: curse God and die--ignoring our commitments to the Lord and others and wallowing in despair. However, even when our circumstances change, our commitment to the Lord must not change. There is no sliding scale. We cannot get a rain check or opt out from our commitments, even for a time. We must stay on track and be lifted up by Jesus' example. Putting our trust in the Lord and following His example is the best way to endure the trials of life and keep our commitments.<br><br>Even though our individual circumstances may be different, our commitments to the Lord are never situational; they do not change depending on the level of stress or joy we may be experiencing in our lives. Whether it is through defining moments of great trial or during seemingly subtle and quiet moments of reflection, making a commitment is a sacred act, an act that reflects what is divine in us. President Marion G. Romney said, "I . . . believe that the most effective way to get on course and to stay on course is to do as Jesus did: make a <i>total commitment"</i> ("Commitment and Dedication," <i>Ensign,</i> March 1983, 5; emphasis in original).<br><h2><b>4. Set Realistic Goals</b></h2><br>Once we are committed to following the Master, then a good way to make progress with our commitments is to <i>set realistic goals.</i> This is the fourth point. My sister volunteers at a family history center and has commented that many people are full of enthusiasm and energy when they come to search for their ancestors but leave disheartened because they are not able to identify all of their forebears in a single session. Their commitment to redeeming the dead can be relatively short-lived. Setting realistic goals assists in fulfilling commitments and thus enduring to the end. Whether we write a list of goals or keep them in our mind, we need to set goals that are reasonable and achievable and that will help us to keep our commitments in the long run.<br><br>We often hear of people who have "commitment issues." Generally, these commitment issues are in the context of a relationship, but it is an idea with broader application. Do we have spiritual commitment issues? With the Lord, all things are spiritual, thus there are no commitments that can be deemed "simply temporal." When we keep our commitments, we draw closer to the Lord and come closer to becoming the person we need to be to endure through eternity. What may initially appear to be temporal is, in actuality, a training ground for things eternal. The companion of commitment keeping is enduring to the end. Because we are children of God, our commitments are lifelong commitments that stretch throughout eternity.<br><br>We would do well to remember what our beloved President Hinckley said:<br><br><i>Commitment . . . involves loyalty. It involves duty. It involves determination of objectives and the resolution to meet those objectives. It involves giving oneself without reservation to the accomplishment of a good and great purpose.</i> [Gordon B. Hinckley, "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/gordon-b-hinckley_codes-covenants/">Codes and Covenants</a>," BYU devotional, 18October 1994]<br><br>"Loyalty," "duty," "determination"--truly these are words to live by.<br><h2><b>5. Anticipate Opposition</b></h2><br>Keeping our commitments is something we must do daily, no matter what the day might bring. President Howard W. Hunter said, "We should decide now, in the light of the morning, how we will act when the darkness of night and when the storms of temptation arrive" ("Commitment to God," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1982, 58). Through both the clouds and the sunshine of life, we must be committed. The fifth point is <i>anticipate opposition.</i> Many will keep their commitments only until the clouds appear, only until it becomes awkward, painful, expensive, unpopular, inconvenient, unfashionable, or politically incorrect. But we must be steadfast and immoveable. Elder Marvin J. Ashton said:<br><br><i>A truly committed person does not falter in the face of adversity. Until one is committed, there is a chance to hesitate, to go off in another direction, or to be ineffective. Members within our ranks who are committed to living the gospel of Jesus Christ will not be affected by the rationale of hecklers.</i> ["The Word Is Commitment," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1983, 62]<br><br>As I was growing up, our family vacations were always to destinations where my parents were searching for their ancestors. A key feature of our holiday would be stopping at various cemeteries to look at the gravestones and search for names. Oftentimes the cemeteries were not well kept and were rather overgrown. We always carried a pair of garden shears and a wire brush in the trunk of our car so that we were ready to handle unruly overgrowth or headstones covered in moss and lichens. We anticipated that our passage around these cemeteries might not be smooth, and we armed ourselves with the tools to remedy this.<br><br>Another tool of opposition the adversary uses to try to get us to break our commitments is discouragement. Robert the Bruce, king of Scotland in the 13th century and an ancestor of mine, learned a great lesson after having been defeated in battle. While hiding from his enemies in a cave for several months and being at the lowest, darkest point in his life, he observed a spider trying to spin its web. The spider fell down again and again as it tried to construct its web, but it persevered and eventually succeeded. Bruce came to the realization that he must try, try again, and he too was eventually successful.<br><br>A further type of opposition we may experience is having friends who are lax or casual in their approach to their commitments and minimize the extent of their obligations. Elder Neal A. Maxwell said:<br><br>[Some] <i>members accept callings but not all of the accompanying responsibilities. . . .</i><br><br><i>While casual members are not unrighteous, they often avoid appearing to be too righteous by seeming less committed than they really are--an ironic form of hypocrisy.</i> ["Settle This in Your Hearts," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1992, 65, 66]<br><br>The natural man is typically another opponent of commitment keeping, which is why our prophets and apostles speak so often of self-mastery. It takes great strength and discipline to be fully committed to all that is required, but the blessings of such an accomplishment are literally, seriously, and truly divine. Often we don't need any more opposition than our own natural man to draw us away from things.<br><br>The cultural tides in our world run strongly against commitments of any kind. And too many of us are not fully committed to living all the commandments. Without a strong commitment to the Lord, we are more likely to have a lower level of commitment to ourselves and to others. Elder Russell M. Nelson noted, "Unfortunately, some souls make a covenant with God--signified by the sacred ordinance of baptism--without a heartfelt commitment to endure with Him" ("Endure and Be Lifted Up," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1997, 71–72). When we put our whole heart into our commitments and covenants with God, the blessings will extend far beyond our spiritual selves and willstrengthen all aspects of our lives.<br><h2><b>6. Reap the Blessings</b></h2><br>We are certain to <i>reap great blessings</i> as a result of keeping our commitments to the Lord. This is the sixth point. When my mother was baptized a member of the Church in 1964, she could not drive, and the local branch met in a drafty building across town. She had to take several buses to get to and from church twice each Sunday. One cold, snowy night as she waited to catch the bus home, the missionaries passed by and told her that if she would keep her commitments to the Lord and continue to live the gospel, in the future it would be easier for her to get to church. Several years later, my mother passed her driving test. Soon afterward, the members worked hard to build a meetinghouse about a five-minute drive away from our home. Some years later, our ward house became the stake center. What a marvelous blessing it was for my mother to be able to get to ward and stake meetings so easily.<br><br>President Henry B. Eyring described great learners as people who keep commitments:<br><br><i>Any community functions better when people in it keep their promises to live up to its accepted standards. But for a learner and for a community of learners, that keeping of commitments has special significance. . . .</i><br><br><i>The Latter-day Saints who see themselves in all they do as children of God take naturally to making and keeping commitments. The plan of salvation is marked by covenants. We promise to obey commandments. In return, God promises blessings in this life and for eternity. He is exact in what he requires, and he is perfect in keeping his word. Because he loves us and because the purpose of the plan is to become like him, he requires exactness of us. And the promises he makes to us always include the power to grow in our capacity to keep covenants. He makes it possible for us to know his rules. When we try with all our hearts to meet his standards, he gives us the companionship of the Holy Ghost. That in turn both increases our power to keep commitments and to discern what is good and true. And that is the power to learn, both in our temporal studies and in the learning we need for eternity.</i> ["A Child of God," BYU devotional, 21October 1997]<br><br>My mother was committed to raising her children in the gospel. Just one example of her commitment to this ideal was an activity that happened every morning in our family. In the Ingram family we called it "morning service," and it involved a hymn, a family prayer, and scripture reading at 7:30 a.m. each day. Regardless of what else might be going on that day, we always had morning service--every single day. I am ever grateful to my mother for her tenacity in keeping her commitment to raise up a righteous posterity even when her children were not always terribly congenial or happy about having to get out of bed for scripture study every morning. Her commitment has made a difference in my life--not least because I know the scriptures better because of morning service. Those blessings extend through future generations and continue to bless my family as I teach my children the gospel by reading the scriptures with them.<br><h2><b>Words to Live By</b></h2><br>With the holiday season already upon us, let's keep the flakiness in the kitchen. With the vacation from school approaching, it is important to remember that we are never on vacation from our commitments to the Lord. As we take time to ponder the wonder of His birth and life on earth, let us also review the commitments we have made and recommit to labor with greater zeal during the coming year. Let us be more fully aware of our commitments, decide now to keep them, follow the Master in our approach to our commitments, set realistic goals to help us fulfill our commitments, anticipate the opposition that will come, and reap the blessings, both temporal and eternal, that flow to those who faithfully keep commitments.<br><br>Commitment to God's laws is the basis of peace in this life. President Howard W. Hunter said:<br><br><i>A successful life, the good life, the righteous Christian life requires something more than a contribution, though every contribution is valuable. Ultimately it requires commitment--whole-souled, deeply held, eternally cherished commitment to the principles we know to be true in the commandments God has given.</i> ["Standing As Witnesses of God," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1990, 62]<br><br>"Whole-souled, deeply held, eternally cherished"--these are words to live by. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i> Sarah Westerberg was associate dean of students at BYU when this devotional address was given on 2 December 2008.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>Is Born - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Beloved students, faculty, and friends of Brigham Young University, you are a marvelous sight, and Susan and I are honored and full of gratitude to be with you today. We always feel tender feelings when we return to Brigham Young University, as this is where we met and were engaged. We met in a religion class called Your Religious Problems. I have forgotten many of the details of the class, but Ido know that whatever my religious problem was, she solved it, and whatever her problem was, well, I hope I solved it too.<br><br>In a very short while your final exams will end and you will return to family or friends for Christmas. In view of the approaching Yuletide season, I have chosen to share with you today a Christmas message, a message of hope and glad tidings, even my assurance and witness of the birth, life, and eternal Lordship of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.<br><br>More than 700 years before his birth, Isaiah prophesied of Christ in words memorialized by George Frideric Handel in the <i>Messiah</i> oratorio:<br><br><i>For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.</i> [Isaiah 9:6]<br><br>In this one concise sentence, Isaiah foretold Christ's birth; His Second Coming; His millennial reign; and His eternal mission as the mighty God and Father of our salvation.<br><br>Handel's <i>Messiah</i> also brought to glorious musical life the following admonition, based on Isaiah:<br><br><i>O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion, . . . O thou that tellest good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with strength: lift it up, be not afraid: say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God!</i> [Handel, "O Thou That Tellest Good Tidings to Zion," <i>Messiah;</i> see Isaiah 40:9]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, join with me and behold your God! Behold your God, born as a little child in Bethlehem and wrapped in swaddling clothes. Behold your God, born in poverty and simplicity that He might walk among common people as a common man. Behold your God, even the infinite and eternal Redeemer, the Messiah, veiled in flesh and come to live upon the very earth that He created.<br><br>Return with me to that sacred first Christmas in Bethlehem to contemplate the birth of our Lord. He came in the quiet of the night, in the meridian of time, He who was Immanuel, the Rod of Jesse, the Dayspring, the Key of David, the very Lord of Might. His birth marked the promised visitation of the Creator to earth, the condescension of God to man. As Isaiah wrote of the event:<br><br><i>The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.</i> [Isaiah 9:2]<br><br>We know from modern revelation that Jesus was born on April 6, making it springtime in Judea when the anointed King of Israel came to earth. As Micah had prophesied, he was born in Bethlehem, "little among the thousands of Judah" (Micah 5:2). The village of His birth lay in the shadow of mighty Jerusalem, six miles to the north. Jerusalem was the capital city of Judea, seat of the temple, and bastion of Roman power. Bethlehem, by contrast, was a pastoral town, homespun and agrarian in all its ways. Its only claim to fame was being the birthplace of David--the ancient king of Israel who established the Davidic line through whom Christ would be born; hence the little village was commonly known as the city of David. Its Hebrew name, <i>bet lehem,</i> meant "house of bread," a name that was of no particular significance until He was born who would be known as the Bread of Life.<br><br>The fields surrounding Bethlehem were home to numerous flocks of sheep, and the month of April was a traditional birthing season for the ewes of the flock. In their awkward role as midwives to the animals, the shepherds would have stayed up most of the night, laboring beneath the crystal sky of the desert plateau. Hence the angels who heralded the Lord's birth would have had no need to wakethem.<br><br>The boy child who arrived that birthing season was known as the Lamb of God. It is atitle of deep significance, for He arrived with the lambs and would someday be "brought as a lamb to the slaughter" (Isaiah 53:7). Yet, paradoxically, He was also the Good Shepherd, one who cared for the lambs. Thus, in a curious way, the twin symbols of His life would represent both those who serve and those who are served. It was only right that Christ should play both roles, for in life He "descended below all things," and in eternity He "ascended up on high" (D&amp;amp;C 88:6). He is in and through and "round about all things" (D&amp;amp;C 88:41). Heknew life from every side and every angle, both above and below. He was the greatest, who made Himself least; the Heavenly Shepherd who became a lamb.<br><br>His coming was more than simply the birth of a great prophet, the advent of a promised heir to the royal throne, or even the arrival of the only perfect person who would ever walk the earth. It was all of that, of course, but it was something far more--the coming of the God of heaven "to walk upon his footstool and be like man, almost" ("O God, the Eternal Father," <i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 175). In the words of a famouscarol,<br><br><i>He came down to earth from heaven,</i><br><br><i>Who is God and Lord of all.</i><br><br>["Once in Royal David's City," <i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 205]<br><br>Jesus Christ was the Creator of the world and the Great Jehovah of the Old Testament. It was His voice that resounded on Mount Sinai; His power that upheld chosen Israel in its wanderings; His presence revealed to Enoch, to Moses, and to all the prophets who foretold of His coming. And therein lies the greatest miracle of the Nativity: when the God and Creator of heaven and earth first revealed Himself in person to the world at large, He chose to do so in the form of an infant, helpless and dependent, born in the same manner as any human being was ever born.<br><br>An ancient Hebrew tradition held that the Messiah would be born at Passover, and from astronomical calculation we know that April6 in the meridian of time indeed fell in the week of the Passover feast, that sacred Jewish commemoration of Israel's salvation from the destroying angel that brought death to the firstborn sons of Egypt. It was a salvation granted to each Israelite family that sacrificed a lamb and smeared its blood on the wooden doorposts of their dwelling. Thirty-three years after His Passover birth, Christ's blood would be smeared on the wooden posts of a cross to save His people from the destroying angels of death and sin.<br><br>Since Christ's birth took place during the Passover week, that Jewish commemoration may have been the reason why there was no room at the inn--the population of Jerusalem swelled by tens of thousands during Passover, forcing travelers to seek accommodations in outlying towns. Mary and Joseph went to Bethlehem, the home of Joseph's forefathers, to fulfill the requirements of an imperial census ordered by Caesar Augustus. The requirement of the census allowed them to make their appearance in Bethlehem anytime during the year, but they very likely chose the Passover season since it was also a requirement of the Mosaic law for all males to present themselves in Jerusalem at Passover. Since Bethlehem was virtually next door to the Holy City, the couple from Nazareth could take care of two obligations at once.<br><br>The innkeeper has come down in history with somewhat of a notorious reputation. Yet given the crowding that took place throughout the region of Jerusalem at Passover, we can hardly blame him for having no room to offer the couple from Nazareth. While the majority of Passover pilgrims camped out in thousands of goatskin tents pitched on the plains around Jerusalem, thousands of others sought refuge in the local inns, also known as caravansaries or <i>khans.</i> The inn in Bethlehem no doubt was overflowing, and the innkeeper's offering of the stable was very likely an act of genuine kindness.<br><br>Even had the couple found room in the inn, it would have offered only primitive accommodations: a typical khan of the period was a stone structure consisting of a series of small rooms, each with only three walls and open to public view on one side. Crowded and noisy, the rooms were devoid of furniture, and the khan provided no services. The stable itself was likely a walled courtyard or even a limestone cave where animals belonging to the guests were kept. Whether courtyard, cave, or other refuge, the place of Christ's birth among the animals did have one conspicuous advantage over the crowded interior of the inn: here at least was to be found peace and privacy. In this sense, the offering of the stable was a blessing, allowing the most sacred birth in human history to take place in reverent solitude.<br><br>Seven hundred years before that first Christmas, the prophet Isaiah penned a messianic prophecy that the Savior later read to His fellow villagers of Nazareth:<br><br><i>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound.</i> [Isaiah 61:1; see Luke 4:18]<br><br>When we read of Christ proclaiming "liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound," we probably think first of His ministry in the spirit world among the dead. But listen closely and carefully now, my beloved brothers and sisters, for I want you to not forget what I tell you now: <i>We are all captives, every one of us, and we all have the need tobe set free.</i><br><ul><br> 	<li>We are all captive to the corruption and weakness of mortal bodies; subject to the temptations of the flesh, to infirmity, and ultimately to death.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>We are captive to sin and to the wages of sin, to guilt and the lonely withdrawal of the Lord's spirit when we disobey.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>We are in bondage to bad habits, indulgences, false ways of thinking, and even sometimes to addictions--both physical and spiritual.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>We are captive to mistakes, errors, and wrong turns taken in the past; to painful memories of precious things lost, time squandered, and regrets of what might have been had we only chosen more wisely.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>We are captive to ignorance and worldly distractions, and hence oblivious to the glory of God that lies all about and around us.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Finally, all of us in some degree are captives of pride, the greatest prison of all--the most common human sin, that great counterfeit of spiritual strength that substitutes carnal imagination and self-obsession for the true freedom found only in meekness.</li><br></ul><br>Whatever it may be that binds us, whatever sins, circumstances, or past events hold each of us captive, the Lord Jesus Christ, the great Immanuel, has come to set us free. He proclaims liberty to the captives--freedom from the bonds of death and the prison of sin, ignorance, pride, and error. Of Him it was written that He "led captivity captive" (Psalm 68:18); of Him it was prophesied that He shall "say to the prisoners, Go forth" (Isaiah 49:9). The only condition of our freedom is that we come unto Him with broken hearts and contrite spirits and seek to do His will.<br><br>About 30 years ago I met a man who won freedom from spiritual captivity by the redeeming power of Christ. This European man, whom I will call Thomas, was about 45 years old when I met him. Twenty years earlier he had been a young man of 25 when his parents met the missionaries and joined the Church. Thomas, who considered himself an atheist, had no interest in his parents' new religion. But his mother loved him, and she treasured the hope in her heart that someday her son might be brought to know the truth of the restored gospel. As the years passed, his mother tried many times to persuade her son to at least meet with the missionaries and hear their message. He refused again and again, and he mocked his parents for their religious faith.<br><br>One day, in desperation, his mother tried a new approach. She said, "Thomas, if you will take the missionary discussions one time, then I will never again talk to you about the Church." Thomas, tired of his mother's pleadings, decided this was a good bargain. He agreed to meet with the missionaries. The elders who taught him reported that he had no interest at all in the Church and no belief in God. During the first three discussions he simply sat there full of pride, occasionally making fun of what the elders were trying to teach. The only reason they went back was because they knew of his mother's love for him and the agreement between them.<br><br>The fourth discussion came, which was then about the Atonement of Christ and the first principles of the gospel. Thomas said nothing at all as they taught him, but they noticed he grew unusually silent and listened closely to the discussion. At the end of the lesson they bore their testimonies of Christ. Thomas simply sat there looking at them, saying nothing. One of the missionaries felt prompted to open his Bible to the Gospel of Matthew and read these words:<br><br><i>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</i><br><br><i>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</i> [Matthew 11:28–29]<br><br>Suddenly, without warning, Thomas burst into tears. He sobbed like a child for the longest time and then said, "Are you trying to say that Christ would forgive <i>me</i> of my sins? Ihave lived a miserable life. I am haunted by the memory of my sins. I would do anything to be freed of the guilt I feel."<br><br>All of his pride had only been a facade that hid a soul captive to sin and guilt.<br><br>The elders assured Thomas that Christ would forgive him and free him from the burden of guilt if he would but repent and be baptized. They bore testimony once more to him of the power of Christ's Atonement. From that moment on, everything changed in the life of Thomas. He had much to repent of and much to overcome, but through the blessings of the Lord, and to the amazement of his mother and father, he was able to qualify for baptism. He became a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br><br>More than 20 years later, I sat in the chapel of the Frankfurt temple waiting for an endowment session to begin. There was a white-haired elderly man sitting in front of me who all at once turned around and said, "Aren't you Elder Porter?" To my great joy I recognized it was Thomas, still faithful and true in the Church, a man freed from bondage by the power of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Perhaps this Christmas season we might each resolve to approach our Father in Heaven humbly in prayer and petition the power of His Beloved Son to be with us in our daily walk and to free us from our own bondages, our own personal forms of captivity, be they great or small.<br><br>Now I have had many witnesses in my life of the reality of Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior. I will share only one in conclusion. In December 1987, about two weeks before Christmas, I was asked by the federal agency where I worked to go to Israel on government business. I had been to Israel many times before, but never at the Christmas season. Unfortunately it was not a peaceful time in the Holy Land, as the first Palestinian <i>intifada</i> had begun--the revolt of the local Arab population against Israeli rule. There were riots in the West Bank, the streets of Old Jerusalem were deserted, and the shops were boarded up. There was political tension in the air, and, to make matters worse, a cold rain drizzled most of the week. The whole city bore a dreary aspect. Fearful of violence, the tourists stayed away in droves that year. Yet as I walked through Jerusalem, peace filled my heart to know that this was the city Christ loved so much; to know that this was the very place of His eternal sacrifice; to know that on these stone streets the Redeemer of all mankind hadwalked.<br><br>I returned to the United States late on a Friday evening, only six days before Christmas. When the Sabbath dawned two days later, my alarm woke me to the music of "O Holy Night," and I heard these words:<br><br><i>The King of kings lay thus in lowly manger,</i><br><br><i>In all our trials born to be our friend.</i><br><br>["Cantique de Nol" ("O Holy Night"), Placide Cappeau and Adolphe Adam, 1847]<br><br>The music and message pierced me deeply, and tears flowed as I contemplated the glorious sacrifice and perfect life of the Redeemer of Israel--He who was born to be the friend of the lowly and the hope of the meek. I thought of my experience in Jerusalem, and love flooded through my whole being for Him who had come to earth and taken upon Himself the burdens of us all. I was overwhelmed to think that He might regard me as a friend. I have never forgotten the tender feelings of that early Sunday morning--as pure a witness as I ever received.<br><br>So to you now, at this Christmas season, Ibear my witness of the Savior of the World. I know that He lives. I know that He was anointed before the creation of the world to proclaim liberty to the captives. He was born of Mary in Bethlehem and raised in Nazareth. He taught the gospel in Galilee, Jerusalem, and throughout Judea, Samaria, and Perea. Helived a perfect life. He suffered and was crucified for the sins of the world. He rose again the third day and stands enthroned in the heavens above, at the right hand of our Heavenly Father. Of His birth and life I can only say, "Oh, come, let us adore him, Christ, the Lord" ("Oh, Come, All Ye Faithful," <i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 202). Of Him I bear witness in His own name, the name of the Lord Immanuel, even in the holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Bruce D.
