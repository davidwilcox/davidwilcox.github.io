<h1>ot Good That . . . Man Should Be Alone” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My message today is summarized in a familiar scripture, Genesis 2:18, in which the Lord declared, "It is not good that ... man should be alone." I suppose most of you upon hearing this will think that I am about to deliver the standard BYU speech on marriage. You are wrong--well, at least mostly wrong. Although the principles I address will apply with full force to marriage, I wish to speak about a broader truth, one recognized in both secular studies and gospel teaching. It is that no one can flourish in isolation and that the quality of our relationships with others will ultimately determine our level of fulfillment and happiness in both this mortal existence and the life to come. It is in this sense that it is not good for man--or woman--to be alone.<br><br>I learned this insight from an unexpected source about twenty years ago. I was ­helping teach a class at the University of Chile about that country's law dealing with indigenous ­people. Members of the class included not onlylaw students but also a number of leaders of indigenous communities, principally Mapuche communities from southern Chile. Each week after the regular class, these Mapuche leaders would teach the ­students--and the ­professors--various aspects of Mapuche culture. On one occasion the topic was Mapuche cosmology, orreligion.<br><br>One Mapuche leader began the discussion by noting that the Mapuche understanding of the meaning of life was quite different from that of the traditional Western world and that that difference could be summarized in part by differences in the Mapuche understanding of the nature of God and the devil. He explained that while the traditional Christian belief was that God was a single, solitary person, Mapuche belief was that the principal deity consisted of four individuals: an older man, an older woman, a younger man, and a younger woman. He explained that to him this was a much more logical view of the world, as everyone knew that happiness can exist only if we share it with other people. By contrast, he noted, the principal evil spirit in the Mapuche cosmology existed all by himself. And that was what made him evil. His eternal destiny was to be alone, and it was his loneliness that made him so angry and destructive.<br><br>There is some disagreement among scholars as to the accuracy of this community leader's view of Mapuche religion,<sup>1</sup> but his insight about the effect of being alone in the world draws support from other disciplines. As Martin E.P. Seligman reported, "Social neuroscientist John Cacioppo has argued [that] loneliness is such a disabling condition that it [is clear] that the pursuit of relationships is a rock-bottom fundamental to human well-being."<sup>2</sup><br><br>Now I am fully aware that there are times when we want to be by ourselves; when we have to get away from others; when our roommates, classmates, brothers and sisters, and others just drive us crazy. All of us can relate, at one time or another, to the character in Jean Paul Sartre's play <i>No Exit</i> when he observed that "hell is other people."<sup>3</sup> But in the long run, the converse is also true--heaven is other people. Heaven will be heaven because of the other people who will be there. And experiencing heaven on earth will ultimately depend, to a large degree, on the quality of our relationships with others.<br><br>This truth has been recognized by a number of different people approaching the issue from a number of different perspectives. In 2002 Dr.Martin Seligman, the father of positive psychology, published a book entitled <i>Authentic Happiness,</i> in which he set forth his ideas about how people could achieve the maximum amount of human satisfaction and happiness. Nine years later he wrote another book entitled <i>Flourish,</i> in which he explained that his prior theory was incomplete. Among the missing elements--among the short list of things that people must have in order to truly flourish, according to Seligman--are positive relationships. Seligman explained:<br><br><i>Very little that is positive is solitary. When was the last time you laughed uproariously? The last time you felt indescribable joy? The last time you sensed profound meaning and purpose? The last time you felt enormously proud of an accomplishment? Even without knowing the particulars of these high points of your life, I know their form: </i><b><i>all of them took place around other people.</i></b><sup>4</sup><br><br>Think about it. Whenever we ­experience something truly good in our lives, that feeling is enhanced when we share it with ­others--either in the very moment or at some future time. That is a universal truth. When Lehi partook of the fruit of the tree of life and found that "it filled [his] soul with exceedingly great joy," his first desire was "that [his] family should partake of it also."<sup>5</sup> Lehi understood implicitly that he could not experience a fulness of joy by himself. His happiness could not be complete unless he could somehow share it with those he loved.<br><br>To a large extent, the depth of our eternal happiness will be determined by the quality of our relationships with others. The clear fact is, no one will be exalted by him- or herself.<sup>6</sup> Thus one of the purposes of this mortal existence--and therefore one of the purposes of your education at this university--is to develop both the skills and the attributes necessary to establish long-lasting, joyful relationships.<br><br>That truth is reflected in the manner in which the Church is organized. As Elder Marlin K. Jensen once noted:<br><br><i>The Church builds meetinghouses, not hermitages.</i><br><br><i>From the beginning of the Restoration, the command has been for us to gather in communities, where we can learn to live in harmony and mutually support one another by honoring our baptismal covenants. ...</i><br><br><i>... The inspired organization of the Church ... provides settings where we can develop socially. In Church callings, meetings, classes, quorums, councils, activities, and a variety of other opportunities for association, we develop the attributes and social skills that help prepare us for the social order that will exist in heaven.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>Indeed, our very concept of heaven is shaped by the notion of relationships. The authors of the lds.org Gospel Topics essay on "Becoming Like God" explain:<br><br><i>Church members imagine exaltation less through images of what they will </i><b><i>get</i></b><i> and more through the relationships they have now and how those relationships might be purified and elevated.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>Latter-day scripture teaches the same message. In section 130 in the Doctrine and Covenants we read:<br><br><i>That same sociality which exists among us here will exist among us there, only it will be coupled with eternal glory, which glory we do not now enjoy.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>That scripture contains both a promise and a warning. The promise is that if we develop positive relationships during this mortal life and keep the commandments, those relationships will not end at death. Indeed, they will be enhanced. We will not only enjoy that same "sociality" in the world to come but it will then "be coupled with eternal glory," thereby increasing both the temporal duration and the quality of those relationships.<br><br>But there is also a warning in the scripture. If we fail to develop positive relationships in this life, they will not suddenly spring into existence in the next life. We will experience the "same sociality" in the next life as we did in this life. If we have done nothing to create eternal relationships during our mortal existence, we will not have any in the next phase--to our eternal sorrow.<br><br>Thus my New Year's plea is that in this coming year we all increase the number and quality of eternal relationships that exist in our lives. Yes, that includes marriage relationships for those who are married or are striving for that. But it also includes other relationships--­relationships with our roommates, our classmates, our teachers, our other family members, and even strangers in the community. Let me provide four suggestions on how to accomplish this goal.<br><br>First, look for and take advantage of opportunities to develop positive relationships with others. These can be found in every aspect of your everyday life at the university. As already noted, the Church itself is organized in ways that present such opportunities. One of the distinguishing factors of the Church is its organization along geographic boundaries. Belonging to a ward organized in this fashion requires us to interact with people with whom, if left to ourselves, we would not otherwise associate. If you are from Los Angeles, being part of a ward may force you to meet and get to know someone you think is a "narrow-minded" Utah Mormon. If you are from Panguitch, it may cause you to get to know someone you may perceive as a "liberal" Mormon from New York. More important, being in a ward gives you opportunities to not only know them but to serve them and, consequently, to love them.<br><br>Similar opportunities can be found in your school life. You are here with a remarkable group of fellow students. Take time to get to know them. Take time to get to know your faculty members. They too are remarkable. Some of them can become not only mentors but lifelong and eternal friends.<br><br>Most of you will also interact with coworkers, either on or off campus. Get to know them; look for ways to serve them.<br><br>As you look for those opportunities, pay ­particular attention to those who struggle to feel included--those who are on the margins of the group, either physically or emotionally. Their loneliness may not be obvious, but with spiritual sensitivity it can be discerned. They will be blessed by your efforts. Just as important, you will be blessed and changed as well.<br><br>The BYU mission statement states that the first major educational goal for BYU is that "all students at BYU should be taught the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ."<sup>10</sup> But like all the educational goals at BYU, that charge is not limited to the acquisition of abstract theoretical knowledge. The mission statement goes on to indicate that "all relationships within the BYU community should reflect devout love of God and a loving, genuine concern for the welfare of our neighbor."<sup>11</sup> Note the inclusive and active nature of that charge. <i>All</i> our ­relationships--those at Church, school, work, home, or anywhere else--are to reflect the Savior's love. And that love is to include "a loving, genuine concern"--an active concern for all of those with whom we interact.<br><br>There are few aspects of your education here that present more--and more ­meaningful--opportunities to meet President Henry B. Eyring's challenge that we be "learners and lifters" at this university than to be actively concerned about the welfare of our neighbor.<sup>12</sup><br><br>And let us not repeat the error of the lawyer who during Jesus's time attempted to narrowly define who those neighbors are. The Savior's response to the lawyer's efforts was the parable of the good Samaritan, which makes it abundantly clear that our neighbors include not only our fellow BYU students but also all those with whom we interact within our broader community, whether they be local merchants or fans from other schools with whom we compete athletically. One of the few sad tasks of my role as president of this university is to receive letters from store owners, landlords, or visitors to our campus whose interaction with a very small minority of our university community have left them wondering how we can possibly call ourselves disciples of Christ. I don't receive many of those letters, but even one or two demonstrate that we have room for improvement. Please treat others with the respect they deserve.<br><br>That leads to my second suggestion. As we expand the group of people with whom we consciously seek to develop positive relationships, let us also expand our vision of who they really are. "The Family: A Proclamation to the World" clearly states:<br><br><i>All human beings--male and female--are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny.</i><sup>13</sup><br><br>Note the universality of the words <i>all</i> and <i>each.</i> Everyone with whom we interact--even those with whom we disagree completely on fundamental issues of truth--is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents. And we need to treat them as such, even when we cannot otherwise agree with them on anything else.<br><br>That same principle applies with particularity to those whom we love the most--our spouses and other family members. In that regard we would do well to reflect upon C.S. Lewis's astute observation:<br><br><i>It is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses, to remember that the dullest and most uninteresting person you can talk to may one day be a creature which, if you saw it now, you would be strongly tempted to worship. .</i>.<i>. There are no </i><b><i>ordinary</i></b><i> people. You have never talked to a mere mortal. .</i>.<i>. It is immortals whom we joke with, work with, marry, snub, and exploit.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>If we remember the nature of the beings with whom we interact, we are more likely to avoid two of the primary impediments to positive and eternal relationships in our digital age: ­distraction and anonymity. The former is evident when we divide our attention between those with whom we are physically present and those with whom we simultaneously interact online through texts and other messages. Surely if we were to be granted a personal audience with Heavenly Father, we would not take out our phones to check to see if someone else was trying to reach us electronically. If we remember the divine potential of all those with whom we interact, it may cause us to be more fully present and engaged with them when they are in our presence, rather than giving them only part of our attention, with the remainder reserved for our cell phone.<br><br>At the other extreme, the anonymity of some social media platforms causes us to say things that we would never say to a divine being in person. Please keep in mind that what we communicate can wound one of God's children, even when the source of that hurt is not revealed. Let all our interactions reflect the profound truth that we do live in a society of potential gods and goddesses.<br><br>Third, we should develop our ability to take joy in the success of others. One of the ­opportunities--or challenges--in life comes when our peers achieve something that we had hoped to achieve for ourselves. How do we respond when it is our fellow study group member who gets the A instead of us? Or when our roommate is the one who gets asked out on a date while we sit at home alone? Or when a classmate gets the part in the play we had hoped to receive? At such times our natural reaction--or, better stated, the reaction of the natural man--is to feel envious and jealous. Such feelings destroy relationships.<br><br>By contrast, responding positively in such circumstances strengthens our relationships in a productive and eternal way. Psychological studies have shown that "when an individual responds ... constructively ... to someone sharing a positive experience, love and friendship [between them] increase."<sup>15</sup> When we share in the joy of others, we not only come closer to them, but we lift our spirits as well.<br><br>The ability to truly take joy in the success of others--and to communicate that joy to them--is a key attribute of a celestial life. Think about it. God's greatest joy comes through the accomplishment of others. His work and glory is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of others.<sup>16</sup> His ultimate happiness comes through His enjoyment of our success. By contrast, Satan's desire is that others fail. That is what he enjoys. He is frustrated when others succeed. Thus how we respond to the success of others may be a telling measure of not only our ability to create eternal relationships but also what our ultimate destiny may be.<br><br>This can be seen in two contrasting scenes from the Book of Mormon. In 1 Nephi 17, note how Laman and Lemuel responded to the frustrations of their brother Nephi as he attempted to construct a ship without their help. As Nephi recorded, "Now when [my brethren] saw that I began to be sorrowful they were glad in their hearts."<sup>17</sup> Laman and Lemuel rejoiced because their brother was sad. They celebrated his failure. There is a word for this kind of reaction: <i>schadenfreude,</i> which means to maliciously take joy in the misfortune of others.<sup>18</sup> Schadenfreude is a common attitude in our world today--whether it be with respect to grades or sports or popularity. As one commentator noted, "We Americans love putting people up on pedestals and we love taking them down."<sup>19</sup> Such behavior is not a good thing for them or for us.<sup>20</sup><br><br>Contrast Laman and Lemuel's reaction to Nephi's sorrow with that of the people of Alma the Elder, whose covenantal desire was "to mourn with those that mourn ... and comfort those that stand in need of comfort."<sup>21</sup> How we respond to both the successes and the struggles of others provides a measure of both the nature of our relationship with them and the extent to which we are becoming like our Heavenly Father.<br><br>I know this is asking a lot. I am asking you to become more of a Zion society--one in which we are "of one heart and one mind."<sup>22</sup> The scriptures indicate that the Lord is "well pleased that there should be a school in Zion."<sup>23</sup> I think that He would be equally well pleased if there was a little more Zion in His school. If we can make progress in that realm, we will be happier and more fulfilled.<br><br>With that aspiration in mind, let me add a caveat. Positive eternal relationships come at a price. To truly love others, we have to become vulnerable in new ways. Our very love and concern for others means that we will be affected by their actions and circumstances in ways that at times will be soul stretching. It affects us more when they do not respond positively to our efforts to reach out to them. And we are wounded more deeply when they fail in their efforts. God Himself wept when He witnessed the struggles and failures of His children.<sup>24</sup> Similarly, implicit in the covenant to bear one another's burdens and to mourn with those who mourn is the certainty that if we love to that degree, we will more often have sorrow--for others. The choice to love others necessarily includes the choice to experience new and profound emotions of all kinds, both positive and negative. But the result is worth the price.<br><br>Finally, if we are to develop positive and eternal relationships with others, we must first develop a positive and eternal relationship with our Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ. As Elder Charles Didier explained:<br><br><i>One of the real purposes of life is to become a friend of the Mediator, our Savior and Redeemer, ... and then qualify to be called his friend.</i><sup>25</sup><br><br>Like other positive relationships, this eternal relationship comes at a price, but one largely paid by the Savior in Gethsemane and on the cross. As a result of His great and infinite atoning sacrifice, Christ is able, with total empathy, to mourn with us in whatever circumstance we find ourselves. He has paid the ultimate price for ultimate friendship. Just as we sometimes get to know God through our extremities,<sup>26</sup> Christ became fully acquainted with us through His extremities as part of the Atonement.<sup>27</sup> As a result, He can teach and lift us as no one else can.<br><br>In the long run there is a connection between our relationships with others and our relationship with Heavenly Father and Christ. Elder Marlin K. Jensen observed that "the quality of our daily relationships with others is the best indication of what we think about Christ."<sup>28</sup> I believe the Lord takes much more literally than we may think His observation that "inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."<sup>29</sup> Because of His great love for all of God's children, and as a result of the intimate and infinite nature of His great atoning sacrifice, Christ is personally affected--either negatively or positively--by the way we treat every single person with whom we come in contact. Thus the quality of our relationship with Him will depend to a great degree on the quality of our relationships with others.<br><br>If we are more mindful of those relationships, if we do our best to reach out to ­others in ways that lift them, if we treat them as the potentially divine beings they are, and if their joys and sorrows become our joys and ­sorrows, then our lives will be more productive and more joyful. We will be filled with the love of Christ, and we will grow closer to Him, with the promise "that when he shall appear we shall be like him."<sup>30</sup> Of this I testify, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Kevin J Worthen was president of Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 5January 2016.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. There is general consensus that the ­principle Mapuche deity consists of an ancient couple (sometimes called the Divine Couple and considered a married couple) often joined by a younger couple, and all together they are sometimes referred to as the Divine Family. See, e.g., Ramón Francisco Curivil Paillavil, <i>La fuerza de la religión de la tierra: Una herencia de nuestros antepasados</i> (Santiago, Chile: Ediciones UCSH, 2007), 75; also, see page 12 of Ana Mariella Bacigalupo, "Rituales de género para el orden cósmico: Luchas chamánicas mapuche por la totalidad," <i>Scripta Ethnologica</i> 26 (2004): 9–38, redalyc.org/pdf/148/14802601.pdf. However, as one author observed, the concept of a single evil being is much less consistent: "Missionaries are tempted to equate the forces of evil with Satan in his several guises, a logic which the Mapuche are able to understand but one to which they give no credence or at least no importance, considering the white man to be wrong" (LouisC. Faron, <i>The Mapuche Indians of Chile</i> [New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, 1968], 65).<br><br>2. Martin E.P.

<h1>gory of the Wedding Cake - Peggy Worthen - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I have entitled my remarks "The Allegory of the Wedding Cake." Once upon a time there were two young ladies. They were BYU students. They were friends and roommates. One day these two young ladies were asked by their other roommate to make her wedding cake.<br><br>"Quite a daunting request," they thought. Everyone knows, after all, that wedding cakes can be challenging. You have to have the right ingredients. You have to know how to follow a recipe. You have to know how to keep the baked cake from crumbling into pieces when transporting it from the pan to the cake platform. You have to know how to properly assemble and support each tier of the cake so that it will not collapse. You have to know how to ice the cake so that it will have a beautiful, smooth surface. You have to know how to make the decorating icing the correct consistency so that it is not too stiff or too flimsy. It has to be just right. You also have to know how to use the different cake decorating tips to make different designs. Despite all these challenges, once you have correctly baked, assembled, iced, and decorated your cake, it is a very rewarding experience. Let us pick up the story from there. [A video was shown; see youtube.com/watch?v=9BSDKbI5Ixg.]<br><br>These two young ladies faced their challenge quite admirably. They were prepared to make the cake. They had taken the class that gave them experience and skill. They had a tried-and-true cake recipe from Grandma. They had all the right ingredients. But, most important, they had the courage and faith in themselves that they could accomplish the task. So they moved forward. And even when they were distracted and things went topsy-turvy, they had the proper perspective. They did not become discouraged but made the best of the situation.<br><br>At times your life, including your life at BYU, will be like making a wedding cake. You will have many opportunities to take the things that you have learned and act upon them. You will be prepared to act. You will have the knowledge and training you need to succeed. You will have the right ingredients. But there will be no guarantee that you will succeed. In such moments you will have to decide for yourself whether you will proceed with faith or be brought to a standstill by a fear of failure. Being able to proceed when the specific outcome is not assured is one of the great tests of life.<br><br>I have a friend who received her bachelor's and master's degrees from BYU. She has used her education, talents, and skills in her profession. And she has been successful. However, she has felt the need to enhance her life. She is interested in a variety of things, but one of the things that interests her the most is the law. She is considering going to law school. I believe she would do very well. All she needs to do is study for the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) and take the exam. (It is easy for me to stand here and say that is all she needs to do because I am not the one studying for or taking the LSAT.) Except for that, she is prepared to go to law school and is qualified to do so. She only needs to apply.<br><br>I asked her one day how her pursuit of law school was going, and she told me that she had decided not to go to law school after all. I asked her why, and she told me that she had been praying about it and had not received an answer. But that does not mean she should not proceed. Elder Richard G. Scott said this about receiving answers to our prayers:<br><br>[God] <i>will reply in one of </i><b><i>three</i></b><i> ways. First, you can feel the peace, comfort, and assurance that confirm that your decision is right. Or second, you can sense that unsettled feeling, the stupor of thought, indicating that your choice is wrong. Or third--and this is the difficult one--you can feel no response.</i> ["Using the Supernal Gift of Prayer," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2007; emphasis in original]<br><br>My friend was experiencing the third reply. After some thought she determined that she would take a leap of faith and continue on with her plan of taking the LSAT and see how she felt afterward. Maybe her score on the LSAT would be the answer. Just like those who were making the wedding cake, she has all the ­ingredients--all she needs to do is act and put her trust in Heavenly Father.<br><br>Sometimes we may hesitate to move forward even after we have prayed. Perhaps we have not received the answer to our prayers that we thought we should have. We may begin to question and ask ourselves, "What if it is not the right thing to do?" or "What if it doesn't work out?" Elder Scott gave this counsel:<br><br><i>What do you do when you have prepared carefully, have prayed fervently, waited a reasonable time for a response, and still do not feel an answer? You may want to express thanks when that occurs, for it is an evidence of</i> [God's] <i>trust. When you are living worthily and your choice is consistent with the Savior's teachings and you need to act, proceed with trust. As you are sensitive to the promptings of the Spirit, one of two things will certainly occur at the appropriate time: either the stupor of thought will come, indicating an improper choice, or the peace or the burning in the bosom will be felt, confirming that your choice was correct. When you are living righteously and are acting with trust, God will not let you proceed too far without a warning impression if you have made the wrong decision.</i> ["Supernal Gift"]<br><br>After we have made the decision to act and proceed in faith--knowing that we have taken all the right steps--and after we have carefully followed the recipe that we have been given, then we need to move forward and enjoy the process without too much concern for the specific ultimate outcome. Things may occasionally turn out upside down or topsy-turvy--as they did with the wedding cake--but with the proper perspective we can enjoy the sense of accomplishment that comes from moving ­forward with faith.<br><br>Speaking of the need to move forward even in the face of uncertainty, President Thomas S. Monson has observed:<br><br>[We must be] <i>explorers in spirit. ...</i><br><br><i>The spirit of exploration ... includes developing the capacity to face trouble with courage; disappointment with cheerfulness; and triumph with humility.</i><br><br><i>God left the world unfinished for man to work his skill upon. He left the electricity in the cloud, the oil in the earth. He left the rivers unbridged and the forests unfelled and the cities unbuilt. God gives to man the challenge of raw materials, not the ease of finished things. He leaves the pictures unpainted and the music unsung and the problems unsolved, that man might know the joys and glories of creation.</i> ["First Presidency Message: In Quest of the Abundant Life," <i>Ensign,</i> March 1988]<br><br>God gives each of us opportunities to create so that we can learn to take joy in that celestial process. Sometimes the result will not be what we have expected, but the process itself is important. One reason I like to think of opportunities as wedding-cake opportunities is that even though making a wedding cake can be challenging, the truth is that even though it is often used as the centerpiece of a wedding reception and will be seen by the guests at the reception, the cake really isn't the important thing. The happiness of the couple being married is the most important thing. And the happiness of the couple does not depend on a wedding cake. Similarly, when we decide to act in the face of uncertainty, to take the leap of faith and make the cake, the cake is not what is important. It is the fact that we had the courage and faith to make the cake in the first place that matters. It is the growth that is important.<br><br>I hope each of you will recognize the ­wedding-cake opportunities that present themselves to you this year. I promise that as you move forward in faith in those moments, your life will be greatly blessed in ways you may not have fully anticipated. May it be so is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Peggy S.

<h1>Your Way - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
We live in some challenging times. More than fifty years ago President ThomasS. Monson said:<br><br><i>Today, we are encamped against the greatest array of sin, vice, and evil ever assembled before our eyes.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>I thought to myself that whatever the conditions were fifty years ago, there is a greater array today. The war between good and evil is raging and intensifying. Satan is busy radicalizing and recruiting. You are needed. You must gain the skills, convictions, courage, wisdom, and confidence to help make a difference for yourself and others. I am grateful for the inspired leadership of the Twelve and the First Presidency to help us be prepared.<br><br>Most of you are at a significant transition point in your lives. You are making life-­changing decisions about your education, careers, marriage, and family as well as your religious practice after schooling and missions. You are making decisions as you transition from being dependent on goals set by others to being independent and self-reliant, setting your own goals and making your own way. Many of those decisions are not as clear or as easy to make as you would like them to be. Trying to find your way is a challenge.<br><br>Today I would like to share a few lessons I have learned that may help you find your way. I invite you to take notes of any "actionable takeaways." Later you can decide how to act onwhat you hear.<br><h2><b>Set Your Destination, Prepare, and Act onYour Plan</b></h2><br>After graduating from BYU, I took a job with the Boeing Company in Seattle, Washington. I was soon called as an assistant Scoutmaster in our ward. One year we spent the summer taking hikes, including a fifty-miler around Mount Rainier. The early hikes prepared us physically and helped us develop the skills needed for the ultimate hike. We learned how to use maps and the compass and also to set checkpoints along the trail to find where we were and how to get where we wanted to go. It was a wonderful time for us.<br><br>For the Scouts, a hike in the Cascades was an exciting adventure and an end in itself, but for us, as leaders, it was an opportunity to teach them the skills, character traits, and testimony needed for life's journey.<br><br>Our journeys of life are like these hikes. We each choose our destination and path. However, after the judgment at the end of this life, we will be assigned a place to live and things to do based on our decisions and actions here. Choose wisely the best path as described by the plan of salvation. Map your course by learning as much as you can, setting your checkpoints, and following your plan.<br><h2><b>You Have a Royal Heritage</b></h2><br>Throughout literature there are stories told of individuals who were destined for greatness or were of royal birth who were sent away from theirhomes. They did not know who they were, their heritage, or their destiny. You know about Harry Potter, Luke Skywalker, and perhaps a few others.<br><br>Luke Skywalker was sent away and hidden. He only gradually learned who he was. Being "chosen" did not eliminate his trials or tribulations. They were important in developing the character and skills needed to achieve his ultimate destiny.<br><br>You were sent away from a royal court ­without memory of who you are or what your final role and responsibility will be. Each of you are of a royal birth and heritage. You are a son or daughter of heavenly parents. You are destined to become a king or a queen, to have a family and royal responsibilities. God is the author of the plan to qualify you for this royal birthright. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is here to help us.<br><br>President Boyd K. Packer has said:<br><br><i>The ultimate end of all activity in the Church is that a man and his wife and their children might be happy at home, protected by the principles and laws of the gospel, sealed safely in the covenants of the everlasting priesthood.</i><br><br><i>Every law and principle and power, every belief, every ordinance and ordination, every covenant, every sermon and every sacrament, every counsel and correction, the sealings, the calls, the releases, the service--all these have as their ultimate purpose the perfection of the individual and the family.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>Just as your life to this point has been ­preparing youfor the rest of your life, your time on earth is preparing you for what you will be doing in the eternities. To qualify, you must be ­worthy. God has counseled, "I the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance"<sup>3</sup> and "Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived."<sup>4</sup><br><br>The plan is designed for every human being to qualify for exaltation. All can qualify. All can succeed.<br><br>While everyone can qualify, each must earn it individually. There is no entitlement or option to delegate this to someone else. No one else can do it for you, not even the Church. It is hard work, but it is worth it.<br><br>President Russell M. Nelson said:<br><br><i>Only as an individual can you keep the commandments of God. Only as an individual can you repent. Only as an individual can you qualify for the ordinances of salvation and exaltation.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>Elder D. Todd Christofferson recently taught the following:<br><br><i>God will not live our lives for us nor control us as if we were His puppets, as Lucifer once proposed to do. Nor will His prophets accept the role of "puppet master" in God's place.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>You are not expected to be a puppet of God, the Church, or anyone else, but you are expected to take responsibility for your future. You are the only one who can earn your exaltation.<br><h2><b>Making Decisions</b></h2><br>There are important decisions to be made. President Packer said:<br><br><i>The crucial test of life ... does not center in the choice between fame and obscurity, nor between wealth and poverty. The greatest decision of life is between good and evil.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>The Book of Mormon teaches us that "men are instructed sufficiently that they know good from evil."<sup>8</sup> The Holy Ghost will help you know all things you need to know and do.<sup>9</sup><br><br>Some people delay making important decisions by waiting for perfect conditions. It could be waiting to find a "perfect" companion, waiting until the outcome is guaranteed, or waiting until job or income is secure. Some are afraid of making a mistake. The greatest mistake may be failing to act.<br><br>Most important relationships and achievements do not come ready-made off the shelf. You must pay the price to achieve the outcome you desire.<br><br>While serving as a counselor in a bishopric here at BYU, I once interviewed a freshman sister at the beginning of the year. I asked why she had come to school, to which she responded, "Iam here to marry a General Authority." I happened to know at the time that all the General Authorities were taken.<br><br>What this sister did not know is that she had to fall in love with a young man with the potential and then, together, help him become a person who could be a General Authority, if called.<br><br>Moving forward in life requires faith. That is part of the plan. President Packer shared this experience:<br><br><i>Shortly after I was called as a General Authority, I went to Elder HaroldB. Lee for counsel. He listened very carefully to my problem and suggested that I see President DavidO. McKay. President McKay counseled me as to the direction I should go. I was very willing to be obedient but saw no way possible for me to do as he counseled me to do.</i><br><br><i>I returned to Elder Lee and told him that I saw no way to move in the direction I was counseled to go. He said, "The trouble with you is you want to see the end from the beginning." I replied that I would like to see at least a step or two ahead. Then came the lesson of a lifetime: "You must learn to walk to the edge of the light, and then a few steps into the darkness; then the light will appear and show the way before you." Then he quoted these 18 words from the Book of Mormon:</i><br><br><i>"Dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith"</i> [Ether 12:6].<sup>10</sup><br><br>Deciding on the most important things first will help make other decisions easier. The scriptures teach to seek first the kingdom of God. From the scriptures we read, "Before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God."<sup>11</sup> We also read:<br><br><i>But rather </i><b><i>seek ye the kingdom of God;</i></b><i> and all these things shall be added unto you.</i><br><br><i>Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.</i><sup>12</sup><br><h2><b>The Scriptures, the Brethren, and the Holy Ghost Are the Maps, Guides, and Compass</b></h2><br>Before each hike with the Scouts, we studied the guidebooks, the maps, and the trails we would hike. We asked or talked to those who had already hiked the trails. Over time we learned which books and people were most accurate and gained confidence in using and following them. Knowledge of the areas in which we would be hiking led to better decisions and outcomes. You must do the same with your journey of life.<br><br>Nowadays Google is the go-to source of information when someone has a question, but it is not necessarily an automatic source of reliable and trustworthy information. The information returned to a query is ranked by how much someone paid for it or the frequency with which something has been referenced. The order of information is not recommended by its accuracy, its value, or the reliability of its source. There are many sources that will give you false information. This is one of Satan's tactics.<br><br>The gospel of Jesus Christ--"the plan"--is found in the scriptures, in the words of the living prophets, and through the Holy Ghost. These are the reliable maps, guides, and compass you need for life's journey. Our regular and continuous study of the scriptures and the words of the living prophets will lead to confidence and trust in the Lord's plan. The Holy Ghost will help you develop a testimony. Continued study, prayer, and experience will expand your knowledge and understanding of the principles and deepen your conversion.<br><br>God's plan provides the First Presidency and the Twelve and other leaders as guides and resources for us. They are called by prophecy and revelation.<sup>13</sup> The Brethren hold the priesthood and have the delegated keys to perform needed ordinances that we cannot get in any other way.<br><br>The role of the Brethren is to represent God to His people, as all prophets have done in the past. These men, past and present, are the first to say they are not perfect, but, like all members, they are striving to become as the Savior commanded.<sup>14</sup> Some people will hold up a yardstick of perfection to them and find them wanting. That measure is just a distraction from the real question. Christ, after all, was the only perfect person who lived on the earth. The real question is, "Did these men have and fill a divine mission?"<br><br>The fact that these men are not perfect does not bother me. It actually gives me hope in my quest for exaltation to know that the Lord does bless, guide, and honor them. Following the teachings of the prophets is our test, not theirs.<br><br>Like a compass, the Holy Ghost is a source that can teach us all things we need to know and do<sup>15</sup>--even when our minds are dark or foggy, when we are alone or with a crowd, or when we are in trouble.<br><br>Our decisions and lives will be better by understanding and living the gospel as taught by the Brethren and witnessed by the Holy Ghost. This is the quest of a lifetime.<br><h2><b>Connect the Dots--Keep Things in Context</b></h2><br>The gospel of Jesus Christ "includes the ­eternal truths or laws, covenants, and ordinances needed for mankind to enter back into the ­presence of God."<sup>16</sup><br><br>Sometimes I have found it helpful for people to understand the gospel by comparing it to a connect-the-dot diagram. Think of the individual dots as the doctrines or principles. The lines of the diagram are like the relationships between principles. The picture that is revealed when the lines are added is the image of the gospel. The quality of the image depends on the number of dots and lines that we know and understand.<br><br>In the gospel there are some fundamental principles that are foundational. They include the mission of the Savior, commandments, ordinances, judgment, forgiveness, faith, repentance, baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost, the Creation, the Fall, the Atonement, the Resurrection, the Restoration, prophets, and the priesthood. With fundamental principles we have a basic understanding of the gospel and the plan of salvation. These are enough to gain a testimony. As we grow in understanding, we learn of additional principles and are able to see a much richer image of the gospel and of our loving Heavenly Father.<br><br>Principles of the gospel do not stand alone but have connections with other principles. For example, the principles of justice and mercy, sin and the Atonement, and death and the Resurrection each have a relationship. The principles of justice and mercy illustrate the need for a connection between the two. If the connection between the two was eliminated, the plan would be destroyed. Both the principles and the relationships are needed.<br><br>In a connect-the-dot diagram, each dot holds a position needed for the creation of the image. If the dots are moved around and reordered, the image will change. The resulting image will be distorted, obscured, and possibly not represent anything at all. The same is true with the principles of the gospel. God established each principle to achieve His work in bringing "to pass the immortality and eternal life of man."<sup>17</sup><br><br>Individual principles cannot be fully understood without being placed in the gospel context. That would be like trying to see a picture with only one dot. For example, some people have contended that Jesus Christ's teachings of love are inconsistent with His teachings of keeping the commandments. But when considered in the full gospel context of qualifying for exaltation, God's insistence on keeping the commandments actually shows a greater love for His children. Parents call this tough love. Any parent would keep a child from running in front of a car in spite of the child's complaining about the parent being mean or unloving.<br><br>Principles must be considered in the context of the full gospel.<br><br>Surely you can see that neither God nor His Church leaders would change the principles at the fancy of individuals, groups, governments, or nations. To change them would put God's children at risk and destroy the plan that was created to save mankind.<br><br>So study the principles and their relationships to other principles and the gospel. Learn as much as you can. Help others to do the same. This will help strengthen testimonies. A testimony of the gospel is made up of testimonies of individual principles. Collectively they combine to create a powerful testimony of the gospel and the Church. This testimony will sustain us. If there is a trial of faith about one principle, we can rely on our testimonies of other principles and our testimony of the gospel as a whole.<br><br>The scriptures teach:<br><br><i>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i><br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>Learning is a continuous process during our lives.<br><br>There will come a time when you will be confronted with something you have not learned that causes you to question. To have a question is good and is an opportunity to learn. So learn with faith. I have a few suggestions:<br><br>1. Take time to fully study it out. Gather and learn all the facts with faith by study, discussion, and prayer. Spiritual things are only learned through spiritual methods, not mortal means. Develop the spiritual skills before trying to judge.<br><br>2. Do not abandon everything you already know. Learn how the new information fits in tothe doctrines and things you already know.<br><br>3. Use trustworthy sources. The scriptures, the teachings of the Brethren, and the Holy Ghost are trustworthy sources. Bishop Krister Stendahl, a former dean of the Harvard Divinity School, has counseled seekers of truth to ask questions of those who believe rather than those who don't believe.<sup>19</sup><br><br>4. Put things in context. Evaluating something in isolation--independent of surrounding principles, conditions, or facts--leads to incorrect conclusions. Events of the past should be considered in the context of the past, not in the context of present-day social norms, laws, or conditions. Words can have different meanings in different time periods; words spoken in 1830 can have different meanings and implications than they have today. Use the right yardstick to measure and judge.<br><br>5. Allow for the possibility that when there isa question, there may not be enough information available to readily answer it right now. In this case, you will have to exercise faith and patience and trust in your testimony that you have of other principles in the gospel--and of course, trust in God.<br><br>These lessons have helped me and ­others ­follow the path. They will help you find your way in these challenging times. Prepare yourselves.<br><br>Just as with my hikes with the Scouts, we can safely travel life's journey by relying on the maps of the scriptures, the words of the living prophets, and the compass of the Holy Ghost. God's plan and desire is that all be successful in reaching their destination. Rise up and qualify for your heritage and destiny. You can do it!<br><br>I wish to bear solemn witness that God does exist, that Jesus is the Christ, and that the Holy Ghost can guide, teach, and sustain us. I know the plan. It will help us achieve our heritage and our destiny. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Allan F.

<h1>ddy, Is Jesus Real?&quot; Overcoming Fear through Faith in Christ - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for that beautiful and calming musical number. I am grateful for the opportunity to speak today and for the support of family, colleagues, students, and friends who are here.<br><br>I invite you to reflect on the last time you experienced the feeling of fear. Was it while wondering if you would be admitted into one of the many competitive degree programs here at Brigham Young University? Or while waiting to see if the girl you asked out wants to go out again? Or, worse yet, while wondering what to do when she does? For me, the feeling is as recent as sitting on this stand, looking into the faces of so many and knowing that, through the miracle of technology, thousands more are watching this message. Like you, I can testify that the feeling of fear is real. Elder DavidA. Bednar taught about this powerful emotion in last April's general conference: "Notably, one of the first effects of the Fall was for Adam and Eve to experience fear. This potent emotion is an important element of our mortal existence."<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2015/05/saturday-afternoon-session/therefore-they-hushed-their-fears?lang=eng"><sup>1</sup></a><br><br>Today I want to visit with you about overcoming the fears that are an essential part of our experience in this earth life.<br><h2><b>Fear of an Unknown Future</b></h2><br>One of my favorite classes to teach here on campus is the Doctrine and Covenants because I find it highly relevant in my own life and in the lives of my students. In a well-known episode from the text, Oliver Cowdery, the primary scribe for the translation of the Book of Mormon, was offered the opportunity of a lifetime: to join Joseph Smith as a translator of that sacred book of scripture. Oliver was instructed:<br><br><i>Ask that you may know the mysteries of God, and that you may translate and receive knowledge from all those ancient records which have been hid up, that are sacred; and according to your faith shall it bedone unto you.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>Shortly thereafter, when Oliver failed in his attempt to translate a portion of the Book of Mormon, the Lord explained the reasons for his failure. Outlining several causes, the Lord declared, "And, behold, it is because that you did not continue as you commenced, when you began to translate, that I have taken away this privilege from you."<sup>3</sup> Furthermore, He added, "Behold, it was expedient when you commenced; but you feared, and the time is past, and it is not expedient now."<sup>4</sup><br><br>I have long wondered what it was that Oliver feared that caused him to not continue as he had commenced. Knowing that the project was of eternal importance, did he fear ­making a mistake and thus marring the sacred publication?<br><br>I was the age of most of you when this scriptural episode came to have special meaning for me. I was in graduate school here at BYU, and I began asking out a particular girl. And, as things progressed, I became scared. Like Oliver Cowdery, fear caused me to "not continue as [Ihad] commenced." I was afraid of making the wrong decision--one that I knew was important and, ideally, eternal. My poorly thought-out solution to this fear was to stop asking the girl out. As weeks turned into months, I buried myself in other things, all the while praying if I should pursue a relationship that I clearly wasn't doing anything to nurture.<br><br>Finally, one Sunday I was at church here on campus when I made up my mind: I would ­pursue the relationship. What would be the worst that could happen? "Maybe I would get married," I thought.<br><br>I called her apartment, only to learn that she had gone home that weekend. I left a message for her to call me when she returned, which, incidentally, is ideal for someone gripped by dating paralysis. The last thing ayoung man really wants to do is talk.<br><br>That afternoon my dad called. "Have you heard the news?" he asked. The girl was engaged.<br><br>She returned my call later that night. "Scott, Iheard you called," she said.<br><br>"Yes, I was just calling to congratulate you on your engagement," was my response. Fear ofthe future had kept me from continuing what I had commenced, and the time had passed. During the next six years of my single life I thought often about that experience and the Lord's instruction to Oliver Cowdery ­concerning fear.<br><br>During those frustrating years of learning to conquer my fears, I fell in love with another section of the Doctrine and Covenants--­section38. In December 1830, the month before this marvelous revelation was received, the Lord instructed Church members in New York, "A commandment I give unto the church, that it is expedient in me that they should assemble together at the Ohio."<sup>5</sup> Fear of the unknown must have gripped their hearts. What would they do about their homes, their loved ones, ortheir professions? What would the future hold for them as they moved into the unknown?<br><br>Understandably, when the members gathered for a Church conference in Fayette, New York, in early January 1831, they were concerned about the implications of this command. Describing the occasion, Church historian John Whitmer recorded, "The solemnities of eternity rested on the congregation, and having previously received a revelation to go to Ohio, they desired to know somewhat more concerning this matter."<sup>6</sup><br><br>Answering their question as to why they were to move to Ohio, the Lord began:<br><br><i>Thus saith the Lord your God, even Jesus Christ, the Great I AM, Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the same which looked upon the wide expanse of eternity, and all the seraphic hosts of heaven, before the world was made;</i><br><br><i>The same which knoweth all things, for all things are present before mine eyes.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>The Lord appears to be saying to His Saints what I love to respond to my own children when they ask questions like "Why do we have to go to bed?" or "Why do I have to eat my vegetables?" or "Why can't I hit my little brother back?" In essence, the Lord's response, like mine, is, "Because I know best." However, in this and all other cases He really does know best.<br><br>Also, unlike my futile fatherly response to my children, the Lord followed up with a promise only He could fulfill:<br><br><i> But behold, verily, verily, I say unto you that mine eyes are upon you. I am in your midst and ye cannot see me;</i><br><br><i> But the day soon cometh that ye shall see me, and know that I am.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>Don't we all have times like this in our past--when we asked why, only to look back and recognize that God was with us and that though we couldn't see Him then, we do now? Don't we all have a job we desperately wanted, a major we wanted to get into, or a person we wanted to date--about which or whom we may have even prayed in earnest in the past? Aren't we all glad that God was in our midst during those "why" times, which we now gratefully see?<br><br>Though the Lord outlined that members should trust both His omniscience and His aid, in John Whitmer's history of these events he recalled:<br><br><i>After the Lord had manifested the . . . words through Joseph the Seer, there were some divisions among the congregation, some would not receive </i>[it] <i>as the word of the Lord: But </i>[held]<i> that Joseph had invented it himself to deceive the people that in the end he might get gain</i>.<sup>9</sup><br><br>Sadly, while some did see the hand of the Lord in the command, others, gripped by uncertainty and fear, did not.<br><br>So how do we overcome our fears, act in faith, and move forward toward an uncertain future?<br><br>Eleven years ago last fall I was dating my wife, Janice. The week before Thanksgiving I invited her to come home with me to southern Utah for the holiday weekend. She accepted. And then, once again, I became really scared. Ihad taken girls on road trips home before, and, for those familiar with Interstate 15 between Provo and southern Utah, usually by about the town of Nephi these became the longest weekends of my life. I started to think of ways that I could uninvite Janice. With fears swirling in my head, I came to campus on the Monday before Thanksgiving. Preparing to teach my class that day, I stumbled across these words at the beginning of Doctrine and Covenants67:<br><br><i>Behold and hearken, O ye elders of my church, who have assembled yourselves together, whose prayers I have heard, and whose hearts I know, and whose desires have come up before me.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>As a thirty-year-old elder, I had the desire and had been praying for a long time that Imight find a spouse and begin an eternal companionship. I could relate to these early Saints.<br><br>The Lord continued:<br><br><i>Behold and lo, mine eyes are upon you, and the heavens and the earth are in mine hands, and the riches of eternity are mine to give.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>While I was in my office in the Joseph Smith Building that morning, the thought struck me: "Maybe marriage is one of the riches of eternity, and maybe it is God's to give."<br><br>The revelation then warned:<br><br><i>Ye endeavored to believe that ye should receive the blessing which was offered unto you; but behold, verily I say unto you there were fears in your hearts, and verily this is the reason that ye did not receive.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>I realized that if I didn't face my fear of an uncertain future, I might never receive the blessings the Lord had in store for me.<br><br>I took Janice home for Thanksgiving, and the weekend went wonderfully. While returning to Provo, however, my worst fears of carrying on an extended conversation with a girl were realized: a snowstorm forced the closure of Interstate 15, and the two of us were stranded together in the car between the Utah towns of Beaver and Fillmore for several hours with no choice but to simply talk to each other. As our three-hour road trip home turned into seven, I realized that if we could survive this time together, maybe we also could face my fears of eternal marriage together.<br><br>I learned a valuable lesson from these experiences: as you exercise faith to overcome fears of future uncertainty, you will see God's hand in your life. In fact, just a few short verses later in Doctrine and Covenants67, the Lord promised:<br><br><i>And again, verily I say unto you that it is your privilege, and a promise I give unto you that have been ordained unto this ministry, that inasmuch as you strip yourselves from jealousies and fears, and humble yourselves before me, for ye are not sufficiently humble, the veil shall be rent and you shall see me and know that I am.</i><sup>13</sup><br><br>I now look back on those years of post-mission single life and, like the Saints in the Doctrine and Covenants, realize that God was in my midst, and I couldn't see Him. There were lessons I needed to learn--primarily about overcoming fear--coupled with experiences both my wife and I needed to have, that eventually prepared us for each other and for our future together. As I stripped myself of fear, the day came that I could see God's hand and receive the riches of eternity. But they only came as Iexercised faith.<br><h2><b>Fear of a Failed Past</b></h2><br>Facing fear in our lives isn't limited to dramatic experiences involving unknown future events, such as relocating at the command of the Lord or finding an eternal companion. Indeed, the happiness of some is crippled by fears of past failures and by the foreboding worry that the present and future can never become bright again. I have been learning this lesson lately from my children.<br><br>To protect the not-so-innocent, I won't name names, but this experience involved one of my children and a few of her friends getting sent to the principal's office in first grade after an incident involving a secret club, a confrontation, and another girl getting tapped on the head with a stick. Though the situation was quickly resolved by missing recess and writing an apology to the girl who had been hit, the incident continues to haunt my daughter. Last fall, in the weeks before starting third grade, we often found my daughter in tears, worrying that her new teacher and friends would discover that she had been sent to the principal's office in first grade and that her social life and academic future would be forever ruined.<br><br>In fact, just last week, when asked if she was happy, her response was, "I would be if I hadn't been sent to the principal's office in first grade."<br><br>Worst of all, she often questions her worth and, most important, her ability to go to the celestial kingdom, because, after all, "no one else in our family has ever been sent to the principal's office."<br><br>How many of us allow fears from our own getting-sent-to-the-principal's-office experience to paralyze us from moving forward with faith in our lives? Even after repenting, do we ever let our past mistakes impede us from enjoying happiness now and having hope for the future? Many of us fear falling short of our divine potential because our mistakes remind us that we are so far from perfect.<br><br>Author GeraldN. Lund, who also served in the Church as a member of the Seventy, offered this wise counsel:<br><br><i> Remember that one of Satan's strategies, especially with good people, is to whisper in their ears: "If you are not perfect, you are failing." This is one of his most effective deceptions, for it contains some elements of truth. But it </i>is<i> deception nonetheless.</i> <i>While we should never be completely satisfied until we </i>are<i> perfect, we should recognize that God is pleased with every effort we make--no matter how faltering--to better ourselves.</i> <i>One of the most commonly listed attributes of God is that he is long-suffering and quick to show mercy. He wants us to strive for perfection, but the fact that we have not yet achieved it does not mean we are failing.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1986/08/i-have-a-question?lang=eng"><sup>14</sup></a><br><br>Sometimes good people like you and my daughter become crippled by fear because focusing on past imperfections clouds the vision of how the Lord feels about us now and what our potential can be in eternity. We are keenly aware of what the apostle Paul taught the Romans: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God."<sup>15</sup> We feel so far from His majestic ideal and often fear that we will never reach our celestial destiny. In these instances, the wise counsel of Elder NealA. Maxwell may be helpful:<br><br><i> Our perfect Father does not expect us to be perfect children yet. He had only one such Child. Meanwhile, therefore, sometimes with smudges on our cheeks, dirt on our hands, and shoes untied, stammeringly but smilingly we present God with a dandelion--as if it were an orchid or a rose! If for now the dandelion is the best we have to offer, He receives it, knowing what we may later place on the altar. It is good to remember how young we are spiritually</i>.<sup>16</sup><br><br>With my daughter and so many like her in mind, I have been impressed lately with the following verse of scripture, again in the Doctrine and Covenants. As part of the Kirtland Temple dedicatory prayer, the Prophet Joseph Smith pled, "OJehovah, have mercy upon this people, and <i>as all men sin</i> forgive the transgressions of thy people, and let them be blotted out forever."<sup>17</sup><br><br>Part of becoming like and returning to our Heavenly Father, even when we feel so imperfect in relation to Him, includes believing in Him both as we repent <i>and </i>after. We typically, and rightly, recite in the fourth article of faith: "We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance."<sup>18</sup> In doing so, we imply an order: faith comes first, then repentance. However, in many passages of scripture, belief also follows repentance.<br><br>In Doctrine and Covenants 20 we read:<br><br><i>And we know that all men must </i><b><i>repent and believe</i></b><i> on the name of Jesus Christ, and worship the Father in his name, and endure in faith on his name to the end, or they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God.</i><sup>19</sup><br><br>To the Nephites, Christ taught:<br><br><i>I bear record that the Father commandeth all men, everywhere, to </i><b><i>repent and believe</i></b><i> in me.</i><sup>20</sup><br><br>And, finally, rejoicing in the success of his missionary labors, Ammon told his fellow companions:<br><br><i>My joy is carried away, even unto boasting in my God; for he has all power, all wisdom, and all understanding; he comprehendeth all things, and he is a merciful Being, even unto salvation, to those who will </i><b><i>repent and believe</i></b><i> on his name.</i><sup>21</sup><br><br>Faith leads to repentance of our past mistakes. But all of us, including an eight-year-old girl who fears she isn't perfect, need to follow up necessary repentance with belief--a belief in God and a belief that, though we all sin, the Atonement of Jesus Christ can and will save us. Such belief can replace our fears of the past with a joy in our present circumstances and a bright hope for our future. In the end, it is nurturing and acting on this belief that will do more than save us--it will perfect us.<sup>22</sup><br><br>When our view of God's hand is obscured by "the temptations and the sins which do so easily beset [us]," we, like Nephi, need to "know in whom [we] have trusted."<sup>23</sup> Counseling university students to apply this power of belief in their lives, Elder JeffreyR. Holland instructed this audience more than thirty years ago:<br><br><i>I am not sure what your most painful memories might be. I'm certain there are lots of problems we could all list. Some may be sins among the most serious God Himself has listed. Others may be less serious disappointments, including a poor start in school, or a difficult relationship with your family, or personal pain with a friend. Whatever the list, it's bound to be long when we add up all the dumb things we've done. And my greatest fear is that you will not believe in other chances . . . , that on some days you will not believe in any future at all.</i><br><br>After summarizing Shakespeare's tragic story of Macbeth, Elder Holland continued:<br><br><i>Unless we believe in repentance and restoration, unless we believe there can be a way back from our mistakes--whether those sins be sexual or social or civil or academic, whether they be great or small--unless we believe we can start over on solid ground with our past put behind us and genuine hope for the future--in short, if we cannot believe in the compassion of Christ and His redemptive love, then I think we in our own way are as hopeless as Macbeth and our view of life just as depressing</i>.<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/jeffrey-r-holland_robe-ring-fatted-calf/"><sup>24</sup></a><br><br>More recently, at a devotional like this one atthe start of a new year, Elder Holland said:<br><br><i>There is something in us, at least in too many of us, that particularly fails to forgive and forget earlier mistakes in life--either mistakes we ourselves have made or the mistakes of others. That is not good. It is not Christian. It stands in terrible opposition to the grandeur and majesty of the Atonement of Christ. To be tied to earlier mistakes--our own or other people's--is the worst kind of wallowing in the past from which we are called to cease and desist. . . .</i><br><br><i>Perhaps at this beginning of a new year there is no greater requirement for us than to do as the Lord Himself said He does: "Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more" (D&amp;amp;C 58:42).</i><br><br><i>The proviso, of course, is that repentance has to be sincere, but when it is and when honest effort is being made to progress, we are guilty of the greater sin if we keep remembering and recalling and rebashing someone with their earlier mistakes--and that "someone" might be ourselves. We can be so hard on ourselves, often much more so than with others!</i><a href="http://speeches-beta.byu.edu/talks/jeffrey-r-holland_remember-lots-wife/"><sup>25</sup></a><br><br>Gratefully, I recently had the chance to teach my fearful daughter that we can repent and move on in our lives rather than let our past scar and cripple us. As my father and I finished work on a playhouse for my kids this past fall, I came across the name of my daughter's friend scribbled on the side of the door. Though my nervous daughter wasn't the one who had ­written it, her anxiety kicked into high gear.<br><br>"Don't tell Grandpa," was her first plea, ­followed shortly thereafter by the question "Was that before or after I was baptized?" Her logical child's thought was, "Am I accountable for my friend's graffiti on the playhouse?" Her follow-up question to me was, "Can I be forgiven?" A past mistake--in this case not even one of her own doing--threatened to cloud her happiness in both the present and the future.<br><br>We then discussed her fears from being sent to the principal's office in first grade and how it was still affecting her life. We talked about the importance of repentance and how once we have repented, we need to believe in the power of the Atonement in our lives. Standing on the porch of that playhouse, I pulled up the following words on my phone from the final general conference address of President BoydK. Packer:<br><br><i>Nowhere is the generosity and mercy of God more manifest than in repentance.</i><br><br><i> Our physical bodies, when harmed, are able to repair themselves, sometimes with the help of a physician. If the damage is extensive, however, often a scar will remain as a reminder of the injury.</i><br><br><i> With our spiritual bodies it is another matter. Our spirits are damaged when we make mistakes and commit sins. But unlike the case of our mortal bodies, when the repentance process is complete, no scars remain because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.</i><br><br>President Packer then added his testimony:<br><br><i>The Atonement, which can reclaim each one of us, bears no scars. That means that no matter what we have done or where we have been or how something happened, if we truly repent, He has promised that He would atone. And when He atoned, that settled that. There are so many of us who are thrashing around, as it were, with feelings of guilt, not knowing quite how to escape. You escape by accepting the Atonement of Christ, and all that was heartache can turn to beauty and love and eternity. . . .</i><br><br><i> ...If you have something that is bothering you--sometimes so long ago you can hardly remember it--put the Atonement to work. It will clean it up, and you, as does He, will remember your sins no more</i>.<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2015/05/saturday-morning-session/the-plan-of-happiness?lang=eng"><sup>26</sup></a><br><br>Handing her my paintbrush, we repeated the words "no scars" as she painted over her friend's name.<br><h2><b>God Is Real</b></h2><br>So how do we develop the faith necessary to conquer our fears resulting from an imperfect past or an uncertain future? As a parent I have thought long and hard about that lately--especially because I have young children whom I deeply want to have faith. It is important to note that both of these fears are rooted in the same thing: the unknown. Faith can displace fear because it is rooted in the knowledge of God. The <i>Lectures on Faith</i> teach:<br><br><i> Let us here observe, that three things are necessary in order that any rational and intelligent being may exercise faith in God unto life and salvation.</i><br><br><i> First, the idea that he actually exists.</i><br><br><i> Secondly, a </i><b><i>correct</i></b><i> idea of his character, perfections, and attributes.</i><br><br><i> Thirdly, an actual knowledge that the course of life which he is pursuing is according to his will</i>.<sup>27</sup><br><br>I am committed, in my own life and in the lives of my children, to develop faith by coming to know God. Elder Bednar taught, "Correct knowledge of and faith in the Lord empower us to hush our fears because Jesus Christ is the only source of enduring peace."<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2015/04/therefore-they-hushed-their-fears?lang=eng"><sup>28</sup></a> Furthermore, our prophet, President ThomasS. Monson, has promised:<br><br><i>Though the storm clouds may gather, though the rains may pour down upon us, our knowledge of the gospel and our love of our Heavenly Father and of our Savior will comfort and sustain us and bring joy to our hearts as we walk uprightly and keep the commandments. There will be nothing in this world that can defeat us.</i><br><br><i>My beloved brothers and sisters, fear not. Be of good cheer. The future is as bright as your faith</i>.<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/04/be-of-good-cheer?lang=eng"><sup>29</sup></a><br><br>A few years ago our children watched for the first time the movie <i>Shrek Forever After</i>. The story features the hero, Shrek, and his conflict with Rumpelstiltskin and an army of witches. That night my wife and I were awakened by the cries of our then four-year-old little girl, whose bad dream had her screaming in fear, "The witches are going to get me! The witches are going to get me!"<br><br>Entering her bedroom, I sought to reassure her. On the wall in her room hangs a picture of Jesus comforting a little child. Hoping for a quick return to sleep for her and for me, I told her, "You can pray. Jesus loves you and will protect you. And, by the way, witches aren't real."<br><br>She looked up at me with questioning eyes and asked, "Daddy, is Jesus real?"<br><br>The logic of a four-year-old at two in the morning was clear: if witches aren't real, then what about this Jesus you tell me about? We had a good, long talk.<br><br>As I testified to her, I testify to you: God, our Father, is real. His Son is real. Our faith in Them will be strengthened as we learn more completely about Them and have sacred experiences with Them. As we do, we will feel of Their love--a "perfect love [that] casteth out all fear."<sup>30</sup> Of that I testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Scott C.

<h1>r of Not Knowing - Liz Wiseman - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
When I came to campus this morning, Ihad a bit of a panic, and it wasn't at the thought of you, because you all are an awesome sight. It was seeing the signs--those big signs at the entrance to campus. I have to admit that those signs always give me a little panicky feeling because they are a reminder that this is the place where I was abandoned by my parents. This is the place where I was left to figure things out on my own and to wonder, "Am I even smart enough to be here?"<br><br>But today these signs gave me this panic because I knew I was coming here to campus--a place that cultivates knowledge and reveres intelligence--to talk about the dangers of knowledge and the downside of intelligence. Essentially I was coming here to ask this question: Can we actually get too smart?<br><br>You have probably heard this saying: "Knowledge is power." But today I want to ask, Is there actually more power in not knowing? Iwant to make a case for ignorance--not ignorance as in stupidity or the lack of education but simply the lack of certainty.<br><br>My dad had a saying. He used to say, "It looks like someone has gotten too big for their britches." By this he meant that they were a little too full of themselves, a little too much of a smarty-pants. As we gain knowledge and intelligence and as we get smart, can we get a little too full of ourselves? A little too smart for our own good and maybe even a little too smart for the good of others?<br><br>I want to center our conversation today on two questions. They are both questions that I have spent years researching and writing about. The first is a question about leadership: How does the knowledge of a leader affect the intelligence of the team around them and why is it that some leaders seem to amplify the intelligence of people around them while other leaders seem to just suck the intelligence and life right out of a room?<br>That is our first question. The second question is a question about learning and performance. I want to begin with the first question.<br><h2><b>Multiplier Leadership</b></h2><br>When I graduated from BYU and from the Marriott School, I took a job working for a small maverick software company called Oracle. No one knew this company at the time; people thought it was a toothbrush manufacturer. Oracle had a very simple and clear hiring ­strategy: hire the top grads out of the top schools, mix them all together, and just see what happens.<br><br>At the time, Oracle didn't recruit at BYU, and Oracle did not actively recruit me. I simply found Oracle and wiggled my way into the mix. It wasn't as if I felt like I didn't belong there; Ijust felt really lucky to be working there and to be working around all these brilliant people. So I became a genius watcher.<br><br>I could see how intelligence--just raw ­brilliance and smarts--was a really powerful tool for growth and for innovation, but I could also see how intelligence was being used as a weapon. We all know that really smart people tend to get promoted into management, but many of these leaders never look beyond their own genius to see the full genius and capability of people around them. They are smart, but they tend to shut down the smarts of others. They are idea killers and energy zappers inside of an organization.<br><br>They are leaders, such as one particular executive I worked with at Oracle who was brilliant but who micromanaged every detail of the operation, despite the fact that he managed a vast scope--several divisions inside the company. He would personally review and edit every piece of documentation for every product that came out of his product divisions. After he reviewed these documents, the authors would get them back, and there would be all sorts of scribble marks with his signature green ink and a lot of capital <i>T</i>s written all over. When the authors got to the end of a document, there would be this helpful legend to interpret these notations: "T = Terrible." I was not surprised watching how people held back and played it safe around this executive.<br><br>But I also noticed a different type of leader: leaders whose intelligence was infectious inside the organization and leaders who seemed to bring out the intelligence of people around them. When these leaders walked into a room, it was as if you could see lightbulbs going off over people's heads, and ideas flowed and problems got solved. I came to call these leadersmultipliersand those other leaders diminishers.<br><br>Now, haven't you ever wondered why it is that you are just absolutely brilliant around some people but kind of a bumbling fool around others? You know, beyond the dating context?<br><br>I became really determined to research and find out why some leaders seem to bring out the very best in people around them. This research showed that these multiplier leaders did a number of things similarly to diminishers but a small number of things very differently. Diminisher leaders issued directives and gave direction based on what they could see and what they knew, whereas multiplier leaders defined opportunities and invited other people to stretch toward them. Diminishers carried with them a belief that no one was going to figure it out without them, whereas multipliers held a belief that, fundamentally, people are smart and that they are going to figure it out.<br><br>The research showed that diminisher leaders got less than half of people's intelligence--the available intelligence around them--whereas multiplier leaders got all of it. It was a two-times difference in the amount of intelligence that was being used by these multiplier leaders, and this difference really came from how a leader used his or her own intelligence.<br><br>One of my favorite multiplier leaders is a phenomenal athlete as well as a sports franchise owner and a businessman--Magic Johnson. He described an experience he had when he was a young man that has shaped the way he leads.<br><br>Even back in high school he was a phenomenally talented basketball player. Because this was back when he was Earvin Johnson Jr., pre-Magic days, his high school coach said to him, "Earvin, every time you get the ball, I want youto ..."<br><br>You might think he would say, "Pass it," but he said, "Earvin, every time you get the ball, Iwant you to take the shot."<br><br>And so he did. And he scored a lot of points, and the coach loved it and the players loved it because they won every game! They would win with fifty-four points, and Earvin would have scored fifty-two of those points. But the boys loved it, because what young boy doesn't want to be on an undefeated team?<br><br>But then, after one particular game, when all the players were leaving the gym and heading out to their cars, Earvin noticed the faces of the parents who had come to watch their sons play basketball but instead ended up watching this superstar.<br><br>And he said, "I made a decision at that very young age that I would use my God-given talent to help everyone on the team be a better player."<br><br>It was this orientation he had that earned him the nickname of Magic--for his ability to raise the level of play of every team that he ever played on.<sup>1</sup><br><h2><b>Accidental Diminishers</b></h2><br>But that really wasn't even the interesting part of the research about leaders. I started out thinking that diminishers were narcissistic, tyrannical bullies, but what I found was that most diminishers actually weren't jerks. Most of them were really nice people. I saw that most of the diminishing that was happening inside of our schools, our workplaces, and our homes was being caused by really good people who thought they were doing a good job leading.<br><br>You might ask yourself, "How might I, with the very best of intentions, actually be having a diminishing impact on those I lead, those I work alongside, or those I live with?"<br><br>I call these people accidental diminishers, and they manifest themselves in several ways.<br><br>Maybe you are a bit of an "idea guy"--the ­creative thinker who is constantly spouting ideas, thinking that their ideas are going to stimulate other ideas. But, actually, people just end up chasing their ideas and shutting down their own ideas.<br><br>Or maybe you are the "always-on leader"--the charismatic leader who is always present, always engaged, and always has something to say and who thinks, of course, that their energy is infectious.<br><br>But people say these leaders are suffocating. I mean, what do you do when you see one of these people coming down the hall toward you? Yeah, you hide, because then they expand like a gas and take up all the available space, leaving very little room for others.<br><br>Or what about the "rescuer"? These are the leaders who don't like to see people suffer, struggle, make mistakes, or fail, so they extend a hand of help. But they end up leaving people rather helpless.<br><br>Or the "pacesetter," who is leading by example, assuming that other people will see and follow. But when other people conclude that they can't catch up and they can't win, these leaders end up creating more spectators than true followers.<br><br>Or the "rapid responder" or the "optimist"--the can-do leader who sees nothing but possibilities but also overlooks problems.<br><br>But where is learning really born? It is born in the struggle.<br><br>Becoming a great leader requires us to understand how our most noble intentions can end up having a diminishing effect. Sometimes we don't see it until much later.<br><br>I ran into executive Mr. T = Terrible several years ago at an alumni gathering called the Oracle 100. It was an event with the top 100 leaders who had helped build and grow Oracle. We all gathered to mostly talk with each other, asking, "Wasn't that fun?" and maybe even, "Aren't we great?"<br><br>Midway through the program we took a break, and I saw this former executive and I said to him, "Man, this must be really fun for you to look back and see what it was that you built."<br><br>He responded in a way that I really wasn't expecting at all. He got heavy and sad, and he said, "No, actually this is really painful for me because I think I was really hard on people. And I realize now that I didn't need to be."<br><br>Not only can our knowledge and our ­capability blind us to the capability of people around us, but it can also blind us to new possibilities.<br><h2><b>Rookie Smarts</b></h2><br>I want to turn to the second question: As professionals, how does our knowledge get in our own way?<br><br>I want to go back in time again, back to Oracle when I was the age of many of you here. I was just a year out of graduate school and a year or maybe a year and a half into my career when I was asked to manage the training function for the company. That seemed premature to me, but then the new responsibility was <i>really</i> premature when they said, "And Larry also wants a university, so, Liz, we need you to build the team and go build Oracle University."<br><br>It struck me that this was a grown-up job, and I wasn't yet a grown-up at all. In fact, my only qualification to run a university was that Ihad recently been at a university. However, no one else seemed at all concerned with my great lack of experience.<br><br>Having this big job with very little experience, I was forced to ask a lot of questions and stay close to the executives. My strategy was to keep showing up at their staff meetings and to learn as quickly as I could. What I learned was that once you keep showing up with questions, they expect you to have answers at some point. It is like showing up to a potluck and never bringing anything. At some point people say, "Hey, are you going to actually bring and contribute anything?"<br><br>So I was forced to show progress and results. We were doing a pretty good job, but I took a lot of teasing from the executives about being kind of young for a fairly big job. One particular time my boss and I were at a business event, and he introduced me to a client who was a very distinguished-looking man. My boss said, "This is Liz. She runs Oracle University."<br><br>The man noticeably flinched. It was almost like a startled response, and my boss, Bob, thought it was quite fun, so he jumped into the conversation, coming to my aid by saying, "Oh yeah, Liz? She is not particularly qualified for her job."<br><br>And then he broke out in this big smile, and I realized that it was like the first lesson in executive management: you don't get a lot of air cover. So I had to defend myself, and I said, "Hey, Bob, who wants a job they are qualified for? There would be nothing to learn."<br><br>And it was as if he had said, "Wish granted," because for the next dozen years I had jobs that I had no idea how to do. It kept up for about a dozen years, but eventually I started to feel qualified. I actually started to feel legit, and I began to think, "Gee, I think I actually know how to do this, and maybe someone would actually hire me to do this and start a university or run a university."<br><br>That is when I started to feel stagnant and stuck. And I decided to leave Oracle--honestly, in search of something I didn't know how to do, which kept things wide open.<br><br>That is what led me to be a management researcher and author. When I left Oracle, I had this really wonderful Hindu friend named Dinesh, and he said to me, "Liz, what is the question that you are holding this year?"<br><br>And my first reaction was, "Wow, a year seems like a really long time to hold a question." But then I realized that I actually did have a question, and my question was this: How does what I know get in the way of what Idon't know but maybe need to learn?<br><br>This was a very relevant question for me because I was leaving a comfortable environment in which I was the boss, and I was moving into unfamiliar territory in which I would be an underdog, at best.<br><br>But it struck me as also a relevant question for our time because we live and work in a reality in which technology has allowed our business cycles and living cycles to spin so fast that often we don't even face the same problem twice. And the state of the art doesn't stand still or stay true for verylong.<br><br>For example, for those who work in science or technology or who are going to take a job in a field related to or highly infused with STEM, I did some interesting calculations for my research. Based on the rate at which knowledge is increasing and the rate at which knowledge is decaying, I calculated that about 15 percent ofwhat we know today is likely to be relevant in five years.<br><br>Okay, and that is not the number fifty--that is the number fifteen, as in between 10 and 20 percent. And here is the kicker: we don't even know which 15 percent this is.<br><br>A few years ago my research team and I went to work and studied about 400 different work scenarios, looking at how people with experience approach a particular task and how people without experience approach the same task. We found some really interesting things. We found that with experience comes, obviously, a lot of virtues and assets, but experience also brings with it a number of blind spots--because what happens once we gain know-how and once we start to recognize patterns and developmental shortcuts?<br><br>I have asked Brent W. Webb, our academic vice president, to read something for us:<br><br><i>It deson't mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod aepapr, the olny iprmoatnt tihng is taht the frist and lsat ltteer are in the rghit pcale. The rset can be a toatl mses and you can sitll raed it wouthit pobelrm.</i><br><br><i>S1M1L4RLY, Y0UR M1ND 15 R34D1NG 7H15 4U70M471C4LLY W17H0U7 3V3N 7H1NK1NG 4B0U7 17</i><i>.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>Well done, Brother Webb. Thank you.<br><br>So you see, once we become familiar with the subject, we can see what we expect to see, and sometimes the more we know, the less we see around us.<br><br>Let me describe what we found when we studied how people without experience approached things. When we are operating without experience, there are some obvious downsides. No one in here really wants a rookie surgeon or a rookie dentist, and if you have been to a first-year violin recital, you know what you are going to get there.<br><br>But when we are inexperienced at something, when we are in this rookie space, when we are doing something really hard and really important, and when we are doing it for the very first time, we operate in some really predictable and very interesting ways. They are simple ways, but they are extraordinarily powerful--­particularly for the environment in which we live right now. We found that when we are in this rookie mode--whether we are twenty-five years old or sixty-five years old--we operate unencumbered by knowledge, so we see more possibilities and we explore more. We lack know-how, so we have to go out and get it.<br><br>When we are in this rookie space, we ask better questions. We are more alert. We listen more. We value feedback. We seek feedback. When we are operating without a lot of expertise, we actually tend to bring in more expertise because we consult with so many people and we mobilize the expertise of others. Contrary to popular opinion, when we are in this rookie zone, we are not big, bold risk-takers; we are actually extremely cautious. But we are fast. With knowledge work, rookies tend to outperform people in both innovation and speed. We operate when we are on a frontier in scrappy ways. We improvise, we are lean, we are agile, and we stay close to our customers, because when we lack resources, that is when we get really resourceful.<br><h2><b>Challenge Brings Satisfaction</b></h2><br>We also found an interesting relationship between challenge level and satisfaction. We surveyed more than 1,000 people, asking these two questions: How challenged are you in your work? and How satisfied are you in your work?<br><br>We found a really interesting linear correlation. As challenge level went up, so did satisfaction. It is kind of our happy place because we are built for challenge.<br><br>So often we are at our best when we know the very least. Why is it that challenges tend to bring out our best? You might conclude that it is because we like them so much. But that is not really what explains this dynamic.<br><br>In a retaliatory move against the professor for whom I was a teaching assistant in graduate school, I am going to ask Dean Lee Perry to come join me for a public experiment. I have underbriefed him, so I don't think he is fully prepared for what we are going to do.<br><br>I am going to ask Dean Perry to play the role of challenger. It is a multiplier discipline. Dean Perry, I want you to stretch this rubber band as far as you can.<br><br>Wait, first of all I should give you a briefing. This is not a magic rubber band, so this could end badly. Yes, it could be bad for you or for me or for pretty much everyone on the stand.<br><br>I want you to stretch it as far as you possibly can without breaking it. And then hold it there. I have a backup in case this one does break. Pull it as far as you can without breaking it.<br><br>People out there are thinking, "I wish I didn't have the floor seats."<br><br>Okay, we are almost there. Okay, we are there!<br><br>So now, if Dean Perry doesn't give in, Iam left here in a position I cannot maintain forvery long. What are my options? I can let go or I can move closer to him, which is representative of me solving the problem, gaining knowledge, figuring it out, and burning through that challenge.<br><br>Then, as my leader, what would Dean Perry do next? What does a good leader get to do next after I have mastered this challenge and burned through this tension?<br><br>Yes, another stretch! There he is! Back to the point of tension. Thank you. We are good, Lee. Well done, well done!<br><br>Herein lies the secret of the rookie zone. It is really powerful. It propels us to do our best work because we don't like it. We can't stand to be in this state of tension in which the size of the task is bigger than our capability, and it pushes us and propels us forward. We either letgo or we push through.<br><br>I think what I learned in this research is that when we linger too long on a plateau, a little part of us dies inside. But when we step out of the space of knowing--where we are fully capable--and step into unfamiliar territory, we feel alive. I think it is actually where we feel divine, and, in some ways, I feel like it is where we see God's hand working in our lives.<br><br>Now my research has been in the professional world, but I can't help but see some of the parallels to our spiritual lives. I was recently struck by something I read in a weekly letter home from my nephew Dylan, who is a BYU student now serving in the Japan Kobe Mission. He told a tale of two investigators, and it might be a familiar tale to some of you returned missionaries.<br><br>Dylan talked to one investigator who said, "Honestly, I don't understand the purpose of life."<br><br>Dylan spoke with another investigator who was convinced that he already knew a lot about the Church from TV and the Internet, and he was eager to share what he knew and teach the missionaries.<br><br>When young Elder Wiseman described teaching the first investigator, he said, "I felt like my soul was on fire."<br><br>He described the experience of teaching the second investigator as a standoff, an inability to teach, and a total absence of the Spirit. In his letter he then referenced--as you might expect--2 Nephi 9:28:<br><br><i>When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves.</i><br><br>Dylan then went on to say, in the beautiful simplicity of a nineteen-year-old missionary, "Yeah, don't be that guy."<br><br>Don't be that guy. When we come to depend on acquired knowledge, we can easily fall prey to secularism, which offers us a one-eyed view of the world. It is like we see clearly but in a limited way. It is like we see half of the colors in a spectrum. We don't really see clearly until we unite our knowledge and our faith--or, in the words of Robert Frost, "As my two eyes make one in sight."<sup>3</sup><br><br>Some of you know that Stanford University was built as a memorial to Leland and Jane Stanford's only child, who passed away in his youth. His mother, the great visionary Jane Lathrop Stanford, designed a church as the center­piece of the campus. Inscribed on the walls of the east transept of the church are these words:<br><br><i>Knowledge is intelligence and its impress comes upon the mind. Wisdom is the desire of the heart prompted by God's highest and most Divine nature and comprises all knowledge. Wisdom is the highest spiritual intelligence, while the natural man, through knowledge, can know nothing of wisdom.</i><br><br><i>A man may have great intelligence and yet have nothing of the Christ life within him.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>I think sometimes our state of not knowing is actually where we come to know God. It is where we discover.<br><h2><b>The Trap of Knowledge</b></h2><br>So how do we escape the trap of knowledge? I am going to share four simple things that we can do.<br><br><b><i>1. Ask More Questions</i></b><br><br>The first is to ask more questions, and one of the most powerful shifts we can make as a leader is to shift from a place of knowing and to operate from a place of inquiry.<br><br>My husband and I have four children. But twelve or thirteen years ago we had a mere three children, ages six, four, and two. I was talking to my buddy Brian at work, and we were just ­commiserating about some of our parenting challenges, and I said, "You know, Brian, I feel like I have become a little bit of a dictator in my house. I have become a bossy mom."<br><br>Brian acted very surprised by this, and he said, "Liz, you don't strike me as a bossy mom."<br><br>I said, "Let me describe bedtime at our house." And if you have the six-four-two combo pack at your house, you know exactly what this is like.<br><br>It is "Okay, kids, time for bed. Put that away. Go over here. Help your sisters. Get your pajamas on. No, no, no, the tag goes in the back. Turn that around. Go brush your teeth. Go back. Use toothpaste. Time for a book. Get a book. Not that book. No big books, not five books, no princess books. Okay, get me a little book. Good. Story time done. Say your prayers. Get into bed. Not in my bed. Out of her bed. Back to bed. Go to sleep."<br><br>There is no yelling. It is just constant telling, night after night.<br><br>So Brian, overlooking the fact that this was recreational complaining and that I wasn't actually looking for coaching, offered me a little coaching anyway, and he said, "Liz, why don't you go home tonight and try speaking to your children only in the form of questions?"<br><br>I went on about the ridiculous nature of this task and how that would take me four hours to get them to bed. But then I became really intrigued by this challenge--a challenge that I have come to call the extreme question challenge--and I decided I would try it. And I would take it to its extreme. Nothing but ­questions would come out of my mouth.<br><br>So I did it. Dinner was interesting, and playtime was interesting, and when we got to bedtime, I said, "Kids, what time is it?"<br><br>And they said, "Bedtime?"<br><br>And I said, "What do we do first? Where does that go? Who needs help getting their pajamas on? Who is going to be the first to brush their teeth? Okay, whose turn is it to pick the story? Which story are we going to read? Who is going to read the story--Mom or Dad?"<br><br>"Pick Dad, pick Dad, pick Dad!" I hoped.<br><br>And then it was, "Okay, what do we do when story time is over?"<br><br>And they said, "Well, we pray," because they knew.<br><br>And then my last question was, "Okay, who is ready for bed?"<br><br>"Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Pick me! Pick me!"<br><br>And they went and got in their beds and stayed in their beds, and I was left in the hallway simply to wonder, "How long have they known how to do this?"<br><br>I learned that when I asked questions, other people found answers. I learned that when I asked questions, people really didn't need me to tell them what to do. They needed me to ask them an intelligent question. We can tell less, and we can ask a lot more.<br><br><b><i>2. Admit What You Don't Know</i></b><br><br>About twenty years ago I sat in a meeting that really changed how I define a great leader. I was working at Oracle with our three top executives: the president, the chief technology officer, and the chief financial officer. We had been running a series of strategy summits, bringing in our executives in groups of about thirty at a time to brief them on the strategy and then send them on their way. I was meeting with the three executives after the third program, and the feedback wasn't good. The feedback wasn't good on the second or the first because the participants said the strategy articulated by our top executives--the three men I was sitting with--wasn't very clear. And, honestly, it wasn't really compelling.<br><br>I was reviewing the feedback with them, and they became unusually quiet. So what did I do? I just went through the feedback one more time to make sure they understood this. That is when Jeff, the chief financial officer and my boss, said, "Hey, Liz, you can stop beating us up."<br><br>And I had felt, "Darn, because that was really fun. I was enjoying that for just a little bit."<br><br>And he said, "You can stop beating us up, because we get that there is a problem. The issue is that we don't know how to do this."<br><br>So then I was trying to figure out what it was that they didn't know how to do. Develop leaders? Because I wasn't so worried about that. But now the president and the chief technology officer were both nodding their heads in agreement, and Jeff said, "We have never run a twenty-five-billion-dollar company before. We don't know how to set a strategy for a company this global and this complex. It is new to us."<br><br>As I was contemplating the implications of this, he said, "But if you could help us figure out how to do this, that would be useful."<br><br>See, in fast times, everyone is winging it. Even the people at the top--particularly the people at the top. So maybe if people are looking up to you, you could admit what you don't know. It creates a powerful dynamic in an organization. For those of you who are actually at the bottom of the organization, where you are the new hire, relax. You don't have to pretend, because you are not being hired for what you have learned at college. You are being hired for your raw intellect and your ability to think and reason and solve problems. Your value will come from the know-how you build, not the know-how you bring.<br><br><b><i>3. We Can Throw Away Our Notes</i></b><br><br>Dr. C. K. Prahalad of the University of Michigan's Stephen M. Ross School of Business was considered to be the greatest management thinker of his time. He was also a terrible fire hazard to the university because his courses were so perpetually oversubscribed that students lined the halls just trying to get in earshot of one of his lectures. When C. K. was a tenured professor, his wife, Gayatri, found a stack of his teaching notes in the trash bin of their home office. So she rescued this most precious resource, and she returned it to C. K. later that night. He thanked her, but he admitted, "Iactually threw those away on purpose because my students deserve my best thinking and fresh thinking every semester."<br><br>So if we need to inject a little bit of rookie freshness into our work, maybe we should throw away our notes. And I should say that I am speaking here mostly to the staff and the faculty. If you are a student, hold on to those notes for just a little bit longer.<br><br><b><i>4. Learn to See the Genius in Others</i></b><br><br>Last of all, instead of showing what we know, we can learn to see the genius in others. I mentioned that my husband and I have four children. Three of them have what I would describe as an active sense of adventure--­loving roller coasters, jumping off of Utah bridges into cold water, etc. Christian, our seventeen-year-old, is different from the rest of them. Instead of being on the scale of adventurous where my other kids are, he is way off the spectrum. He is a kid who was born without a sense of fear. He is a kid who has been living his life as if Red Bull were his corporate sponsor. His mantra is "See it, climb it, figure out how to get down later. Think it, make it, clean up the mess absolutely never."<br><br>It is very easy for Larry and me to get in this mode of wanting to keep him safe and telling him how to do things and dispensing, at the very least, essential survival advice to keep him "alive until twenty-five"--which is kind of our mantra. Most of this advice just bounces off of him, as you can imagine. A couple of years ago I decided that I was going to do something different. Instead of trying to dispense advice, Iwould simply focus on seeing his brilliance.<br><br>Let me just give you a sense of this kid. One of his little creations was a man fort. That was not the problem. The problem was where this fort was. The fort was on our roof for about two months before we discovered it.<br><br>I have come to learn to see him differently. Whereas I used to see a dangerous and destructive kid who might kill himself and the rest of us with him, I have come to see a creator, a brilliant and bold innovator, a problem-solver, someone who takes initiative, and a fearless missionary. I see him differently, and nothing makes me happier than that special look that Ilike to think is reserved just for Mom, and it is that look when he has done something kind of ingenious.<br><br>One of my favorites was when we came home recently to find out that he had gashed open his shin. Of course I started to get alarmed, but then he rolled up his pant leg to show me that he had just stitched it up himself.<br><br>My first response was, "How scary!" But then I suppressed that, and I said, "How brilliant! How brilliant! And how cost effective for your father and me that you have done that."<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>We are just about out of time, so let me sum up by saying that, ironically, what I know is that we are so often at our best when we don't know. The best leaders don't have the answers; the best leaders have really good questions, and they use those questions and their own intelligence to bring out the genius in the people around them.<br><br>The great philosopher Bono was describing the great actor George Clooney, and he compared him to the second of two British prime ministers from the 1800s. He said:<br><br><i>It has been said that after meeting with the great British Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone, you left feeling he was the smartest person in the world, but after meeting with his rival Benjamin Disraeli, you left thinking you were the smartest person.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>I think it is time that we recognize it is not the genius who is at the top of the intelligence hierarchy but rather the genius maker. Ithink we need to recognize that we tend to do our best work when we are on the outer edges of what we know, when we are doing something hard and new, and when we are growing through challenge. This is not only where we do our best work but where we tend to find our greatest joy.<br><br>Let me end with a video filmed by ten-year-old Zia Terry with a GoPro camera on her head as she made her first attempt at the forty-meter ski jump at Park City, Utah, moving through her fear to great exhilaration. [The video was shown.]<sup>6</sup><br><br>For those of you lucky ones who are going to be taking jobs, I hope some of you will take jobs that you are not fully qualified for and tell yourselves, "Who wants a job they are qualified for? There would be nothing to learn."<br><br>So yes, let us gain knowledge, but let's not get too big for our britches. The best leaders are restless learners and perpetual rookies. They realize that it is not what you know that counts, it is how fast you can learn.<br><br>Yes, "the glory of God is intelligence" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36), but it is in seeking, not knowing, that we find truth. In that space is where we discover the true glory of God.

<h1>afely Home - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is wonderful to be here with you. I am a Cougar through and through--I love BYU. While here Iobtained both my undergraduate and graduate degrees, created lasting friendships, and convinced Shelley Hatch to take a risk on me. She was the first of the two of us to graduate from BYU and is the best thing Igained from being here. I hope your time as astudent will be as productive as mine was!<br><br>After I was called as a General Authority, Sister Nash and I--along with our two youngest children--were assigned to Lima, Peru, where I would serve in the Area Presidency. On our first Monday there, we were given a brief driving tour so that we could learn how to get to and from places such as home, the children's school, the grocery store, and other places. Then they handed me the keys to the car.<br><br>This sounds simple, but the streets of Lima can be bewildering. Even seasoned inhabitants get lost. The traffic is in constant flow and the streets curve, twist, and turn--and never seem to intersect with another street that will take you back to the exit you just missed. It can seem at times that the streets of Lima are designed to take the unwary exactly where they do not intend to go! So after driving for approximately five minutes that first day, I missed a turn and got us completely lost--and that was for a few hours.<br><br>A year or two later Sister Nash, driving on her own in Lima, got lost and ended up in a part of the city that was uncomfortable and even dangerous--and she did not know how to get home. Then, in a moment of inspiration, it came to her that our recently obtained GPS had a button marked Home. She pushed that button and was guided safely home.<br><br>My dear students, the plan of salvation--one of the greatest treasures of knowledge restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith--is a perfect, fully updated spiritual GPS. It is a celestial map given to unerringly guide us home.<br><br>Please listen to what I am about to say, even though you have heard it before. Listen as if you were hearing this for the first time: each of us "is a beloved ... son or daughter of heavenly parents," and we lived with them prior to our mortal birth.<sup>1</sup> Motivated by perfect love and a desire to give each of us as His children the opportunity to receive all He has, our Father in Heaven instituted a plan from before the foundation of this earth<sup>2</sup> whereby we could obtain eternal life, "the greatest of all the gifts of God."<sup>3</sup> Put simply, eternal life is the life God lives!<sup>4</sup> This plan of salvation was--and is--based upon laws and truths that have always existed<sup>5</sup> and that make God what He is and heaven what it is.<sup>6</sup> When the plan was explained to us in the premortal realm, you and I not only "shouted for joy"<sup>7</sup> but also defended the plan against those who opposed it.<sup>8</sup><br><br>The plan required that this beautiful world be created to give us a place to live in mortality outside of the presence of God so that we could receive a body and gain experience.<sup>9</sup> Thus Adam and Eve were placed upon this earth, and together they chose to fall from the presence of our Father in Heaven and become mortal so that humankind could come into existence.<sup>10</sup><br><br>For us, some things fundamental to eternal life could only be learned by experience. For example, a book or video may explain the different swim strokes, but we really only learn to swim when we exercise our faith by getting into the water and applying what the book or video has described. In a similar way, living in mortality with its attendant trials and opposition gives us the opportunity to learn by experience some things we could learn in no other way--especially to learn how to live by faith.<sup>11</sup><br><br>Our Heavenly Father understood that as mortal beings fallen from His presence, faced with opposition and temptation, we would sin. He knew that we and others impacted by our sins would--sooner or later--experience the misery that sin always produces. He knew that as a result of our own sins, we would become impure and thereby disqualify ourselves from reentering the presence of God, where nothing unclean can dwell.<sup>12</sup><br><br>Thus, as a loving, just, and merciful God who desires our happiness here and in all eternity, our Heavenly Father provided as a part of His plan a Savior to redeem us from our sins through His atoning sacrifice.<sup>13</sup> It is through the Savior's Atonement that the plan is made operative.<sup>14</sup> Because of the plan and the Savior's Atonement, we can repent,<sup>15</sup> grow, be cleansed from sin,<sup>16</sup> be happy even in tough times,<sup>17</sup> and live with the hope (that is, the expectation) of eternal life<sup>18</sup>--the very life God leads.<sup>19</sup><br><br>Knowledge--such as that of the plan of salvation--is only helpful to the degree it is applied. For example, knowing that seatbelts save lives will not do us any good in an accident unless we have put one on. Similarly, while it is good to know the plan, that alone is not enough. We must also apply it to our thinking, our decisions, and our actions--and that requires faith. Faith is confidence and trust that moves us to act; indeed, it is the moving "principle of action in all intelligent beings."<sup>20</sup> Faith in Heavenly Father and His Son is both a principle of action and of power--<i>Their</i> power.<sup>21</sup><br><br>We focus our faith upon God the Father, His Son, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost.<sup>22</sup> Jesus plainly taught, "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father."<sup>23</sup> Part of the reason for the Savior's mortal ministry was--and is--to reveal the Father to us through His teachings and His exemplary, perfect life. In order to exercise faith unto salvation--again, it is eternal life that we are speaking of--we must come to know our Heavenly Father and His Son<sup>24</sup> and learn of Their "character, perfections, and attributes."<sup>25</sup> To know Them is to love and trust Them completely and to willingly submit to Their will and law.<sup>26</sup> As we do so consistently--which will require sacrifice on our part--we will come to know that our life is increasingly in accordance with Their will. This knowledge will strengthen our faith even more, eventually making it powerful.<sup>27</sup><br><br>If we fail to exercise faith in the Father and His plan of salvation and in Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice, we will fall far short of our divine potential. You see, we are not able to do it on our own. Mormon put it this way: "No man can be saved ... save they shall have faith in his name."<sup>28</sup> He added that where there is no faith, "awful is the state of man, for they are as though there had been no redemption made."<sup>29</sup><br><br>Why is that? Simply stated, those who lack faith will lack the motivation and power to consistently live the law of the gospel of Jesus Christ upon which eternal life is based.<sup>30</sup> Since the law was given to enable us to partake fully of the redemptive power of Christ and receive eternal life, those without faith to live that law are as though there were no redemptive power--and that is awful! Especially when so much is offered us with so much love.<br><br>Faith comes by reading, hearing, and experimenting upon the word of God and nurturing it with all diligence.<sup>31</sup> When we do this consistently, we will feel swelling motions in our breast, our souls will enlarge, and our understanding will be enlightened. We will come to know that this is real, good, and true--for it is light and it is discernible.<sup>32</sup><br><br>I have experienced this throughout my life, beginning in my youth. After reading the Book of Mormon as a teen, I asked in prayer if it was true. The response, interestingly, was to guide my mind to the peace, soul-expanding light, and understanding that had gently distilled upon me while reading the book. I knew it was true, and that knowledge was so sweet that at times, as a teen, I would hold the book to my chest as I went to sleep. That knowledge increased my faith, enabling me to seek more "learning, even by study and also by faith."<sup>33</sup><br><br>Perhaps chief among the many ills of the world is the widespread lack of faith caused by a famine of the word of God.<sup>34</sup> Many in our day are starving spiritually. Without belief in and obedience to the word of God, there is no real foundation for faith in the Father, nor in the Savior. As a result, many people know so little (or seem to have forgotten what they once knew) about the Father's plan of salvation that, with a straight face, they actually "call evil good, and good evil."<sup>35</sup> Perhaps the confusion of some can be excused on account of their lack of knowledge of the plan. But we as Latter-day Saints have no such excuse. We are blessed to know the plan and are expected to share it as part of the Restoration and to apply our knowledge of the plan to our lives and the decisions we make--which, again, requires faith on our part.<sup>36</sup><br><br>Now, let's collectively exercise faith and examine a couple of current social issues in light of our knowledge of the plan of salvation. It is important to note that faith-challenging social issues have for centuries rolled through each successive generation. Through it all, the fundamental, eternal doctrine of the plan of salvation and the need to learn to live by faith will remain unchanging.<sup>37</sup><br><br>First, please consider this observation by Elder RobertD. Hales of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles:<br><br><i>Marriage and family are under attack because Satan knows that they are essential to obtaining eternal life--as essential as the Creation, the Fall, and the Atonement and Resurrection of Jesus Christ. Having failed to destroy any of those pillars of the plan, Satan seeks to destroy our understanding and practice of marriage and family</i><i>.</i><sup>38</sup><br><br>We know that the purpose of the plan is to give each of us the opportunity to obtain eternal life--the life God leads. Stated simply, Heavenly Father's life defines eternal life. One of the things we know about His life is that He is sealed in an eternal marriage of man and woman. So to choose anything less than the eternal marriage of woman and man is to choose something less than the full, resplendent purpose of our Father's plan!<sup>39</sup><br><br>God loves all of His sons and all of His daughters, and He would have us know that each of us has the innate, divine capacity to exercise faith in Christ and receive all the Father offers His children. In other words, none of us is predestined to fail.<sup>40</sup> However, weshould recognize that each of us comes intothis world with weakness, which I will define as desires or tendencies inconsistent with the plan of salvation. Such things, to one degree or another, are inherent in the human condition.<sup>41</sup><br><br>Moroni taught that any son or daughter of God who will humble him- or herself before God and exercise steadfast faith will over time experience the miracle of Christ making "weak things become strong unto them."<sup>42</sup> If we do not dictate a timetable to the Lord, we shall, like Joseph Smith, "out of weakness ... be made strong."<sup>43</sup> Any of us, whatever our weakness, can live with the assurance that if we see--that is, acknowledge--our weakness and exercise faith in the Father and His plan and in the Savior and His Atonement, we shall "be made strong, even unto the sitting down in the place which [the Lord has] prepared in the mansions of [our] Father."<sup>44</sup><br><br>For the faithful, such weakness is ultimately temporary, for when He comes again, God will "wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: forthe former things are passed away."<sup>45</sup><br><br>Our Heavenly Father's plan of salvation--making eternal life possible for us--is the greatest expression of love ever made. If we choose by faith to live according to His law despite our human weakness,<sup>46</sup> we will one day receive all that the Father has! Thus, to stand for the Father's plan is not hatred or bigotry; rather, it is an expression of God's love.<sup>47</sup><br><br>Second, there is societal concern about the equality of woman and man. While I do not pretend to know all the answers, I do know that, according to the plan of salvation, "the family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children"<sup>48</sup> and that the ultimate expression of priesthood power is in the eternal union of woman and man. While we do not fully know what administrative structure will exist in the next life, we do know that families sealed in the temple will exist in the next life. When we contemplate mortality against the backdrop of eternity, we should remember that the title of our God is not President but Father. That alone speaks volumes about the organizational structure that matters most in the celestial kingdom and in eternity.<sup>49</sup> So do not get too distracted by temporal administrative structure.<br><br>The ultimate purpose of the plan is that a husband and wife are happy at home and sealed for time and eternity so that they may receive eternal life<sup>50</sup>--for their eternal union is part of the very definition of eternal life. You see, the ultimate equality of woman and man is godhood, something each can <i>only</i> do with the other by <i>together</i> entering into--and abiding within--the order of the priesthood of the new and everlasting covenant of eternal marriage.<sup>51</sup> Notably, the blessings pertaining to eternal life are promised jointly and severally to "them" and not severally to "him" or "her."<sup>52</sup> In the order of heaven, "Neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord."<sup>53</sup><br><br>On these and other issues, we would do well to understand that "the key to our success in our premortal life was our support of the Father's plan."<sup>54</sup> And the key to success in this life is the same: support the Father's plan. We must learn, by faith, to see life through the lens--or from the perspective--of the very plan about which we "shouted for joy" in our premortal existence!<sup>55</sup><br><br>Satan--who was thrust out of the presence of God for his rebellion against the Father and His plan of salvation--desires the misery of all mankind.<sup>56</sup> Because he is aware of the protective, moving power of faith,<sup>57</sup> he seeks to weaken and ultimately destroy it. Time has shown that among the most effective weapons in his war against faith are sin, fear, and doubt. Maybe a couple of stories will illustrate the potentially disabling impact of doubt.<br><br>Several years ago I watched as our high school girls' volleyball team in Washington State (where we lived at the time) played in the state volleyball championship tournament. Many on the team feared and doubted they belonged in that tournament, so they played very poorly and were soundly defeated in the first game of their first match. Now contrast that with what happened next: There was a very special athlete on that team--in the spirit of full disclosure, Imust confess that she is our ­daughter--and she happened to be the one who was to start service in the second game of the match. Knowing her, I expected to see something remarkable. And I did. She served thirteen straight aces. Her greatest gift as an athlete was confidence, even faith, and when the game was on the line, she gave no room to fear or doubt.<br><br>When the Savior saved Peter from slipping into the stormy sea upon which Peter had been walking, He gently asked Peter: "O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?"<sup>58</sup><br><br>In that insightful, probing inquiry, I hear the Savior saying to Peter: "Despite what science and life experience would say, you <i>were</i> walking on water! So why did you doubt?"<br><br>Too many of our members have walked on water spiritually and do not know it. Or, if they did know it once, they--like Peter--have taken their eyes from the Savior and pay more attention to the doubt suggested by some towering waves of secular thinking. Too many do not exercise faith in God and the eternal truths they know to be good and true; instead, they operate from the perspective of culture or, worse yet, from the position of fear or doubt.<br><br>Still others conflate the idea of questions with the concept of doubt. Questions and doubt are not the same thing. We can seek answers to honest questions with doubt, or we can do so with faith. The choice is ours. To do so through doubt is, frankly, to put ourselves--and others--at the risk of spiritual paralysis. On the other hand, to do so through faith is to progress, learn, and grow.<br><br>In making this choice, please remember the father who sought healing for his son. The Savior reminded him that belief, or faith, was key. Said He, "If thou canst believe, all things are ­possible to him that believeth."<br><br>In response, the man cried out, "Lord, Ibelieve; help thou mine unbelief."<sup>59</sup><br><br>In that moment this admirably honest man declared his choice of faith and asked in faith to be helped with his unbelief. And that was sufficient. Because the man chose faith, Christ healed his son.<sup>60</sup><br><br>As you know, "faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things; therefore if ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen, which are true."<sup>61</sup> Having faith means that we do not know all the answers to all the questions all the time, but we choose to live our lives consistent with the gospel truths we <i>do</i> know because we trust our God! So heed not<sup>62</sup> the mocking and often condescending voices of those who have lost faith, including the online Iagos,<sup>63</sup> whose object is to cultivate doubt. Rather, with the light of your faith, engage your reason, study prayerfully, be patient, and keep yourself anchored in the scriptures and in the guidance of the Spirit.<sup>64</sup><br><br>Remember, we receive a witness after the trial of our <i>faith--</i>not of our doubt!<sup>65</sup> Knowing this and appreciating the great power of faith, we can better understand that the Lord's command to "doubt not, fear not"<sup>66</sup> is akin to King Benjamin's instruction to "[put] off the natural man."<sup>67</sup> We are all acquainted to some degree or another with natural-man tendencies such as anger, impatience, selfishness, and greed. If left unchecked, such things will canker our soul. That is why we put them off! Doubt too can be part of the natural-man experience, and it too will canker the soul if left unchecked. So while we do not panic at the manifestation of any of these natural-man tendencies, we do learn to put them off through faith in the Father and His plan and in the Son and His Atonement.<br><br>Rather than over- or underreacting if doubt crosses your mind about what you already know to be good and true, see doubt for what it is: a natural-man impulse that can paralyze your thinking and actions. Then exercise your faith in the Father and in the Son by patiently and diligently living the gospel and trusting that light and understanding will come to those who patiently seek learning by study <i>and</i> by faith.<sup>68</sup> It is beautifully, eternally productive to combine study and faith.<br><br>These words--<i>faith, diligence,</i> and <i>patience--</i>may not resonate with some who have grown up in a world of two-hour movies in which the earth is imperiled and then saved, where love is lost and then found--and all in the same movie! An invitation to faith and patience can seem like a delay tactic to those who impatiently wait two or three minutes for the microwave oven to heat their food, who complain over having to wait ten minutes in the line of a fast-food take-out window, or who believe that all knowledge is instantly available through Google and maybe prayer. It can seem like a rebuff to others who have cried out for answers and feel they hear nothing in response but the echo of their cries.<br><br>Regardless of our circumstance, the first answer is always--<i>always--</i>the faith of which I have spoken and patience. My dearly beloved students, start with what you know to be good and true and hold to it. Lead with it!<sup>69</sup><br><br>When Elijah invited the starving widow to give him food to eat and promised that if she did so her "barrel of meal [would] not waste, neither [would] the cruse of oil fail,"<sup>70</sup> she at that moment had a choice to make: stay with the stark reality of her impoverished life and have one last meager meal with her son before they died or exercise faith in Elijah's seemingly impossible promise and live. She chose--at great personal sacrifice--to exercise faith. And so she lived.<sup>71</sup><br><br>I promise that if you choose to exercise faith by daily reference to the plan of salvation and obedience to the truths of the gospel, you too will live--and that eternally.<sup>72</sup> You will experience peace in this life and eternal life--God's life--in the world to come.<sup>73</sup> You will be guided safely home.<br><br>In this way the plan of salvation will be for you a personal GPS--an eternal global positioning system--that by faith will unerringly guide you safely home. That home is before us, not behind us. The journey of faith of which I speak is to go forward. It is to progress, grow, and, through the Atonement of Christ, become like our Heavenly Father, like our heavenly parents! There we will live as family, enjoying "all that [our] Father hath."<sup>74</sup><br><br>I bear witness that this is the Lord's Church. Iknow that Joseph Smith was and is a prophet of God and that the Book of Mormon is true. We are led by living prophets, by a living prophet. I know that our Father in Heaven lives and loves us. Of that great love and of the living, loving reality of the Lord Jesus Christ I testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Marcus B.

Faith is vitally important both in time and in eternity. For example, consider the faith that our Heavenly Father exercised in His Son when He sent Him to earth as a babe. All eternity hung in the balance, and because of the Savior's love and faith in our Father and because of the Father's faith in His Only Begotten Son, the Savior fulfilled His mortal mission perfectly and performed His wondrous Atonement. Thus it was by faith that the plan of salvation became operative through the Atonement of Christ, even from before the foundation of the world. Think about it: the children of God were able to exercise faith unto repentance and be forgiven and cleansed from sin thousands of years prior to the Savior's atoning sacrifice because of their faith coupled with the faith of the Father and the Son!<br><br>37.

They can be organized or they can be dissolved. ...</i><br><br><i>But the family, on the other hand, can be an eternal organization. Though the family may move from one ward or stake to another, the family organization remains intact. It may even be transferred from mortality into the eternities in the spirit world.

<h1> of the Earth - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As a young girl, one of my favorite Primary songs was "My Heavenly Father Loves Me" (<i>Children's Songbook,</i> 228) because I could imagine all of the beautiful creations of God in that song--"hear[ing] the song of a bird," "look[ing] at the blue . . . sky," having eyes to "see The color of butterfly wings," and feeling "the wind as it rushes by." Throughout my life I have lived in and traveled to places that have allowed me to experience different beauties of the earth, including various landscapes and cultures. Beyond the physical beauties of the earth, God has given us other beauties to help strengthen us and bring us joy. Today I want to share four beauties of the earth with you.<br><h2><b>The Beauty of Education</b></h2><br>Coming to teach at Brigham Young University was a new experience for me because I had never attended BYU as a student. Starting as a faculty member at BYU, I quickly realized there was a unique culture that existed at BYU. I remember the first time someone mentioned meeting at the SWKT. I thought to myself, "What is a SWKT?" I am happy to report that since that time, I have become familiar with the SKWT and many other campus buildings and with BYU lingo.<br><br>Not having attended a religious university before, the idea of combining spiritual learning into a secular classroom was foreign to me. Through the help of faculty in my department, new faculty seminars, and practice, I have come to treasure the beauty of bringing spiritual insights into a classroom setting.<br><br>Through the past several years of being at BYU, I have been blessed to read and listen to incredible, inspiring stories that are the foundation of this institution. Many miracles occurred throughout the history of this university that have helped me catch the vision that embodies BYU. Let me recount one of these stories.<br><br>During the era of the Great Depression, BYU, like many areas of the United States, was impacted by this part of history. In a <i>BYU Magazine </i>article several years ago, the following was published about this time:<br><br><i>The university wrestled with its own financial challenges--including a 22.5 percent pay cut for faculty and the recurrent threat of closure. Yet, partly because most Church junior colleges had closed by 1933, BYU enrollments increased 50 percent during the 1930s. By using federal grant money to fund hundreds of campus jobs, and by reaching out in other ways, faculty and administrators did what they could to help students who struggled.</i> ["Stories of the Century," comp. Mary Lynn Bahr, <i>BYU Magazine,</i> Winter 1999–2000, 24]<br><br>The <i>BYU Magazine</i> article also quoted Wilford Lee's memories of his early experiences when he registered at BYU in 1931:<br><br><i>The school was struggling. ... They were still accepting gallon jugs of blackstrap molasses from the Dixie [Southern Utah] students as part payment on the student's tuition. ...</i><br><br><i>I will always remember the Y as the poor man's school; and since I was one of the poorest of the poor, I will always remember those days as a real struggle for existence.</i> [Wilford Lee to James R. Clark, 23 January 1974, BYU Centennial History Faculty Survey Papers, L. Tom Perry Special Collections, Harold B. Lee Library, BYU; quoted in Ernest L. Wilkinson, ed., <i>Brigham Young University: The First One Hundred Years,</i> 4 vols. (Provo: BYU Press, 1975–76), 2:258]<br><br>Now I am guessing none of you paid for your tuition this year with molasses, but my hope is that this story gives you a glimpse of the impressive history of this university and the sacrifices made by students, faculty, and administration to keep it thriving. While you are at BYU, I hope you will cherish the opportunities given to you that are unique to this university. I hope you catch the vision of BYU.<br><br>The most important educator we have in this life is the Holy Ghost. One of my favorite scriptures in the New Testament is when Christ taught His apostles that once He departed this earth life, He would provide them with "another Comforter" that "may abide with [them] for ever" (John 14:16). Because of this other comforter--the Holy Ghost--we can receive guidance to know the path we should take in life. If we are willing to do all we can to pursue our dreams and then put our trust in God to take us on the path that He knows will lead to our greatest growth, we will be where God knows we need to be to become the person He intends us to become.<br><br>Before I came to teach at BYU, I--like many of you--had decisions before me as to which major to choose and, eventually, what to do with my life after graduation. I am thankful for prayer and for the inspiration that came through the Holy Ghost. When answers about which path to pursue did not come in the time I had hoped for, I learned to rely on faith and trust in God that whatever decision I moved forward with, He would guide me differently ifthat path was not the one I should take.<br><br>In my undergraduate years I initially startedout in one major. However, in my second year, after receiving mostly C grades in a couple of courses for my major, I thought that I should be doing better in my major. I began seeking other avenues. In the university's career center I searched through a book for potential career options. I stumbled across a description of a pediatric nutritionist. I became more excited as I read, and I felt that this might be my answer. I recalled taking a nutrition course in high school and thoroughly enjoying the class. After meeting with the academic counselor for nutrition science, I decided to switch majors. Given my current faculty position, you can probably guess that this major stuck. The course content was exciting to study, and I felt like I couldn't wait to learn more in each class.<br><br>Looking back, I have been able to identify what made the difference, and this realization is the advice I share with students when they mention trying to decide on a major: find your passion and then work hard at it.<br><br>Most aspiring graduates will recognize this all-too-familiar question: "What are you going to do after you graduate?" Sometimes it can be scary to think of what is next, but if we have an open mind and heart, God can lead us to great things.<br><br>During my master's program work, I had an opportunity to intern at a federal public health agency, and I thoroughly enjoyed the work. Iwas excited about the impact this work could have on individuals across the nation.<br><br>During my doctoral program I had every intention of applying for employment at this agency, and I kept my contacts active within the division I had worked in as an intern. However, God had different plans for me. I knew that if I was offered a faculty position at BYU, this is where God wanted me to be. BYU extended me the job and, obviously, I accepted.<br><br>This is just one of many experiences I have had in my life when, if I have been willing to accept the Lord's will and listen, He has guided me to the path that is best for me. He does this for all of us. Christ taught, "Ask, and it shall be given unto you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you" (3 Nephi 14:7). All that is required of us is to ask, to listen, and to accept His timing.<br><h2><b>The Beauty of God's Creations</b></h2><br>Over many years of studying nutrition, Ihave come to stand in awe of God's creations. He truly has given us the gift of a mortal body and the beauties of this earth to sustain and strengthen it. Food is one of those beauties. Not only does food give us life, but it also was created for our enjoyment and pleasure. This last year, as I was reading in the Doctrine and Covenants, a series of scriptures stuck out in my mind. I know I have read these verses before, but they took on a different meaning when I read them this time. Theystate:<br><br><i>All things which come of the earth, in the season thereof, are made for the benefit and the use of man, both to please the eye and to gladden the heart;</i><br><br><i> . . . For taste and for smell, to strengthen the body and to enliven the soul.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 59:18–19]<br><br>This concept is one that I aim to teach my students. Food is wonderful and truly something to rejoice in! The colors and textures and variety make food pleasing to the eye and can truly gladden our hearts. The nutrients that food provides strengthen and enliven us.<br><br>In the Book of Mormon we learn that "men are, that they might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25). God created us so that we could have joy on this earth. However, at times life brings challenges that may make it seem hard to find joy. A few years ago at a ward Relief Society activity, a panel of women in varying life stages and situations were asked to answer a series of questions. One of those questions was whether their life had turned out as they had planned. Regardless of age or situation, their experiences affirmed that life rarely turns out as we have planned or anticipated. I have come to better understand that despite what we might consider setbacks or disappointments, God wants us to find joy where we currently are in life and to recognize that He has a plan tailor-made forus.<br><br>Finding joy in our current circumstances is a message that President DieterF. Uchtdorf recently taught. He said:<br><br><i>Everyone's situation is different, and the details of each life are unique. Nevertheless, I have learned that there is something that would take away the bitterness that may come into our lives. There is one thing we can do to make life sweeter, more joyful, even glorious.</i><br><br><i>We can be grateful!</i><br><br><i> It might sound contrary to the wisdom of the world to suggest that one who is burdened with ­sorrow should give thanks to God. But those who set aside the bottle of bitterness and lift instead the ­goblet of gratitude can find a purifying drink of ­healing, peace, and understanding....</i><br><br><i> . . . Our loving Heavenly Father knows that choosing to develop a spirit of gratitude will bring ustrue joy and great happiness.</i><br><br><i> But some might say, "What do I have to be grateful</i><b><i> </i></b><b><i>for</i></b><b><i> </i></b><i>when my world is falling apart?"</i><br><br><i> Perhaps focusing on what we are grateful </i><i>for</i><i> is the wrong approach....</i><br><br><i> Could I suggest that we see gratitude as a disposition, a way of life that stands independent of our current situation? In other words, I'm suggesting that instead of being thankful </i><b><i>for</i></b><i> things, we focus on being thankful </i><b><i>in</i></b><i> our circumstances--whatever they may be.</i> ["Grateful in Any Circumstances," <i>Ensign, </i>May 2014; emphasis in original]<br><br>Finding joy in our circumstances may seem difficult at times, but as President Uchtdorf taught, we can still find an attitude of gratitude at these times. Some may ask, "How is this possible?" President Uchtdorf further taught that "being grateful in times of distress does <i>not</i> mean that we are pleased with our circumstances" but "that through the eyes of faith we look beyond our present-day challenges" and recognize that even if "we do not always understand the trials" we are facing, we can still put our trust in God "that one day we will" ("Grateful in Any Circumstances"; emphasis in original).<br><br>Through personal experience I have learned that when we do not feel that attitude of gratitude that President Uchtdorf talked about, we can pray to God for His help in seeing beyond today or a particular moment. We can ask for God's help in opening our eyes and hearts to help us find an attitude of gratitude so that we can better endure the trials that are bound to come.<br><h2><b>The Beauty of Scriptures and Modern-Day Prophets</b></h2><br>The first recollection I have of reading the scriptures on my own was when I was about seven or eight years of age. At the time, we lived in a house in which the living room had bookshelves that covered one wall. Although many books were out of my reach because of my height, I remember some, including the children's version of the scriptures, being placed within my reach. In that version of the scriptures I came to thoroughly enjoy the graphics and the stories of the prophets and of the Savior that were told. Since that time I have again and again come to treasure the words of the scriptures.<br><br>A few years ago I felt a strong desire to reread all the standard works; at that time Idid not realize that God was preparing me for something yet to come. I began with the Doctrine and Covenants and learned new insights that I had not considered before. I can truly say that I came to better understand the idea of feasting on the words of Christ: everyday I was thrilled to read more, and reading rekindled my testimony of the Savior and of the Prophet Joseph Smith.<br><br>Shortly after starting to study the Doctrine and Covenants, I was called to teach a youth Sunday School class, and, to my surprise, which of the standard works were they studying that year? Yes, the Doctrine and Covenants. I knew that it was not by coincidence that I had felt the inclination to read the Doctrine and Covenants at that particular moment. If we allow Him to, God directs our lives and prepares us for what is yet to come.<br><br>After finishing the Doctrine and Covenants, I turned to the New Testament and then to the Old Testament--which I am currently reading. I remember thinking as I read certain passages in the Old Testament that the Savior I had come to learn about and love through the Book of Mormon and the New Testament was the same Being of the Old Testament. I made connections stronger than at any time before between the doctrine and principles in the standard works, and my testimony and knowledge of Jesus Christ expanded.<br><br>During this time I also pondered how difficult my life would be without the scriptures. Iwas reminded of a time long ago when people did not have access to the scriptures in their own language to read on their own. Elder M.Russell Ballard related the events of that time inhistory:<br><br><i>The Dark Ages were dark because the light of the gospel was hidden from the people. They did not have the apostles or prophets, nor did they have access to the Bible. The clergy kept the scriptures secret and unavailable to the people. We owe much tothe many brave martyrs and reformers like Martin Luther, John Calvin, and John Huss who demanded freedom to worship and common access tothe holy books.</i><br><br>Elder Ballard also said:<br><br><i>Men like John Wycliffe, the courageous William Tyndale, and Johannes Gutenberg were prompted against much opposition to translate the Bible into language people could understand and to publish it in books people could read. I believe even the scholars of King James had spiritual promptings in their translation work....</i><br><br><i>Because of the efforts of the reformers, "the Bible became a household possession. The word of God wasread around the family fireside of the lowly as well as the parlors of the great." </i>["The Miracle of the Holy Bible," <i>Ensign, </i>May 2007; quoting JohnA. Widtsoe, <i>CR,</i> April 1939, 20]<br><br>We are truly blessed to have access to ancientscriptures and also living prophets and­apostles who teach us God's words every six months. We have a wealth of knowledge and resources literally at our fingertips. What could fill shelves and shelves of bookcases we now hold in the palm of our hand. On this ­subject Elder D.Todd Christofferson taught:<br><br><i>Consider the magnitude of our blessing to havethe Holy Bible and some 900 additional pages of scripture, including the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. Then consider that, in addition, the words of prophets spoken as they are moved upon by the Holy Ghost . . . , which the Lord calls scripture ..., flow to us almost constantly by television, radio, Internet, satellite, CD, DVD, and in print. I suppose that never in history has a people been blessed with such a quantity of holy writ. And not only that, but every man, woman, and child may possess and study his or her own personal copy of these sacred texts, most in his or her own language.</i> ["The Blessing of Scripture," <i>Ensign, </i>May 2010]<br><br>As Elder Christofferson reminded us, we have easier access to Church doctrine than ever before. However, with this abundance I think this counsel applies: "Unto whom much is given much is required" (D&amp;amp;C 82:3). We are so blessed to have readily available resources to access scriptures, general conference talks, and much more, but do we utilize them to their full potential? Do we truly cherish what they offer us? Alma counseled Helaman about the scriptures, speaking of the Liahona that Lehi and his family used to journey through the wilderness to the promised land. He said:<br><br><i>For behold, it is as easy to give heed to the word of Christ, which will point to you a straight course to eternal bliss, as it was for our fathers to give heed to this compass, which would point unto them a straight course to the promised land.</i><br><br><i>And now I say, is there not a type in this thing? For just as surely as this director did bring our fathers, by following its course, to the promised land, shall the words of Christ, if we follow their course, carry us beyond this vale of sorrow into a far better land of promise.</i><br><br><i>O my son, do not let us be slothful because of theeasiness of the way; for so was it with our fathers; for so was it prepared for them, that if they would look they might live; even so it is with us. The way is prepared, and if we will look we may live forever.</i> [Alma 37:44–46]<br><br>I know that if we sincerely look at the marvelous resources available to us through ancient and modern scriptures, we will find Christ. We will truly be able to live--a joyous life now on this earth and into the eternities. Christ brings us life, and His words bring us to Him. We look to the scriptures and the prophets just as Nephi and his family had to look for the words on the Liahona to guide them to the promised land. As we look to the scriptures and the prophets, we will stay on the "strait and narrow path" (1Nephi 8:20) that leads to God, and He will help us to become the son or daughter He intends for us to become.<br><br>We have been given the opportunity to find the truthfulness of the scriptures and the prophets for ourselves. We do not need to rely on others to learn of Christ and His teachings. We have been given a promise that if we "ask with a sincere heart [and] with real intent ..., he will manifest the truth of it unto [us]" (Moroni 10:4). We can each know for ourselves. That is truly beautiful!<br><h2><b>The Beauty of Temples</b></h2><br>The temple is the house of the Lord, "a place of love and beauty" ("I Love to See the Temple," <i>Children's Songbook,</i> 95). To me, the temple is also a symbol of power and peace. As most of you here know, not too long ago the beloved Provo Tabernacle was burned. The sadness of the community was real, but when President ThomasS. Monson announced rebuilding it to become a temple, those tears of sadness became great tears of joy and rejoicing (see "As We Meet Again," <i>Ensign, </i>November 2011).<br><br>Recently I had the opportunity to visit the Provo City Center Temple during the open house. The beauty of this building is breath­taking, and although the Spirit of God is found there, I couldn't help but be reminded that the true power comes after its dedication. The work we do in the temple for ourselves and for those who have passed from this life is where the true power lies and is the real intent of building temples.<br><br>This year we have the privilege of studying the teachings of President Howard W. Hunter in Relief Society and Melchizedek Priesthood. Although President Hunter was a prophet for only a short time, his impression on me in his love for the temple was great. I clearly remember his admonition for every person to "be worthy of--and carry--a current temple recommend"; this symbolized a person's commitment to the Lord, even if distance or life circumstances prevented him or her from attending as frequently as desired ("First Presidency Message: The Great Symbol of Our Membership," <i>Ensign,</i> October 1994; also in Jay M. Todd, "President Howard W. Hunter: Fourteenth President of the Church," <i>Ensign,</i> July 1994).<br><br>I think of his foresight as the prophet in preparing a people for a time that would come later under President GordonB. Hinckley. I recall the day when President Hinckley announced that he had received revelation on how to increase the building of temples and to lessen the distance in which people had to travel to get to the temple. President Hinckley explained that the Church would "construct small temples . . . , buildings with all of the facilities to administer all of the ordinances" ("Some Thoughts on Temples, Retention of Converts, and Missionary Service," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1997). Since that time, numerous temples have been built--so many, in fact, that Elder QuentinL. Cook reported in the April 2014 general conference that "85 percent of the Church members now live within 200 miles ... of a temple" ("Roots and Branches,"<i> Ensign,</i> May 2014). And as you know, we have been blessed here locally to have two temples within minutes of each other. However, I wonder too if our lives become so busy that we forget the great blessing that awaits us just minutes away. The Lord has a great work for us to do in the temple--we just need to be willing to give our time. As we do that, God will bless usabundantly.<br><br>President Monson shared his thoughts on the blessings that come through the temple. Hesaid:<br><br><i>As we enter through the doors of the temple, we leave behind us the distractions and confusion of the world. Inside this sacred sanctuary, we find beauty and order. There is rest for our souls and a respite from the cares of our lives.</i><br><br><i>As we attend the temple, there can come to us a dimension of spirituality and a feeling of peace which will transcend any other feeling which could come into the human heart. . . .</i><br><br><i>Such peace can permeate any heart--hearts that are troubled, hearts that are burdened down with grief, hearts that feel confusion, hearts that plead for help.</i> ["Blessings of the Temple," <i>Ensign, </i>May 2015]<br><br>Every one of us will experience trials, challenges, and heartaches as a part of mortality, but our loving God has given us a place where we can go to leave the world behind and to feel of His love. The temple reminds us of who we once were before this life, what our purpose is on this earth, and what the possibilities for our future life can be. It helps us keep the right perspective in life--to not get caught up in the day-to-day difficulties but to remember that this earth life is but a part of God's plan for us. We are reminded that God's plan for us is much grander. His ultimate goal is for us tobecome like Him.<br><h2><b>Eyes to See and Ears to Hear</b></h2><br>Today I shared four beauties of the earth that have helped to shape my life: the beauty of education, the beauty of God's creations, the beauty of scriptures and modern-day ­prophets, and the beauty of temples. However, as I thought of these beauties, many other beauties of the earth that have blessed my life came to mind. Irealized that God's beauties of the earth are all around us and that He wants us to find them and feel gratitude for them.<br><br>All we have to do is open our eyes to see them or our ears to hear them (see Matthew 13:16). We can ask God to help us find and cherish the beauties found in each of our lives. As we do so, we will find joy, meaning, and purpose in our lives and become ever closer to and more like our loving Heavenly Father. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Rickelle Richards was an associate professor in the BYU Department of Nutrition, Dietetics, and Food Science when this devotional address was delivered on 9 February 2016.</i>

<h1>appiness - Larry R. Lawrence - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p class="p1">Last October I was assigned to speak in ­general conference. I decided to speak about perfecting our lives so that we could eventually become like our Father in Heaven. In my talk I invited the Saints to participate in a spiritual exercise. I suggested that members take the time to humbly ask the Lord the question "What lack I yet?" and then wait for a prompting from the Holy Ghost.</p><br><p class="p1">In the weeks that followed, as I visited stakes around the Church, members came up to me and said, "Elder Lawrence, I tried the suggestion you gave in your conference talk. I asked the Lord what I needed to improve, and I got a clear answer."</p><br><p class="p1">Some have even shared with me the specific direction they received from the Lord. I was interested to learn that many Saints have been prompted to "be more cheerful" or to "smile more often" or to "count their blessings."</p><br><p class="p1">I am convinced that, more than anything else, our Heavenly Father wants His children tobe happy.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Latter-day prophets have taught that happi­ness is the purpose of our existence. Joseph Smith understood this principle. In spite of all his challenges, he chose to be happy, maintaining his cheerful disposition to the end of his life.</span></p><br><p class="p1">One who knew him well described the prophet as always wearing "an unconscious smile."<sup>1</sup> I have known people like that--­individuals who are continually smiling ­without even realizing it. Their faces reflect genuine inner peace.</p><br><p class="p1">When I speak at stake conferences, I look around the congregation for one of those happy faces to focus on. A smiling face in a crowd of strangers is a great comfort.</p><br><p class="p1">What is the secret of inner happiness? The obvious answer is righteous living. But besides being "temple worthy," what are some ways that you can increase the joy in your lives? Modern-day prophets have shared helpful insights.</p><br><p class="p1">For example, President Gordon B. Hinckley taught that the more often a person says thank you, the happier he will be.<sup>2</sup> It might be a worthwhile experiment to keep track of how many times you say thank you in a typical day--and then to make an effort to increase it.</p><br><p class="p1">The theme of gratitude has been addressed by every latter-day prophet--and more often than almost any other topic. Our inspired leaders know that being grateful leads to happiness, and they are compelled to remind us.</p><br><p class="p1">In the scriptures we are commanded to "thank the Lord thy God in all things" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.7?lang=eng#6">D&amp;amp;C 59:7</a>), and that means to thank Him for trials as well as for obvious blessings. If we look close enough, we discover that there is always something to be grateful for. For example, one BYU coed had the stomach flu all during Thanksgiving week, but she tried to keep a positive attitude. She recorded in her journal only these words: "I lost five pounds this week. Life is good!"</p><br><p class="p1">Besides expressing thanks to our Father in Heaven, President Thomas S. Monson has encouraged us to also thank our friends and family. He said:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>We often take for granted the very people who most deserve our gratitude. Let us not wait until itistoo late for us to express that gratitude.</i><sup>3</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Several years ago there was an inspiring story in a popular sports magazine about a professional football player named Deion Branch. He was a wide receiver for the New England Patriots for eleven years, and during that time he played in three Super Bowls.</p><br><p class="p1">The article pointed out that many professional football players go out drinking and get "hammered" in the days leading up to the Super Bowl. They find various ways to deal with the stress, and many of these ways are notpraiseworthy.</p><br><p class="p1">But Deion Branch had a different way of preparing himself for the big game in 2005. Hepicked up his phone and called every coach he had ever had. He called his junior college coaches. He called his high school coaches. Heeven sought out the phone numbers of his Pee Wee coaches and reached out to them. Hemade thirteen phone calls in all.</p><br><p class="p1">He called these men to say thank you: "Thank you for caring about me [enough to teach me]. Thank you for making me run stairs. Thank you for believing I could do this." He thanked his college coach for not giving up on him when his grades were bad. Deion stood only five feet nine inches tall, so he thanked his high school coach for never saying that he was too small to play football.</p><br><p class="p1">These phone conversations were very meaningful to his coaches, but they also invigorated Deion Branch. He felt so motivated that he played his very best, leading his team to victory. He was named the Most Valuable Player ofthe Super Bowl in 2005.<sup>4</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Have you ever had a rush of gratitude come over you? Did you make a phone call or write a note or take time for a personal visit? Have you experienced the happiness that comes from saying thank you and feeling it with your whole heart?</p><br><p class="p1">My father died of cancer when I was just eighteen years old. I was not yet a member of the Church, and I didn't have the sensitivity that the gift of the Holy Ghost can bring.</p><br><p class="p1">I never really took the opportunity to thank him for all that he had done for me before he passed away. Now I wish I had thanked him for coaching my Little League team and for teaching me not to lose my temper when our team didn't win. I wish I had thanked him for working with me night after night when I was learning to read in the first grade. I wish I had thanked him for teaching me how to work and to value family.</p><br><p class="p1">Please don't make the same mistake that I made. Thank your parents often while you still have the opportunity.</p><br><p class="p1">It doesn't matter if your parents are not perfect. They still changed thousands of diapers and provided countless meals for you. They taught you how to walk and to talk and a million other things. They gave you plenty of rides and even let you learn to drive by practicing in their cars. They must have encouraged you to study--otherwise you would never have been accepted here at BYU. They deserve your heartfelt thanks, and someday you will realize it when you are doing all these things for someone else.</p><br><p class="p1">The prophet Nephi expressed gratitude for his parents in the very first verse of the Book of Mormon. He praised them by saying, "I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore Iwas taught somewhat in all the learning of my father" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1.1?lang=eng#primary">1 Nephi 1:1</a>). What a sweet tribute to Lehi and Sariah.</p><br><p class="p1">An excellent way to express gratitude is by giving sincere praise. Praise lifts both the giver and the receiver. Mark Twain said, "I can live for two months on a good compliment,"<sup>5</sup> and most of us feel the same way.</p><br><p class="p1">God showed us the importance of giving praise by His own perfect example. At the baptism of Jesus, Heavenly Father announced, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/3.17?lang=eng#p16">Matthew 3:17</a>).</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Jesus Himself gave many compliments during His ministry. Some of them are recorded in the scriptures. Remember when He first met Nathanael, who later became one of the Twelve Apostles. The Lord praised Nathanael's honest character by saying of him, "Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom [there] is no guile!" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/1.47?lang=eng#p46">John 1:47</a>).</span></p><br><p class="p1">When John the Baptist was in prison, the Savior made a point of praising this good man publicly. Jesus said, "Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/7.28?lang=eng#p27">Luke 7:28</a>).</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> When the Roman centurion asked Jesus to heal his servant, the Lord paid him the supreme compliment. He said, "Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in [all] Israel" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/8.10?lang=eng#p9">Matthew 8:10</a>).</span></p><br><p class="p1">And don't forget Nephi, son of Helaman. One day when he was especially discouraged, <span class="s1">the voice of the Lord came to him and delivered </span>these words of praise:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Blessed art thou, Nephi, for those things which thou hast done; for I have beheld how thou hast with unwearyingness declared the word, which I have given unto thee. ...</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>... Behold, I will bless thee forever.</i> [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/10.4-5?lang=eng#p3">Helaman 10:4–5</a>]</p><br><p class="p1">If we truly want to emulate the Lord, we need to be looking for the good in others and then voicing it. If there is anything ­virtuous, lovely, of good report, or praiseworthy, we <span class="s1">should be seeking after these things (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.13?lang=eng#p12">Articles of Faith 1:13</a>). Praise is aprecious gift that costs the giver nothing. So ifyou see some</span>thing, say something.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> In his classic talk "<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1989/05/beware-of-pride?lang=eng&amp;amp;_r=1">Beware of Pride</a>," President Ezra Taft Benson warned that whenever we are "withholding gratitude and praise that might lift another," we are manifesting the sin of pride.<sup>6</sup> On the other hand, when we point out the good in others, the Holy Ghost helps us discover the good in ourselves--and everybody wins.</span></p><br><p class="p1">When our six children were growing up, we often played a game during family home evening that encouraged them to give compliments. Every family member took a turn sitting in the chair that was designated the "hot seat." Then we went around the room, and each of us said something we admired or appreciated about the person in the hot seat. For example, comments were made such as "Casey always shares his things with me," "Brooke does her homework as soon as she comes home from school," or "McLane is really funny; he can make me laugh when I'm having a hard day." You get the idea.</p><br><p class="p1">We noticed that whenever we played this game, the Spirit would fill our home with love. I am sure that heaven approved of this family tradition because the Lord has commanded us to "strengthen [our] brethren in all [our] conversation" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/108.7?lang=eng#6">D&amp;amp;C 108:7</a>).</p><br><p class="p1">A newly called bishop understood this principle and used it to strengthen his ward members. As each family came to his office for tithing settlement, the bishop asked the father to introduce his wife and children. Fathers were invited to tell the name of, the age of, and something they especially loved about each family member.</p><br><p class="p1">As soon as these introductions got underway, the Spirit grew stronger and stronger in the room. Tears appeared in the eyes of fathers, mothers, and children. Sincere compliments from parents mean a lot; sometimes they are remembered for a lifetime.</p><br><p class="p1">Even when a compliment comes from a complete stranger, it can make your whole day. My niece told me about a difficult time she had when she was a single college student. The whole week had been a disaster, and she was feeling lonely and discouraged. While saying her prayers one morning, she asked Heavenly Father to help her feel His love that day. After praying, she was prompted to go to the temple, so she put on a dress and fixed her hair. On the way there she passed an older woman who smiled and stopped to compliment her beautiful, wholesome appearance. The gracious stranger had no idea that a few kind words from her had delivered a message from heaven. My niece immediately felt a feeling of love wash over her and realized that her morning prayer had been answered.</p><br><p class="p1">An elderly widow shared a similar sweet experience with me. She opened her front door one wintry day to find a handwritten note left on the doorstep. The note read:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>I just wanted to drop you a note to tell you how much I admire you in all the roles you have played--as a mother, teacher, wife, and example of a daughter of God. Thank you for being you. From a friend and admirer.</i></p><br><p class="p1">The anonymous note from a thoughtful neighbor took only a few minutes to write, but the message will lift that faithful widow for months to come.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Years ago President David O. McKay gave this valuable counsel to Latter-day Saints: "Start out to make somebody else happy and see how quickly your own soul is filled with joy."<sup>7</sup></span></p><br><p class="p1">When I was called as a General Authority, my first assignment was to move to Moscow, Russia. I was very humbled to serve in the Area Presidency, especially as I thought of the history of the area. The countries in Eastern Europe were formerly under communistic rule, and many of the old attitudes still prevailed.</p><br><p class="p1">President Russell M. Nelson was assigned to advise our area. He has a wealth of experience, having opened Russia and most of the surrounding countries for the preaching of the gospel. Although he lived far away in Salt Lake City, I communicated with him on a regular basis by email or by phone while I served as the Area President. I was constantly reporting what was happening in Eastern Europe and asking for his inspired counsel.</p><br><p class="p1">After several weeks I began to see a pattern. Whenever I received an email from President Nelson, it contained more than just excellent advice. It always included some complimentary words and a positive message to encourage our presidency. His example made me want to lift others as he had lifted me. I learned that kindness is contagious.</p><br><p class="p1">I also learned that our modern-day apostles emulate the Savior in their lives, especially in the way they treat others. They are turned outward, not inward.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I remember the first time I met President Gordon B. Hinckley. I was attending a luncheon held at the Church Office Building. By some tender mercy I found myself seated at the same table as the prophet. During that lunch hour I observed that he rarely talked about himself; he was more interested in learning about others. He directed the conversation by asking questions of each person at our table. Somehow he knew that I had served as a mission president in Siberia, so he asked me how the Russians heat their big apartment buildings in the winter­time. He was a very gracious listener, sincerely interested in everyone and everything--much like the Master whom he served.</span></p><br><p class="p1">Consider the unselfish life of the Savior. Think back to the night when He was arrested in Gethsemane. Even after suffering and bleeding from every pore, Jesus was not thinking just about Himself. He was sensitive to others. When He saw Peter smite off the ear of one of the guards, Jesus reached out, touched the fresh wound, and healed it. Keep in mind that this was a guard who had come to arrest Him. (See <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/22.49-51?lang=eng#p48">Luke 22:49–51</a>; see also <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/26.51-52?lang=eng#p50">Matthew 26:51–52</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/mark/14.47?lang=eng#p46">Mark 14:47</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/18.10-11?lang=eng#p9">John 18:10–11</a>.)</p><br><p class="p1">When He was dying on the cross, our Lord showed more concern for His beloved mother than for His own suffering. The dying Christ used up His last bit of strength to arrange a home for Mary, asking John to care for her after He was gone. (See <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/19.25-27?lang=eng#p24">John 19:25–27</a>.)</p><br><p class="p1">Try to imagine meeting the Savior in person. How would He greet you? Would He be slouched over, looking intently at His cell phone, or would He smile and look right into your eyes?</p><br><p class="p1">I believe He would call you by name and make the conversation about you. He would offer reassurance and help. Most of all, I believe He would radiate love. In the earliest account of the First Vision, Joseph Smith recorded that after having met the Father and the Son, "my soul was filled with love and for many days Icould rejoice with great joy."<sup>8</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Someday we will meet Jesus and feel His profound love for us. Until then, we have many lessons to learn. There are going to be both smooth days and rough days throughout our lives, but the Lord has commanded us repeatedly to "be of good cheer." Elder Jeffrey R. Holland observed that "we may be more guilty of breaking that commandment than almost any other."<sup>9</sup> Sometimes we just plain choose to be grumpy. At those times we turn inward--instead of outward.</p><br><p class="p1">My wife and I served in Russia on Church assignments for a total of seven years. We treasure the memory of our time there, but there was one thing we could never quite get used to. Russian people on the streets and in the stores always wear a very serious expression. They avoid smiling or making eye contact with others. Their cold outer demeanor comes from living under a communist regime for many decades. During the Soviet era, people learned not to call any attention to themselves; they just tried to blend in. Their guarded behavior inpublic became a part of the culture.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> For this reason we were amazed at the warm greeting we received whenever we attended the branch meetings on Sundays. What a contrast! Those Russians who had joined the Church were very friendly and welcomed us with open arms. They had smiling faces, and the Light of Christ shone in their eyes.</span></p><br><p class="p1">We realized why the Church members were so kind and outgoing--because that's what the gift of the Holy Ghost does to people. Jesus taught, "By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/13.35?lang=eng#p34">John 13:35</a>). We learned for ourselves that the Saints in Russia were true disciples of Christ.</p><br><p class="p1">I was baptized when I was a young medical student at the University of Arizona. The first time I attended Church meetings at the LDS institute, I looked around hoping to find a familiar face. Thank goodness another medical student recognized me and came right over to say hello. His name was Phil Freestone. Phil sat with me and introduced me to other Church members. It is not easy to be a newcomer, and Phil's friendship meant a great deal to me at that important time in my life. I came to understand what the Savior meant when He said, "Iwas a stranger, and ye took me in" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/25.35?lang=eng#p34">Matthew 25:35</a>).</p><br><p class="p1">Latter-day Saints who are guided by the Spirit should be the most congenial people on earth. I hope the BYU campus reflects that same spirit of friendliness. Every student should feel welcome here and at the same time go out of his or her way to welcome others. It takes very little effort to say hello, but whenever you do, you make the world a better place.</p><br><p class="p1">Today I have pointed out a few practices that can lead to greater happiness: smiling more often, expressing gratitude, looking for and praising the good in others, welcoming the newcomer, and reaching out to those who need a friend. Let me also share with you some practical advice found in the scriptures.</p><br><p class="p1">I read the account of a young man who had experienced some severe personal trials. In the course of a few months his brother died, then he lost his job, and finally his girlfriend broke up with him. Although he was feeling misunderstood by his boss and somewhat betrayed by his girlfriend, he didn't lose his faith. In fact, he prayed to the Lord for counsel because he really wanted to be happy.</p><br><p class="p1">After praying, he opened the scriptures, determined to act on whatever verse he found. The book fell open to section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Almost immediately he recognized a call to action contained in these words of scripture:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Cease to be idle; cease to be unclean; cease to find fault one with another; cease to sleep longer than is needful; retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>And above all things, clothe yourselves with the bond of charity.</i> [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.124-25?lang=eng#p123">D&amp;amp;C 88:124–25</a>]</p><br><p class="p1">As the young man pondered this counsel and applied it to his own situation, he realized that he could no longer sit around moping. He needed to be anxiously engaged in a good cause, like finding another job--and another girlfriend. There was a lot about his life that he decided to change, including his sleeping habits. He also decided to begin to pray for the gift of charity. This timely advice helped him put the past behind him and look forward to the future.</p><br><p class="p1">All of us need a little cheering up sometimes. Book of Mormon readers are often surprised when they come to the chapter in which Nephi was grieving over his imperfections. He expressed himself in these words: "O wretched man that I am!" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4.17?lang=eng#p16">2 Nephi 4:17</a>). Most of us on a good day wish we could be as "wretched" as Nephi. His sorrowful lament makes us wonder, "Why do good people--even prophets like Nephi--occasionally feel discouraged and unworthy?"</p><br><p class="p1">Let me tell you a fable about the devil that offers some perspective.<sup>10</sup> The story goes that Satan went into his garage one day and noticed that everything was a complete mess. He couldn't find what he was looking for because there were so many rusty tools lying around cluttering up the place.</p><br><p class="p1">Satan decided on a solution. He would have a garage sale. He cleaned up his old tools and offered them at a discount price for other devils to purchase. Some tools sold right away--for example, the hammer of hatred, the wrench of fear, and the clamp of addiction. They were very popular items.</p><br><p class="p1">When he was asked why he was selling off so many of his tools, Satan explained that he had decided to concentrate all of his personal efforts on bringing down the Latter-day Saints. He preferred to use his favorite tool on them. What do you think it was?</p><br><p class="p1">It was the wedge of discouragement. Satan boasted about it, saying, "With this one tool I can inflict major damage on the faithful. Discouragement works wonders every time--even when nothing else will. It can bring misery to the most conscientious souls--those who are striving to keep the commandments."</p><br><p class="p1">Then Satan, using his favorite tool, went about whispering lies. To the humble followers of Christ he said, "You are worthless," "You never do anything right," "Give up," "No one cares about you," and "You can never change." Sadly, many good people believed him.</p><br><p class="p1">There is a lesson to be learned from this fable. The devil specializes in discouraging the faithful and those who are trying to repent. For that very reason, Church members must continually lift and encourage each other.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Don't forget that Satan wants all men to be "in misery, like unto himself" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.9?lang=eng#p8">2 Nephi 9:9</a>). Jesus, on the other hand, wants men and women to "receive a fulness of joy" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/138.17?lang=eng#p16">D&amp;amp;C 138:17</a>).</span></p><br><p class="p1">In summary, Jesus votes for us, Satan votes against us, and we cast the deciding vote. It is my prayer that each of us will use our agency tochoose happiness.</p><br><p class="p1">I bear my witness that our Father in Heaven loves us and wants us to be happy--even as He is happy. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Larry R.

<h1> the Light - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
What an amazing opportunity it is to stand before you today. Never in a million years would I have ever thought that I would be right here, right now. I must admit that the first thing I thought when asked if I would be willing to speak was, "Really? Are you sure? I'm just a soccer coach!" And then I thought, "Oh, no--those new Marriott Center screens are way too big!"<br><br>It goes to show you that we never know what God has in store for us in the present or in the future. Life is a journey, and we must always embrace it--even when we are asked to do something that we thought was absolutely unimaginable. My journey truly has been different than what I would have ever foreseen when I once sat in your seat over thirty years ago. But what a blessed life and what a ride it has been.<br><br>I pray that I will be able to share a few thoughts and stories today that might inspire you to realize your significance and importance here on earth. I know that I will not necessarily tell you anything you haven't heard before, but I hope that I might remind you of what you have always known and of what can so easily be forgotten in our demanding lives.<br><h2><b>Follow the Light</b></h2><br>Does your life seem too busy at times? I know mine does. We live in a world in which our lives are busier, noisier, and more stressful than ever--a time when nothing stops or even slows down. We have more responsibilities, more pressures, more expectations, and more places to be, and we spend far too much time on our smartphones. It just seems impossible sometimes to keep up with the pace.<br><br>In order to slow down the madness of life, I love to retreat into nature. We are so blessed to live at the base of majestic mountains. We can look to the west and appreciate the view of the lake, travel east and be enveloped in the canyons, or drive south and take in the magnificence and serenity of the red rock.<br><br>I am always drawn to the light in the beauty of God's creations, in which I can find ­calmness, comfort, peace, and a deeper connection to my Heavenly Father and my Savior. Just as the sun, the moon, and the stars light the landscape of this beautiful world, the light from above provides us with direction and purpose. When I think about light and the many different meanings it has, Ireflect on an experience Ihad last June.<br><br>For several years I have had the opportunity to participate in a team race that takes runners through some of the most beautiful scenery in the state. The event starts in Logan and winds through the Wasatch Back to finish in Park City. It is called the Ragnar Relay Series, and each team consists of two vans, with six people packed into each van. Each team spends more than thirty hours together with no sleep, not much food, and few rest spots. Each team member runs three different routes, and the whole team runs a total of more than 180 miles. What an adventure!<br><br>Last year I wasn't quite as prepared as usual after badly spraining my foot a few months before. Just so you know, I was the oldest on the team and by far the slowest runner. Everyone else on my team was really fast. After my first run of nearly six miles, I was okay, but it had been really hard and I had gone pretty slow.<br><br>Soon after, our van was starting to get ready for our second leg of runs when my friend Greg mentioned that maybe I should run a shorter leg that was half the length of what I was supposed to run. At first I thought, "Oh, that's thoughtful of him--he's concerned about my foot." But I soon realized that he just didn't want me to slow down the team.<br><br>So I took the shorter run. However, it put me on an unfamiliar course. It was one of the few runs that took place on a trail in the middle of nowhere at 2:00 a.m. There was no lighted path, and there were no signs or obvious markers. I wore a headlamp and a blinking red reflector. My headlamp was the only source of light through the two and a half miles of switchback trails. As you can imagine, it was a bit disconcerting, and it was very challenging to stay on the path. I had to stop a few times to shine my headlamp around for fear that I was off of the course. During the entire run I was scanning for any sign of a light, a marker, or even a blinking reflector from someone. Occasionally I would see in the distance a small red light with an arrow and run in that direction. Once I had passed the arrow, I would scan again, trying to find another redlight.<br><br>Finally, toward the end of my run, I saw a few runners ahead and followed their lights to the finish. Soon after, a couple of runners came in behind me and thanked me for leading them to the end. Evidently they had been following my light all the way in.<br><br>In this experience and in life, the lighted path is not always easy to follow, but it is the only way to reach our desired destination. During the run it was important to stay strong, positive, and confident, even though there were continual doubts. I had to intently search for the light of others to help me find the way and point me in the right direction. And although Iwasn't even aware of it at the time, I was ­actually a light for others.<br><br>We have been sent to this earth as part of a remarkable plan to prove ourselves--to learn, to grow, and to develop into our best selves. We are here to build the kingdom of God and to help our family and friends reach their highest potential. We know and have been taught that the light leads us through this journey. We have all been blessed with the Light of Christ--to know right from wrong and good from evil and to have a knowledge of our Heavenly Father's and our Savior's love.<br><br>President HaroldB. Lee stated:<br><br><i>Every soul who walks the earth, wherever he lives, in whatever nation he may have been born, no matter whether he be in riches or in poverty, had at birth an endowment of that first light which is called the Light of Christ, the Spirit of Truth, or the Spirit of God--that universal light of intelligence with which every soul is blessed</i>. [<i>Stand Ye in Holy Places: Selected Sermons and Writings of President HaroldB. Lee </i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1974), 115]<br><br>As surely as there is light, there is darkness. As surely as there is God, there is Satan. If we don't continuously search for the light and stayon the path, we can just as easily be led into darkness and off the course. We all know that we live in a world in which there is increasing darkness, in which lines are blurred and the separation between the light and the dark is getting larger. Our society is trending away from the spiritual and becoming more secular than ever. It is even becoming apparent that those who choose to follow the light are often mocked, ridiculed, and looked down upon.<br><br>We must always stay on the lighted path and search for those things that we know to be true. As it says in the thirteenth article of faith, "If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things" (Articles of Faith 1:13).<br><br>President Wilford Woodruff once said:<br><br><i> We have . . . no time to be drawn away from the things of the kingdom of God. .</i><i>.</i><i>. While enjoying the spirit of the Lord, we want the light all the time. Without the light no man can see. .</i><i>.</i><i>. While I walk in the light of God my mind is open. I can comprehend it and understand the signs of the time and the working of the Spirit of God, and when a thing is presented to me by [the] servants of God, I can receive a testimony of the truth of that; but when Ilose the light I don't comprehend those things. Iamliable to find fault with this, that, and the other. We want to walk in the light. We want the Spirit of [the] Lord to be with us in order for us to live our religion, fulfill our mission as </i>[sisters and]<i> elders inIsrael, and do the will of God--to fulfill this great, high calling in the building up of this kingdom. We can't do it </i><b><i>unless</i></b><i> we walk in the light of the Lord. </i>["Sermon to the Saints in Farmington," 9 January 1864, transcribed by LaJean Purcell Carruth, 1 March 2013, <a href="https://history.lds.org/article/lost-sermons-wilford-woodruff-january-1864?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">history.lds.org/article/lost-sermons-wilford-woodruff-january-1864?lang=eng</a>; emphasis in original]<br><h2><b>Seek After the Light</b></h2><br>Clinging to the light is a choice, and often that choice is challenging. We have heard the saying "I never said it would be easy, but it will be worth it." We all face challenges, and Satan loves to prey on us, especially during the difficult times. He wants us to feel as if there are different paths. He wants us to give up, and he places opportunities for missteps along our way.<br><br>I believe that one of his greatest tools is to provide situations in which we doubt ourselves, our unique spirit, and our mission here on earth. We then let those negative voices speak loudly in our heads--with phrases such as "I'm not good enough, smart enough, pretty enough, or skinny enough. I'm not worthy enough or strong enough. Life is too hard!"<br><br>Yes, life is hard and we are all challenged, and at certain times we are challenged more than at other times. We get scared of failure, we fear the unknown, and we are burdened with losses, sickness, and pain. All of these emotions leave us vulnerable, questioning, and sometimes searching for easy fixes. This often leads us to complain, blame, talk badly of others, and make excuses, and the light gets smaller and smaller and smaller.<br><br>We are in a battle between the light and the darkness each and every day. We have more and more forces working against us, and Satan will always give us his best shot. Sometimes the more progress we make toward the light, the more temptations may come. As members of the Church trying to build the kingdom, we can be assured that we are prime targets.<br><br>However, no matter what is thrown at us or whatever temptations and obstacles and kinds of darkness come our way, we always have a choice. Which voices do we let in? Which voices can drown out the darkness and fill our minds and souls with the light?<br><br>We must intentionally use our voices that say, "I am strong. I can do this. I am a fighter, and I choose to walk in the light."<br><br>One of my favorite songs is titled "I Will" and is written and performed by Hilary Weeks. To me it emphasizes the importance of making a personal commitment to stay strong in our faith. I wish she were here to sing it, but the ­lyrics include the following:<br><br><i>I've made my choice</i><br><i>You can mark this day</i><br><i>The day I pledge</i><br><i>To take His name</i><br><br><i>I will be strong</i><br><i>I will be brave</i><br><i>Standing for Him</i><br><i>As I take my place</i><br><br><i> . . .</i><br><br><i>I will stand</i><br><i>I will not fall</i><br><i>In a world that's weak</i><br><i>I will be strong</i><br><i>I'll be true,</i><br><i>I will choose His way</i><br><i>I know what's right</i><br><i>And I will not change</i><br><i>In a world where so many will not</i><br><i>I will</i><br>["I Will," <i>Every Step</i> (Shadow Mountain Records: 2011)]<br><br>There are so many times throughout our lives when we have experiences that shake our commitments and cause us to doubt our abilities. As a coach, I am in a position in which difficult decisions have to be made that can significantly impact young people's lives. Whether these are choices about who to recruit or about playing time, these decisions often cause issues with players, parents, and families--who, needless to say, are not too happy with me.<br><br>Many years ago I was in the middle of some very challenging situations that not only caused me much doubt in my abilities but also made me question my own path. Fortunately I was blessed by the tender mercy of a friend who must have been inspired to send me a poem that appealed to Mother Teresa. The poem reminded me that we always have the ability to make positive choices and see the light, even in the midst of darkness. This poem has had a profound impact on my life, and I refer to it often. I love to share it at every possible opportunity.<br><br><i>People are illogical, unreasonable, and self-centered.</i><br><i>Love them anyway.</i><br><i>If you do good, people will accuse you of selfish ­ulterior motives.</i><br><i>Do good anyway.</i><br><i>If you are successful, you will win false friends and true enemies.</i><br><i>Succeed anyway.</i><br><i>The good you do today will be forgotten tomorrow.</i><br><i>Do good anyway.</i><br><i>Honesty and frankness make you vulnerable.</i><br><i>Be honest and frank anyway.</i><br><i>The biggest men and women with the biggest ideas can be shot down by the smallest men and women with the smallest minds.</i><br><i>Think big anyway.</i><br><i>People favor underdogs but follow only top dogs.</i><br><i>Fight for a few underdogs anyway.</i><br><i>What you spend years building may be destroyed overnight.</i><br><i>Build anyway.</i><br><i>People really need help but may attack you if you do help them.</i><br><i>Help people anyway.</i><br><i>Give the world the best you have and you'll get kicked in the teeth.</i><br><i>Give the world the best you have anyway.</i><br>[Kent M.

He also sent us here with all the tools we need to find success, happiness, and peace. But we must choose to surround ourselves with light. We must search the scriptures and the words of our prophets and leaders and seek after the truth. We must be disciplined and dedicated, and we must look for opportunities to learn and grow. And we must be willing to do all the little things in order to reap the bigger rewards.<br><br>When I was younger, one of my first coaching jobs was for a high school boys' soccer team. What an amazing and growing experience that was! Can you imagine a young girl, twenty-five years ago, who had just graduated from college, coaching a high school boys' soccer team? I loved it. I loved those guys, and we had a great time.<br><br>Back then we had to do everything on our own. Some of our competitions were hours away. I used to drive the team around in a fifteen-passenger van--just me and fourteen high school boys.<br><br>A few weeks ago I heard from a former player from those days who wrote me an email telling me of an experience he remembered and a lesson he learned that has helped him over the years. He referenced a situation when I let the guys do what they wanted at practice for a few minutes, and they chose to stand around the front of the goal taking shots.<br><br>He remembers me saying, "What makes you think you will ever get those shots off in a game if you can't even pass, trap, or control the ball?"<br><br>Although I don't remember saying those specific words, he does, and he not only applied them to soccer but to life. He understands and he reminded me that "we can'texpect to have chances to succeed at the 'game-changing' visible thingsunless we are working to master the 'little things,' and the 'bigthings' are ultimately dependent on how hard we are willing to work."<br><br>To me, this is a great example of someone who was able to apply a simple concept to his life and who continues to share that lesson with those he teaches. He searched for deeper meaning in his experiences, and he learned from some of life's simple truths. This is one way wecan search for the light.<br><br>Another way to search for the light is to surround ourselves with individuals who inspire us and lift us to great places. We must choose our friends and those we associate with very carefully. We must ask ourselves: "Are these individuals helping us to move toward the light, or are they allowing us to let some darkness slip in? Are they motivating and inspiring us, or are they bringing us down? Do they help us see what is great about the world, or do they cast a shadow of negativity?" We mostly have a choice of who we spend our time with.<br><br>A big part of my job and our staff's job is to recruit players to BYU. It is truly one of the hardest and most time-consuming aspects of our job, but it is also one of the most rewarding because we have the opportunity to recruit some of the finest young women who are playing at the highest level in their sport. We know that the players we bring in will not only be spending a large amount of time with us but will also be a significant part of the lives of their teammates for the course of their college career. They will spend countless hours together at practices, in the weight room, and on the road throughout almost every weekend during the season and the summer. Each new season of recruits will be a major influence in our lives, so we must choose wisely.<br><br>When you seek after the light by surrounding yourself with positive and great individuals, you provide yourself with more opportunities to learn and grow. I have been blessed to work with so many inspiring student athletes. They continue to teach me so much, but one player truly stands out.<br><br>Many years ago we recruited a young lady who had a special talent and gift for the game. She was raised a long way from Provo, Utah, and had never really been around many Latter-day Saint players. She was also someone who was so good that she had never really been held accountable to some of our athletic standards, such as fitness tests, work rate, and being on time--or even things such as what to wear to soccer clinics and service projects. She was her own person, had her own ideas, and marched to her own drum--which was fine, but at the same time, it was holding her back from reaching her highest potential.<br><br>We did not see eye to eye on many things early on. It actually came to a point at which I had to make the decision to ask her to leave the team. She was good enough to play at other universities, and I told her I would help her find a place. However, I also mentioned that if this was where she really wanted to be and if she was willing to embrace her opportunity here and make some changes, then she would have the opportunity to join us again the following semester. After a short time she told me that she really wanted to come back and learn from all those around her.<br><br>It was not an easy journey for her, and there were many times when she knew it would be easier somewhere else. But through the struggles, the fight, the dedication, and the choices, she was able to develop, mature, and grow. She made the decision to stay and surround herself with great friends, teammates, professors, ward members, and the environment at BYU, and it ultimately led to an opportunity to change her life and her future.<br><br>One of the most rewarding and proud moments of my coaching career was to give Jenavieve Phillips a big hug on the field after her last game as a Cougar and congratulate her on an amazing journey. During her senior year she helped lead our team to a number fourteen ranking before we were knocked out of the tournament by the University of Portland, the defending national champion at that time.<br><br>What a blessing and unbelievable inspiration Jenavieve was to me, my staff, her teammates, and all those who knew her. She went on to graduate from BYU, serve a mission, and bless the lives of all those she came in contact with. She lived her life to the fullest, fulfilled her mission on this earth, and was taken home to her Heavenly Father after a car accident in 2012.<br><br>Not only can we choose to surround ourselves with good people, but we are also blessed to have a God who intentionally places certain individuals in our path to provide opportunities and open doors to the future. He wants so badly to help us reach our potential, and He will, if only we will let Him.<br><br>I would like each of you to think about some of the individuals who have helped you get to where you are today. Some have had big roles, some small, and some have made all the difference. It is important to remember that at no time do we accomplish things on our own.<br><br>I remember Ken Marshall, a high school soccer coach who taught me to push myself, work harder, and achieve more than I thought was possible. He challenged me in every way toget better and always expected success. He hired me as a sixteen-year-old to help work his youth soccer camps throughout the summer, and that opportunity gave me the knowledge and ­experience I needed to direct the camps here at BYU with the more than 2,500 kids who attend each year.<br><br>I remember a brilliant lady, Nancy Heuston, head of the Waterford School, who hired me to begin teaching at a middle school and coaching at a high school during my senior year at BYU. I was a finance major, and I had no teaching credentials, no education classes, and no real experience. However, she believed in me, and she believed that I had a future in education and coaching. This opportunity eventually opened doors for me to set a new career path.<br><br>I remember the legendary coaches and administrators of the BYU women's athletic department. These were great women--­including Lu Wallace, Elaine Michealis, and Ann Valentine--who in 1995 took a chance on a young coach who had no real NCAA coaching, recruiting, or managerial experience but who had a dream and a vision of what BYU soccer could someday be. So many amazing people have crossed my path over the years, as I am sure many have crossed yours.<br><h2><b>Be the Light</b></h2><br>With so much that has been provided for us by a loving Heavenly Father, much is expected. What a blessing for all of us to be at this great institution. As part of my job, I have the opportunity almost every week to tell young people, their coaches, and their parents what an amazing place this is: a university where students can reach their highest potential athletically, academically, socially, and spiritually and where everyone understands that they are not perfect but where they are committed to being their best.<br><br>I am sure that we all have worked extremely hard and sacrificed much to be a part of this BYU community. I am sure that we all are qualified and have had numerous opportunities to be elsewhere, but we have chosen to be here at Brigham Young University and to stand for something more than ourselves.<br><br>Several years ago President Gordon B. Hinckley said at a BYU devotional:<br><br><i>You came because you wanted the BYU experience, although perhaps you could not define it. Having gained it, never lose it. Cultivate it in your lives and hold its very essence until you grow old and gray. Even then you can sit on the wall on a warm summer day and think of the things you are still learning in light of the great experience you had</i>. ["<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/gordon-b-hinckley_byu-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The BYU Experience</a>," BYU devotional address, 4November 1997]<br><br>Are we making the most of our opportunities here at BYU? Are we doing everything we can to build the kingdom of God? Are we being a light to others?<br><br>Years ago President JamesE. Faust gave a talk titled "The Light in Their Eyes." He recalled a historic meeting in Jerusalem about the new lease for the land on which the BYU Jerusalem Center would be built. President Ezra Taft Benson and Elder JeffreyR. Holland agreed with the Israeli government that the university would not proselyte in Israel. After the lease was signed, someone remarked, "Oh, we know that you are not going to proselyte, but what are you going to do about the light that is in their eyes?" He was referring to the BYU students who would be studying in Israel. ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2005/10/the-light-in-their-eyes?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Light in Their Eyes</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2005.)<br><br>Do you have that light in your eyes? Would someone who doesn't know you know that you have the light within you?<br><br>In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus said:<br><br><i> Ye are thelightof the world. A city that is set on anhill cannot be hid. . . .</i><br><br><i> Let yourlightso shine before men, that they may see your goodworks, andglorifyyour Father which is in heaven.</i> [Matthew 5:14, 16]<br><br>President ThomasS. Monson has said:<br><br><i> Our opportunities to shine are limitless. They surround us each day, in whatever circumstance we find ourselves. As we follow the example of the Savior, ours will be the opportunity to be a light, as it were, in the lives of those around us--whether they be our own family members, our coworkers, mere acquaintances, or total strangers</i>. ["<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/thomas-s-monson_be-a-light-to-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Be a Light to the World</a>," BYU devotional address, 1November 2011]<br><br>On our team, we often talk about the importance of representing ourselves at the highest level--about how wearing the name Brigham Young University on our jerseys means much more than just being another college team. We are aware that people are watching us, and you never know which lives can be touched, which doors can be opened, and what inspiration can be provided. Although we are not perfect, we try to represent BYU the best we can. We want to play at the highest level, win championships, and be nationally relevant so that people will know who we are and what we represent. As President Monson stated, we want to be a light even to "total strangers."<br><br>A few months ago I received a package from one of the state prisons in Utah. I thought it was unusual, but I opened the package. Inside was a beautiful hand-knitted blanket with the full BYU Cougar logo in the middle. There was a handwritten note on top, and part of it read:<br><br><i>I am an inmate of the Utah State Prison. I am fifty-four years old, and in all my life I never was interested in watching any sports on TV. That was until 2009, when I was running channels and came across a BYU women's soccer game just as someone did a flip throw. I stopped to watch to see what was going on, and I was hooked. To this day, the only sport I really watch is BYU women's soccer.</i><br><br><i> There is something about the way they play. It is very hard to describe. They play with heart, for the love of the game, and just for fun and enjoyment. Itis something that you cannot put into words.</i><br><br><i> I will never get to see a game in person. So please accept this blanket as a token of my appreciation. Itis for the entire team.</i><br><br>This was such a kind gift and note that touched our team and reminded us that we are capable of reaching individuals who we would never have thought of. Our reach goes so far, whether in sports, music, dance, research, science, or education. In whatever we are involved with here at BYU, we can make a difference.<br><br>Each year our players work as camp coaches for young players who love the sport and often have dreams of someday attending and playing soccer at BYU. Most of our players attended camps when they were younger, so they know how exciting it is for young campers to come and hang out with them for a week. In fact, I first met several of the current players on our team at camp when they were only ten or eleven years old.<br><br>One summer several years ago we had a young girl attend who was shy but also uncooperative, and she didn't want to participate in the drills or games with her group. A couple of my players who were coaching her weren't sure what to do with her. I mentioned that maybe they should just spend a little more time with her, get to know her, and sit with her at lunch or dinner. I told them that maybe she just needed a little extra love and attention.<br><br>The girls did a great job, and toward the end of the week she was much more engaged in the training and seemed to be having a lot of fun with her team.<br><br>A week or so after the camp, I received a thank-you note from her mom, explaining that this young girl had not wanted to come to camp. Her mom basically had made her attend. Obviously, this is one reason why she had gotten off to a rough start. Her mom went on to explain that her daughter loved soccer but was from an area where there weren't any members who played, and she was slowly losing interest in attending her Young Women group, seminary, and even church on Sunday. It was becoming a battle for her parents to keep her moving in the right direction.<br><br>Her parents thought maybe it would be good for her to be around some members of the Church who also loved soccer. Her mom was quick to point out that her daughter's experience at camp that week had been life changing. Her daughter had found new motivation, inspiration, and direction. She wanted to be like the campers and players on the team and go to BYU someday.<br><br>She continued to attend camp for several summers after that. Although she was never quite at a level to play college soccer, she was inspired at a young age to make good choices during her high school experience, and she ended up attending BYU.<br><br>You never know what light you might spark in others just through your kindness and your example. It is so important that we find ways in which we can inspire others. It is our responsibility. We are to use our gifts and our individual talents to share the light and bring the light to others. It is what we have been taught and counseled to do.<br><br>Our prophet recently challenged all of us to be an example and a light to the world. President Monson stated:<br><br><i>We become examples of the believers by living the gospel of Jesus Christ in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, and in purity....</i><br><br><i> ...As we follow the example of the Savior and live as He lived and as He taught, that light will burn within us and will light the way for others. </i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2015/10/be-an-example-and-a-light?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Be an Example and a Light</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2015]<br><h2><b>Remember Who You Are and What You Cameto Do</b></h2><br>Are you lighting the way for others? Are you an example of the Savior in your words, thoughts, and actions? These are questions we must ask ourselves on a daily basis. In order for us to hold up our light, we must believe and remember who we are, where we came from, and what we were sent here to do.<br><br>I have the opportunity several times throughout the year--whether at practice, before a game, or at halftime--to try to motivate, inspire, and remind the girls of what they are capable of and how amazing they are.<br><br>I have often thought about what simple and direct words of encouragement might come from our Heavenly Father to remind us how capable and amazing we are. Something most of you know and something I have come to learn over the years is that your mother and father are always your biggest fans. I know that our Heavenly Father and our Savior are our biggest fans. They want nothing more than for us to find happiness and peace and to return home to Them someday.<br><br>Here are some words of wisdom that I believe They want us to know, to repeat to ­ourselves, and toalways remember:<br><br>• You are a beautiful child of God, made inHis perfect image.<br>• You are loved, appreciated, and valued more than you will ever know.<br>• You are unique and capable of more ­success than you can ever imagine.<br>• Dream big dreams and find your passion--itis never too late.<br>• Never let fear hold you back.

<h1>s Believers in the Nation We Have Now - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear friends, I am here today because I believe the friendship of the Latter-day Saint and Catholic communities is important. The better we know each other's stories as religious minorities in this country, the better we can support each other in pursuing some of the vital issues we share. And that serves not just our beliefs and concerns but the health of our entire nation.<br><br>I want to begin by giving you some background on the Catholic experience in this country. I will do that through the lens of a particular Catholic bishop--me. I don't claim to speak for all or even most Americans who describe themselves as Catholic, but my comments do reflect the views of many Catholics who rank their Catholic faith as the most precious thing in their lives--and actually live that way.<br><h2><b>Our Task as Believers in America</b></h2><br>Let me start with a simple fact: Catholics have never<i> </i>entirely "fit" in America. We have tried, but the results are mixed. In fact, some years ago Stanley Hauerwas, the distinguished Protestant theologian, said that not only do we Catholics not fit in America, but we also <i>know</i> we don't fit in. And because we know, we are doubly eager to prove that we are more American than anybody else.<br><br>For Hauerwas, the proof is obvious. He wrote:<br><br><i> All you need to know .</i><i>.</i><i>. is that the FBI is made up of Catholics and Southerners. This is because Catholics and Southerners </i>[need]<i> to show they are more loyal than most Americans, since Southerners have a history of disloyalty and Americans fear that Catholics may owe their allegiance to some guy in Rome. That is why the FBI is given the task of examining graduates of Harvard and Yale--that is, high-culture Protestants who, of course, no longer believe in God--to see if they are loyal enough to be operatives for the CIA.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>Hauerwas was writing with a dry sense of humor, but what he said is largely true. America's roots are deeply Protestant and Americans are historically suspicious of Catholics. America is a child of the Refor­mation and the Enlighten­ment. Neither event had much use for the Catholic Church. At the time of the revolution, out of three ­million or more colonists, fewer than 25,000 were Catholics. In practice, Catholics were often tolerated because their numbers were so small. And some, like Charles Carroll, the only Catholic signer of the Declaration of Independence, were well educated and quite successful. But prejudice against Catholics was nonetheless widespread.<br><br>The really ugly anti-Catholic bigotry--churchburnings and looted convents--came later, in the nineteenth century, and it was linked, predictably, to the waves of poor immigrants who arrived from Catholic countries in Europe and the social strains they caused. Reading the official documents of America's Catholic bishops from the 1830s to the 1950s is revealing. They tell us two things: first, the bishops were determined to protect their people from public hatred and violence, and second, they were committed to proving their loyalty as good citizens integrated into the American mainstream. America's Catholic bishops wanted their members to be more loyal than anyone else, so they became zealously patriotic.<br><br>I was born in 1944, and I inherited that spirit of patriotism. It shaped the early years of my own life and my generation. More than eighty Catholic chaplains died in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. Five Catholic chaplains, all of them priests, won the Congressional Medal of Honor in those same wars. When I was growing up, the nation's service academies all had a disproportionate number of Catholic cadets. And even today--after the disaffection of the Catholic Left during Vietnam and the Catholic critics of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, including at times the Vatican--most American Catholics have a deep habit of loyalty to this country.<br><br>And for good reason: at its best, America is an exceptional nation. It is a country built on limited government, the rule of law, and economic opportunity. Personal rights and liberties are still important here. They actually mean something. And our public life, while nonsectarian, is--or at least was--founded and grounded in a broadly biblical morality.<br><br>Here is why I mention this. I have a friend of many years--a man committed to his wife and family who is well educated and very Catholic--whose son attended West Point. Over the years he has taken great pride in his son and in the ideals of the military academy. He is still proud of his son, and he still admires the legacy of West Point.<br><br>But he would never send another child to a service academy. He simply doesn't believe that America, as it currently stands, is the same country he once loved. And, in his words, it is not worth risking a son or a daughter to fight for it. The America he sees now--an America of abortion, confused sex, language police, entitlements, consumer and corporate greed, clownish politics, and government bullying of religious groups, like the Little Sisters of the Poor--is different in kind<i>,</i> not merely in degree, from the nation he thought he knew. It is no longer a country he considers his own. And keep in mind that this is a man of the cultural right, in which support for the military has typically been strong.<br><br>Now those are harsh feelings. But I do understand them.<br><br>There is a lot of talk in Christian circles today about the need to protect believing families from a flawed culture that often seems to be getting worse, and the talk frequently turns to a thing called the "Benedict Option." It is an idea worth explaining.<br><br>Benedict of Nursia was a sixth-century Italian saint and the founder of Western monasticism. The son of a Roman nobleman, he left Rome as a young man for the peace of the countryside. He eventually founded twelve religious communities that grew into the worldwide Benedictine order of monks we have today. So the core of the modern Benedict Option involves finding a way to preserve people from the most dysfunctional elements of the secular world--either by building new communities or withdrawing mentally, or even physically, from the public culture around us.<br><br>It is a compelling idea. Critics don't do it justice when they write it off as a form of escapism.<br><br>But for me, as a bishop--and I have heard this from many other believers--I think an even better model is Saint Augustine, who led the fifth-century church in the North African city of Hippo Regius. Augustine lived and worked in the thick of his people. As a bishop, he engaged in the problems of the society around him every day--even as the Roman world fell apart and his own city came under siege.<br><br>I think we need to think and act in the same way Augustine did. Our task as believers, whatever our religious tradition, is to witness our love for God and for each other <i>in the time and place God puts us in. </i>That means we have duties--first to the City of God but also to the city of man. It means working with all our energy to make our nation whole and good, even as we keep our expectations modest and even when we experience criticism and failure. And finally, it means realizing that none of us can do this work alone, which brings us to this moment now--here, together, today.<br><br>Exactly six years ago, a great mentor and friend of mine came to this campus--Cardinal Francis George of Chicago. He spoke about Catholics and Latter-day Saints as partners in the defense of religious freedom. But he went further than that. He noted how often the LDS and Catholic concerns about marriage, family, poverty, the degrading effects of pornography, and the sanctity of the unborn child coincide. He also acknowledged that the differences between our two religious communities are large--and ignoring them serves neither God nor the truth.<br><br>But in his remarks here at BYU in 2010, Cardinal George stressed that despite those differences, "the possibilities of deepening our friendships through common witness and dialogue" are too important to underestimate and too urgently needed to let lapse.<sup>2</sup><br><br>Cardinal George died just last year. He was one of the great Catholic minds of my generation, and he had an enduring respect for the LDS leaders and believers he knew.<br><br>I want to build on his words today by doing two things with the time that has been given me. First<i>,</i> I will offer some thoughts as a Catholic pastor about how and why we got to where we are as a nation. Second<i>,</i> I will talk briefly about what we need to do, in mutually supportive ways, as people of faith going forward.<br><h2><b>How and Why Did We Get Where We Are?</b></h2><br><i> </i>While speaking last July, the political scholar Charles Murray argued that "the American project, as originally defined [by the Founders], is dead. [Not] dying, but dead."<sup>3</sup> Those are strong words. They pretty well take the air out of the room. And they come from a source--the author of studies like <i>Losing Ground</i> and <i>Coming Apart--</i>that we can't easily dismiss.<br><br>I should note here that Murray is a libertarian. Catholic thought has some serious problems with the libertarian approach to social philosophy. But that doesn't allow us to ignore his point, because much of Murray's research and analysis is high grade.<br><br>For Murray, the America of the Founders is dead because we killed it. We strangled it with a regulatory state that expands by its own inertia. It creates dependency and accumulates power as it provides services. As it grows, it eats into the space for personal liberty and rights, and it slowly replaces the authority of the people's elected representatives with an administrative machine. A good example is Obamacare. Congress passes a national healthcare act. Then the administration "interprets" the law to impose a contraceptive mandate that deliberately attacks the conscience of many religious believers and ministries.<br><br>There is obvious merit in Murray's argument. What we had, once upon a time, was limited government. And that was a good thing. The government we have now is something quite different and much more unsettling.<br><br>I do wonder if a continent-wide nation of 320 million people can really work in a globalized age without a big federal footprint. In any case, the changes in our country have deeper and more complex roots than just the growth of big government.<br><br>A simple example is demography<i>.</i> America was founded by white, Anglo-Saxon Protestants. They were people steeped in English common law. Today Americans are vastly more numerous. They are also a lot more diverse. Many trace their heritage to cultures that have no experience of Christianity, the Reformation, the Enlightenment, or English common law. No one should fear that. America thrives on diversity. It needs immigration to constantly renew itself.<br><br>So demographic change is a very<i> </i>good<i> </i>thing, as long as some mechanism exists in society to weave people together into a nation with common ideals--ideals that are organic to our past and higher than our personal appetites. America is an idea, and the idea needs to have a moral substance greater than "every man for himself" or "do whatever you want, as long as it doesn't hurt somebody else." That is a hunting license, not a national purpose.<br><br>Another example is legal theory<i>.</i> Until recently, American law sought to apply a code of objective truth about good and evil to human affairs. This truth was understood to be written into the design of creation as a kind of natural law. All<i> </i>things, including the human person, were seen as having a nature and a purpose--a <i>telos.</i> As a result, human laws presumed a built-in moral order to the world. They presumed the "givenness" of nature, and the givenness of nature implied a Giver and a Creator--in other words, nature's God. The natural rights we take for granted--life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness--are inalienable only because they are guaranteed by nature's God, a God who stands above any human authority.<br><br>In most of our law schools, our public discourse, and our courts today, that idea is all but dead. Today's so-called "positive law" doesn't reflect and apply some higher order of justice. It invents<i> </i>justice by discovering new rights and juggling interests, and that means no rights are inalienable--whether our political class wants to admit it or not. To put it less kindly, asort of fundamental lawlessness now governs our thinking about the law. In a nation like the United States, where the law is one of the main adhesives of our unity, that has very big implications.<br><br>Here is another example of how we got where we are: technology<i>.</i> Technology has played a big role--the decisive role--in changing our economic lives, often for the better. But it has also changed how Americans think. To put it another way, we use our tools but our tools also use us. In half a century the United States has gone from a manufacturing economy based on production to a knowledge economy based on consumption<i>. </i>The impact on our imaginations and our behaviors has been huge. Production is a joint affair. It requires guilds, unions, and corporations; it needs assembly lines, heavy industry, and communities. Consumption is a private affair. It requires only the self.<br><br>This difference between production and consumption is what sociologist Zygmunt Bauman called the gulf between "solid" societies and "liquid modern life."<sup>4</sup> Older, solid societies, which are based on production, find their security in ownership, delayed gratification, and rational organization. They seek methodical progress, and they put a high value on durable goods. Liquid, or consumer-based, societies--creatures of the tech revolution and its rapid rate of change--feed on "incessant new beginnings"<sup>5</sup> and experiences.<br><br>What that means is this: in liquid ­consumer-<br>based life, the biggest fear is what is called "drag ­coefficient"<sup>6</sup>--the burden of having to live with ­obsolete or bad product choices. Inevitably, this approach to life shapes personal relationships. As Bauman noted, once the pattern "to reject and replace an object of consumption ... is extended to partnership relations," the partners themselves become disposable consumer objects.<sup>7</sup> In this sense, nothing is more liquid than no-fault divorce, which is now common across the country.<br><br>I could go on with a list of examples for a long time, but before we turn to the last part of my remarks, I want to note just one more factor that divides the America we now have from the America we remember--or at least think we remember. That factor, of course, is<i> </i>sex--sex and relationships, sex and marriage, sex and the family, sex and human meaning.<br><br>To borrow a thought from C.S. Lewis, the human person is a kind of "amphibian"--a creature made by God for this world <i>and</i> the next, a blending of spirit and flesh that gives the body special dignity.<sup>8</sup> The body is not modeling clay. It is not raw material at the service of our wills, and there is something profoundly sad about watching a person mutilate his or her body in the hope of creating a new identity. The body has a purpose. Our sexuality is ordered to creating and raising new life and to the mutual support of a man and a woman in a covenant oflove.<br><br>My point is this: sexual confusion isn't unique to our age, but the scope of it is. No society can sustain itself for long if marriage and the family fall apart on a mass scale. And that is exactly what is happening as we gather here today. The Supreme Court's <i>Obergefell</i> decision, approving same-sex marriage last June, was a legal disaster. But it didn't happen in a vacuum. It fits very comfortably with trends in our culture that go back many decades, even before the 1960s and the sexual revolution. It is useful to read or reread Wilhelm Reich's book from 1936, <i>The Sexual Revolution. </i>Reich argued that a real revolution can only be made at the level of sexual freedom, and it needs to begin by wiping away institutions like marriage, family, and traditional sexual morality.<br><br>What's interesting about Reich's work is that, eighty years ago<i>,</i> he saw the United States as the most promising place for that kind of revolution, despite its Puritan history.<sup>9</sup> The reason is simple: Americans have a deep streak of individualism, a distrust of authority, and a big appetite for self-invention. As religion loses its hold on people's behavior, all of these instincts accelerate. The trouble is that once the genie is out of the bottle, sexual freedom goes in directions and takes on shapes that nobody imagined. And ultimately it leads to questions about who a person is and what it means to be human.<br><br>Now all this is a pretty sober view of where we find ourselves. But we should remember two things.<br><br>Here is the first thing: Peter Drucker, the great expert on business and management, liked to say that every success bears the seeds of failure. What he meant is that people who succeed tend to forget that they are fallible. They get overconfident. They get lazy or vain. They forget that what worked yesterday may not work tomorrow. And that leads very quickly in a bad direction--even for nations. But the inverse of Drucker's warning is also true: every setback and failure bears the seeds of success--<i>if we learn the right lessons from it.</i><br><br>Here is the second thing: Just as optimism is very different from hope, a little pessimism--Iprefer to call it realism--is a long way from hopelessness. <i>Optimism</i> is a kind word for wishful thinking. "Hope," as Georges Bernanos liked to say, "is despair overcome,"<sup>10</sup> and it is built on the granite of faith. People who really believe in a loving God are always people of hope and the joy that comes with it.<br><br>Augustine, who was a pessimist, could be a very hard critic of the Roman world, but in his sermons he called this earth a smiling place.<sup>11</sup> Portions of his work read like a litany to the goodness and beauty of creation.<sup></sup> His biographer, Peter Brown, described him as a man immoderately in love with the world. This is all true. And the reason for it is simple: Augustine loved the world because he was in love with the Author of the beauty and goodness he found there.<br><br>What does that mean for us today? Augustine would tell us that the real problem with the world is bigger than climate change or abortion or poverty--or even two leading presidential candidates who seem equally distasteful--and it is much more stubborn. Thereal problem with the world is us.<br><br>As Augustine said in his sermons, it is no use complaining about the times because <i>we are the times.</i><sup>12</sup><i> </i>How we live shapes them. And when we finally learn to fill our hearts with something more than the noise and narcotics of the wounded societies we helped create, when we finally let our hearts rest in God as Augustine did, then--and<i> only</i> then--the world will begin to change, because God will use the witness of our lives to change it.<br><br>A few weeks ago, as I was working on my remarks for today, I got an email from a friend at Villanova University in Philadelphia. Professor Thomas Smith teaches in Villanova's Humanities and Political Science Departments. He also directs the university's honors program. He is a wonderful scholar, husband, and father and a very serious Catholic. I want you to hear what he wrote:<br><br><i> </i>[Archbishop,]<i> I visited BYU last year to give a talk and spent considerable time with Mormon families and went to one of their Sunday services. Their theology is obviously very different from ours. But their culture is amazing, very intentional, and full oflove and solidarity.</i><br><br><i> One thing that really struck me: they have a palpable sense that they belong to a global church. Primarily, this comes from the mission work they have to do. But it gives their participation in the church a much wider scope--they're not as obsessed with how they fit into American culture because their horizon is just wider and bigger.</i><br><br><i> We</i> [meaning Catholics]<i> absolutely need to learn from that. We have a much larger global church, and we need to participate in that more fully and intentionally. Young Catholics in the U.S. need to meet and become friends with serious young Catholics in Nigeria or Argentina or Italy and so on. Older ones do too. We need to engage, or reengage, the global church in a way that leavens everyone's culture.</i><br><br>That is high praise from a good man. I would add only this: never neglect to nourish your roots and your identity as a university grounded in faith. Faith in God is the road to life. Faith in a loving God is the light that illuminates and gives meaning to human reason and to all of life. Real excellence is a quality of the soul<i>.</i> And to borrow a line from the Gospel of Luke, the soul of this university and the soul of each and every one of us here today should "magnify the Lord" (Luke 1:46).<br><br>I'll leave you with one final thought.<br><br>In 1973 the neurologist Oliver Sacks published a book called <i>Awakenings.</i> It is the story of an experiment Sacks ran in 1969. Sacks gave the drug L-Dopa to a group of patients who had been catatonic for decades. The results were dramatic. The patients literally woke up to a much higher level of understanding, functioning, and communication. And they discovered a world that had greatly changed since their original illness.<br><br>The results were temporary. All the patients eventually slipped back into silence or developed other medical problems. But while they had their window of clarity they saw the world <i>as it really is,</i> and they experienced it with all of the wonder, suffering, fear, and joy that give life its grandeur.<br><h2><b>What Do We Need to Do as People of Faith Going Forward?</b></h2><br>We come back to the question I asked earlier: <i>What do we need to do as people of faith going forward?</i><br><br><i> </i>We can begin by remembering those patients. We need to wake each other up to see the world and our nation as they really are--the good along with the evil. We need to support each other in the work for the religious freedom we share. We need to treat each other as friends, not as enemies or strangers. We need to learn from each other's successes and mistakes. And, unlike the patients of Dr. Sacks, we need to keep each other from slipping back into the narcotic haze that so much of America's everyday life has become.<br><br>To put it another way: it is important for our own integrity and the integrity of our country to fight for our convictions in the public square. Anything less is a kind of cowardice. But the greater task is to live what we claim to believe by our actions--fidelity to God, love for spouse and children, loyalty to friends, generosity to the poor, honesty and mercy in dealing with others, trust in the goodness of people, and discipline and humility in demanding the most from ourselves.<br><br>These things sound like pieties, and that is all they are--until we try to live them. Then their cost and their difficulty remind us that we create a culture of human dignity in the measure that we give our lives to others. Nations change when people change, and people change through the witness of other people--people like each of you here today. You make the future. You build it stone by stone with the choices you make.<br><br>One of the unofficial mottos of Brigham Young University is "Enter to learn; go forth to serve." "Go forth to serve"--it is a better exit line than anything I could ever write. Dear friends, go forth to serve<i>.</i> Serve the poor. Help the weak. Protect the unborn children. Fight for your right to love and serve God and for others to do the same. Defend the dignity of marriage and the family and witness their meaning and hope to others by the example of your lives.<br><br>If you do that, you will inspire others to do the same. And you will discover in your own life what it means to be fully human.<br><br>Thank you, and God bless you.<br><br><i>Most Reverend Charles J. Chaput, O.F.M.

<h1>ish and Destinies - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning, brothers and sisters. Thank you for participating in the devotional today. I know it is a busy time of year, with papers, projects, and finals pending. I promise to do my best to reward your time investment with something helpful to you now and throughout your life.<br><br>According to a very fun website<sup>1</sup> that I found, it was thirty-six years, one month, and ten days ago that, as a freshman student at BYU, I sat where you are sitting today. I listened carefully as President Ezra Taft Benson, then president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, gave a talk titled "Fourteen Fundamentals in Following the Prophet."<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/ezra-taft-benson_fourteen-fundamentals-following-prophet/"><sup>2</sup></a> He shared how we could more faithfully follow the living prophets and better keep the commandments of God.<br><br>The Spirit was strong that day, and I was motivated by President Benson's remarks. I thought to myself, "I am going to follow his counsel to be a better follower of the prophets and to be more faithful in keeping the commandments of God. But I can do better than that. From this point on, I'm not even going to make any mistakes!"<br><br>Now, I know all of you are a lot smarter than I was as a freshman. You can see the impossibility, and perhaps the silliness, of my well-intentioned commitment.<br><br>As I was exiting the devotional, I paused to use the restroom. I was concentrating so intently on my new commitment--to not make any mistakes--that I didn't notice the cute little stick figure wearing a triangular dress on the restroom door. It wasn't until I had turned the corner that I realized where I was. There, standing in front of a large mirror, was a young woman brushing her long, black hair. I hadn't even made it out of this very building before Ihad failed at my new commitment!<br><br>Now, as an aside, I am still grateful to this day to that young woman for not calling for security. Can you imagine the look on the security officers' faces as I tried to explain that I was concentrating so hard on never making another mistake that had I made a mistake?<br><br>In my mind's eye I can see and hear the security officers as they would have looked at each other and said, "Yeah, right! Book 'em, Danno!"<br><br>Today I come to you hopefully a little wiser to share some counsel on something I have worked on ever since that day.<br><h2><b>The Starfish Story and Our Thoughts</b></h2><br>We are told in Proverbs 23:7 that "as he thinketh in his heart, so is he." Related to that isthis old saying:<br><br><i>Sow a thought, and you reap an act;</i><br><br><i>Sow an act, and you reap a habit;</i><br><br><i>Sow a habit, and you reap a character;</i><br><br><i>Sow a character, and you reap a destiny.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, our destiny is to live eternally with our Savior in the presence of our Heavenly Father. Because of the very real covenants we make at baptism and in the temple, our destiny also includes living eternally with a spouse, children, and extended family. Truly, families can be forever. The scriptures teach us that the Lord Himself says that His work and glory is "to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man."<sup>4</sup><br><br>As members of Christ's restored Church, we should try to understand the actuality of eternal life and the reality of our personal destiny. Our destiny, as grandiose and incomprehensible as it is to fully understand, begins with the tiniest of individual thoughts.<br><br>These little things we call thoughts accompany us throughout almost every moment of every day of our entire lives. They can be small but immensely and intensely powerful. They will ultimately determine our character and our destiny. Thoughts must be consciously and carefully monitored and directed so that the acts, habits, and character that surely follow them are consistent with the commandments ofGod and lead to the destiny that is inherently ours.<br><br>You may have heard of the starfish story. It has been adapted numerous times by numerous people from Loren Eiseley's essay titled "The Star Thrower."<sup>5</sup> Based on these adaptations, the story goes something like this:<br><br>There was an old man walking along the seashore. In the distance he saw a young person doing something near the water's edge. As the old man approached, he saw that it was a boy surrounded by numerous starfish that had washed ashore and were lying on the sand. The old man watched, intrigued, as the boy picked up starfish after starfish and threw them as far as he could over the breaking surf.<br><br>After some time the old man approached the boy and said, "Son, do you realize there are thousands of starfish on this shore? Certainly what you are doing can make no real difference."<br><br>After respectfully listening, the boy reached down and picked up another starfish and hurled it into the ocean. Then, looking thoughtfully at the old man, the boy said, "It made a difference to that one." And he continued to throw more starfish back into the water.<br><br>Now, all of us can benefit from the excellent principles in this story. Doing something good against what seem like insurmountable odds does make a difference.<br><br>But today I would like for us to create a different kind of starfish story. This story has a very special purpose with an eternal application. In this story you are the young man or woman at the ocean's edge. The shore represents your mind and, ultimately, your life, which comprises thoughts, acts, habits, and character. The starfish in this story represent unwanted or inappropriate thoughts that sometimes come as you try to transition from a "carnal, sensual, and devilish"<sup>6</sup> nature to a state in which you possess the same character as your Savior Jesus Christ.<br><br>It is possible that some starfish in your new story aren't necessarily good or bad thoughts; they can be time wasters that keep you from thinking about or doing something positive, productive, or purposeful. For some of you the starfish may represent negative thoughts about roommates, Church or family members, coworkers, or others. For some, starfish will be thoughts of revenge, resentment, or reclusiveness. Perhaps some starfish will be negative thoughts related to self-image, self-worth, or even self-destructive behaviors. Some starfish thoughts may be motivated by the pursuit of power, fame, fortune, or sex. There may be starfish representing thoughts related to immoral behavior with someone from either the opposite or same gender.<br><br>I cannot represent all types of unwanted or sinful thoughts, but as you consider your story, I invite you to reflect on those thoughts that you know you struggle with. In all of these examples, it is possible that the starfish have already been sown into acts, habits, or even the foundation of your character--but not yet into your destiny!<br><br>You are standing on the shore of your life. The waves bring what you allow into your life. With each incoming wave there is the possibility that a new or a reoccurring starfish washes ashore. Typically, your desire is to have a clean oceanfront. It is beautiful when it is clean. And when it is clean, you feel comfortable inviting others there. It is where you want your friends and family to be. It feels good, and typically you want it to remain that way.<br><br>But there may be times when you find yourself actually inviting certain starfish onto your shore. There may be some starfish that are secretly your favorites. They are exciting and enticing when they first arrive, but you soon realize--in fact, you may have known for a long time--that they clutter your shore and quickly decay into an ugly mess.<br><br>It is both our challenge as well as our opportunity in this life to throw our starfish back into the sea. We need to fling them as far as we can over the breaking water so that they will not come back again.<br><h2><b>Controlling Our Thoughts</b></h2><br>Having pure, positive, and appropriate thoughts will affect all aspects of your life. It will affect who you marry, what kind of spouse you will be, and how you teach and raise your children. It will affect what kind of job you have and how successful you are in your employment. It will affect your testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ, your faithfulness in the Church and to your callings, and your commitment to covenants you have made or will make with God. In short, having pure, positive, and appropriate thoughts will determine your life and your eternities.<br><br>Perhaps you may, appropriately, ask how to do it: How do I replace negative or inappropriate thoughts with pure or positive ones that lead to good acts, good habits, and good character? It is especially challenging for us to control our thoughts when we live in a world of ever-increasing "'in-your-face,' carnal confrontiveness," as termed by Elder Neal A. Maxwell.<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2002/10/encircled-in-the-arms-of-his-love?lang=eng"><sup>7</sup></a><br><br>President Boyd K. Packer of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles gave some guidance on how we can accomplish this task:<br><br><i> Probably the greatest challenge to people of any age, particularly young people, and the most difficult thing you will face in mortal life is to learn to control your thoughts. As a man "thinketh in his heart, so is he." (Prov. 23:7.) One who can control his thoughts has conquered himself. . . .</i><br><br><i>This is what I would teach you. Choose from among the sacred music of the Church a favorite hymn, one with words that are uplifting and music that is reverent, one that makes you feel something akin to inspiration. . . .</i><br><br><i> Now, use this hymn as the place for your thoughts to go. Make it your emergency channel. Whenever you find these shady actors have slipped from the sidelines of your thinking onto the stage of your mind, put on this record, as it were.</i><br><br><i> As the music begins and as the words form in your thoughts, the unworthy ones will slip shamefully away. It will change the whole mood on the stage of your mind. Because it is uplifting and clean, the baser thoughts will disappear. For while virtue, by choice, </i><b><i>will not </i></b><i>associate with filth, evil </i><b><i>cannot</i></b><i> tolerate the presence of light.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1973/10/inspiring-music-worthy-thoughts?lang=eng"><sup>8</sup></a><br><br>There are many strategies you can use to control your thoughts. The critical thing is to consciously recognize an unwanted thought and acknowledge that it will lead to actions that lead to habits that lead to character that leads to--eventually--your destiny. Once recognized, replace the unwanted thought with something uplifting. The void created by removing an unwanted thought must be replaced by something of value.<br><br>One person shared with me that she replaces inappropriate thoughts by reflecting upon her temple covenants. She ponders on the words of the covenants and their sacred and eternal meaning. She reflects on the security these covenants personally bring to her, to her marriage, and to her young children. She also ponders on the promised and eternal blessings associated with each covenant.<br><br>A returned missionary once shared that he tries to imagine the sublime glory of the Savior. This has helped him replace undesirable thoughts with virtuous ones that elevate his mind to a holier place. He tries to imagine what it was like for Joseph Smith when he saw God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ in Their glory. He imagines what it would feel like to gaze into the Savior's eyes and to feel of His approving love.<br><br>A young woman once shared that when she recognizes that an unwanted thought has crept onto the stage of her mind, immediate prayer provides her a safe refuge. She found that as she focuses on sincerely speaking to her Heavenly Father, the unwanted thoughts seem to melt away, and she feels peace as the Holy Spirit prompts her in her prayer.<br><br>All of these methods can help us control our thoughts. I have created a personal reminder to help myself that I call the five Rs:<br><br>1. <b>Recognize</b> when a thought is inappropriate, unworthy, or unwanted.<br><br>2. <b>Remove</b> the thought as soon as you ­recognize it.<br><br>3. <b>Replace</b> the thought with something pure, positive, or productive.<br><br>4. <b>Repent</b> immediately when necessary.<br><br>5. <b>Repeat</b> the process as often as required for as long as required.<br><br>The blessings associated with keeping your shoreline clean and unencumbered of starfish are many. The Doctrine and Covenants promises that if you have charity toward all and if you let virtue garnish your thoughts unceasingly,<br><br><i>then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.</i><br><br><i> The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>Another way to construct these scriptural blessings is to approach the Lord in prayer, asking for whatever righteous needs or desires you have, and to expect with faith and confidence that the Lord will hear and answer your prayer. It means that your understanding of the mysteries of heaven can expand to where faith becomes knowledge. It means that the Holy Ghost will carefully lead you by constant personal revelation to truth, wisdom, and understanding. It means that you will, with legitimacy, be able to lead, teach, and inspire family, friends, and others who love, respect, and seek for your influence--forever! It ultimately sets in place your eternal destiny--and all this because you choose charity and virtuous thoughts.<br><br>In a talk during the priesthood session of the October 1983 general conference, equally applicable to all members of the Church, President Benson said:<br><br><i>A priesthood holder is </i><b><i>virtuous.</i></b><i> Virtuous behavior implies that he has pure thoughts and clean actions. He will not lust in his heart, for to do so is to "deny the faith" and to lose the Spirit. (See D&amp;amp;C 42:23.)</i><br><br><i> He will not commit adultery "nor do anything like unto it." (D&amp;amp;C 59:6.) This means fornication, homosexual behavior, self-abuse, child molestation, or any other sexual perversions.</i><br><br><i> Virtue is akin to holiness--an attribute of godliness.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1983/11/what-manner-of-men-ought-we-to-be?lang=eng"><sup>10</sup></a><br><h2><b>Cleansing Our Thoughts Through theAtonement</b></h2><br>Like the boy in the starfish story, our shore may be covered with dozens or perhaps even hundreds or thousands of starfish. We cannot remove them all alone. Fortunately, we do not have to. We can have our shores washed clean through the cleansing power of Christ's Atonement. As part of the repentance process we must say no to the temptation and we must say yes to Christ's cleansing blood of Gethsemane and the cross at Calvary.<br><br>Through diligent and sincere repentance andthrough receiving the gift of the Holy Spirit, we can have, as it were, a wave of the ocean roll onto the shores of our lives and cleansethem completely--not only of the unwanted starfish but of all debris. He who has power to calm the sea also has power to cleanse its shores. For each of us, this cleansing should be a continuous process, as rhythmic to our souls as the waves are to the sea. It is the Atonement of Christ that makes possible the ultimate tidal wave of complete redemption.<br><br>To receive complete redemption, we must consistently yield to the quiet but clearly discernible whisperings of the Holy Spirit. Failing to follow these promptings never leads to happiness.<sup>11</sup> Yielding to the promptings of the Holy Spirit provides both the path to change and the ability to change.<br><br>Baptized members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have been given the gift of the Holy Ghost. To enjoy the benefits of this gift, we must both receive and "apply unto it."<sup>12</sup> As we consistently listen for and heed the promptings of the Holy Spirit, we will experience what Alma referred to as "a mighty change [of] heart."<sup>13</sup> We read in the Book of Mormon, "Behold, he changed their hearts; yea, he awakened them out of a deep sleep, and they awoke unto God."<sup>14</sup> Alma continued:<br><br><i>I ask of you, my brethren </i>[and sisters]<i> of the church, have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>Alma also explained that in order to experience this mighty change in our hearts, we must also be humble and willing to trust God.<sup>16</sup> As we trust God, humble ourselves, and listen for and heed the promptings of the Holy Spirit with exactness, we become enabled to do all things the Lord commands, including sanctifying our thoughts.<sup>17</sup> This sanctification helps us adhere to the solemn covenants we make at baptism and in the temple. In turn, adhering to these solemn covenants helps to change our hearts and transitions us into a Christlike character.<br><br>President Benson said:<br><br><i>We are to emulate the character of the Savior.</i><br><br><i> And what is His character?</i><br><br><i> . . . You are familiar with this verse in section 4 of the Doctrine and Covenants... :</i><br><br><i> "Remember faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility, diligence." (D&amp;amp;C 4:6.)</i><br><br><i> These are the virtues we are to emulate. This is the Christlike character. . . .</i><br><br><i> Never in the history of mankind has there been a greater need for men </i>[and women]<i> to be united in their determination and actions to be Christlike in character.</i><br><br><i> To follow Him is to emulate His character.</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>When living a sanctified, Christlike life, we will lose the "disposition to do evil,"<sup>19</sup> we will have "clean hands, and a pure heart,"<sup>20</sup> and the image of God will be "engraven upon [our] countenances."<sup>21</sup> Again, this begins by listening carefully and consistently to the Holy Spirit's clear and discernible promptings and then by heeding them with complete exactness.<br><br>By listening to these promptings, we can recognize and replace undesirable thoughts, whether immoral, unkind, self-destructive, or simply unproductive. We can replace them with charitable thoughts consistent with the admonition of Paul:<br><br><i>Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, </i><b><i>think on these things.</i></b><sup>22</sup><br><br>I believe Paul knew that by thinking on these things, Christlike acts, habits, and character would surely follow.<br><br>Elder Bruce R. McConkie said:<br><br><i> Our goal as mortals is to gain the mind of Christ, to believe what he believes, </i><b><i>to think what he thinks</i></b><b><i>,</i></b><i> to say what he says, to do what he does, and to be as he is.</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/bruce-r-mcconkie_seven-deadly-heresies/"><sup>23</sup></a><br><br>In Alma 12:14 we are taught that if we allow inappropriate thoughts to remain in our minds, they will condemn us. However, when we think on things as Paul outlined, our thoughts will also justify us. Our thoughts will either lead us to godliness or they will destroy us.<br><br>King Benjamin ended his address to his people in the land of Zarahemla with this warning:<br><br><i>If ye do not watch yourselves, </i><b><i>and your thoughts,</i></b><i> and your words, and your deeds, and observe the commandments of God, and continue in the faith ..., even unto the end of your lives, ye must perish. And now, O man, remember, and perish not.</i><sup>24</sup><br><h2><b>Developing the Character of Christ</b></h2><br>As a summary of my remarks today, remember that your acts, habits, character, and destiny will flow from even the smallest of your thoughts. Through constant effort and by the grace of Christ, you can control your thoughts by removing inappropriate or unwanted thoughts and by replacing them with thoughts that are "virtuous, lovely, or of good report."<sup>24</sup> To do this, you must listen carefully to the promptings of the Holy Spirit and then follow those promptings with exactness.<br><br>Your heart can be changed, you can be sanctified, and you can ultimately possess the character of Christ, which is consistent for all who bear His name.<br><br>I hope you leave this devotional encouraged. I know you can do it! As I mentioned earlier in my remarks, I left a similar devotional address more than thirty-six years ago with a commitment to no longer make mistakes. I confess: I have failed miserably! But in continuing to try and by applying the Lord's Atonement, I have also succeeded wonderfully. Perhaps today is your day to start--to change your thoughts and your life, for good and for forever.<br><br>Just like me, you may not even exit these doors before you fail. To you I say: Don't worry and don't give up! All that matters is the starfish lying right at your feet. Follow the five Rs. Reach down, pick the starfish up, and throw it out. Replace it with a pure and virtuous thought. Repent immediately if you need to. Then repeat these steps again and again and yet again.<br><br>Just like the starfish in the original story, these actions will make a difference to that one thought. In time, you will one day look down at the shoreline of your life and see it washed clean, purified, and sanctified, and in the water's reflection you will see the image of Christ in your countenance.<br><br>I testify that this is real, this is doable, and, most important, this is your destiny. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Jeffery N.

<h1> Story - to the New BYU Alumni - BYU Speeches</h1>

<br>
Wow, graduates! You look great. I have never stood before an audience as full of promise and potential as this one. As president of the BYU Alumni Association, it is my privilege to hereby confer on each of you graduates lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. I offer you congratulations and welcome you into this great association of more than 420,000 alumni.<br><br>Our alumni association has an ad campaign that prompts us to remember our time at BYU with the tagline "Remember when; ­remember why." We all have a BYU story. Recently I asked some of you graduates why you chose toattend BYU. Your answers included:<br><br><i> Both of my parents went to BYU. Hearing their stories and seeing the relationships they built here made me want to have that experience for myself.</i><br><br><i> I could have gone to any university in the country to learn how to read andwrite and think well, but it is at BYU that I learned to center my storytelling around the familiar ideas of charity and patience.</i><br><br><i> I chose BYU because of the concentration of goodness I found when I first visited the campus.</i><br><br>I can relate to these reasons. I fell in love with BYU at a young age, when my family lived in Heritage Halls for a couple of summers while my dad worked on his doctorate.<br><br>But some of you might have had very different reasons for attending BYU. My husband came here on an athletic scholarship. He knew very little about Mormons then. Imagine his surprise on the first fast Sunday when the Cannon Center did not open for breakfast.<br><br>Regardless of why we chose to attend this university, we all now have in common a BYU experience. Here are some of the fond memories that you graduates have shared with me:<br><br><i> Professors knew my name, wanted to hear about my life, and cared about me as a person.</i><br><br><i> I will always be grateful for my semester in Washington, DC, and talking to generations of alumni there who showed me what I could do because of my BYU degree.</i><br><br><i>We would meet for church every Sunday in the Clyde Building foyer. I will never forget ­watching from the long windows as the snow fell when I received the prompting that I should serve a mission.</i><br><br>Our BYU stories have played a major role in shaping us. We all leave this place with memories and experiences that impact our future for good and serve as a springboard for the next phase of life. The alumni association is really all about this next phase. Our purpose is to help you stay connected to BYU. We want to know how your story continues. You can tell us your story at rise.byu.edu. A visit there will introduce you to inspiring alumni and give you the opportunity to share your own personal and professional experiences and successes. We want to see the realization of the potential for good contained in this audience.<br><br>Congratulations, graduates. Your fellow alumni are rooting for you. We love you and want the best for you. As you go out into the world, remember your BYU story and stay ­connected for good.<br><br><i>Amy Fennegan was president of the BYU Alumni Association when this commencement address was given on 21 April 2016.</i><br><br>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>and Staying Connected - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Dear brothers and sisters, it is an honor to accompany you this afternoon in these graduation ceremonies. This is a great day! It is a hinge point in your lives for you graduates. I join with your family members and friends and of course with the administration, faculty, and staff of Brigham Young University in congratulating you for the mighty accomplishment that this day acknowledges. We recognize the time, toil, and commitment your efforts have required. We hope you feel the satisfaction of having done something hard, something worth doing, and something that has made more of you than you were when you first entered a classroom here a few years ago.<br><br>Kathy and I have seven children, five of whom graduated from BYU, as did two sons-in-law and two daughters-in-law. Your graduating class includes our nephew, who now goes on to dental school. It also includes the daughter and son-in-law of one of my former law partners from California. My secretary's son and daughter-in-law are graduating today, as are the children of cousins, friends, and relatives. These connections make today even more special and memorable for us. We are very happy for each of you and express our personal congratulations to them and to you aswe honor all of you.<br><br>Like many of you, I do most of my reading of current events, the news, and commentary about the news online. Every morning I read from several news sources and sometimes watch news stories online. I found that doing so was helpful professionally as a lawyer, but it has been essential in my Church service as well. This reading frequently leads me to ideas that can be used to illustrate gospel principles in sermons, usually by providing instructive examples.<br><br>Some of the examples are about good and brave people doing noble or courageous things. They are stories that inspire. Other news accounts fall in the opposite category. They also have value.<br><br>This afternoon I want to share with you something other than a news story that I saw online. It was an advertisement. As you well know, in order to access some news stories online, we sometimes first have to watch short advertisements. Most of you have seen your share of such advertisements. You also know that you have to see some advertisements multiple times before they are replaced by newones.<br><br>A recent advertisement I saw a few times caught my attention. It was an ad for a smartphone, and it showed a group of twenty-somethings out on the town at night. They looked happy as they moved across the screen. They were laughing and talking together in a close circle of friendship. As I recall, there was no cell phone actually in view. Instead, the narrator praised the virtues of staying connected. I inferred, as I think it was intended I would, that these young people were having a terrific time together because their phones connected them to each other in some almost magical way. Had they not had their phones, their happy night just wouldn't have been the same. I am confident that is what I was supposed to conclude. The advertisement ended with another image: a close-up of an attractive young woman looking intently at her phone with a slight sort-of Mona Lisa smile and a knowing, purposeful, confident look on herface.<br><br>I thought the message this advertisement conveyed was subtle and fascinating: Purchase this product and you too will be "connected." You will be young, attractive, socially accepted, up-to-date, and in charge of your life. Things will be good. You will be happy, have friends, and have fun.<br><br>I wondered, after seeing the ad a few times, does all of that really come from owning the right smartphone? I thought about how real connection has so much more weight and substance than what a cell phone offers, no matter how smart it is. Real interpersonal connection is so much more transcendent than the video of a carefree night on the town suggests. Nevertheless, the power of the advertisement is that it subtly nudges against eternal truths.<br><br>There can be, after all, real value in being connected. All of our human interactions in one way or another are connections. Some are fleeting and less consequential, and some become the very substance of eternity and matter immensely, now and forever. Along the spectrum between these two ends are many other kinds of relationships. Let me mention a few thoughts about connections for your consideration.<br><br><b>First,</b> nearly all of you who graduate today are intimately connected to people who over a lifetime helped you qualify to attend BYU. These connections include your parents, grandparents, and other family members. In many cases they also provided the financial wherewithal for you to stay here and the emotional support that helped you succeed. You owe them so much more gratitude than a few words from any of us will capture this afternoon.<br><br>At the dedication of the Kirtland Temple, the Prophet Joseph Smith offered what he described as a revealed prayer. He prayed for Church leaders and their families, including those whom he called their "immediate connections."<sup>1</sup> That same sort of prayer is appropriate for you to offer today for your immediate connections. We hope that you will thank them as well, especially by the way you live.<br><br>John the Beloved wrote, "I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth."<sup>2</sup> Your lifelong faithfulness and devotion to the Savior and His restored Church will be the highest demonstration of gratitude that you can offer to your parents.<br><br><b>Second,</b> a number of you have formed your own families while you have been at BYU, connecting profoundly and eternally with each other. Nothing else that you did while you were here, no matter what degrees or academic distinctions you achieved, is more valuable to you than this eternal connection. Your happiness and growth in this life and your ­opportunities for eternity hereafter are fundamentally linked to this most "immediate" of all connections.<br><br>Your most important mortal responsibility will be to build and nurture this young relationship into a connection that is qualified by its virtues and character to be eternal. As you both are faithful, the love you have experienced thus far will increase in beauty, significance, and substance. If you will both pay the price of becoming devoted to heaven and to each other as God intends, then your connection will be the flower and fruit of your lives.<br><br><b>Third,</b> some of you became parents during your time here at BYU. Your children are connected to you and you to them in ways you have to experience as parents to understand. As the years go by, your connection to your progeny will become ever more precious and meaningful. Your education and experience at BYU have expanded your capacity to offer your children an opportunity to thrive in this life. Your time here enriched you by providing you with a deeper storehouse from which to draw truth and wisdom as you raise your children. You will find that you will continue to be parents for your children long after they have moved on with their own marriages and families. Your connection to these children is clearly an eternal one.<br><br><b>Fourth,</b> you have also consciously--or perhaps unconsciously--become more closely connected to the Church and its members worldwide. The Church's financial and leadership investment in BYU is staggering. The expense of operating BYU far exceeds the tuition paid for your education. You literally stand on the shoulders of faithful members who pay their tithing in full confidence that, among many other things, worthy and honorable Latter-day Saint students will benefit from their faithful financial obedience.<br><br>The cost of your education here was subsidized by the tithing of a few members with extensive bank accounts, but it was also aided by some both here and abroad who literally or figuratively keep their limited savings under their mattresses. Tithing is paid by those who have never dreamed of being able to attend BYU and by others who dream about it but for whom for many reasons the dream will never be realized. Saints around the world selflessly pay tithes so that you--people they have never met and will never know--can attend BYU. Their continuing obedience and generosity are dependable and allow for the Church to maintain BYU and her sister organizations. You are connected to all of these Saints as their beneficiaries.<br><br><b>Fifth,</b> I believe you now have a duty to stay connected to BYU. The alumni association's motto is "Connected for Good." Your education enables you to help BYU go forward in good ways. The effort you make to repay the blessing you have received will never compensate the Church or the Lord for the good to which you have been exposed and connected at BYU. But it won't hurt you to try to do so.<br><br>Some of you may earn sufficient income to make major philanthropic gifts to the university in addition to your tithes. Please consider doing so, using wisdom and acting in accordance with your circumstances. The blessings you have been given and will be given will in turn bless many others in unforeseeable ways. Staying connected to BYU for good means staying close enough to be useful for the long run, doing all the good you can to promote the future of this great institution.<br><br><b>Sixth,</b> I hope as well that you will stay ­connected in appropriate ways with friends, classmates, and professors from BYU. The world is small, especially in the Church, and your friendships can be perpetuated and enhanced as the years go by. Those connections will circle around over the years to bless and help you in happy, righteous ways. For example, some of my present quorum associates in Church service met each other as ­roommates at BYU and have friendships that extend back for decades.<br><br>In these regards, however, three brief reminders seem important. Just as there are connections that should be strengthened, there are others that should be relegated to history. Some of you had dating connections during your years here that did not result in marriage, and either you or your former interest married someone else. If so, wisdom suggests that you disconnect from that association. Staying in touch with each other electronically or otherwise after eternal covenants or connections have been made is spiritually unwise and unfortunately all too often dangerous because it permits or encourages familiarity to exist when such closeness is no longer appropriate. Don't do anything that exposes your own or someone else's eternal connection to a spouse to hazards in any way. In matters of such consequence, there is no room for error.<br><br>A similar warning should be sounded about the perils of pornography. Though Church leaders continually fire off warning flares about the seriousness of this selfish and gullible sin, too many still fail to make the lasting behavioral change required. The transgression is serious enough by itself, and the risk of greater evil it entails is real. Any closeness to this temptation should be abruptly disconnected and efforts should be focused on seeking help from Church leaders and through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.<br><br>A few of you may have run into some who have ceased to hold fast to the iron rod, have wandered off the strait and narrow path, and have become lost. They started sometimes with online tours of the territory of the faithless. This indiscretion is often accompanied by failing to earnestly study the Book of Mormon every day and by the companion problem of gradually becoming lax in keeping other commandments. This sometimes leads to listening and then hearkening to those who mock the Church, its leaders, or its history.<br><br>The faithless often promote themselves as the wise who can rescue the rest of us from our naïveté. One does not need to listen to assertive apostates for long to see the parallels between them and the Korihors, Nehors, and Sherems of the Book of Mormon. We should disconnect, immediately and completely, from listening to the proselytizing efforts of those who have lost their faith and instead reconnect promptly with the Holy Spirit.<br><br>The adversary sees spiritual apathy and half-hearted obedience as opportunities to encircle us with his chains and bind us, and he hopes to destroy us. We escape his chains as we voluntarily choose to bind ourselves instead to God. In what at first may seem ironic, our choosing to bind or connect with heaven frees and empowers us to become all that we possibly can in this life and the next through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.<br><br>The word <i>connect</i> comes from the Latin root <i>connectere,</i> meaning "to bind." As I watched that smartphone advertisement about connecting with friends, my recurring thought was that the connection--the binding--that matters most is the one we have with God. We connect with God most securely by covenant. When we are baptized we covenant to keep the commandments, to take upon us the name of Christ, and to always remember Him. We are promised that if we do so, we will always have His Spirit to be with us. We renew and recommit ourselves to this covenant every Sunday when we partake of the sacrament.<br><br>Additional covenants made by receiving the priesthood and in the temples of God bind us ever more closely to Him. These covenantal connections to Him become the guideposts for our lives. They help us measure where we are on the strait and narrow path. They lead us to the fruit of the Atonement--forgiveness, peace of conscience, and love. They help us stay worthy to enjoy the blessings of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>Whatever we do that may tend to weaken our connection--our binding--with heaven should be assessed with wariness. Everything we do that tends to reinforce faith and promotes keeping our covenants should be embraced. Our connection with heaven is the most ­valuable blessing we have and the most important one we can secure. It strengthens every other worthy connection in our lives.<br><br>You have had a wonderful opportunity at BYU to receive both a full, broad academic program and the blessing to connect to God. There is nowhere else that you can find a believing student body studying such diverse subjects as you can here. There is nowhere else you can find so many eminently qualified professors who are faithful believers. With the exception of associated Church schools, there is nowhere else you can find as rich an opportunity to learn whatever it is you studied while looking through the lens of belief and faith.<br><br>All of this afforded you a rich opportunity to connect with heaven. It offered you a time in which you could deepen discipleship and refine covenant keeping. If your time here led to such a result while gaining academic excellence, your time was well spent. If your experience here did not further establish such a connection--a closer binding between you and God--then perhaps today's hinge point in your life's journey is the time to take steps to ensure that your focus in life is where it shouldbe.<br><br>A lawyer once asked the Savior:<br><br><i>Master, which is the great commandment in thelaw?</i><br><br><i>Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thyGod with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</i><br><br><i>This is the first and great commandment.</i><br><br><i>And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>When we love God, we become truly connected to Him. When we love our neighbor, we become truly connected to him or her. As we keep the commandments of God, we show our love for God. As we serve one another, we show our love for our neighbor. The lasting value of your education at Brigham Young University is that it enhanced your capacity to do both. May you and we all make it our purpose to be worthily connected to God and to each other Ipray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1>nected - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Hi, everybody! To all of you--graduates, parents, and other supporters--thank you so much for being here, and thank you even more for what you have done to get here. I also want to say thank you to those who have helped me get here. To my sweet husband, my parents, my siblings, and all my extended ­family, thank you for your wonderful encouragement and support.<br><br>I will start by letting you all know that I do not feel particularly qualified to address you, much less able to give you any life advice. After all, most of us are pretty much in the same stage of life. So what I want to do today is just share a story, an experience, and a thought. I hope this will be both meaningful and somewhat entertaining.<br><h2><b>The Story</b></h2><br>Once upon a time there were two men named James Watson and Francis Crick. They went on a quest to discover the structure of DNA, arguably the most important molecule in the universe. As you might guess, there were also other people on that same quest. There was a physicist named Max Delbrück, who had made some speculations based on quantum physics, and there was a biochemist named Erwin Chargaff, who was studying the chemical makeup of the molecule. There was also Rosalind Franklin, an X-ray crystallographer who was focusing on visualizing the crystal structure of DNA.<br><br>All of these scientists contributed important information to the discovery, but none of them was actually able to figure it out. So, back to our heroes, Watson and Crick. These two connected the dots between all the pieces of information from the other scientists and correctly solved the puzzle. Because they made connections between different branches of science, they were able to see a bigger picture that nobody just working within their own narrow fields could have ever seen. Brilliant, right?<br><h2><b>My Experience</b></h2><br>Now let me share my experience. It is somewhat related. I was a molecular biology major finishing my first semester at BYU when my attention was caught by a paper taped to one of the doors at the JKB, where I attended church. It was an advertisement for the editing minor, and it changed my life. Something told me that I just had to find out more, and before I knew it, I was registered for the first class in the minor.<br><br>As I finished out the rest of my time at BYU as a science major with a humanities minor, I got this comment a lot: "Wow! So how do those fit together?" In some ways they don't. But for me, the most rewarding things I have done at BYU have come as I have found opportunities to combine my diverse interests--like working on writing curricula for science classes and writing magazine articles for the College of Life Sciences magazine. Connecting the ­different parts of my education has been a huge blessing for me.<br><h2><b>The Thought</b></h2><br>That brings me to the thought that I would like to share with you. I think that making our lives as connected as possible is helpful. This doesn't just apply in the academic world, where we make connections between ideas and disciplines. It also applies in our daily living, in the way we connect truths we know in our hearts with decisions about our words and actions. It is not easy. I don't think any of us will go through life without facing situations in which we will feel tremendous pressure to disconnect our words or our actions from our knowledge of what is right--whether it be a high-stakes social situation, an important business deal, or an uncomfortable question from an angry accuser.<br><br>President Thomas S. Monson gave us a good guide for such times. He asked:<br><br><i>Are you the same person wherever you are and whatever you are doing--the person our Heavenly Father wants you to be and the person you know you should be?</i> ["Be Strong and of a Good Courage," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2014]<br><br>I think there is a lot of spiritual safety and peace in being able to answer yes to that ­question--in knowing that all the parts of your life are firmly connected back to the most important truths of Christ's gospel.<br><br>In summary, when we make connections between different aspects of living--the physical, the intellectual, the emotional, and the spiritual--we see the big picture more clearly (just as did Watson and Crick with DNA). When we integrate our different talents and interests, we find unexpected opportunities to do good. And, perhaps most important, when we apply the gospel to all aspects of our life, when we avoid compartmentalizing our roles or compromising our values, we stay true to ourselves and connected to our purpose for living. Thank you.<br><br><i>Alicia K. Stanton spoke as the representative of hergraduating class at BYU commencement on 21April 2016.</i><br><br><em>© 2016 Brigham Young University.</em>

<h1> Forth to Serve&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Dear Elder Clayton, President Worthen, ­faculty, fellow students, and friends: two months ago President Worthen kindly informed me of an invitation to receive an honorary doctorate degree in recognition of "outstanding life and contribution to society and the world."<br><br>Aware that this is the highest honor that the university confers on individuals, I replied in my email, "With full appreciation in my heart, the only uneasiness in mind is whether I have done enough to deserve this singular honor."<br><br>Then my daughter exclaimed, "What? I always thought that honorary doctorates were given <i>only</i> to people without a PhD!"<br><br>This is not only my own honor but recognition for the work of all Chinese students at the Y, past and present. I first came to BYU on an exchange program between the College of Humanities and the Xi'an Foreign Language Institute. Then a BYU scholarship enabled me to pursue my further studies. Therefore, it may also be regarded as a little fruit of educational exchange between China and the United States.<br><br>As the Chinese saying goes, "Whenever one drinks water, he must not forget those who dug the well." Coming to mind is a microcosm of BYU faculty, including Erlend Peterson, Todd Britsch, Frank Fox, and Paul Hyer--now with friendship extended on by his son Eric. Also, I want to include Marshall Craig, Briant Jacobs, Ray Hillam, Spencer Palmer, and others who have passed away but who will forever live deep in my heart. Last but not least is Neil York, the mentor for both my MA and PhD programs. All in all, my heartfelt appreciation goes to my alma mater--in Chinese, "the mother school."<br><br>For my assigned speaking time, President Worthen advised me, "As our graduates will be going out into an increasingly global world, any connection you make between their BYU experience and what they will likely encounter in that global world will be valuable to them."<br><br>Indeed, the world is undergoing complicated and profound changes. In an age of peace and development, both globalization and multipolarity continue to deepen. Nontraditional security challenges keep rising amidst traditional problems. Interdependence and connectivity make international relations no longer a zero-sum game. Global governance calls for international cooperation and, Iemphasize, talents.<br><br>To recall my experience, the BYU motto "Go forth to serve" has exerted boundless inspiration, courage, and guidance. The elapse of time has only accumulated understanding and appreciation of its meaning and significance.<br><br>First, "go forth to serve" could mean <i>confidence</i> and <i>dedication</i> in the pursuit of one's undertaking. In my case, I have always had a strong belief in the need for a constructive and cooperative Sino-American relationship. In this new century it is vitally important for the United States and China to build up a new type of relationship between major countries based on nonconfrontation, mutual respect, and win-win outcomes. The status quo power and the rising power must enhance strategic trust and manage their differences to avoid the so-called Thucydides Trap.<br><br>Second, "go forth to serve" could mean <i>inclusiveness</i> and <i>adaptability.</i> For the new Chinese ambassador to Iceland from tropical Surinam, the Icelandic foreign minister wondered why there should be this drastic transition. "Climate change and global warming," was my answer. After the world financial crisis, three undertakings cemented Iceland-China relations: currency swap, geothermal cooperation, and the Free Trade Agreement (FTA). It shows that countries need inclusive cooperation. One must constantly broaden one's horizons and adapt to change.<br><br>Third, "go forth to serve" could also mean <i>responsibility</i> and <i>perseverance.</i> Our diversified world is full of opportunities and rewards. However, it may also contain tempting loopholes and pitfalls. High lofty ideals need to be paralleled with down-to-earth actions. One should keep a moral bottom line in life and professional standards at work. No matter what the outer conditions are, keep spirits high and just persevere. Personal righteousness, responsibility, discipline, and devotion are requirements for final achievements.<br><br>I remember a set of cartoons on campus back around my graduation time, almost thirty years ago. The first cartoon was about a boy entering college, expecting "The world is our campus." The second showed the boy at graduation, and the caption read, "The end of the world is here."<br><br>At this great crossroads in life, graduates need bravery to enter the real world. Indeed, "aship in harbor is safe, but that is not what ships are built for."<sup>1</sup> So, my fellow Y graduates, we have entered to learn. Now it is our high mandate and bound duty to "go forth to serve." I wish each and every one of you agreat success. Thank you very much!<br><br><i>Ambassador Su Ge is president of the China Institute of International Studies under the Foreign Ministry of the People's Republic of China.

I was born in Mountain View, California, the second of (eventually) eleven children. We settled in a relatively quiet neighborhood on the east side of San Jose, not far from the rolling foothills that are crowned by the imposing Mount Hamilton, home to the Lick Observatory, "the first permanently occupied mountaintop observatory in the world."<sup>1</sup> The weather was usually pleasant, even during the warm, sunny days of summer. As spring yielded to summer, the foothills would turn from a verdant green to a cozy, warm brown. But even on hot days, a cool breeze would flow off the bay every afternoon just as temperatures were peaking for the day.<br><br>Our subdivision consisted of a single principal street with four cul-de-sacs branching off toward the east. To the south was a walnut orchard that, in a child's mind, seemed dark and foreboding--the stuff of fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm. To the east was a large strawberry field. One day Mom sent my older brother, Jim, and me out to pick strawberries. I remember doing a lot of picking and eating; I don't remember bringing much home in the bowl she gave us.<br><br>Shortly thereafter, bulldozers and earthmovers took over as Interstate 680 came to our neighborhood. The walnut orchard also gave way to construction. "Silicon Valley" had to be built, and it seemed we were in the middle of it.<br><br>When I was fourteen years old, my father decided to purchase a microcomputer kit. This seemed like a sensible activity for a systems analyst in Silicon Valley. He chose the Heathkit H-89, and it was as amazing in 1979 as an iPad is today! I am sorry to get a little nerdy here, but I need to paint the picture properly. The H-89 was an all-in-one model with a keyboard and a twelve-inch display built right in. Its brain was an eight-bit Zilog brand Z80 CPU<sup>2</sup> that ran at more than two megahertz (that is more than two million clock cycles per second). The kit came standard with 16K of RAM,<sup>3</sup> but since Dad bought three expansion packs over time, we eventually had an entire 56K of RAM in which to lose ourselves. (In contrast, a typical smartphone today has billions of bytes of RAM and executes billions of clock cycles each second.)<br><br>Dad let us older boys help build the thing, but, as I recall, I was the most zealous deputy in the bunch. We had to bolt and solder all sorts of parts together, and soon enough there was this box--a true marvel of engineering and a testament to not only mankind's creativity but also our ability to follow complex instructions and manipulate tiny parts. There it was, sitting on our kitchen table with its fan purring, enthusiastically waiting for that next instruction to come in from its mass storage device, a cassette tape recorder. (Yes, it took another upgrade before we could use modern, high-capacity floppy disk technology.<sup>4</sup>)<br><br>The computer was built, so what next? I had to learn how to program it. I knew how it was assembled, but I didn't know how it worked. And I couldn't leave it alone. My brother Jim was a year ahead of me in school, and he was already attending the digital computer programming class at our high school, Independence High. I was a lowly freshman and hadn't yet risen to those lofty ranks in which you could get into Mr. McKell's class and learn the secrets to life, the universe, and digital computers. So I pestered Jim with questions, trying to absorb everything I could about the art of computer programming. Eventually I learned to program in BASIC, then FORTRAN, and then in the Z80 CPU's assembly language. Ah, those were ­halcyon days!<br><br>My teenage fascination with software development grew into a lifelong love affair. I had found my calling in life: computer science was the discipline for me, and I knew it! Ilove the process of creating software. You start essentially with a blank canvas and order the universe the way <i>you</i> want to order it. You create a computer program very literally as Isaiah described it: "line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little."<sup>5</sup> And then, when you run your program, that faithful computer companion does <i>exactly</i> what you have told it to do. Absent a hardware failure or other unusual event, the computer exhibits a remarkable trait: in it there "is no variableness, neither shadow of turning"<sup>6</sup> or "changing."<sup>7</sup><br><br>The computer reminds me of the amazing stripling warriors in the Book of Mormon. Helaman reported that in battle "they did obey and observe to perform every word of command with exactness."<sup>8</sup> The results of that obedience were astonishing, even miraculous.<sup>9</sup><br><br>To an older brother with lots of younger siblings, this was all the more incredible. Have you ever tried to get your younger brothers or sisters to follow your instructions primarily on the strength of your status as the older sibling? It is hard--and not particularly successful, in my experience. I had experienced an epiphany, a revelation: here was this device ready and willing--even eager--to do my bidding to the letter. I could be king, absolute ruler, and sovereign in this kingdom of the H-89. Later, when I read section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants, something resonated with me:<br><br><i> All kingdoms have a law given;</i><br><br><i> And there are many kingdoms; for there is no space in the which there is no kingdom; ... either agreater or a lesser kingdom.</i><br><br><i> And unto every kingdom is given a law; and unto every law there are certain bounds also and conditions</i>.<sup>10</sup><br><br>Software development is a kingdom, albeit a "lesser kingdom," and thus it "is given a law," and to that law we find "certain bounds also and conditions." There is in some sense a finiteness to the laws of this lesser kingdom. As a PhD student I learned that a simple language with just three particular types of statements is sufficient to write any computable function.<sup>11</sup> Certainly for software development, "out of small things proceedeth that which is great."<sup>12</sup> I have a hope of being able to master those laws and thus have dominion over this kingdom.<br><h2><b>Stewardship and Dominion</b></h2><br><i>Dominion,</i> which means sovereignty or control, is a dangerous word in the modern context. Certainly we tend to think of those who are domineering in a negative light, and we read about "unrighteous dominion"<sup>13</sup> in the scriptures. No Latter-day Saint wants to be labeled as someone who exercises unrighteous dominion.<br><br>But there is also a kind of righteous dominion. The first place in the scriptures that we see the word <i>dominion </i>used is in the Creation account:<br><br><i> And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have </i><b><i>dominion</i></b><i> over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth</i>.<sup>14</sup><br><br>Righteous dominion is more akin to the concept of stewardship, not dominance. There are many positive references to dominion in the scriptures. The psalmist declared of the Lord, "He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth,"<sup>15 </sup>and, "Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations."<sup>16</sup><br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon, who saw in vision the kingdoms of glory, noted that dominion increased in the higher kingdoms. For example, "We saw the glory of the terrestrial which excels in all things the glory of the telestial, even in glory, and in power, and in might, and in dominion."<sup>17</sup> They went on to note that those who dwell in the celestial kingdom inherit glory that exceeds all and that they are "equal in power, and in might, and in dominion."<sup>18</sup> This is the kind of dominion we want.<br><br>Dominion will be our inheritance in the next life to the extent that we are true to our covenants and obey the laws, bounds, and conditions that lead to exaltation. I love the way Doctrine and Covenants 121 describes this process: "No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood,"<sup>19 </sup>or, in other words, by virtue of a statement of some authority or status--"because I said so." Instead, we acquire power and exert influence<br><br><i>by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned;</i><br><br><i> By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and ­without guile.</i><sup>20</sup><br><br>Something interesting happens as we walk this path and behave according to these principles:<br><br><i>Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.</i><br><br><i> The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever</i>.<sup>21</sup><br><br>We want to have influence, or, in other words, power. We are here at Brigham Young University to learn how to become more influential. Each one of us wants to change and bless the world in some way. To do that we need knowledge, skills, and connections to opportunities.<br><br>How do we acquire this influence? By becoming more like the Savior--in gentle and meek ways, with genuine love and kindness. We need pure knowledge, an authentic genuineness, and charity, "the pure love of Christ."<sup>22</sup><br><br>Striving for these attributes can at times be difficult to remember to do, such as when project deadlines are approaching or it is final exams week. Pressures build. Sometimes we cram and try to force the required knowledge into our brains or we try to find a quick and easy solution on the web. The fact that we are taking a college course does not entitle us to a particular set of knowledge. Rather, we must earn it the same way everyone else must: by walking the path of long-suffering patience. Rather than try to force our way, we should instead seek for that distilling "as the dews from heaven" that leads to a condition in which we don't need to try to force it because "without compulsory means" itcomes naturally.<br><h2><b>Agency: Thou Mayest</b></h2><br>My mother taught me to love the writings of John Steinbeck. There was a copy of <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> in our bookcase, and when I was old enough, not only was I enriched by reading it, but I actually enjoyed it. Eventually I found my way to <i>East of Eden,</i> the work that Steinbeck apparently considered his magnum opus. I was fascinated by the novel and its exploration of the universal story of Cain and Abel, set in nineteenth- and twentieth-century America among families any of us might recognize--people who could be us or our neighbors.<br><br>In chapter 24 Steinbeck had a character named Lee give an account of studying the Cain and Abel story. He focused in particular on Genesis 4:7, which the King James Version of the Bible translates as "If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him."<br><br>However, in the American Standard Version, the last phrase is rendered "but do thou rule over [him]" instead of "thou shalt." The underlying Hebrew word that leads to the differences in translation is rendered by Steinbeck as <i>timshel,</i> and it means, essentially, "you may."<sup>23</sup><br><br>The character Lee explained all this in the following key passage from <i>East of Eden:</i><br><br><i>"Don't you see?" he cried. "The American Standard translation </i><b><i>orders</i></b><i> men to triumph over sin. .</i><i>.</i><i>. The King James translation makes a promise in 'Thou shalt,' meaning that men will surely triumph over sin. But the Hebrew word, the word </i>timshel--<i>'Thou mayest'--that gives a choice. It might be the most important word in the world. That says the way is open. That throws it right back on a man. For if 'Thou mayest'--it is also true that 'Thou mayest not.' Don't you see?"</i><sup>24</sup><br><br>Lee continued:<br><br><i>"'Thou mayest'! Why, that makes a man great, that gives him stature with the gods, for in his weakness and his filth . . . he has still the great choice. He can choose his course and fight it through and win."</i><sup>25</sup><br><br>Steinbeck wove this concept masterfully throughout the story of the families in <i>East of Eden.</i> But this is our story too. For each one of us this statement is true: "thou mayest" or "thou mayest not." The choice is ours.<br><br>Father Lehi told his son Jacob that we "are free to choose."<sup>26</sup> In modern revelation, the Lord declared that men and women<br><br><i>should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;</i><br><br><i> For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves.</i><sup>27</sup><br><br>Within us lies the power of choice. Unlike that trusty H-89 computer, we do not merely mechanically perform whatever is commanded of us. Rather, like my siblings, we choose and then do according to our choice. Because of the Savior's Atonement, we "are redeemed from the fall" and thus "have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for [ourselves] and not to be acted upon."<sup>28</sup><br><br><i> </i>What will you and I do with our agency? Will we learn, improve, and develop our talents?<br><h2><b>Agency and Learning</b></h2><br>We hope that every member of the BYU community will experience the Aims of a BYU Education:<br><br><i>A BYU education should be (1)</i> <i>spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building, leading to (4) lifelong learning and service.</i><sup>29</sup><br><br>My question to you is, Will these aims be achieved regardless of your agency? Of course the answer is no! You must choose to accomplish them. None of us who serve as faculty members can impose these aims upon you, nor can any external force. "Thou mayest!" We can encourage, entice, engage, and invite, but whether you experience these outcomes depends significantly on what you are willing to invest in this quest for an education.<br><br>Will your testimony and spiritual preparation grow as a result of the things you learn? Itis your choice.<br><br>Will you dig in and really learn, or will you just get far enough into the material to do well enough on the exams and earn the grade you want? It is your choice.<br><br>Will you expand upon what your instructors teach and explore on your own outside of class and independent of course requirements, or will you simply accept what they present and be done with it? It is your choice.<br><br>At the Marriott School, Dean Lee Perry often reminds us that we should be "difference makers." Is that what you will become--a ­difference maker--or will you be satisfied ­simply with making it through? Again, it is your choice.<br><br>We faculty members are pleased to see the majority of students making the most of their BYU experience.<br><br>The Lord taught His Latter-day Saints that we are to actively "seek learning" and indeed that we are collectively to seek this learning. Hedeclared:<br><br><i> And as all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.</i><sup>30</sup><br><br>The Lord invited us to employ our agency in learning and in helping others to learn. Is that not a primary purpose of mortality? For "whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection."<sup>31</sup><br><br>The Savior repeatedly invited us to learn: "Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for Iam meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls."<sup>32</sup> That sounds to me like experiential learning. The Lord also said, "Learn of me, and listen to my words; walk in the meekness of my Spirit, and you shall have peace inme."<sup>33</sup><br><br>Have you ever asked, "What should my major be?" Shall we read what the Lord wants us to study? He gave a list. The commandment is to learn<br><br><i>of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations .</i><i>.</i><i>.</i>; <i>and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms.</i><sup>34</sup><br><br>Okay, maybe that doesn't answer your question about a major, but whether it is astronomy, geography, geology, history, political science, nursing, computer science, information systems, or any other subject, we are under a divine mandate to acquire a broad and deep education so that we can magnify our callings and fulfill our missions.<sup>35</sup><br><br>"To be learned is good," Jacob taught, when we "hearken unto the counsels of God."<sup>36</sup> We are to exercise our agency, take control of our educational agenda, and learn what we decide we will need for our particular mission. "Thou mayest!"<br><br>Faculty members have significant degrees of freedom in selecting the research projects they wish to undertake. More than a decade ago a colleague from another college, RichardC.Galbraith, approached me with a scripture citation index he wanted to share with ­others. He had indexed the general conference talks from 1942 to the present, and he had also gone through the <i>Journal of Discourses</i> and <i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</i><sup>37</sup> to annotate those materials with scriptures that were used or cited by the authors.<br><br>My colleague's key insight was that indexing the conference talks by the scriptures they cited tied the words of ancient and modern prophets together in a way that helps us learn effectively. Dick had typed up this citation index in several different WordPerfect files, and he wanted my help to distribute his work.<br><br>As I recall the conversation, it went something like this:<br><br>"Steve, would you help me put these on CD-ROM so I can share them with my friends?"<br><br>My answer: "No." Then, after a pause, I said, "Let's make a website instead!"<br><br>Over the years I have had the help of many students--including, most recently, my own daughter, Rosie, who just graduated with her master of information systems management degree--as we have created multiple versions of the LDS Scripture Citation Index for the web and for mobile devices. Currently, the iOS version is the easiest to use, and the web version is the most feature rich. You can find it at scriptures.byu.edu.<sup>38</sup><br><br>This project has made a huge impact in my work and in my life. I have been able to study web and mobile software-development techniques because of this work. Thousands of people, including me, have been able to use the citation index over the years to enhance their learning.<br><br>We live in a world in which knowledge of all kinds is readily available. Ancient prophets saw a day when "the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea."<sup>39</sup> It is my sincere hope that the citation index contributes to this vision in some small way. I am a better researcher and teacher because of my choice to develop this software, and this is just one of many useful and interesting projects in which I have been able to participate during my career.<br><br>Most of the BYU faculty members I know feel this same way. What a joy it is to exercise our agency in the advancement of knowledge and to build our students in accordance with the Aims of a BYU Education! My PhD advisor, David Embley, retired from BYU not long ago and is now serving a Church service mission at FamilySearch with the goal of applying our data-extraction research<sup>40</sup> to the task of making family history texts more accessible. He is having so much fun that he reminds me of a kid in a candy store.<br><br>And not only faculty members feel this way. As academic director of the Rollins Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology,<sup>41</sup> I have the privilege of working with many successful entrepreneurs who support the center and have joined what we call our Founders Organization. These men and women mentor BYU students because they want to give back and help build the kingdom. I often receive emails reporting how one of our entrepreneur mentors has touched the life of a student in a deep and significant way, changing the mind-set and career direction of a student whose imagination they have opened to new vistas.<br><br>I know that this is a real experience for our students because it has also happened to me. Dear friends among the Founders have changed my life, taught me, and helped me better achieve my potential. The Founders are eager learners who want to create, build, and grow. They use their agency to marshal all kinds of resources to build BYU students.<br><br>An entrepreneur identifies an important pain that people are experiencing in their lives, explores possible solutions, and then delivers a sustainable solution to eliminate it. Entrepreneurs don't let anything stand in their way. As I see it, entrepreneurship is all about exercising agency to learn how to do good and then using that learning to make the world a better place.<br><br>President Thomas S. Monson recently reminded us of another aspect that relates agency, learning, and faith. He said:<br><br><i> May we choose to build up within ourselves a great and powerful faith which will be our most effective defense against the designs of the adversary--a real faith, the kind of faith which will sustain us and will bolster our desire to choose the right. Without such faith, we go nowhere. With it, we can accomplish our goals.</i><sup>42</sup><br><br>Faith is a choice we make: we can choose to build up faith. We can learn by faith and we can also live in true joy by faith, guided by the Holy Spirit, through whose power we "may know the truth of all things."<sup>43</sup><br><br>In Gethsemane, Jesus Christ was faced with a choice: whether to partake of the bitter cup or to shirk this most difficult of responsibilities. To our everlasting benefit, He yielded to the Father's will.<sup>44</sup> When He made this singularly momentous choice--this hinge upon which the entire plan of salvation turned--He learned how to accomplish the Atonement, and, as Isaiah expressed it, "by his <i>knowledge</i> [this] righteous servant justif[ied] many,"<sup>45</sup> and, we are told, "with his stripes we are healed."<sup>46</sup><br><br>President Dieter F. Uchtdorf recently taught:<br><br><i>If you will only lift up your heart to the Savior of the world, He will find you.</i><br><br><i> He will rescue you.</i><br><br><i> He will lift you up and place you on His shoulders.</i><br><br><i> He will carry you home.</i><sup>47</sup><br><br>This power came from knowledge, from learning, and from the righteous exercise of agency.<br><br>What will you and I learn with our agency? What will we do with that learning?<br><h2><b>"Without Compulsory Means"</b></h2><br>The Lick Observatory that I admired from afar as a child sits at an elevation of 4,209 feet (1,283meters). The elevation of my home in Orem is nearly 4,900 feet (1,494meters). Literally and symbolically, I start my day well above the tallest thing I could see as a child. Likewise, Ihave grown and have learned a tremendous amount since those days. My agency has increased, and at the same time I know so very much more than I did decades ago. Perhaps that is saying the same thing. By exercise of agency we learn, and by learning we increase our capability to act, which is agency.<br><br>Let me return to the H-89 computer of my youth. Ihad wanted to control my younger siblings but found that not to be in keeping with the eternal principle of agency--they were not things "to be acted upon."<sup>48</sup> However, the computer was. But it was also a spark that ignited a fire within me to learn the laws of software development. Because I was driven by the desire to learn, the effort did not feel strenuous; rather, it was a joy to learn. And that fire burns today. I have a commitment to lifelong learning in this my chosen discipline<sup>49</sup> and also in the gospel.<br><br>Have you ever been absorbed by a project? Have you ever been driven internally by a goal you wished to accomplish? I believe that when we exercise our agency to learn, grow, and accomplish good in this world and when we apply "the principles of righteousness,"<sup>50</sup> our influence will naturally increase. As we continue on this path, one day we will look back and see that our "dominion [has become] an everlasting dominion, and <i>without compulsory means</i> it shall flow unto [us] forever and ever."<sup>51</sup> I pray that each one of us will be able to find joy in learning "without compulsory means."<br><br>I testify that the power of the Atonement is real. Jesus Christ is our Lord and God, the Redeemer of the world. He can heal us in all things, and He has marked the path for us.<sup>52</sup><br><br>May each of us follow our Savior as we work to achieve the aims of this unique university and carry out the special mission with which we, individually and collectively, have been commissioned.<sup>53</sup> And may Heavenly Father bless each of us, guided by faith and by the Spirit, to find joy in that process. The power is in you.<sup>54</sup> In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Stephen W.

<h1> Tune: Minimizing Interference Beats - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
March 20 of this year was a beautiful day. It was warm and the sun was shining. Some of the trees had started to bud, and early blooms were visible. I had been anticipating this day with great excitement and a good deal of apprehension from the time I received a phone call three months earlier asking if I would play the organ at one of the Provo City Center Temple dedication sessions. I had never dreamed I would have a chance to serve in this capacity, for I knew there were scores of talented and accomplished organists in our temple district, and I was also keenly aware of my own inadequacies.<br><br>Surprise and shock were some of the feelings I had when I got the call, but in the few seconds it took me to stammer out an acceptance of this assignment, I felt my Heavenly Father's love. And even though I was very nervous, I sensed that this was one of His tender mercies.<br><br>I was to have an experience similar to one that my beautiful paternal grandmother, Ethel Taylor Robinson, had had, and this created a sense of connection to her that I had not felt before. I never met her, as she died in her early thirties, but I knew of her and of her many talents. My home teacher made sure of that. Herepeatedly told me what a wonderful musician she was and how much she was loved and missed by our community.<br><br>In October 1927 my grandmother directed a stake choir that sang at the dedication of the Mesa Arizona Temple. Although four of the songs she performed with her choir in that dedication were different from the ones Iplayed at the Provo City Center Temple dedication, we both performed the "Hosanna Anthem." Realizing that we would both perform the same song in a temple of the Lord almost ninety years apart was a very sweet experience.<br><br>I had other sweet experiences while our choir prepared and rehearsed. Choir members shared their testimonies and tender feelings about the temple, the gospel, and our Savior both in words and song. Everyone was focused on offering his or her very best to the Lord.<br><br>In my personal practices I often felt inadequate and worried when I thought about performing in the celestial room, only a few feet away from the Lord's apostles and in front of millions of viewers. I tried to calm myself with the feeling that if I put the time into my practice, the Lord would help me. I therefore practiced every day. The footwork with the organ pedals was my biggest challenge. Idrilled the arpeggios and foot crossings over and over and over and over--slowly at first, and then I would attempt to speed them up to the performance tempo. Some repetitions went well, and I thought, "Ican do this!" But on the very next repetition I would land on a note just adjacent to the one I was aiming for. So I would try again.<br><br>One day as I was going through this process, I remembered something I had learned in an acoustics class many years ago when I thought Iwanted to be a music teacher. The thought that came into my mind as I was practicing is the subject I would like to speak about today.<br><h2><b>A Lesson on Sound Frequencies and BeinginTune</b></h2><br>I remembered learning about sound waves and their frequencies. I am sure there were some more in-depth physics I was supposed to learn and remember from that class, but what came to my mind four decades later as I struggled to land on the right note was the effect of sound waves with different frequencies when they are heard at the same time. Let me illustrate with a rudimentary explanation.<br><br>When something vibrates, sound is produced. These vibrations, called longitudinal waves, have high- and low-pressure areas, and when they are diagrammed they look like symmetrical wavy lines. The frequency is the measurement of the number of cycles a sound wave makes in a second, and it determines the pitch of the sound. A pure tone is a sound wave with a single frequency.<br><br>When two pure tones with the same frequency are sounded together, their sound waves are the same. They are matched, and the tone you hear is the same pitch and sounds in unison. When two tones with different frequencies are sounded together, their sound waves are not in sync, and if we were to graph the waves, we would see how the variance between the two waves grows. If the two frequencies are different but fairly close, instead of a unison sound we would hear a beating sound, often described as a wobbly or wah-wah-wah sound. These interference beats will decrease as the difference in frequency between the two sounds is reduced. The beating sounds will altogether disappear when the frequencies are matched and the sounds are in tune.<br><br>As I was practicing I thought about how these interference beats sounded when the difference in frequencies was only marginally off and how the dissonance increased the farther apart they were. I thought about how wonderful it would be if, as I was performing, the Spirit would cause the listeners to hear the right note--making their ears hear a sound with identical frequencies. In my wishful thinking I wondered how close the pedal notes I played would have to be to the precise one the composer had in mind to be heard in harmony with the other notes I was playing.<br><br>As I drove home from practice that day, I kept thinking about sound waves and frequencies--not just about how they applied to the music I was practicing but how the attributes of sound could apply to me and my efforts to be more like our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.<br><br>If we were to represent our Heavenly Father--His qualities, His attributes, His thoughts, and His actions--as a sound wave with a single frequency, we would hear a pure tone. If we added Jesus Christ as a second sound wave, the two tones would have the same frequency and would be in tune. Jesus told us, "I am in the Father, and the Father in me, and the Father and I are one."<sup>1</sup> We could say They are on the same wavelength. What would happen if we were to add our own sound wave to that of our Heavenly Father? Would there be minimal beat interference or would the variance be a greater dissonance?<br><br>With sound waves as an example, the waves start at the same point, and, depending on the difference in frequency, the sounds are either in unison or out of tune. In the premortal existence we were all one with our Father, and we supported His plan--a plan that would give us the opportunity to become like Him. During the War in Heaven we were still one with Him and we fought for His plan. But just as there are many reasons that musical instruments can get out of tune, many of our life choices can get us out of tune with our Heavenly Father.<br><br>In 3 Nephi we read about the devastation that happened in the land after the Crucifixion of the Savior. There were great storms and tempests with terrible thunder and sharp lightning. There were earthquakes, fires, and whirlwinds. Cities sank to the depths of the sea. Great and terrible destruction deformed the land. During this major upheaval, many of the inhabitants were killed.<sup>2</sup><br><br>After the devastation ended and the darkness that had lasted for three days dispersed, Jesus Christ visited the people who were spared. During His several visits, He ministered to and taught the people. He told them to search the scriptures, ponder His words, and pray for understanding. He healed their sick and blessed their little ones. He instituted the sacrament. He expounded all things unto them, and many saw and heard unspeakable things that could not be written.<sup>3</sup> Before the Lord left them He asked, "Therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as Iam."<sup>4</sup><br><br>They took His directive to heart. It didn't happen overnight, but it wasn't too many years later that all were converted unto the Lord, having all things in common. With their conversion, they were able to live in a society in which there were no contentions or disputations. They had become like our Savior. Their sound waves were in tune with His and stayed in sync for two centuries.<br><br>Who were these people, and what can we learn from them to help us be on the same wavelength as our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? Their story gives us four clear directions or guidelines that we can follow to be more in unison with our Creators. If we follow the Nephite example, we will grow more in tune. But, like everything in life, all things have their opposite, which means that if we do the reverse, we grow more out of tune.<br><h3><b><i>1. Receive the Prophets and Stone Them Not</i></b></h3><br>In 3 Nephi 10:12 we learn who these people were: "It was the more righteous part of the people who were saved, and it was they who received the prophets and stoned them not; and it was they who had not shed the blood of the saints, who were spared." From this scripture we learn about the first way we can follow the Nephite example to be more in tune with our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, and that is toreceive the prophets and stone them not.<br><br>Just last month we had the opportunity to raise our hands and sustain our prophets. Raising our hand is easy, and sometimes we do it without really thinking about what it really means. To receive the prophets and stone them not, we have to do more than casually raise our hand. We need to follow President Russell M. Nelson's teachings and sustain our prophets by honoring them, standing behind them, defending their good names, striving to carry out their instructions, and praying for them.<sup>5</sup><br><br>Another way we can receive the prophets and stone them not is to love them. President Henry B. Eyring, in his October 2014 general conference address, talked about the feelings oflove we get for the prophet of God. He said:<br><br>[The love we feel]<i> is far more than hero ­worshipor the feelings we sometimes have of ­</i><i>admiring heroic figures. It is a gift from God. With it </i>[we] <i>will receive more easily the gift of confirming revelation when he speaks in his office as the Lord's prophet. The love </i>[we]<i> feel is the love the Lord has for whoever is His spokesman.</i><br><br><i> That is not easy to feel continually because the Lord often asks His prophets to give counsel that is hard for people to accept. The enemy of our souls will try to lead us to take offense and to doubt the prophet's calling from God.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>The last sentence of this quote gives us a glimpse at ways in which we may stone the prophets. Sometimes they have to call us to repentance and tell us hard things. As Sister CarolF. McConkie told us in her October 2014 general conference address, sometimes their words may seem<br><br><i>unreasonable, inconvenient, and uncomfortable. According to the world's standards, following the prophet may be unpopular, politically incorrect, or socially unacceptable. But following the prophet is always right.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>When we choose to take offense or rationalize that the teachings of our prophets don't really apply to us in our unique circumstances or we doubt that their calls are from God, we stone them. But when we follow their words, love them, and pray for them, we receive them. Our lives are more like the lives of the Nephites, and we are more in harmony with our Savior and Heavenly Father.<br><h3><b><i>2. Do Not Allow Contention</i></b></h3><br>Following the model of the Nephites after Christ had visited and taught them, we learn a second way in which we can be in tune with our Heavenly Father: do not allow contention. In 4Nephi 1:2 we read:<br><br><i>And it came to pass in the thirty and sixth year, the people were all converted unto the Lord, upon all the face of the land, both Nephites and Lamanites, and there were no contentions and disputations among them, and every man did deal justly one with another.</i><br><br>In 4 Nephi 1:15–17 we are told that the Nephites had no contentions<br><br><i>because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people.</i><br><br><i> And there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor whoredoms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor any manner of lasciviousness; and surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God.</i><br><br><i> There were no robbers, nor murderers, neither were there Lamanites, nor any manner of -ites; but they were in one, the children of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom of God.</i><br><br>"They were in one, the children of Christ." To me this sounds like some very beautiful music, with everyone in tune with Christ.<br><br>Alma, at the waters of Mormon, commanded his people<br><br><i>that there should be no contention one with another, but that they should look forward with one eye, having one faith and one baptism, having their hearts knit together in unity and in love one towards another.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>Alma's followers followed his teachings, and they had the blessings of unity in their lives.<br><br>Contrast the unity and peace of Alma's people with the contention among the Nephites after the chief judge and governor of the land, Pahoran, died. The scriptures describe this as a time of serious difficulty and serious contention as they decided which of Pahoran's sons should have the judgment seat. The people chose Pahoran the second to fill the judgment seat. But amidst the contention caused by his brother Paanchi--who rebelled against the people and tried to destroy their liberty--Pahoran was murdered, and another brother, Pacumeni, was appointed to take his place.<br><br>The contention in the land had weakened the Nephites, and when the Lamanites saw this, they came to battle with an army of innumerable men. Now the Nephites, "because of so much contention and so much difficulty in [their] government, . . . had not kept sufficient guards in the land,"<sup>9</sup> which allowed the Lamanite leader Coriantumr to march with his army into the land of Zarahemla, slay everyone who opposed him, and take the city. The contention among the Nephites at this time divided them as a society, separated them from God, and caused adversity and misfortune in their lives.<br><br>President Eyring told us how to avoid contention and how to be peacemakers and be unified. He said:<br><br><i>The great peacemaker, the restorer of unity, is the one who finds a way to help people see the truth they share. That truth they share is always greater and more important to them than their differences. You can help yourself and others to see that common ground if you ask for help from God and then act. Hewill answer your prayer to help restore peace.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>To be in tune, then, with our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, we have to find a way to see the truth we share and work toward peace and unity.<br><h3><b><i>3. Be Humble, Not Prideful</i></b></h3><br>A third way the Nephites can teach us how to stay in tune with our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ is to be humble, not prideful. In 4Nephi 1:24–26 we read:<br><br><i> And now, in this two hundred and first year there began to be among them those who were lifted up in pride, such as the wearing of costly apparel, and all manner of fine pearls, and of the fine things of the world.</i><br><br><i> And from that time forth they did have their goods and their substance no more common among them.</i><br><br><i> And they began to be divided into classes; and they began to build up churches unto themselves to get gain, and began to deny the true church of Christ.</i><br><br>For two hundred years the Nephites followed the Savior's teachings and were one with Him, with their sound frequencies mirroring His. It was the sin of pride that started the dissonance and eventually led to their destruction.<br><br>President Ezra Taft Benson taught us about pride. Describing it as a very misunderstood sin, he said:<br><br><i> Most of us think of pride as self-centeredness, conceit, boastfulness, arrogance, or haughtiness. All of these are elements of the sin, but the heart, or core, is still missing.</i><br><br><i> The central feature of pride is enmity--enmity toward God and enmity toward our fellowmen. </i>Enmity<i> means "hatred toward, hostility to, or a state of opposition." It is the power by which Satan wishes to reign over us.</i><br><br><i> Pride is essentially competitive in nature....</i><br><br><i> Our will</i> [is] <i>in competition to God's....</i><br><br><i> The proud cannot accept the authority of God giving direction to their lives....</i><br><br><i> ...The proud wish God would agree with them. They aren't interested in changing their opinions to agree with God's.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>Lucky for us, there is an antidote for pride. It is humility. President Benson told us that wecan combat pride by being meek and submissive and by having a broken heart and a contrite spirit. When we are humble, we can receive counsel and chastisement, be ­forgiving, and give selfless service. We can love God, submit our will to His, and put Him first in ourlives.<sup>12</sup><br><br>President SpencerW. Kimball helped us think about humility by comparing it to a doughnut. He said that we are like the hole in the doughnut. We would be nothing without the Lord, or what is around the hole. Our everything is dependent on the Lord--our breath, our brains, our hearing, our sight, and our locomotion. Without Him, we are nothing. We are only crumbs. We are totally dependent on Him.<sup>13</sup> When we realize our dependency on Him and when we are grateful for His help, that is when we are humble.<br><br>President Kimball used some great adjectives to describe humility. He said:<br><br><i> Humility is gracious, quiet, serene--not pompous, spectacular, nor histrionic. It is subdued, kindly, and understanding--not crude, blatant, loud, or ugly. . . . Its faithful, quiet works will be the badge of its own accomplishments.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>Bishop Richard C. Edgley, in his 2003 general conference address, told of an experience that illustrates the power and blessings of humility. He described a lesson in his high priests quorum meeting in which the instructor asked attendees to tell who their heroes were and why. Someone named the Savior, another spoke of Abraham Lincoln, another mentioned Joseph Smith, and still another said President GordonB. Hinckley. When it was Brother Edgley's turn, he chose as his heroes members of his ward who had experienced tragedies and major setbacks in their lives yet had carried on in humility. They relied on the Lord and not on their own abilities to help them through their difficult life experiences.<br><br>One example of his heroes was Ken and Jo Ann Sweatfield, who for many years cared for their comatose son with love and patience. Their son Shane had been in a terrible automobile accident just two weeks before he was to leave for his mission. For twenty years his parents tended him, never taking a vacation. During the long years of their trial, they remained humble, maintaining "a spirit of faith, optimism, and gratitude" and never questioning God's purposes.<sup>15</sup><br><br>Bishop Edgley went on to tell about more of his heroes who did not hold high or prominent callings in the Church nor were widely known to the general membership of the Church but who were all humble and relied on the Lord to help them meet life's challenges. They did not seek position, prominence, or fame but did the unnoticed and the unspectacular, humbly and righteously. He said, "Their humility leads to submissiveness to the Lord's will. And ... in spite of the difficulties and trials of life, they are able to maintain a sense of gratitude for God's blessings and life's goodness."<sup>16</sup> The people he described were regular people who were able to combat the prideful natural man and feelings of enmity by being submissive to God and acknowledging their dependence on the Lord. In this, we, like them, can be in harmony with our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.<br><h3><b><i>4. Search, Ponder, and Pray</i></b></h3><br>When Jesus visited the Nephites, He commanded them to search the scriptures diligently.<sup>17</sup> He told them to ponder on the things He had said.<sup>18</sup> And He taught them how to pray.<sup>19</sup> They obeyed. The scriptures say, "And it came to pass that they did do all things even as Jesus had commanded them."<sup>20</sup> Searching the scriptures, pondering, and praying helped them be more like Christ and live in peace for two hundred years. When we include this last example from the Nephites in our efforts to be one with God, we will be more in tune with Him.<br><br>Why are the scriptures so important that prophets of all ages have taken and continue to take the time to record the word of God? And why are we commanded to search them?<br><br>Elder Daniel L. Johnson gave us the key when he said, "One of the primary purposes of the scriptures is to help us know, understand, and become like the Savior (see 3 Nephi 27:27). Continually studying the scriptures helps us keep our eyes, minds, and hearts focused on Him."<sup>21</sup> The scriptures bring us to Christ and show us how to be like Him.<br><br>To get the full benefit of the scriptures, we need to not only search them but also ponder them and pray about them. These three separate activities go hand in hand. Doing only one of the activities by itself is not enough to move us in the direction we want to go. Doing only one will not reduce the difference between God's and our own frequencies.<br><br>Take Nephi for example. In his history we learn how he searched, pondered, and prayed. He had a great desire to know the mysteries of God, so he cried unto the Lord.<sup>22</sup> He searched the scriptures.<sup>23</sup> He told us that he pondered them in his heart.<sup>24</sup> He said, "For my soul delighteth in the scriptures, and my heart pondereth them."<sup>25</sup> His great knowledge and love of the scriptures allowed him to quote the prophets and use their teachings to teach and preach, call his brothers to repentance, and even at times confound them. But, more important, by searching, pondering, and praying, he was able to become more like the Savior.<br><br>Nephi's experience was very different from that of his older brothers. Laman and Lemuel grew up in the same household as Nephi and were taught the scriptures by their father. Nephi read many things unto them that were written in the books of Moses.<sup>26</sup> Yet they were stiffnecked and murmured against their father "because they knew not the dealings of ... God."<sup>27</sup> They had the scriptures and they were taught from the scriptures, but they did not put forth the effort to search, ponder, and pray about them. They therefore were not in tune with the Savior.<br><br>If they had included the companion activities of pondering and praying with their scripture study, perhaps they would have had experiences like those described by Sister CherylC. Lant in the October 2005 general conference. She said of the scriptures, "'My heart pondereth them.' How I love to carry the scriptures with me in my heart! The spirit of what I have read rests there to bring me peace and comfort."<sup>28</sup><br><br>When we ponder the scriptures in our hearts and let them rest there, it is like they settle there, where they can influence our decisions and actions throughout the day and give us comfort as well as ideas and thoughts. Sister Lant went on to say that when she ponders the scriptures, something happens to her. She said, "I have a stronger desire to live close to my Heavenly Father. Ilong to serve Him. Iwant to live the principles that I learn in the scriptures."<sup>29 </sup>She then added prayer to the mix andsaid:<br><br><i> I find that if I pray not only to have a witness of the truthfulness of the scriptures but also to have the Spirit with me as I read, my sensitivity is heightened, and I see ever so much more clearly. I can see where I am in my life and where my Heavenly Father wants me to be. I can understand principles of truth, and I can see how to make the needed changes in my life. I can feel assured that the Lord will help and strengthen me to accomplish the task.</i><sup>30</sup><br><br>Searching, pondering, and praying are hard work and take practice. We cannot get to be in tune by merely asking or by simply reading or by just thinking about things. We need to combine all three and work at it. Trying to take the easy way would be like Oliver Cowdery in his efforts to translate the Book of Mormon. The Lord told him, "Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me."<sup>31</sup> To have the blessings promised us when we search, ponder, and pray, we need to do the work.<br><h2><b>Following the Example of the Nephites</b></h2><br>Preparing for the temple dedication gave me the chance to work and practice so that I could offer the Lord my best, and even though my best wasn't perfect, it was a beautiful experience. The gift I was given of being part of a wonderful choir, performing at the temple dedication, and having a special connection with my grandmother has increased my desire to be in tune with my Heavenly Father and Savior.<br><br>As each of us considers what changes we can make in our lives in order to be more like our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and match our desires and actions with Theirs--to be on the same wavelength--let us remember the example of the Nephites who were visited and taught by the Savior. These people received the prophets and stoned them not. They did more than just raise their hands. Theyloved their prophets; they prayed for them, and they adhered to their teachings. These people did not allow contention. They dealt justly with each other and were "one, thechildren of Christ." These people were humble, not prideful. They had no enmity toward God or their fellowmen. These people also searched the scriptures, pondered the word of God, and prayed. They understood the importance of the scriptures in helping them know, understand, and become like the Savior by keeping their eyes, minds, and hearts focused on Him. These people did the things the Savior asked them to do, and He asks us todo the same.<br><br>May we be like these righteous Nephites and heed the Savior's commandment when He said, "What manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am."<sup>32 </sup>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Rebecca Schroeder was acquisitions librarian and department chair of the Material Acquisitions Department in the BYU Harold B.

<br>
Many who speak at a Brigham Young University devotional make reference to their experiences as students at BYU and the insights they have gained by attending devotionals. I can't do that because I never attended BYU. I am a Utah State University Aggie, and my Aggie blue runs deep. I am a big Cougar fan, but even after twenty years of holding season tickets for BYU basketball and football, I still can't bring myself to sing, "Rise and shout."<br><br>In those same twenty years I have also attended devotionals as a faculty member and have heard the testimonies of many of my colleagues and felt the spirit of many students as they have borne testimony through music. I am particularly humbled by this opportunity to speak to you today in a place where prophets and apostles have taught and testified.<br><br><b>Do We Really Believe in the Resurrection?</b><br><br>I am the youngest in a family of four boys, and about twenty-two years ago I was encouraged to apply for a faculty opening here at BYU in the Department of Mathematics. At the time, I was a faculty member at Oregon State University, and my three older brothers lived in Iowa, Washington, and California, while my parents lived in Logan, Utah. In addition to this being a great opportunity for me to come to BYU, it allowed me to be a little closer to my parents, because their health was failing.<br><br>My father did not want my decision to move to Utah to be based in any way on helping him and my mother. He was very proud of the fact that his sons were contributing to the kingdom outside of Utah. My wife, Shauna, and I felt that the move to BYU was the right decision, and we arrived here in August 1996.<br><br>Six months after our arrival in Provo, my father had surgery in Salt Lake City to repair a heart valve. Ten years earlier his original valve had been replaced with a pig valve, at which time he contracted hepatitis C. Because this pig valve was now failing, the doctors decided to replace it with a mechanical valve. During the surgery the doctors realized that the hepatitisC had wreaked havoc on my father's liver, which made the heart surgery very traumatic on his body. This was the beginning of a seventeen-day roller coaster ride.<br><br>At this time my mother's health was not good, so she was only able to visit my dad about every two to three days. Thus the responsibility of visiting my father and communicating with the doctors fell to my wife and me. One or the other of us would travel from Mapleton, about ten miles south of Provo, to the hospital in Salt Lake City every day. Many times my wife would visit in the afternoon, and I would spend the evening at the hospital, or vice versa. This was particularly challenging because we had four children ranging in age from three to nine.<br><br>I referred to this time as a roller coaster ride because on one day a particular doctor would be pessimistic and on the next day another doctor would be optimistic about the eventual outcome. These varied opinions and outlooks greatly affected my emotions as I went to visit my father.<br><br>I remember driving up State Street toward the hospital in Salt Lake City and feeling the dread of what I might hear from the doctors on that day and wondering to myself, "Am I afraid of my dad dying?" I also thought to myself, "I have a testimony of the Atonement of Jesus Christ and of His Resurrection. Am I afraid of death? Do I really believe I will see my father again?"<br><br>It is this question of "Do we really believe?" that will be the focus of my comments today. As I pose this question, I do not do so to introduce doubt, because when I was going through these trials associated with my father's time in the hospital, I never really doubted my testimony. Instead I wondered why I was feeling this wide swing of emotions when I knew I did have a testimony that the Atonement of Jesus Christ would allow me to see my father again.<br><br>Moroni 7:41 says:<br><br><i>And what is it that ye shall hope for? Behold I say unto you that ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ and the power of his resurrection, to be raised unto life eternal, and this because of your faith in him according to the promise.</i><br><br>I believed this scripture, but this was the first time I had had to directly apply it in my life. We don't truly gain a testimony of many principles of the gospel until we exercise faith and apply those principles in our lives. I already had a testimony of the blessings of paying tithing, a testimony that Joseph Smith saw God and Jesus Christ, and a testimony of God's presence in the temple because I had had many opportunities to test these principles and had had confirming experiences about them. Facing the death of my father, however, was my first opportunity to test my faith and understanding of the Resurrection.<br><br>On what gospel principles is your testimony based, and are there principles or doctrines about which you ask, "Do I really believe?"<br><br>As I faced this trial, I recalled something that my father had told me many times growing up: "Hold fast to the things you know are true, and the answers to the rest will come to you intime."<br><br>When my father was a young man, he struggled to understand why worthy black male members of the Church could not hold the priesthood. He went to his bishop with this question and was given these words of advice: "Hold fast to the things you know are true, and the answers to the rest will come to you in time." He heeded this counsel and often shared it with my brothers and me. For our family, June 8, 1978, was a day of celebration and a confirmation for my father that "the answers totherest will come to you in time."<br><br>Interestingly, I have heard this same idea shared many times in recent general conference talks. Elder JeffreyR. Holland counseled us in April 2013 to "hold fast to what you already know and stand strong until additional knowledge comes" ("Lord, I Believe," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2013).<br><br>Later that same year, President DieterF. Uchtdorf admonished, "First doubt your doubts before you doubt your faith" ("Come, Join with Us," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2013; see F.F. Bosworth, <i>Christ the Healer</i> [Grand Rapids, Michigan: Chosen Books, 2008], 23).<br><br>During a talk in October 2014, Elder NeilL. Andersen said, "We do not discard something we know to be true because of something we do not yet understand" ("Joseph Smith," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2014).<br><br>And, similarly, Elder KevinW. Pearson taught us in April 2015 that "when adversity comes, don't let something you don't fully understand unravel everything you do know. Be patient, cling to truth; understanding will come" ("Stay by the Tree," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2015).<br><br>When I was on this trying journey of driving to the hospital each day and was facing the fact that my father might not recover, I held fast to the testimony I did have of various gospel principles, and I knew that someday I would better understand the Resurrection. One thing that I have since come to realize is that the main contributing factor to the swing in my emotions at this time was the fear of the temporary loss of association with my father.<br><br>One of the main things we enjoy about our families is spending time with them. My father never missed attending a game in which I participated as a young man. Whether it was church basketball or high school football or basketball, he never missed a game. We also attended many Utah State University basketball games together and even had a chance to attend a Jazz basketball game in the month before his surgery. I believe that one cause of my fears as I drove to the hospital was not a doubt of my testimony but the sadness I would feel in not being able to spend time with him.<br><br>After seventeen days in the hospital, my father passed away, and I was forced to consider the question "Do I really believe in the Resurrection and Atonement?" The fact that I never really doubted my testimony during this trying time is consistent with my patriarchal blessing, which states that I have been blessed with the gift of faith--the gift of a believing heart. This believing heart came, in part, from my mother. At her funeral, my older brother, Mark, quoted Alma 56:48: "We do not doubt our mothers knew it." All three of my brothers and I knew that there was no doubt in our mother's testimony, and we are all the beneficiaries of her gift of faith.<br><br><b>Do We Really Believe That People Can Change?</b><br><br>Since all of us will be challenged at one time or another about what we really believe, I will now examine a few other places in our lives and in our testimonies in which the question "Do we really believe?" may arise.<br><br>My wife, Shauna, has listened to the radio talk show host Dr. Laura for many years. Dr.Laura Schlessinger is a marriage and family therapist who fields phone calls to help people deal with problems in their relationships. Perhaps some of you have listened to her show or maybe your parents have or maybe some of you have called her for advice with regard to someone you are dating right now. I have listened to this show many times while driving long distances with my wife, but because Dr. Laura is so confrontational with the people who call in, it makes me uncomfortable. This discomfort is a good thing for me, however, because it helps me stay awake while driving long distances.<br><br>One of the common types of phone calls Dr.Laura receives is a husband or wife calling in to describe a behavior or a problem regarding his or her spouse that the caller would liketo change or fix. Dr. Laura often asks if thecaller knew that the spouse had the ­problem while they were dating, and the answer is usually yes. Dr. Laura then says that she can't help because the person knew about the spouse's flaw before they got ­married, and now the caller has to deal with it. Although not necessarily intentional, I believe one underlying message of her counsel in these types of situations is that people can't change. I have always been bothered by this message that people can't change because it seems so inconsistent with my understanding of the Atonement.<br><br>Do we really believe that people can change? I believe they can. Intellectually I have known this for years, but I didn't gain a strong testimony of the principle until I served as a bishop. In this ecclesiastical role I had the opportunity to counsel with a man who was struggling with pornography and had been for many years. Ialso counseled with his wife about the emotions she was experiencing at this challenging time. Because he had hidden his addiction from her for so long, she didn't know if he could ever overcome this struggle. She didn't know if she could ever trust himagain.<br><br>As we visited one evening, the following thought came clearly to my mind: "If you truly believe in the Atonement of Jesus Christ, you have to believe that people can change. If you don't believe a person can change, then you don't believe in the Atonement." In that moment I was taught by the Holy Ghost for the benefit of this sister. Simultaneously, my testimony of the Atonement's power to change people also increased.<br><br><b>Do We Really Believe in the Words oftheProphets?</b><br><br>Let us consider another example. In my current study of the Book of Mormon, I have been reading the student manual for Book of Mormon institute classes. For 1 Nephi 10 and 11 the manual poses the question "What principles for receiving revelation can you identify from Nephi's experience?" (<i>Book of Mormon Student Manual: Religion 121–122</i> [Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2009], 25). With this question in mind, I gained some new insights as I read 1 Nephi 11:1–5, which states:<br><br><i>For it came to pass after I had desired to know the things that my father had seen, and believing that the Lord was able to make them known unto me, as I satpondering in mine heart I wascaught awayin the Spirit of the Lord, yea, into an exceedingly highmountain, which I never had before seen, and upon which I never had before set my foot.</i><br><br><i>And the Spirit said unto me: Behold, what desirestthou?</i><br><br><i>And I said: I desire to behold the things which myfather saw.</i><br><br><i>And the Spirit said unto me: Believest thou that thy father saw the tree of which he hath spoken?</i><br><br><i>And I said: Yea, thou knowest that Ibelieve all thewords of my father.</i><br><br>There were two phrases in these verses that really jumped out at me: "believing that the Lord was able to make them known unto me" in verse 1 and "thou knowest that Ibelieve all the words of my father" in verse 5.<br><br>Put simply, the first phrase indicates that Nephi believed that if he asked, God would answer. Maybe this seems obvious to many of you, but it jumped out at me in my recent reading because I am not sure I always believe God will answer when I pray. Rather, I believe He will answer, but I am not sure I am going to understand or recognize that answer.<br><br>I also find it significant that Nephi said he believed all the words of his father, because his father was also a prophet. Nephi's general mind-set was that he believed in the words of the prophet, but he wanted to understand those words better. To do this, he knew that he could ask God because he believed God would answer his inquiry.<br><br>In a world in which the beliefs of those in "the great and spacious building" (1 Nephi 11:36) get further and further away from the doctrines of the Church, it becomes more and more common for the words of the prophet to be at odds with the beliefs of the world. How do we respond when those conflicts exist? Do we believe, as Nephi did, in all of the words of the prophet and turn to God in prayer, believing that He will answer our honest inquiries, or do we doubt and turn to our peers or the Internet for reinforcement of the messages of the great and spacious building?<br><br><b>Do We Really Believe God Will Answer OurPrayers?</b><br><br>It is interesting to contrast Nephi with his brothers Laman and Lemuel on this same ­matter of understanding their father's dream. In 1 Nephi 15, Nephi returned to his father's tent after having been taught by an angel and by the Spirit. He found Laman and Lemuel arguing about the meaning of Lehi's dream. It is at this point that we have the following interchange, starting in verse 8:<br><br><i>And I said unto them: Have yeinquiredof the Lord?</i><br><br><i>And they said unto me:Wehave not; for the Lord maketh no such thing known unto us. </i>[1 Nephi 15:8–9]<br><br>Notice the contrast in attitude between Nephi and his brothers. Nephi <i>believed</i> that God would teach him about Lehi's dream while Laman and Lemuel said that the Lord wouldn't answer their prayers. Continuing on in verse 11, Nephi counseled:<br><br><i>Do ye not remember the things which the Lord hath said?--If ye will not harden your hearts, andaskme in faith, believing that ye shall receive, with diligence in keeping my commandments, surely these things shall be made known unto you.</i><br><br>Nephi reminded his brothers that if they believed they would receive an answer and "surely these things shall be made known unto [them]."<br><br>We see similar contrasting attitudes between Nephi and his brothers when they returned to Jerusalem to seek the plates of brass. In 1 Nephi 3:31 we see that Laman and Lemuel didn't believe that they could get the plates when they said, "[Laban] can slay fifty; then why not us?"<br><br>Nephi showed his believing heart in 1 Nephi 4:1 when he said that God "is mightier than all the earth, then why not mightier than Laban and his fifty?"<br><br>When we pray, do we really believe that we will receive an answer? When we are prompted to do challenging things, do we really believe that we can overcome obstacles to do so?<br><br>Iknow that I need to be more believing in these situations. What is your belief when you pray? Do you believe that God will answer your prayers and that you will understand those answers?<br><br><b>Does Our Behavior Testify What We ReallyBelieve?</b><br><br>Another way to look at the question "Do we really believe?" is to ask ourselves, "Can the people with whom I interact see what I believe by the way I act?"<br><br>When I was young, my family was very active in the Church, but my parents struggled to hold family home evening or family scripture study. We did have the occasional family prayer, but it was not a regular habit. And yet my brothers and I have all served missions, have all been faithful in our testimonies, and have all served faithfully in various callings throughout our lives.<br><br>I have often wondered how my parents nurtured their sons' testimonies when they didn't do the basics of family prayer, family scripture study, or family home evening. I know we have been counseled by the prophets to do these things, and I believe they have had a positive influence on my children as Shauna and I have tried to do them in our home. This is why I was puzzled at my parents' success when they didn't do these basics. I have come to realize that my parents taught us the gospel by the way they lived.<br><br>Although my mother's health limited the callings she held, she never let her health struggles get in the way of my father's service. When I was a teenager my father was the bishop of our ward, but my mother was only able to attend church once or twice a month. Regardless of how she felt, she always supported my dad in his time-consuming callings, from Scoutmaster to bishop to stake president. There was never any doubt of what she believed.<br><br>Some examples of my father teaching me what he believed were seen in his day-to-day actions. First, as a home teacher of an older sister in the ward, he spent many evenings working at her home breaking up concrete and laying forms so that she could have a new driveway. Second, as an Explorer Scout advisor, he organized the selling of eggs, lightbulbs, and candy to raise money to take the Explorers to Southern California. Third, as a deacons quorum advisor, he got up early every Sunday morning for a few years to help one of his deacons deliver newspapers so that this young man could make it to priesthood meeting on time.<br><br>One final example of how we saw my father's beliefs through his actions comes from my niece Amberly and her husband, Jason. When they were dating they went to visit my father in the month before his surgery. Since Amberly was attending Ricks College--now BYU–Idaho--in Rexburg, she would often go to Logan on the weekends to visit her grandparents, and she had seen my father's health deteriorate. On this particular visit she had brought Jason, who was then her boyfriend. Being the boyfriend, Jason slept on the couch, and there he witnessed my father restlessly wandering about the house all night trying to find a comfortable chair in which he could sleep.<br><br>This restless night preceded a Sunday morning when my father was scheduled to teach a Gospel Doctrine class in his ward. As Amberly and Jason watched my father walk across the church parking lot, they wondered if he would make it because each step required great effort and concentration. Here is the rest of the story in Amberly's own words:<br><br><i>When it came time for his Gospel Doctrine ­lesson, he taught Alma 5. I knew he was dying. He had been dying for several years, and as I sat listening to one of my favorite people in the world talk about being prepared to meet God, I was overwhelmed by the Spirit and my love for my grandpa. Personal preparation is a lifelong effort, and my grandpa was a living example of that preparation.</i><br><br><i> He ended his powerful lesson by saying, "I hope that when I leave this life and see God, I can say, asthe Apostle Paul did: 'I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith</i><i>'</i><i>"</i> [2Timothy 4:7]<i>. I knew what a fight he had made just to get into the building. And then he stood for fifty minutes to teach the lesson. He had fought a good fight, finished his course, and kept the faith that very day. My perspective on preparation and enduring to the end was forever changed by the faithful example of my grandpa that day.</i><br><br>On that day, my niece and her boyfriend saw the strength of my father's testimony and saw what he believed through the faithful way in which he magnified his calling.<br><br>I am currently serving in the bishopric of a young single adult ward in south Provo. A few weeks ago in elders quorum we were discussing Sister Bonnie L. Oscarson's recent general conference talk titled "Do I Believe?" (<i>Ensign,</i> May 2016). A member of the quorum made the following observation: "If your words don't match your actions, then you don't really believe."<br><br>Are your words consistent with your actions? Does your behavior testify what you really believe? Do your actions testify to your children what you believe, just as my parents' actions testified to me?<br><br><b>"Help Thou Mine Unbelief"</b><br><br>In the April 2013 general conference Elder Jeffrey R. Holland taught us abouta father who went to the Savior pleading for help with his son (see "Lord, I Believe," <em>Ensign,</em> May 2013). The father described a son who was possessed of "a dumb spirit" (Mark 9:17) and who was continually doing harm to himself. The family was at the end of their rope. Tothe father's pleading the Savior responded:<br><br><i>If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.</i><br><br><i>And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief. </i>[Mark 9:23–24]<br><br>The significance of this story for me is in the way the father responded to his unbelief. He had a belief in some teachings of the Savior and was seeking help with his unbelief. The father was likely asking himself if he really believed his son could be healed, but rather than turning away from the gospel, he pled for help with his unbelief.<br><br>All of us here have a belief in some principle of the gospel or have had a spiritual experience at some point upon which our testimony rests. Do we respond as this father did by seeking help with our unbelief, or do we "discard something we know to be true because of something we do not yet understand" (Andersen, "Joseph Smith")?<br><br>So how should we respond when ­trials, doubts, or questions arise? Because they certainly will. How do we respond when we are faced with questions such as Do I really believe in the Resurrection? or Do I really believe that people can change? or Do I really believe that God will answer my prayers? Where do we turn for answers to questions like these? Do we follow the example of this father from the New Testament story that Elder Holland shared by remembering what we do believe and turning to the Savior to seek help with our unbelief, or do we forget what we believe and turn to Facebook or other social media for answers to resolve our unbelief?<br><br>Laman and Lemuel took the Facebook approach because they didn't believe God would answer their prayers, and they murmured when understanding didn't come. Nephi turned to God, believing he would receive an answer, and understanding came.<br><br>I conclude where I started by sharing an experience that happened to me several weeks after my father passed away. Sitting in an elders quorum class, I was asked to read Doctrine and Covenants 138:28–30, which states:<br><br><i>And I wondered at the words of Peter--wherein he said that the Son of God preached unto the spirits in prison, who sometime were disobedient, when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah--and how it was possible for him to preach to those spirits and perform the necessary labor among them in so short a time.</i><br><br><i>And as I wondered, my eyes were opened, and my understanding quickened, and I perceived that the Lord went not in person among the wicked and the disobedient who had rejected the truth, to teach them;</i><br><br><i>But behold, from among the righteous, he organized his forces and appointed messengers, clothed with power and authority, and commissioned them to go forth and carry the light of the gospel to them that were in darkness, even to all the spirits of men; and thus was the gospel preached to the dead.</i><br><br>As I read these verses in that elders quorum lesson, the Spirit powerfully testified to me that my father was one of those missionaries sharing the gospel in the spirit world. Do I really believe in the Resurrection and that I will see my father again? <i>Yes.</i> I followed my father's counsel and held on to what I believed, and the answer did come.<br><br>When you are faced with the question of whether you really believe some principle of the gospel, I encourage you to hold fast to the things that you know are true because the answers to the rest will come to you in time. While you are waiting for your answers to come, live the gospel in a way that allows those around you to know what you really believe. Inthe name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Blake E.

<h1>asy and the Reality of Your Royal Identity - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is truly an honor and a privilege to be here with you today. When I was invited to speak at the devotional, I decided to ask my children what they felt was most important for BYU students to know. My eleven-year-old son, Nathan, said to tell you to <i>not</i> vote for a particular presidential candidate, who shall remain unnamed. My only daughter, Hannah, age eight, has three brothers. She felt that the most important thing to say should be directed at all the men and boys here in the audience in regard to their bathroom hygiene. Hannah and Nathan both offered some pretty sound advice, but I was particularly touched by the response from my five-year-old, Aidan. He said it was important to know that "God is special--and you are special."<br><br>I pondered Aidan's words for some time. How can we know that we are special? More important, how can we know who we truly are?<br><br>Today I would like to talk about your royal identity.<br><br>When Elaine S. Dalton was the Young Women general president, she said:<br><br><i>Like the king's son, each of you has inherited a royal birthright. Each of you has a divine heritage. "You are literally the royal daughters of our Father in Heaven." Each of you was born to be a queen.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2010/04/remember-who-you-are?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>1</sup></a><br><br>What does it mean to be truly royal and what are the eternal implications of being royal? I study the effect of media on children and families. I just finished a study on the effect of the superhero and princess culture on children. If you have ever been around a preschool child, you know that both superheroes and princesses are very popular with this age group. In fact, many children this age say that they would like to <i>be</i> a superhero or a princess when they growup.<br><br>I have been thinking quite a lot about superheroes and princesses over the past few years, and I would like to structure my talk with these two groups in mind. I will mainly be directing my comments on superheroes to the men in the room and my comments on princesses to the women. However, there are many overlaps in both categories, and I hope you can find things that apply to you in both sections.<br><h2><b>Superheroes</b></h2><br>I would first like to talk about the fantasy and reality of superheroes. Some of the most popular movies of all time have featured superheroes. Why are superheroes so popular today? Superheroes are pretty cool. We would like to imagine ourselves being able to fly faster than a speeding bullet, see through buildings, or be almost invincible. But there are definitely some fantasies and fallacies that are portrayed by superheroes in popular media.<br><h3><b><i>Hypermasculinization</i></b></h3><br>Because of your royal identity, you will one day have more power than the most powerful superhero. You have the potential to become limitless. As cool as superheroes are, they are not always the greatest of role models in terms of power. First of all, superheroes tend to embody a hypermasculinization that is stereo­typical and that I believe is not very helpful. They are often brash, arrogant, angry, and aggressive, and they take a lot of risks. Some of them misunderstand or abuse their power. It seems that to be a superhero or even to be a man, one needs to embody some pretty negative behaviors.<br><br>Bishop Gérald Caussé spoke out on the troubling portrayal of superheroes in the media in arecent <a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/gerald-causse_weak-strong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BYU devotional</a>:<br><br><i>The world values the cult of the invincible. Super­heroes, from Batman to Superman, abound in our media. This ideology leads to dangerous behavior. We see people who want to hide their problems under the appearance of strength through boasting, aggressiveness, or abusive behaviors. Some are so obsessed with outperforming others that they turn to drugs </i><i>or other stimulants in order to do so. Still ­others lose themselves in egotism and self-­admiration. These forms of pride lead to disappointment, ­ineffectiveness, or worse.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>Prescribing a one-size-fits-all mentality that is largely influenced by the superhero culture may be damaging to our young boys and men. Weaknesses are not tolerated, and humility, empathy, emotional connection, and softness are not valued under this approach. Indeed, I feel like some of the most damaging words you can say to a young boy who is showing softness or is in emotional pain is "be a man" or "man up." In my opinion, the hypermasculinization we so value in the superhero culture is a complete distortion and takes us away from understanding our royal identity.<br><h3><b><i>The Muscular Ideal</i></b></h3><br>Part of accepting your royal identity is understanding the purpose of your body here on earth. Another fantasy that takes us away from our true identity is very common in the superhero culture and is called the muscular ideal. Superheroes in popular media tend to look very similar. They are extremely muscular and have broad shoulders and small waists. Research suggests that exposure to these types of images and media models is related to body dissatisfaction and depression in men.<br><br>We almost never talk to men about their body image. There are quite a few conference talks on this topic directed to women, but for some reason we ignore the men. Indeed, we know that "the spirit and the body are the soul of man,"<sup>3</sup> so this is not insubstantial. Your body is a gift from your Heavenly Father, and I strongly believe that one of Satan's primary attacks on your esteem is to diminish your respect for your body. He will try to make you feel like you aren't good enough or that you don't measure up.<br><br>Sister Susan W. Tanner, former Young Women general president, said:<br><br>[Satan] <i>seduces some to despise their bodies; others he tempts to worship their bodies. In either case, he entices the world to regard the body merely as an object. In the face of so many satanic falsehoods about the body, I want to raise my voice today in support of the sanctity of the body. I testify that the body is a gift to be treated with gratitude and respect.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2005/10/the-sanctity-of-the-body?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>4</sup></a><br><br>Men, please do not worry about trying to conform to the muscular ideal we see in the superhero culture. Please do not view your bodhttps://www.lds.org/general-conference/2005/10/the-sanctity-of-the-body?lang=engy as merely an object meant to be honed to ultimate perfection. When I picture Christ, I picture the ultimate superhero--but I do not picture Him as being particularly muscular, as men are portrayed in the media today. You are created in the express image of our Heavenly Father and are His royal heir. That means our bodies look like His. In the eternities, I cannot imagine everyone walking around looking like they are on steroids! Instead, I imagine individuals of different shapes and sizes and an acceptance as our royal identities are made clear.<br><br>Russell M. Nelson, president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, said:<br><br><i>The marvel of our physical bodies is often over­looked. Who has not encountered feelings of low self-esteem because of physique or appearance? </i><i>Many people wish their bodies could be more to their </i><i>liking....</i><br><br><i>Your body, whatever its natural gifts, is a magnificent creation of God </i>[see Psalm 8:3–5; see also Hebrews 2:7, 9].<i>It is a tabernacle of flesh--a temple for your spirit</i> [see 1 Corinthians 6:19].<i> A study of your body attests to its divine design.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>Do not buy into the fantasy of the superhero culture when you think about the profound gift of your body from your Heavenly Father. Your acceptance of your body is a key part in understanding your royal identity.<br><br>Now on to the realities of becoming a superhero.<br><h3><b><i>The Reality of a True Villain</i></b></h3><br>In every superhero story there is also an ultimate villain: the Joker, Loki, Magneto, or Lex Luthor. One of my favorite superhero stories is from the animated film <i>The Incredibles.</i><sup>6</sup> If you remember the story, there was a little boy named Buddy who wanted more than anything to be a superhero, but he didn't have any real superhero power. He became angry and decided to devote his life to trying to destroy the real superheroes and prove how much smarter and more powerful he was than the Incredibles. Buddy changed his name to Syndrome and ended up becoming a very evil person, even though he started out wanting to help others.<br><br>There is a very real and very evil villain in the story of our lives. Satan will try anything to turn you to his dark side. Just like Buddy, he started out with a different name, Lucifer, but his name was changed to Satan when he became truly evil. The irony is that Satan couldhave become powerful if he would have trusted in his Father in Heaven and in Jesus Christ's plan. Instead, he was too impatient and power hungry, which ultimately led to hisundoing.<br><br>Luckily, in our story we know the ending in the ultimate battle between good and evil. There will be a final showdown someday. Even though Satan will be more powerful than any villain we see in the superhero culture today, Christ <i>will </i>win the day. Good <i>will </i>conquer evil. This gives me great hope and comfort as I look at the evil of the world and sometimes despair. Even when I think Satan has won over the hearts of mankind, I know that this will not beour final destiny.<br><h3><b><i>The Characteristics of a True Superhero</i></b></h3><br>I would now like to focus on the characteristics of becoming a true superhero, of truly embracing the qualities that will prepare you to become royal someday. Batman, Captain America, Iron Man, and Spider-Man all have some excellent redeeming qualities, yet they pale in comparison with the ultimate superhero: Jesus Christ.<br><br>When I think of a real superhero, I imagine someone who is empathetic. He is someone who is "willing to mourn with those that mourn ... and comfort those that stand in need of comfort."<sup>7</sup> He is soft, gentle, tender, and kind. He understands his emotions and he uses them to bless the lives of others. We see none of the arrogance or brashness portrayed in the media--instead we see humility and an understanding and acceptance of one's own weaknesses.<br><br>One of my favorite characteristics of a true superhero is being a defender. Many of the superheroes portrayed in the media are wonderful defenders. Unfortunately they typically defend others in a violent way. I study bullying in childhood, and there is a small group of children who are termed "defenders." These children see someone picking on someone else and are willing to stand up for the victim, to get a teacher, and to tell the bully to stand down. Defending someone against the schoolyard bully takes a unique type of bravery and courage.<br><br>I once saw a news article about some truly amazing children from the Bridgewater, Massachusetts, area. Danny Keefe, age six, suffered a severe brain hemorrhage after birth, and his parents worried that he might have some serious developmental delays. Danny wears a jacket, a tie, and a fedora to school every day and has some speech problems. He is also the official "water coach" for the Peewee Football League Bridgewater Badgers, an older group of fifth-grade boys.<br><br>Some of the kids at school started picking on Danny for the way that he spoke and for his choice in outfits. The boys on the football team heard about this and decided to show their support for Danny by starting a Danny Appreciation Day and dressing up just like Danny. The quarter­back of the football team said:<br><br><i>We heard that Danny was getting picked on, so we thought that we would all have a day to dress up like Danny. We thought we would all come to school like Danny and sponsor Danny to show Danny that we love him--that we love him very much.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>In my view, these boys are superheroes--better, in fact, than so many of the superheroes we see in the media. They were able to defend someone who was being hurt without resorting to aggression themselves.<br><br>I just finished doing a study on superheroes and defending in preschool boys. We found that boys did <i>not </i>pick up the defending themes in superhero media and that they were no more likely to be defenders than their peers who were less into the superhero culture. In fact, they were actually more aggressive than their peers! However, I suspect that one way to learn how to become a defender would be to study and try to emulate Christ--the Ultimate Defender of mankind.<br><br>One of my favorite stories in the New Testa­ment is that of the woman caught in adultery:<br><br><i>And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,</i><br><br><i>They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>This was a pretty serious crime, and there was no doubt that she was guilty. The law at the time allowed for her to be stoned to death--a truly terrible way to die. She must have been so afraid.<br><br><i>But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote onthe ground, as though he heard them not.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>The scribes and Pharisees continued to press Him, and in His kind and wise manner He said, "He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her."<sup>11</sup><br><br>By His very example Christ defended the woman, and the crowds, "being convicted by their own conscience,"<sup>12</sup> left her alone.<br><br>Later, Christ asked:<br><br><i>Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</i><br><br><i>She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</i><sup>13</sup><br><h3><b><i>My Boys</i></b></h3><br>I want so badly for my three boys to understand what it means to be a true superhero:<br><br>• To be kind, honest, and true.<br><br>• To defend those who cannot defend themselves.<br><br>• To honor the priesthood and to be righteous defenders of Christ's authority.<br><br>• To understand where true power comes from and to respect the true source.<br><br>• To each love and respect their future wife and to be kind, gentle, and understanding fathers.<br><br>• To serve those around them and to show integrity for their values even as the world tries to knock them down.<br><br>My greatest hope for my boys is that they understand their royal identities as sons of God and live their lives in a way that would make Him proud.<br><h2><b>Princesses</b></h2><br>Now, on to the princesses. For some reason we are obsessed with royalty. I did my graduate work in England and then worked there for a few years before we moved to Utah. It was so interesting to live in a country that had a queen and a royal family. I watched people become obsessed when Prince William married Kate Middleton--and then become even more obsessed when she gave birth first to Prince George and then to Princess Charlotte. We see this same level of obsession in the media world. For example, the Disney Princess line earns around $3 billion each year.<sup>14</sup> Our own research suggests that 96 percent of preschool girls view Disney princess media and 82 percent play with Disney princess toys.<sup>15</sup><br><br>One reason I think we are obsessed with royalty is because it speaks, in part, to the royalty within each one of us. Stop and think about this for a second. You are the child of a loving heavenly king and queen--each of us is a very real prince or princess in our own right. Speaking to the young women, President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, second counselor in the First Presidency, said:<br><br><i>You are truly royal spirit daughters of Almighty God. You are princesses, destined to become queens. Your own wondrous story has already begun. Your "once upon a time" is now.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2010/04/your-happily-ever-after?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>16</sup></a><br><br>When a king or queen is crowned, there is a grand ceremony. They are given the crown jewels, a scepter, and a diadem as marks of their royalty. The scriptures also use powerful imagery to speak to our royal destiny. Pay attention to these words:<br><br><i>But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, isfor ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.</i><sup>17</sup><br><br>Also, referring to gaining a knowledge of the Book of Mormon, we are told:<br><br><i>And those who receive it in faith, and work righteousness, shall receive a crown of eternal life.</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>Our family lived in England for six years, so we have been to London quite a few times. We visited an exhibit at the Tower of London that displays the crown jewels and the royal scepter that Queen Elizabeth was given at her coronation. I remember looking at these things and being enchanted by their beauty. I reflected on what an amazing experience that must have been for Elizabeth to have had that crown put upon her head and the scepter placed in her hand as she became the queen of England.<br><br>Each one of us will have this experience one day if we are righteous and endure to the end. I get chills when I think about what it will be like to receive not a crown and scepter of jewels but, as it says in the scriptures, "a crown of eternal life." That one is going to blow the biggest diamond on earth completely out of the water.<br><h3><b><i>We Are All Princesses</i></b></h3><br>My name, Sarah, actually means "princess" in Hebrew. Until I turned thirty and decided I needed to grow up a little, my email address was princess-sarah. So I have been thinking about this princess thing for a very long time, and I always felt like my name represented something important and something special. However, you don't need to be named princess to actually be one.<br><br>One of my favorite stories is from the film <i>ALittle Princess.</i><sup>19</sup> If you remember, this was the story of Sara Crewe, a rich little girl who ended up losing her father and living in an orphanage. One day the headmistress was being particularly mean to Sara and told her that she was not a princess anymore. Sara stood up straight and tall and told her:<br><br><i>I am a princess. All girls are! Even if they live in tiny old attics, even if they dress in rags, even if they aren't pretty or smart or young, they're still princesses.</i><sup>20</sup><br><br>These words are beyond true. No matter our circumstances in life, we are princesses or princes of a royal family, destined to become queens and kings someday. Just think of what that means for your life. How does that change the way you think about your identity and the way you manage your life?<br><br>I recently saw a beautiful picture of a girl wearing a crown. Her head was held high and her eyes were closed. Written on the picture were these words:<br><br><i>Sometimes, on dark days, I think, "Nobody cares and nobody's coming." Then I remember who sends thoughts like that, and I </i><b><i>straighten my crown.</i></b><sup>21</sup><br><br>I would like to now talk about a few fantasies about being a princess.<br><h3><b><i>Waiting for a Prince on a White Horse</i></b></h3><br>One of the most predominant storylines about princesses involves finding true love. In many of the stories, a prince rides up on a white horse to sweep the princess off her feet. He seems perfect in every way, and it is love at first sight. They kiss and ride off into a beautiful sunset together, ready to live happily ever after. Though beautiful, I think this storyline is misleading in a number of ways. First of all, I believe that the youth of today are too concerned about finding their prince and expecting him to be perfect.<br><br>Elder David A. Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles said:<br><br><i>As we visit with young adults all over the Church, often they will ask, "Well, what are the characteristics I should look for in a future spouse?" as though they have some checklist of "I need to find someone who has these three or four or five things."...</i><br><br><i>The list is not for evaluatingsomeone else. Thelist is for you ... and what ... you need to become. And so ifthere are three primary characteristics that</i>[you] <i>hope to find in an eternal companion, then those are the three things</i> [you] <i>ought to be working to become. Then</i> [you] <i>will be attractive tosomeone who has those things. ... Youarenotona shopping spree looking for the greatest value with a series of characteristics. You become what you hope your spouse will be, and you'll have a greater likelihood offinding that person.</i><sup>22</sup><br><br>Instead of focusing so much on finding your prince, I would suggest you focus more on becoming a princess. And I don't mean a bratty, materialistic, helpless type of princess. I mean a daughter of God who is secure in her royal identity, who loves to learn and to help others, and who has a strong testimony of Jesus Christ. Good things will happen when you focus more on becoming the right person and less on finding the perfect person.<br><h3><b><i>The Thin Ideal</i></b></h3><br>One other fantasy about being a princess has to do with the way they generally look in the media. Each represents what is termed the "thin ideal." They all have a similar body shape with an impossibly tiny waist, large eyes, and lustrous long hair. Research shows that internalization of the thin ideal as portrayed in the media can be damaging, having an impact on girls' body image, self-esteem, and self-worth. We start this internalization with our very youngest girls, dressing them up as princesses and complimenting them because they are so "pretty." I believe there is too much appearance-<br>based talk that happens with our young girls and not enough that focuses on their true, royal identity. Similar to what we discussed about superheroes and the muscular ideal, this talk leads to a view that there is one size that fits all. Women tend to have greater body image issues than men, and I believe that one of Satan's greatest weapons is aimed at making women feel bad about and reject their bodies.<br><br>Indeed, Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles said, "One would truly need a great and spacious makeup kit to compete with beauty as portrayed in media all around us."<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2005/10/to-young-women?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>23</sup></a><br><br>One of my favorite princess movies is <i>Brave.</i><sup>24</sup> If you remember the story, Merida is an independent young princess in Scotland. Her mother is constantly telling her how a princess should behave and tries to arrange a marriage with a host of lackluster princes. There are three princes who each decide to have an archery contest to win Merida's hand in marriage. Merida is forced to wear a corset and to watch her fate be decided by men she barely knows.<br><br>My very favorite part of the entire movie is after the three men have shot their arrows. Merida comes up, gives a royal grunt, and stretches to rip her dress apart so she can move more flexibly. She then pulls out a bow and arrow and says, "I am Merida, firstborn descendant of Clan DunBroch. And I'll be shooting for my own hand!"<sup>25</sup> She then gets a perfect bullseye.<br><br>Here Merida was taking charge of her royal future. Yes, she was meant to become queen, but she had learned that she didn't need to let others dictate the way she looked or decide her own fate. She went on to discover her true ­identity--that being a princess meant being <i>herself</i> and not some contrived princess from fairy tales long ago. She would also find love on her own terms.<br><br>To the women in this room, I cannot say this strongly enough: love who you are. And part of that means loving your body with every blemish, stretch mark, and perceived flaw. Do not waste any more of your precious time obsessing over the way you look.<br><br>In the film <i>Miss Representation,</i> Katie Couric aptly stated:<br><br><i>If women spent more time helping a sick neighbor or volunteering at a homeless shelter, focusing on how to use all their energy to solve some of the world's problems--if they spent a tenth of the time thinking about those things that they do thinking about their weight, I mean, I think we'd solve all the world's problems in a matter of months.</i><sup>26</sup><br><br>Yes, we want to be healthy, but this means very different things for each person, and body acceptance may be difficult to achieve for some of us. Our Father in Heaven loves us for who we <i>are--</i>in fact, I believe He cares very little about our current dress size or how we look in a bathing suit. Remember, we are created in the image of our heavenly parents. We don't know much about our Heavenly Mother. We don't know what she looks like or even much about who she is as an individual. I can't wait to meet her someday. I have so many questions for her! I do believe that my body looks like hers in a way. I want to be respectful and true to her image and to the way that she lived her life. Now I have the gift of my body on this earth.<br><h3><b><i>Falling Asleep and Being Rescued by a Prince</i></b></h3><br>I would like to discuss one last fantasy that has a ring of truth. In many of the stories, such as those of Sleeping Beauty or Snow White, the princess falls asleep and is rescued by a prince. Ladies, we are <i>not</i> on this earth to fall asleep! Our Heavenly Father has a much bigger fairy tale in store for us.<br><br>He has asked us to serve our communities and our families and to mother and nurture the children in our care, whether they are our own children, nieces, nephews, or other children in our sphere of influence. He has asked us to learn and to grow. My advice would be to get as much education during this time of your life as you can. Rely on the Spirit as you make decisions about your education and your career.<br><br>One of my favorite quotations of all time is by President Gordon B. Hinckley in a talk called "<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2001/05/how-can-i-become-the-woman-of-whom-i-dream?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Can I Become the Woman of Whom I Dream?</a>":<br><br><i>Find purpose in your life. Choose the things you would like to do, and educate yourselves to be effective in their pursuit. For most it is very difficult to settle on a vocation. You are hopeful that you will marry and that all will be taken care of. In this day and time, a girl needs an education. She needs the means and skills by which to earn a living should she find herself in a situation where it becomes necessary to do so.</i><br><br><i>Study your options. Pray to the Lord earnestly for direction. Then pursue your course with resolution.</i><br><br><i>The whole gamut of human endeavor is now open to women. There is not anything that you cannot do if you will set your mind to it. You can include in the dream of the woman you would like to be a picture of one qualified to serve society and make a significant contribution to the world of which she will be a part.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2001/05/how-can-i-become-the-woman-of-whom-i-dream?lang=eng"><sup>27</sup></a><br><br>I resonate so much with this quotation. Our personal circumstances necessitated that I be the primary earner for our family. This was a difficult decision, and we spent many, many nights on our knees in prayer. Many people were supportive, but others were judgmental and condescending when I started working full-time at BYU.<br><br>My favorite scripture is Proverbs 3:5–6. Itsays:<br><br><i>Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</i><br><br><i>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</i><sup>28</sup><br><br>I believe that promise with all my heart. I am beyond lucky to have found a man who is my true equal, who understands, as it says in the family proclamation, that we "are obligated to help one another as equal partners."<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1995/11/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>29</sup></a> I trusted in the spiritual promptings we received that helped me know that I was meant to be at BYU. Because of the choices I made earlier in life and the education I felt prompted to receive, Iam becoming the type of scholar that I know Heavenly Father needs me to become. Your path and your future might be very different than mine. Rely closely on the Spirit and trust in the Lord with all your heart when deciding what is right for your family.<br><br>Regardless of your circumstances, we need women who can speak up and speak out. In a beautiful talk entitled "A Plea to My Sisters," President Russell M. Nelson said:<br><br><i>My dear sisters, whatever your calling, whatever your circumstances, we need your impressions, your insights, and your inspiration. We need you to speak up and speak out in ward and stake councils. We need each married sister to speak as "a </i><b><i>contributing</i></b><i>and</i><b><i>full</i></b><i> partner" as you unite with your husband in governing your family. Married or single, you sisters possess distinctive capabilities and special intuition you have received as gifts from God. We brethren cannot duplicate your unique influence.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2015/10/a-plea-to-my-sisters?lang=eng"><sup>30</sup></a><br><br>Do not be afraid to share your experiences and your insights--in a class or in a calling--especially when you are in a leadership position. We need your voices! We need you all. We need the single sisters, we need the mothers, we need the widows, we need the grandmas, we need the aunts, and we need the daughters. We need the women who work and we need the women who stay at home with their children.<br><br>I love this quote by Sister Ruth L. Renlund--Elder DaleG. Renlund's wife--who said, "One thing I've always felt strongly about is that there's no one way to be an LDS woman."<sup>31</sup> We have many roles, but we have one thing in common. We are daughters--and, I would add, princesses--of a Heavenly Father, who loves us.<sup>32</sup> And we love Him. And He needs the women of the Church more in this time than in any other. We are not here to fall asleep.<br><br>In our princess study we asked preschool girls who their favorite princess was and why. The vast majority chose Rapunzel, likely because the movie <i>Tangled</i><sup>33</sup> had just come out. The number one reason why they liked Rapunzel was because of the way she looked, with the two most common answers being because she was pretty or because she was blonde. There was only one girl in the entire study who chose Mulan<sup>34</sup> as her favorite princess. When asked why, she answered boldly, "Because she saves China."<br><br>God has asked us not only to save China but to fight for and defend our brothers and sisters across the entire world. We simply cannot do this if we fall asleep and do nothing.<br><h3><b><i>My Girl</i></b></h3><br>My little princess is my daughter, Hannah. I hope she knows that she is treasured by both her parents and by her Father in Heaven. I hope she truly understands her royal identity and that being a princess isn't just about dressing up in fancy dresses. I hope understanding this becomes a core part of her identity. I hope she understands that being a daughter of a heavenly King is knowledge that will help her get through the hard times that she will surely experience in her life. I hope she knows that being a princess comes with the responsibility to care for others, to be brave, and to be of good courage. Being a princess comes with the responsibility to not fall asleep but to truly do good in this world.<br><h2><b>The Prince of Peace</b></h2><br>I would like to end with one reality to the princess tales. Even though we are not here to fall asleep, we will be rescued by a prince. And not just any prince. He goes by many names, but one of my favorites is the Prince of Peace. Ilove my Savior Jesus Christ. I know without a shadow of a doubt that He atoned for my sins. He descended below all so that He could know exactly what we are going through. He sacrificed all so that I could live.<br><br>Christ has rescued me so many times in my life. This last year we experienced the death of a beloved niece, Nona. I am sure that I will experience more difficult things, but I have had no more painful moment in my life than watching my sister bury her only child, a princess she and her husband had so fervently wanted.<br><br>I remember one day while I was working in my office that I was so sad that I couldn't seem to work. I remember shutting down my computer, crawling under my desk, curling up in a little ball, and just sobbing. I felt like nothing could ever be right in the world again.<br><br>I began to pray for comfort and understanding. The Spirit filled the room and penetrated my heart so that I could barely breathe. I realized that Heavenly Father had also lost a child, and I imagined the pain He must have felt as He watched His Beloved Son on the cross. I was given an assurance that my niece, our little princess, was destined for royalty and that the bands of death were nothing compared to the "happily ever after" that she was currently experiencing.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>We are each of royal birth--princesses and princes in our own right. We have the potential to have greater power and reach than the most powerful superhero portrayed in the media today. Let us not waste this precious gift. Instead, let us let it shape our identity and be a comfort to us when we are going through our hardest moments. I hope that realizing you are "royal" changes the very way that you see yourself, your body, your family, your life, and your destiny.<br><br>Normally in a talk I would end by saying that I hope you all live happily after. Instead Iwill end using these more appropriate words: inthe name of the Prince of Peace, even the Savior Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Sarah M.

<h1>an Anchor of Our Souls - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I would like to share one personal observation: I have been associated with seven different universities over the course of my career. In my experience, there is nothing even remotely similar at any of those other institutions to what we are doing here today. It is remarkable what we do here each Tuesday morning. We share our testimonies and we share our experiences, and I am grateful for what I have learned from all of you as I have attended devotionals over the last twenty-two years.<br><br>What I add today to that library of devotional wisdom is not new. I am acutely aware that I am merely revisiting truths that have been taught by many others with different words, by different means, and through different personal experiences.<br><br>The seed for my thoughts today was planted more than a year ago as a successful family reunion came to an end. Even though our children are all grown, as their parents we feel some misplaced obligation to be on the last flight out and to see them all off safely. This usually gives my wife and me some extra time to visit more adult attractions while waiting for a later flight. Our preference seems to be for art museums.<br><br>On this occasion we chose a museum not too far from the airport, in which one of the traveling exhibits happened to be of sixteenth-century engravings. My general lack of enthusiasm or appreciation, probably brought on by equal measures of ignorance and fatigue, was tempered by the observation of a theme throughout many of the engravings. Series after series of engravings depicted the seven virtues and the seven deadly sins. Almost all contained precisely the same compositional elements derived from scripture.<br><br>And here is the seed that was planted: a representation of hope in many of the engravings. There were commonalities in all of these portrayals of hope: There was always a young woman looking longingly toward heaven, perhaps envisioning a brighter future in this life or in the next. There was always the symbolism of the anchor, which is referred to in scripture in numerous places, but none so directly as in Hebrews 6:19: "Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast."<br><br>I have always been curious about hope and how we obtain it. It is something we all desire. In scripture it is always sandwiched between faith and charity. What is this hope, how does it act as an anchor of our souls, and how do we obtain this hope that we all seem to so desire? Iwill endeavor to address, if not answer, some of those questions today.<br><br>I wish to dismiss rather quickly two worldly notions regarding both hope and anchors. Hope in the scriptural sense is not wishing. We use the word <i>hope</i> far too often in that shallow context and thereby confuse ourselves into believing that hope is a transitory state that can be achieved in times of duress through mere desire or anxious longing. This is not the hope that is "both sure and stedfast."<br><br>Just as hope is not the same as wishing, neither are anchors dead weight meant to slow us down or impede our progress. The proper use of an anchor is paramount to safety on the water. Having hoisted a few anchors myself, I can fully appreciate that one of the young ladies in an engraving depicting hope, although still gazing into heaven--perhaps waiting for that elusive answer to that last final exam ­question--had chosen to use the anchor for support rather than to hold it forever.<br><h2><b>A Story About Anchors</b></h2><br>In October 2000 my wife and I and two of our three children were living in Christchurch, New Zealand. BYU had provided us with a generous development leave, and we had made our home in a quaint bungalow--<i>quaint</i> meaning old, cold, drafty, and damp--adjacent to the University of Canterbury, where I was working with a colleague who was to become a good friend.<br><br>We had been there for a little more than three months when one of New Zealand's fabled storms came roaring out of the northeast. It smashed into our little neighborhood, flooding the local schools and uprooting trees and sidewalks. We had been so charmed by the garden-like nature of Christchurch that we were distraught over the wreckage around our home. As an aside, those of you who are familiar with Christchurch know that in recent years the city has suffered several major earthquakes, whose aftermath has unfortunately eclipsed our experienced disaster by orders of magnitude.<br><br>During our October storm, however, the most devastating effects were wrought on Lyttelton Harbour, just to the southeast of Christchurch. The marina at Lyttelton was almost completely destroyed, with millions of dollars in ­damage done to boats and infrastructure.<br><br>As we followed the news reports and developments, Iwas most intrigued by the stories of the vessels that had survived the storm and how their owners had effected that survival. As the storm developed, these experienced men and women were intently watching the barometer, and when it began to drop precipitously, they rushed to their boats and headed out to sea. This was entirely counterintuitive to someone of my limited experience. I would have thought that my boat would be safest in a picturesque harbor, tucked in a deepwater inlet in the hollow of an ancient volcano behind a sizable rock jetty. But not so.<br><br>The boats that had left the harbor were among the few vessels that successfully weathered the storm. They went to sea and dropped an anchor--not just any anchor but a storm, or sea, anchor. These anchors are clearly not a new invention, although the materials and technology of them have improved over time. Storm anchors are basically underwater kites or parachutes.<br><br>There are multiple purposes for this type of anchor. Even in a substantial storm, the anchor prevents the vessel from being significantly moved from its initial position. A boat that gets turned sideways in high seas is apt to capsize and founder. This anchor allows the vessel to maintain stable orientation relative to prevailing winds and predominant waves. The differential movement between the tethered vessel and the underlying waves yields a more responsive rudder, allowing the ship to navigate changes in the oncoming waves. Finally, the anchor prevents a vessel caught on a large wave from sliding headlong down and crashing into the next wave.<br><br>I am sure it is apparent where my metaphor is taking us. Real hope, based on eternal principles and spiritual experiences, is an anchor to our souls, intended to have and capable of having precisely the same effects as a sea anchor. In the storms that will descend on our seemingly safe harbor of home, family, church, and career, real hope grants us stability, affirms our orientation, and allows us to steer through troubled waters with measured progress.<br><br>So where can I procure one of these anchors against the storms of life? I would really like to give them as Christmas presents to my children and grandchildren. Sadly, they cannot be purchased in the way that the world purchases goods and services. Instead I will share my favorite scripture with my children and grandchildren and with all of you.<br><h2><b>Paul's Spiritual Learning Cycle</b></h2><br>In Romans 5:3–4, Paul described the process by which we gain that hope that is real and eternal:<br><br><i>And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;</i><br><br><i> And patience, experience; and experience, hope.</i><br><br>The first thing we notice is that this is just a normal learning cycle. I have seen this cycle in my children, in myself, and in most of my students here at BYU. The greatest learning opportunities come in the chaos and confusion of a failed experiment, in a clash of ideas, and in moments of doubt. They come in recognizing that we do not know all things, that our preconceived notions are perhaps incorrect, and that the acquisition of knowledge is not simply a matter of memorizing facts and figures.<br><br>In my learning cycles, personally, patience is always the hardest part. Patience is the long, hard slog through data. It is experiencing misguided assumptions and repeated failures. It is the careful attention to nuance and detail. It is a matter of great and continual effort.<br><br>And we repeat this cycle over and over and over again, adding to our knowledge, understanding, and confidence. Confidence, by the way, is merely the worldly version of hope.<br><br>But Paul was not speaking of worldly or secular knowledge here. He was speaking in a spiritual sense, which is clearly taught in the foundation that he laid for verses 3 and 4, which I have not yet shared with you. In verses 1 and 2 he gave us a clear understanding of the critical element that makes this learning cycle not just a worldly endeavor but a spiritual one:<br><br><i>Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:</i><br><br><i> By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.</i><br><br><i> And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;</i><br><br><i> And patience, experience; and experience, hope.</i><br><br>Paul, speaking spiritually, affirmed that my hope, real hope--that anchor of my soul, both sure and steadfast--is only to be found when it has its genesis in my faith in the Savior.<br><br>Paul also told me something that I did not necessarily want to hear: that the storms in this life are a necessary part of our progression. They represent a progression in our spiritual knowledge and understanding that is just as sure as our acquisition of academic knowledge. The cycle is the same. Why should we think that it would require any less effort? Why do some--or many in our day--propose that if God were real, if Christ had been His Son, and if the Restoration was all that important, then all of this would be self-evident, rendered to our full vision without effort on our part?<br><br>That is not how it works--in any aspect of our lives. When confronted with tribulation and trials, we rely upon our faith to keep us in the path facing the right direction. We then call upon the Lord for assistance and succor. We wait patiently for the hand of the Lord to be revealed. We recognize that promises have been kept and that we have been sustained, even when that sustenance comes in a form or at a time that is remarkably different from that which we have envisioned, requested, or expected.<br><br>As we traverse round after round of this spiritual learning cycle, we gain experience in the application of our faith, experience in waiting on the Lord, experience in being obedient, experience in understanding His ways, experience in being blessed, experience in feeling the quiet whisperings of the Spirit, and experience in feeling our Savior's love for us and for all of God's children. With each experience we fashion new anchors of hope that we plant firmly around us.<br><br>These spiritual anchors have amazing properties that sea anchors do not. They are additive and they can be numerous, and as long as we remember them, they are permanent. They are deployed one by one over a lifetime. They grant stability, direction, safety, and hope--real hope for the future, not only in this life but in the life to come.<br><h2><b>Weathering the Storm</b></h2><br>We all know people--individuals or ­families--who seem immovable in the face of overwhelming tragedy. They have suffered much, usually with a quiet dignity that belies the tumultuous storms of emotion, disappointment, fear, and grief that may rage beneath the surface. They are amazing. They have been through this spiritual learning cycle over and over again. These are people who have forged anchors of hope from the materials of experience, testimony, covenants, and service.<br><br>I have often wondered about my personal capacity to weather significant storms. My eternal companion and I have managed to face together most of what life has thrown at us with some degree of grace and persistence--the poverty of being married and in graduate school, the failed job search, the employment that ended prematurely, the family car that caught fire and burned to the ground, chronic health issues, and a miscarriage. I saw these as difficulties common to all mankind and their solutions as equally common.<br><br>My mother-in-law was always of a different mind. She claimed that I was the luckiest person in the world because it seemed that all of our trials evaporated over time. Her perspective caught my attention, and I began to be more cognizant of the process by which resolution arrived. I began to see the hand of the Lord in so many aspects of our development as a couple and as a family. I became acutely aware of Paul's cycle of spiritual learning. Still, in the back of my mind I was waiting for the real storm to arrive and wondered if my anchors were sufficient.<br><br>On July 14, 2010, a grandson was added to our family. Jonah was born with Treacher Collins syndrome, caused by a mutation in a single gene that variably affects late-stage craniofacial development. As we learned more about Jonah's condition and the surgeries that would be required to restore some of his underdeveloped capacities, I thought that maybe this was the real storm.<br><br>Despite the difficulties he faced, Jonah turned into a brilliant, bright star in our lives. A bone conduction hearing aid allowed him to hear until the time that a surgery could repair his outer ears. He was bright and generous and kind. Jonah relished all those challenges that face every other child his age, mainly those of trying to reach the highest of heights.<br><br>When Jonah was fourteen months old he passed unexpectedly from this life--not from any complication from the surgeries he had faced or from his general condition but by a random series of events that are commonly avoided by every toddler almost every day of his or her life. He inhaled a fruit snack that, despite all valiant and professional effort, could not be cleared from his airway.<br><br>In the moments after I received the call from my wife that Jonah had died, I sensed the coming storm--the rapid drop in the barometer and the desperate need to head to sea. It was, however, not my anchors that were to be tested but those of my daughter and her good husband. For my wife and me as parents, this trial was almost harder to bear because we were no longer at the tiller; we were not directly engaged in the struggle.<br><br>Jonah's life and our experiences with Jonah were special and sacred, but they were not unique. I fully recognize that there are some in this room today and some who are listening whose diverse histories of tribulation have required them to patiently lean on the Lord, to learn by bittersweet experience, and to have hope in eternal promises. Many of these histories enrich our lives when they are shared. Many remain lovingly and carefully conserved deep in our hearts.<br><br>My daughter chose to process her incredible grief by writing. She wrote honestly, very publicly, and prolifically for more than a year about her grief, sorrows, triumphs, and hope. It is no coincidence that we began the devotional today with the hymn "Lord, I Would Follow Thee" (<i>Hymns, </i>2002, no. 220). This has become one of my favorite hymns and the most difficult one for me to sing all the way through because my daughter adopted a line from the second verse as the title of her blog: <i>In the Quiet Heart IsHidden</i>.<br><br>I quote, with her permission, a good portion of her first entry because it so poignantly illustrates the elements of Paul's learning cycle: faith, tribulation, patience, experience, and hope. I trust that you will see each of these ­elements in her narrative.<br><h2><b>"A Month Without Jonah"</b></h2><br><i> A month ago I was just like you--going about my life, busy schedules, plans, trying to be a good wife, mother, sister, daughter. I loved being a mom but occasionally felt overwhelmed by the constant job of motherhood. In a moment my life, my relationships, my purpose, my job changed.</i><br><br><i> The moment I knew Jonah was leaving this earth was the moment I felt my faith and everything I believed in being ripped away from me. I questioned everything. I have wept every day since he died and wish I could hold him again. As I have cried and prayed and sought answers, I have found some truth and so much comfort. I am not yet at the point where I am grateful for this trial, although I believe that can happen, but I'm grateful for what I have learned.</i><br><h3><b><i>Prayer Works</i></b></h3><br><i> I was with Jonah when he died. I watched him choke and struggle and slip away from me. That memory is so vivid that I feel it happening again when I close my eyes at night. I see it, I feel it, and it causes a rush of adrenaline to flood my body. It has been horrifying, and each night I know this memory is coming. But each night I pray to God to comfort me, to give me peace, and the peace comes, like a warm blanket wrapped around me, and I sleep. I prayed that God would help me let go of that memory, and I felt impressed to write it all down, every detail, in my journal. I did that yesterday, and last night I laid in bed without my heart and mind racing, at peace....</i><br><h3><b><i>Miracles</i></b></h3><br><i> I believe that life is full of trials, and none of us will escape hardship or death. I also believe that God is a God of miracles. Almost instantly I was able to see small miracles in the experience of losing Jonah, but I found myself saying, "God, that is not the miracle I wanted." The miracle I wanted was for Jonah to be restored to health, to live. On the surface it seems like such a miracle would have done more for our faith than this experience of trying to make sense of his death and grieving.</i><br><br><i> Over the past month as I have studied the scriptures and have thought about this, I have found many examples of people who saw angels or incredible signs from heaven only to doubt them later. I can relate to that. After Jonah's funeral there was a beautiful rainbow that arched over our home. It instantly felt like a sign to me, almost perfectly biblical. A sign of peace and promise, but I felt myself doubt it as well. Perhaps the rainbow was a coincidence, simply a natural occurrence. I wanted another sign to back that sign up.</i><br><br><i> I can see how relying on signs and miracles becomes an addictive game. On the other hand, the slow and steady work of praying for answers and comfort is a refiner's fire. As I have worked at grieving and understanding, I have felt a steady strength that I cannot deny. I cannot say it is a coincidence. I can only say that it is the love of my Heavenly Father, that He sends me comfort and helps me get out of bed each day. I don't understand why this happened, but I know that God loves me and is sending me small miracles each day. Sometimes believing is seeing.</i> [Julia Harker Hall, "A Month Without Jonah," <i>In the Quiet Heart Is Hidden: Simple Reflections on Love, Loss, and Living an Unexpected Life, </i>29 October 2011, inthequietheartishidden.blogspot.com/2011_10_01_archive.html]<br><h2><b>Hope and the Love of God</b></h2><br>I am most grateful that my children have made the necessary efforts to forge anchors of their own--anchors made through years of experience with the Atonement and our Savior's love. My daughter's expressions of desperation and comfort, grief and hope, are universal. They are mirrored perfectly in Paul's exhortation to the Romans. The individual circumstances will change, but we will all experience this spiritual learning cycle over and over again so that we might know the good from evil and experience joy and sorrow, sickness and health--all that we might seek solace in the Atonement offered by our Savior and Redeemer. Our tribulations come in various forms: death, chronic pain, financial hardship, infidelity, divorce, prodigal children, or addiction. The sources are innumerable.<br><br>But it is precisely the universality of our experiences that allowed Paul to foresee the consequences of our faithful and spiritual acquisition of hope. These consequences are found in a subsequent verse that I have likewise withheld:<br><br><i>Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:</i><br><br><i> By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.</i><br><br><i> And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;</i><br><br><i> And patience, experience; and experience, hope:</i><br><br><i> And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. </i>[Romans 5:1–5]<br><br>With our anchors of hope duly deployed, we are prepared to more carefully listen to the promptings of the Spirit. We are prepared through our humble understanding of the Atonement and God's love to offer a reflection of that love to all around us. This is charity--that through our words, actions, and service, the love of God is shed abroad as we proclaim our unashamed testament to the reality of His being, to our Father's love for each of His children, and to His promise of redemption and eternal life. The Holy Ghost then bears witness to the truthfulness of that unashamed testament.<br><br>In following this pattern, a new property of spiritual anchors begins to emerge. Each of us begins to share our anchors--mine become yours and yours become mine. And all are strengthened together against the oncoming storm. Inspired prophets, seers, and revelators have urged us to this end from the beginning and still do to this day.<br><br>Paul's words were perfectly summarized by Nephi: "Press forward with asteadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men" (2 Nephi 31:20). Paul simply and eloquently instructed us in the process by which faith, hope, and charity are linked inexorably to our eternal progression and well-being.<br><br>May we each embrace the storms in our lives, having faith in our experience with that one Anchor, sure and steadfast, even Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer. This is my prayer, in His holy name, amen.<br><br><i>Alan R.

<h1>nters and the Fire of the Lord - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Many years ago, as a high school ­student, I had the opportunity to become acquainted with several Catholic nuns who lived in a convent in my hometown and worked in the nearby Catholic hospital. As their schedules permitted, I often spent time with them, walking in the park or visiting in the parlor of the convent.<br><br>One afternoon I happened to be talking with Sister Columba. She was a tiny, elderly woman who had been a member of the Irish Army before she became a nun. That day she was sharing with me the profound love that she had for our Savior, Jesus Christ, and as she spoke, tears were streaming down her face. It was a powerful spiritual moment that touched me in the deepest center of my being.<br><br>After I left that day, I pondered Sister Columba's testimony of Christ. I had grown up as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and I had attended my church meetings and seminary classes. I had frequently borne testimony that the gospel of Jesus Christ was true. And yet I couldn't comprehend how it could be, with all of this truth, that I had never felt anything for Jesus Christ--certainly nothing like the level of worship and gratitude that I had experienced from Sister Columba.<br><br>That afternoon with this frail nun in the quiet parlor of the convent became the definitive moment of my spiritual growth, as it launched a quest to know my Savior that has shaped my entire life. The most critical point, which I have at last come to comprehend, is the absolute centrality of Jesus Christ and His Atonement to every aspect of our lives. Because of that centrality, the most significant challenge for us is to learn to grasp this center and to build our lives upon this secure foundation.<br><br>This injunction is nothing new. If we really look at it, this one fact--the centrality of Christ and the Atonement--builds the focus for all the religious instruction that the Church conveys. The question that I have been grappling with is this: Since Christ and His Atonement are so clearly the center toward which all our religious experience leads, why is it often so difficult for us to actually connect with that center and to make it our own in an active way?<br><br>Of course there are many ways to answer this question, but today I would like to share some insights that I have found as I have pondered this ­question in my own life.<br><br><b>Mortal Perception and Spiritual Perception</b><br><br>We are born into this world as somewhat awkwardly composite beings in which an eternal spirit has been enclosed in a mortal, physical body. This dividedness comes, I believe, because these two disparate elements--mortal body and eternal spirit--provide us with two distinctly different mechanisms for comprehending the world. I will call these "mortal perception" and "spiritual perception."<br><br>Mortal perception is the means of understanding that is provided by our physical body. This body is equipped with an amazing array of capabilities. These include our physical senses, such as seeing, hearing, tasting, and touching, but they also include the cognitive abilities that enable us to think, remember, hypothesize, and synthesize. As we develop this amazing wealth of abilities provided by our mortal bodies, we learn to make sense of the world and to master our environment.<br><br>However, these mortal abilities are also limited, and at times faulty, simply because they are just that--mortal. There is always something we don't know. A pencil seems to be bent when we look at it in a cup of water. Sometimes we think we see something that isn't there, or we don't hear when someone speaks directly to us. Although we can understand a great deal about the world, this comprehension only extends as far as the limits of our mortal capacities. We can't see into the future, read minds, or understand the underlying reasons for many actions. There are always huge gaps in our knowledge and understanding of that which surrounds us. Our mortal perception is always limited by the bounds of language, culture, personal baggage, and emotional states.<br><br>Fortunately, mortal perception is not the only means of coming to terms with our mortal existence. Because of our eternal spirit, we are also equipped with a great capacity for spiritual learning. Our spiritual perception provides us with a conduit of direct connection with God through the medium of His Spirit. We may think that--because of the veil of mortality that has been drawn between us and our memories of life before birth--God has abandoned us on earth. But it is only the limitations of our mortal perceptions that give us this illusion of isolation from God. As soon as we embrace our spiritual way of knowing, we find that God is as close to us as we allow Him to be, and His communication with us is constant.<br><br>Our spiritual mode of perception is not limited by our mortal senses or rationality and therefore isn't reducible to language, culture, or personal baggage. It is a direct link, through the Spirit, to our all-knowing and all-powerful Father, who is pleased to give us guidance when we seek it. Spiritual perception enables us to comprehend eternal truths that can't be explained through our physical rationality because these truths belong to the realm of the divine--that is, to God. Our spiritual perception enables us to receive constant inspiration, enlightenment, and personal revelation. There are no limitations to the possibilities of our spiritual perception--except the limits that we place on our own efforts to develop this aspect of our being.<br><br>It may be that when we enter mortality our spiritual and mortal ways of perceiving are in balance, but it doesn't take long for the seemingly more concrete mortal ways of perceiving to begin to predominate. Spiritual ways of perceiving aren't as obvious; they can't be rationally processed in the same way as tasting dirt or looking through a magnifying glass. As we explore our environment and school our physical capacities, the mortal way of experiencing life, with all of its apparent solidity and reasonableness, begins to seem normal. The mortal seems to be what <i>is.</i><br><br><b>The Dangers of Mortal Perception</b><br><br>Because the mortal way of perceiving seems so powerfully real, it can happen that in our minds the mortal and spiritual ways of knowing become blurred and confused so that sometimes we sincerely believe that we are operating in a spiritual mode when we are actually relying almost entirely on the limited mortal perception that seems most natural to us. This is the confusion that makes it possible to know the scriptures inside and out without ever being illuminated by the spiritual fire that testifies of the truth of those scriptures. This is why people can recite all that mortals can know <i>about</i> Jesus Christ without ever <i>knowing</i> Christ or being touched by His Spirit. This is why I had been able to spend my life learning about the gospel without that knowledge ever being lit by the spiritual flame of love for my Savior, until Sister Columba ignited the spark for me that afternoon.<br><br>If we don't put enough effort into untangling this confusion and consciously developing our spiritual capacities of perceiving, it doesn't take long before the seemingly normal concreteness of mortal perception takes over. It begins to encrust and to wall in the subtle internal flame of spiritual perception. When this happens, we can come to trust almost entirely in our mortal senses and intellectual abilities--our reasoning and experience--because they seem to be so concrete.<br><br>Sadly, as our spiritual way of perceiving fades behind the wall of our mortalness, we often find ourselves feeling confused and bewildered in life. Because our conduit of connection with God has become clogged, we increasingly reach out to people around us--mortals like ourselves--for help and support. We gain a sense of security and direction from the opinions of others expressed through social media, blogspots, emails, self-help books, and numerous other sources. But the danger here is that all mortal knowing is by nature limited and flawed. For this very reason the scriptures warn us again and again against reliance on "the arm of flesh."<sup>1</sup> Even if the "flesh" we rely on is our own mental capacity and even if we're blessed with genius-level abilities, there will still always be something that we can't see or that we fail to understand. The flesh is always limited, unless it is complemented by the power of the Spirit.<br><br>I would never wish to discount the insight that we can gain through the wisdom shared by sincere truth seekers. I have benefited from my share of self-help books and inspirational writings. But I have also found that although such sources have helped me gain some understanding of how I can better live in the world, they leave me unsatisfied as well. It took me a long time to realize that if we engage even the wisest of words solely through the medium of our mortal perception, we will always be absorbing limitation, the wisdom of the flesh, without the transformative power supplied by the fire of the Spirit. Mortal perception allows us to fall prey to misconceptions and hidden agendas; it blinds us to lies and traps.<br><br>When we lose contact with our spiritual abilities, we are easily led to assume that truth is a matter of consensus. To the mortal mind, the more widely something is believed, the more truth it seems to have. Often, with our mortal thinking, we fail to understand that even if a particular idea has received a hundred million "likes," if it doesn't receive the one "like" that really matters--that is, the stamp of testimony through the power of the Holy Spirit of God--it still remains merely mortal opinion and is therefore inadequate and limited. If we aren't careful, when we slip into complete trust in our mortal modes of perceiving, we will find ourselves truly on our own, reliant only on our limited personal abilities as we wander through the vast cyber-foyer of media and public opinion that can lead us subtly, but irresistibly, into the "great and spacious building"<sup>2</sup> of the world.<br><br>Another danger of allowing mortal perception to predominate is that, as our subtle spiritual senses become obscured, we soon tend to become decentered. If we cease to rely on our inner power of spiritual perception, we lose the moorings that fasten us securely to our center in Jesus Christ. As our center shifts, we find it more and more difficult to feel the comfort, strength, and divine love that enfold us when we are close to God's Spirit. This loss leaves us spiritually famished, so we try to fill the emptiness with approximations--music, art, nature, excitement, and adventure--but nothing mortal is sufficient to still our deepest spiritual yearnings.<sup>3</sup><br><br>Because we need to find some meaning and direction in our life, when we become decentered from Christ, we tend to drift to other centers in the attempt to find stability: friends, a career, money, a good cause, entertainment, a spouse or family, and sometimes our own self as we pursue self-fulfillment. But the difficulty with all of these centers is that they, like us, are bound by the limitations of mortality and are of necessity temporary and unstable. We lose our job or become bored with thrills and adventure. A loved one dies, a spouse leaves, a child turns away, and we find that we can't fill our own inmost needs. Suddenly the center that was the foundation for our life is revealed to be empty.<br><br>If this picture of life as lived through the merely mortal seems to be quite bleak, it is, because the great and spacious building is a cold place. No matter how much happiness it promises, no matter how many multitudes fill its halls, it always leaves us feeling empty and alone because we have lost our secure center and because we are only half a person--the mortal, limited half.<br><br><b>Developing Spiritual Perception</b><br><br>God has given us very powerful ways to resist the scenario I have just described. The truth is that we are not here just to be mortal. We are here to rediscover who we were before we came to this life and to learn to be that being again, enhanced by the new abilities offered by combination with our mortal body.<br><br>Because our concrete physicality tends to predominate, we are constantly reminded to take time away from our busy mortal activities so that we can develop our skills in spiritual perception. We gain this spiritual training by immersing ourselves in engaged Church activity, temple attendance, scripture study, and sincere personal prayer. If we take these opportunities seriously and consciously try to use them as they were intended, these times of spiritual involvement become the schoolroom--the laboratory for our spiritual development. They provide us the opportunity to step away from the world and its demands so that we can actively exercise our inner spiritual ways of perceiving.<br><br>If our religious beliefs seem to be stale, mundane, or simply habitual, it is generally because we are only viewing them through our mortal perception. This is like looking at the Grand Canyon at night, when the colors are darkened, the shapes are blurred, and everything seems shadowed, indistinct, and unremarkable. The fire of the Lord, which transforms religious experience into the burning essence of our being, can only be accessed through our spiritual perception. It is the fire of the Spirit that takes what to the mortal mind may be merely interesting theological concepts or useful social habits and transforms them into breathtaking, soul-satisfying spiritual realities.<br><br>Sometimes we become so complacent in our mortal, physical sense of reality that we believe we have things under control and have no need for any deeper spiritual connection. We are willing to settle for a level of contentment and happiness in life and figure that we are doing fine. But even when we have lost our vibrant spiritual connection with God, He is still close to us. What He desires is to lead us to joy--the true joy that is only possible through the power of the Spirit. He is trying to help us develop the same kind of eternal perspective that He has, so at times He allows difficulties to shatter the complacency of our lives. As the saying goes, "There's no growth in a comfort zone, and there's no comfort in a growth zone." Sometimes only redemptive pain and grief are strong enough to break down the crust of mortality that has obscured the flame of our spiritual fire. Often refining sorrow and struggle alone have the power to disrupt our preoccupation with the merely mortal and pull our focus back to spiritual realities so that we can regain our center in Christ and be healed by the power of His Atonement.<br><br><b>Combining the Spiritual and the Mortal</b><br><br>Increasingly, as we develop our spiritual way of perceiving, we find that the truths of the gospel aren't just concepts that we know about; they are what we do. The meshing of mortal and spiritual faculties moves us beyond asking a passive question such as What is faith? to asking an active, challenging query such as How can I exercise my faith more effectively? It is the powerful combination of our mortal and spiritual ways of perceiving that lifts us beyond a lifeless inquiry such as What is the Atonement? to the transformative question What do I need to do to make the gift of the Atonement into an active part of my life? All knowledge that we acquire through our mortal faculties gains more powerful meaning and depth when it is illuminated by spiritual perception.<br><br>The development of our mortal and our spiritual ways of perceiving is not an either/or proposition. When we learn to expand our spiritual abilities through relying on God and following the direction of His Spirit, we aren't somehow being cheated out of our mortal capabilities. Our reliance on God does not mean that we have been weakened as an independently functioning individual. The gospel and the commandments of God are not a cage that keeps us from succeeding in the world. They are the wings that help us to soar to heights of success that we, with our mortal faculties, can't even dream of on our own. If we choose to follow the path laid out by Jesus Christ, which He demonstrated for us through His own example, He will help us to develop the same kind of perfect intermeshing between the mortal and the spiritual that He himself achieved and which He now possesses in a glorified form. Hewants us to be complete and whole, just as He Himself is complete and whole.<br><br>It is the skills that we develop in using our spiritual mode of perceiving that compensate for our mortal limitations and gaps. These skills are what allow a parent or leader or manager to understand another person's situation and needs, even if those needs are totally different from their own. The moments of inspiration or "strokes of genius" that lie behind inventions, artistic creations, scientific discoveries, or just plain good ideas are, in reality, sparks of insight sent through our spiritual perception and connection with God to strengthen our mortal capabilities. Spiritual perception combined with mortal perception can help us gain expanded power to use the understanding and skills we are gaining through our life experiences so that we can be more effective in all aspects of our lives, whether secular or religious, temporal or spiritual.<br><br>The scriptures and other gospel sources give us much of the "what" of the gospel--the teachings and doctrines that our mortal perceptions can understand. But it is only when we activate our spiritual mode of perceiving that we truly begin to comprehend how the gospel works in our individual lives--that is, how it makes a difference for <i>me</i>. As we develop our spiritual abilities, the Holy Spirit becomes our private tutor, whispering more profound insights about the doctrines that our mortal capabilities have mastered. It turns the teachings that we have heard about our whole lives into living, vibrant instruction tailored to our own needs and situation. There is no textbook for the deepest levels of spiritual experience because the private tutelage of the Spirit leads each person individually to needed sources of insight and direction.<br><br>The spiritual aspect of perception is much like the eyeglasses in the movie <i>National Treasure,</i> with their lenses of different colors. Each lens, when it is put into action, makes it possible to see new details, new aspects of the map to the treasure, that were invisible before. We seek the greatest treasure of all: a deep relationship with our Savior, Jesus Christ, and rich personal application of the power of His Atonement. Only the spiritual mode of perception can enhance what we learn through our mortal perceptions and intellect so that we can reach this transformative level of understanding.<br><br>In the October 2014 general conference President DieterF. Uchtdorf exclaimed:<br><br><i> I offer you my personal witness that spiritual truth will fill your heart and bring light to your spirit. It will reveal to you pure intelligence with wonderful joy and heavenly peace....</i><br><br><i> ...If you seek God's truth, that which now may appear dim, out of focus, and distant will gradually be revealed and clarified and become close to your heart by the light of God's grace. Glorious spiritual vistas, unimaginable to the human eye, will be revealed to you.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>When he made this powerful promise, President Uchtdorf was not just presenting religious platitudes or something pretty to say at conference. Rather, he was giving us a vision of what we can actually achieve if we work through the Spirit to activate the combination of both our mortal and our spiritual ways of perceiving.<br><br><b>Developing Deep Love for Christ</b><br><br>As I think about my experience with Sister Columba now, after many years of my own growth, I still don't know whether I have developed the same level of love for Jesus Christ as Sister Columba shared with me. But what I have discovered is that, as with all other parts of religious belief, love for our Savior is something that we <i>do</i>. One way of demonstrating intense love for Christ is to follow His injunction when He said, "If ye love me, keep my commandments."<sup>5</sup> When we keep His commandments, we demonstrate actively that we love Christ enough to sacrifice immediate physical desires and worldly temptations in order to come close to Him. But keeping the commandments also blesses us, since the purity that comes through living according to God's expectations is the force that keeps our inner connection with the Spirit of God open and clear so that we can continually expand the power of our spiritual perception.<br><br>Sister NeillF. Marriott, second counselor in the Young Women general presidency, indicated another way in which we can demonstrate love for Christ when, in her address at the 2016 general women's session, she asserted, "Love is making space in your life for someone else."<sup>6</sup> This truth is valid, not just for our children or our family but for our relationship with God as well. We show love for Christ by making space in our lives for Him. This means consciously devoting time every day to seriously studying His words, meditating on the scriptures that teach of Him, and praying to know Him, utilizing both our mortal and our spiritual forms of perception.<br><br>I have been deeply touched by Elder JeffreyR. Holland's passionate expression of his desire to make space in his life for Christ. He exclaimed:<br><br><i>I would walk on hot lava, I would drink broken glass to find one more word, one more phrase, one more doctrine, </i><b><i>any</i></b><i> parable that </i><b><i>anyone</i></b><i> could give me of the life of Christ the living Son of the living God. The doctrine of Christ means everything to me as a result of [my feelings] for the author of the doctrine of Christ.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>As we too come to thirst for anything that can bring us a step closer to our Savior and help us act on this desire, we clearly manifest our love for Him.<br><br>In addition to making space in our lives for Christ, there is yet another way in which we demonstrate our love. As author Catherine Galasso-Vigorito asserted:<br><br><i> Love is not a special way of feeling, though lovely feelings come now and then. But real love is a commitment to live and care for another person. When that love is God's love, it reaches out to all the people around you automatically. You just can't help caring and sharing from the heart.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>Our service to God's children is a visible sign of our love for Him. As we willingly serve others, we become a conduit through which His love flows to touch the lives of everyone around us.<br><br>What these different ways of showing love teach me is that, as we devotedly keep God's commandments, fill our hearts and thoughts with contemplation of our Savior and His gospel, and perform His works of service, we are transformed into a living manifestation of the love for God that I experienced that day with Sister Columba.<br><br>Since I am a professor--that is, someone whoprofesses--people often ask me about my affinity with the different concepts of critical theory that I frequently teach. They want to know whether I advocate feminism or poststructuralism or some other theoretical system. The only answer that I can give to such questions is this: I am a follower of Jesus Christ. The theoretical ideas we talk about in classes were invented by people who want to improve society, but because they were developed by mortals, these concepts all have limitations. In reality, the gospel of Jesus Christ--as Jesus Christ taught it and as He expects us to live it--is far more demanding than any mortal ideas or systems of behavior. The gospel alone has the power to transform us, and by applying its principles we can help to change the world aroundus.<br><br>As I see it, there can be no more significant title than that of a true disciple of Christ. I believe that it is important to develop our mortal abilities as fully as we can so that we can be successful in the careers, professions, and lives we have chosen. However, it is far more urgent that we develop the powerfully intermeshed combination of both our mortal and our spiritual capabilities so that we can function in every aspect of our lives--professional, religious, and personal--as inspired followers of Christ who touch the lives of our Father's children with service, love, and compassion. And beyond even this, the highest pursuit of all--the most meaningful achievement in life--is to use all the combined powers of our mortal and spiritual perceptions in order to center ourselves firmly on Jesus Christ and the infinite power of His Atonement so that every aspect of our lives will be charged and illuminated by the fire of the Lord. Only this will bring us ­success and joy, both in this life and for the eternities tocome.<br><br>This is what I have learned in my own spiritual quest, and I bear testimony of these truths. In the name of our Savior, Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Michelle Stott James was a professor in the BYU Department of German and Russian when this ­devotional address was given on 21 June 2016.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. 2 Nephi 4:34; D&amp;amp;C 1:19.<br><br>2. 1 Nephi 8:31.<br><br>3.

<h1>s Freedom: A Cherished Heritage to Defend - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My remarks this evening are about America's great heritage of religious liberty--and about the need for each of us to defend that heritage before it is too late.<br><br>In 1790, at a time when western Europe excluded Jews from the full rights of citizenship, including the ability to hold public office, President George Washington wrote a memorable letter to the Jewish congregation in Newport, Rhode Island. They had written congratulating him on his election. In reply, Washington assured them that<br><br><i>the Government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, requires only that they who live under its protection should </i>[conduct] <i>themselves as good citizens.</i><br><br>He included a prayer for their welfare:<br><br><i>May the children of the stock of Abraham who dwell in this land continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other inhabitants--while every one shall sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree and there shall benone to make him afraid.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>No one who knows the difficult history of the Jewish people, or their fate during succeeding generations, can fail to be impressed by Washington's affirmation of religious freedom.<br><h2><b>Religious Freedom Under Fire</b></h2><br>Last year at an interfaith conference on religious freedom in São Paulo, Brazil, I addressed a meeting of religious leaders, including Catholics, Evangelicals, Seventh-Day Adventists, Jews, Muslims, and many others. There I explained:<br><br><i>Religious freedom is the cornerstone of peace in a world with many competing philosophies. It gives us all space to determine for ourselves what we think and believe--to follow the truth that God speaks to our hearts.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>While protection from government persecution is of course crucial, that is not all that religious freedom means:<br><br><i>A robust freedom is not merely what political philosophers have referred to as the "negative" freedom to be left alone. .</i>..<i> Rather, it is a much richer "positive" freedom--the freedom to live one's religion or belief in a legal, political, and social environment that is tolerant, respectful, and accommodating of diverse beliefs.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>That freedom is now under fire. Although religious freedom lies at the core of what America is and what it stands for, critics now openly ask whether religion belongs in American public life at all. Some say that faithful Americans have no business speaking of their beliefs when addressing issues of public concern, even when those issues involve unmistakably moral judgments.<sup>4</sup> Others condemn churches and religious organizations for expressing moral and religious perspectives on matters of public policy--especially when those perspectives conflict with secular viewpoints.<sup>5</sup> Some even claim, with no sense of history, that religious people and institutions violate the constitutional separation of church and state if they bring their beliefs into the public square.<sup>6</sup> A few scholars have gone so far as to argue that religion does not deserve to be tolerated, much less receive special protection.<sup>7</sup><br><br>Recently it has become popular to argue that the freedom of religion is really only the right to worship rather than the right to freely exercise your faith in daily life--as if religion should be kept in the closet or some other private place. Some advocates demean as "discrimination" the long-standing right of religious organizations and schools to have faith-based standards in employment and admissions. Others resort to politically correct name-calling rather than talking about difficult topics in a spirit of mutual respect. Hurtful labels such as "bigot" or "hater" are all too common. There are concerted efforts to shame and intimidate believers who have traditional moral values and to suppress religious viewpoints and practices regarding marriage, family, gender, and sexuality.<sup>8</sup> Worst of all, government sometimes joins in these efforts.<br><br>Religious freedom is indeed under attack. In case you think that is an exaggeration, let me read to you a statement by Professor Douglas Laycock, one of the nation's premier authorities on religion and law:<br><br><i>For the first time in nearly 300 years, important forces in American society are questioning the free exercise of religion </i><b><i>in principle</i></b><b><i>--</i></b><i>suggesting that free exercise of religion may be a bad idea, or at least, a right to be minimized.</i><sup>9</sup><br><h2><b>Religion in American History</b></h2><br>I am convinced that those who question the value, or even the legitimacy, of religious freedom do not understand that it is woven into the very soul of America. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote that "a page of history is worth a volume of logic."<sup>10</sup> So let me review a little history to see what role religious faith and churches have played in the miraculous unfolding of America.<br><br>Religious conviction was a leading reason why colonists left England for the New World. One historian wrote:<br><br><i>When the English undertook to plant colonies in America, they commenced .</i>..<i> not with propositions about the rights of man or with the gospel of wealth, </i><i>but with absolute certainties concerning the providence </i><i>ofGod.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>Religious purpose was the common thread that connected the Puritans of Massachusetts, who felt a divinely appointed duty to found Zion in the wilderness,<sup>12</sup> with Virginia's first colonists, who looked to God for their success.<sup>13</sup> William Penn, who founded Pennsylvania, and Roger Williams, who founded Rhode Island, established colonies dedicated to the principle of religious liberty. And Maryland was established as a place of religious toleration for England's persecuted Catholic minority.<sup>14</sup><br><br>Religion remained a vital source of shared meaning in the years leading up to the American Revolution. The principal influence in public debates during that period was the King James Bible.<sup>15</sup> Indeed, the American Revolution cannot be understood without taking into account the religious teachings that motivated patriots to action.<sup>16</sup><br><br>Following the battles of Lexington and Concord, sermons rang out across New England. Clergymen, as one scholar noted, "connected religion and patriotism, and in their sermons and prayers, represented the cause of America as the cause of heaven."<sup>17</sup> Thousands of sermons justified resistance to British tyranny by, as another scholar put it, reaffirming "New England's enduring identity as an embattled people of the Word [of God] who were commissioned to uphold a sacred and exclusive covenant between themselves and God."<sup>18</sup><br><br>The clergymen of New England were not alone in drawing the connection between religion and patriotism. In New Jersey, John Witherspoon--James Madison's tutor at what is now Princeton University--delivered a sermon in 1776 announcing his support for the Revolution. He explained that the union of the colonies against Great Britain resulted from "a deep and general conviction, that our civil and religious liberties ... depended on [it]."<sup>19</sup><br><br>Capturing the sentiments of that patriotic ­generation, one historian wrote:<br><br><i>The men of 1776 believed that the good state would rise on the rock of private and public morality, that morality was in the case of most men and all states the product of religion, and that the earthly mission of religion was to set men free. It was no mere pose when they justified resistance to oppression as obedience to God and an appeal to heaven.</i><sup>20</sup><br><br>Hence it is no surprise that just weeks before the Declaration of Independence was signed, Virginia adopted a bill of rights, largely penned by George Mason. Its ringing affirmation of religious liberty remains an inspiration:<br><br><i>Religion, or the duty which we owe to our Creator, and the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence; and therefore all men are equally entitled to </i><b><i>the</i></b><i></i><b><i>free exercise of religion,</i></b><i> according to the dictates ofconscience.</i><sup>21</sup><br><br>And of course the Declaration itself reminds us that Americans believed they were "endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights."<sup>22</sup> Later the Constitution would enshrine the first of those unalienable rights--the right to religious freedom.<br><br>These formative experiences of colonization and revolution solidified the importance of religion in our national understanding. The French political thinker Alexis de Tocqueville, visiting America during the 1830s, reported that Americans considered religion indispensable to freedom. Tocqueville wrote:<br><br><i>I stop the first American whom I meet, .</i>.. <i>and I ask him if he thinks religion is useful for the stability of law and the good order of society; he immediately responds that a civilized society, but above all a free society, ­cannot subsist without religion.</i><sup>23</sup><br><br>But it was not just America's colonists and founders who valued faith and religious freedom.<br><br>Repeating the pattern set by their Puritan forebears, early Latter-day Saints fled from state to state--eventually settling in the Great Basin--in the hope of building Zion in the wilderness.<br><br>Religious convictions and language set the terms of the national debates over slavery, ­emancipation, and the Civil War.<sup>24</sup><br><br>Within my lifetime, the civil rights movement depended on the persuasive power of ministers and the language of religious belief. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote from the Birmingham jail, for instance, that "human progress .<b></b>.<b></b>. comes through the tireless efforts and persistent work of men willing to be co-workers with God."<sup>25</sup><br><br>So religion and religious freedom are deeply connected to both the formation of America and our ongoing effort, in the words of the Constitution, "to form a more perfect Union [and] establish Justice."<sup>26</sup> As one historian summarized:<br><br><i>American churchmen and American churches have, throughout our history, played an important role in public affairs. .</i>.<i>. The churches have usually assumed that their mission includes active participation in the formulation and fulfilment of moral principle. Whether the cause has been abolition, prohibition, or integration, the churches and their leaders have played a central, sometimes a crucial, role in translating what the churches conceived to be moral principle into rules of law.</i><sup>27</sup><br><br>Religious participation in public life is one of the golden threads in our national tapestry. It is also, of course, a cherished constitutional right.<br><h2><b>Religious Liberty Is a Fundamental Right</b></h2><br>The First Amendment to the Constitution declares:<br><br><i>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</i><sup>28</sup><br><br>Notice that religious liberty is the first freedom mentioned in the First Amendment. It consists, first, of protection from laws "respecting an establishment of religion." This is what we lawyers call the Establishment Clause. (Some of you didn't know I used to be a lawyer. I hope that doesn't lower your opinion of me!) Unlike England, for example, this country knows no national church, and government may not officially prefer one religious denomination over another.<sup>29</sup> But some have misunderstood the ban on establishing an official religion to mean that government should treat religion with skepticism, even hostility. Not so. The Supreme Court has said:<br><br><i>The Establishment Clause does not license government to treat religion and those who teach or practice it ... as subversive of American ideals and therefore subject to unique disabilities.</i><sup>30</sup><br><br>And, contrary to what some say, a law does not become unconstitutional when it coincides with religious principles. Otherwise we couldn't have laws punishing murder and theft.<sup>31</sup><br><br>The other First Amendment right protecting religion forbids the government from enacting laws "prohibiting the free exercise" of religion. Notice the word <i>exercise.</i> It protects the right to "exercise" religion in our daily lives--not just to believe whatever we like or to worship privately in our homes and chapels, but to live openly and freely according to our faith as long as we respect the fundamental rights of others.<br><br>The First Amendment's protection against an established religion and its guarantee of the free exercise of religion are not the only freedoms that make religious liberty possible. The First Amendment's freedom of speech and press and assembly, plus the freedom to petition the government for redress of grievances, all ensure that religious people and institutions can function freely and openly in our society as equal citizens.<br><br>The right to exercise religion would be seriously diminished if we couldn't say what we believe. Fortunately, in common with all Americans, religious believers and organizations are entitled to the freedom of speech. Their right to speak on matters of public concern is beyond dispute. The Supreme Court has taught "that private ­religious speech, far from being a First Amendment orphan, is as fully protected under the Free Speech Clause as secular private expression."<sup>32</sup> Religious speech cannot be singled out for government suppression.<sup>33</sup> Nor is there any question that churches and other religious organizations--not just ­individuals--hold the right of free speech too.<sup>34</sup><br><br>To be effective, the freedom to speak must also include the freedom to publish one's opinions. Whether communicated through traditional means, such as books, newspapers, and television, or through the global medium of the Internet, religious voices cannot be silenced any more than other points of view.<sup>35</sup><br><br>All of these rights--including the freedom of peaceful assembly--are indispensable to what we mean by religious freedom. As I have previously explained:<br><br><i>We use our freedom of religion and belief to establish our core convictions, without which all other human rights would be meaningless. How can we claim the freedom of speech without being able to say what we truly believe? How can we claim the freedom of assembly unless we can gather with others who share our ideals? How can we enjoy freedom of the press unless we can publicly print or post who we really are?</i><sup>36</sup><br><h2><b>Religious Participation in Public Life Is Good</b></h2><br>There are two big points I want you to remember when you leave this evening. The first is that religious participation in public life is not only part of American history and a constitutionally protected freedom, it is also <i>good</i> for our nation. All laws and government policies are based on values--religious or otherwise. Everyone has a right to be heard--"to compete"--in the marketplaces of ideas and in influencing governmental decisions. To silence one voice potentially leads tosilencing all others.<br><br>Religious voices are at least as deserving of being heard as any others. In fact, churches and other religious organizations bring unique experiences and perspectives to public policy debates. They recognize corrosive social forces that threaten faith, family, and freedom. They know personally about the hardships of family breakdown, unemployment, poverty, drug abuse, and numerous other social ills. Why? Because they are on the front lines helping individuals and families work through these wrenching problems. When they speak out, they do so <i>not</i> for selfish reasons, like the special-interest groups that constantly lobby our public officials, but out of concern for the people they minister to, their families, and society itself. They bring a moral--often cautionary--voice to matters of social and public policy that we desperately need in this age of materialism, self-promotion, and disruptive change. The perspectives of churches and religious leaders make an irreplaceable contribution to our ongoing democratic conversation about how we should live together. Their voices are essential.<br><br>And so are yours. If you are a person of faith, you have a critical contribution to make to our country and society. Public discussions about the common good are enriched by men and women like you who routinely put duty above convenience and conscience above personal advantage. Don't be intimidated by those who claim that you are imposing your religious beliefs on others. In a pluralistic society, promoting one's values for the good of society is not imposing them on others--<br>it is putting them forward for consideration along with all others. Societies will choose and decide. Someone's values will prevail in the end, and all of us have the right--and duty--to argue for what we believe will best serve the needs of the people and most benefit the common good. Without you, our political and social debates will lack the richness and insights needed to make wise decisions, and our nation and communities will suffer.<br><br>Again, the first thing I want you to remember is that the religious voices are vitally important to our country--both to society and to wise government.<br><h2><b>Standing Up for Religious Freedom</b></h2><br>The second point I want you to remember is that it is time to get involved and take a stand for religious freedom. There is much you can do to ensure a culture in which religious freedom has an honored place in American life.<br><br>Begin by becoming informed. Study the principles of the American founding and teach them in your families. Teach your families to cherish America's heritage of freedom. Teach them the importance of religion to our nation and society. Teach them to respect the faith of all people, even those with very different beliefs. And teach them that respecting religious freedom means tolerating religious beliefs, speech, and practices we disagree with. That is the price of asking others to respect our own freedoms.<br><br>Next, speak up. Churches and people of faith must not allow themselves to be intimidated and silenced. Your opinions count. You have a right to speak and to be heard. Make the effort to stay informed about issues of public importance, and then speak out with courage and civility--and Ido emphasize civility. Whatever your faith, our society needs your voice, your experience, and your goodness.<br><br>Next, get involved. You don't need to run for president or Congress to make a big difference. To borrow a phrase from another LDS leader, "lift where you stand."<sup>37</sup> The crisis of religious freedom is as much a cultural crisis as a political or legal one. So get involved in the cultural and civic organizations around you so that you can influence them to respect religious freedom. Be active in the PTA and express your views to the school board; the future of religious freedom will depend a great deal on what our children are taught. If you are a professional or run a business, be involved with your professional association or the chamber of commerce; the lack of business and professional support for religious freedom is a real concern. You can make a difference. Participate in your political party and help guide it toward sound principles. Write to your representatives. Make it a family tradition to vote regularly. There are numerous opportunities to get involved right in your own community.<br><br>Finally, and above all, as the Apostle Paul wrote, "be ... an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity."<sup>38</sup> Whatever your religion, "live your faith so that others ... will see your good works, experience your genuine love and friendship, and feel [God] working through you."<sup>39</sup> Americans tend to respect and protect what they believe is good. So let us show them the highest and best in our faiths--our willingness to love and serve others, to build strong families, to live honorable lives, and to be good citizens. As our fellow ­citizens see the goodness of your faith,<br><br><i>they will want to listen to you and understand when you say your religious freedom is being abridged. They may not agree with you or even understand entirely the issue that is so important to you. But if they know you and respect you because you are a true</i> [example of the believers],<i> they will be far more inclined to work toward a solution that respects </i>[essential]<i> religious freedoms.</i><sup>40</sup><br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>My friends and fellow citizens, we live in challenging times. Religious freedom is indeed under fire. And things may get worse before they get better. But these are <i>our</i> times. This is <i>our</i> moment to defend our fundamental freedoms. With courage, conviction, and civility--drawing upon our noble heritage as Americans--each one of us can make a profound difference. As the great Winston Churchill said on the eve of the world's greatest conflict, let us "arise again and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time."<sup>41</sup> As fellow believers and citizens of this great nation, we can do no less. Thank you, and may God bless you and this wonderful nation.<br><br><i>D.

<h1>ng Our Way Through Life - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As I begin my message today I would like you to think back on a time when you were completely lost. You may have been hiking in the wilderness, been trying to find your way to a meeting in a new city, or been separated from your parents at an amusement park. Can you remember how you felt? You may have felt frightened, embarrassed, or desperate for help. How did you ultimately find your way? Rather than focusing on the dreadful experience of being lost, I would like to speak about guiding principles that can help us find our way.<br><br>For many years I have been interested in the topic of navigation, specifically in figuring out ways for unmanned aircraft--commonly called drones--to find their way from one location to another. For me, this topic is both technically fascinating and an interesting metaphor for our mortal journey through life.<br><br>The scriptures are replete with examples of journeys or paths used as symbols for our lives here on earth. A couple of my favorites include the stories of Lehi and his family being led to the promised land by the Liahona<sup>1</sup> and the stories about the Israelites wandering in the wilderness and being led and protected by a "pillar of ... cloud by day" and a "pillar of fire by night."<sup>2</sup><br><br>This common use of the path or a journey as a teaching aid leads me to ask, "What is to be learned from these accounts? How can we be led by our Father in Heaven through the wilderness of life to our own promised land? And what about the more modern techie metaphor of drone navigation? Are there useful parallels to consider between our course through this earthly life and the way a drone finds its way around?" Let's explore this topic a little.<br><h2><b>Using Feedback to Help Us Navigate</b></h2><br>I have had the opportunity to perform research on drones with fantastic colleagues and students for the past seventeen years. Our primary goal has been to make small unmanned aircraft capable of performing useful tasks without the direct control of a pilot, using innovative combinations of sensors and algorithms implemented on board the aircraft.<br><br>Whether flying to avoid obstacles such as buildings or canyon walls, coordinating the actions of multiple drones, or navigating through a crowded building, the approaches we have used have always involved four important components: first, having a goal or a desired objective; second, sensing the state of the aircraft and the environment around it; third, processing the sensor information to determine the input commands to the aircraft; and fourth, sending the commands to the aircraft motors to produce the desired behavior.<br><br>Similarly, for us to reach our ultimate ­objectives in life, we must have a vision or goal that defines the path we should take. We must have ways to assess our progress along our path and whether we are close to or far away from it. We must have the ability to reason and make decisions about ways to improve our progress. And finally, we must exercise our agency to act in ways that lead us toward our desired objective.<br><br>This idea of evaluating where we are relative to our desired objective and then acting to move toward it can be termed in technical jargon as "feedback control." The word <i>feedback</i> refers to the information we gather from sources around us while the word <i>control</i> describes how we use that information to come up with a course of action. This principle of feedback is powerful, and it is finding its way into our daily lives in more and more ways. While feedback has been and will be critical to many technological advances, I would like to consider how we use it to navigate through this mortal journey called life.<br><br>Whether we realize it or not, we all use feedback to make decisions that guide our actions. Iwould like you to consider these questions:<br><br>• What are my sources of feedback?<br><br>• Am I receiving spiritual feedback from divine sources?<br><br>• How often am I receiving feedback?<br><br>• How can I ensure that my feedback is accurate and true?<br><br>The feedback that we receive and use can be true, accurate, and frequent, which is what we want, or it can be infrequent and in error in a variety of ways. If we consider an unmanned aircraft that is following a path to a desired destination, it will reach its destination as long as the feedback it receives about its location relative to the path is accurate and is received with sufficient frequency. On the other hand, if the feedback is in error in some way, whether it is biased, noisy, or otherwise incorrect, the aircraft will not converge to the desired path and will not arrive at its destination. Interestingly, even accurate feedback that is delayed or received too infrequently can lead to poor outcomes.<br><br>The same is true for us in our lives. We must be wise and careful in choosing our sources of feedback because those sources that are most readily available to us, such as the Internet and popular culture, are sometimes biased, inconsistent, or just plain wrong. Decisions and actions based on errant information will not put us on a path to our desired destination.<br><br>Feedback really is a powerful concept. Used properly, it can guide us precisely to our eternal goal, and, used improperly, it can lead us away. Critical to its proper use is consistent and steady action based on accurate and frequent feedback.<br><br>One of the best examples in the scriptures of a feedback device is the Liahona.<sup>3</sup> The Liahona was given to Lehi and his family early in their journey into the wilderness. It was composed of a ball and pointers, and it functioned like a compass in the sense that its pointers indicated the direction in which Lehi and his family should travel. Unlike a magnetic compass, the pointers were controlled by divine means and showed them the way the Lord would have them go.<br><br>We learn some details about the function ofthe Liahona from Nephi, who had firsthand experience using it. In addition to the pointers within the ball that directed their journey, Nephi described how words were written on the ball that gave them understanding concerning the ways of the Lord. Nephi told us that the words were "changed from time to time"<sup>4</sup> and that the pointers directed the family's way "according to the faith and diligence and heed which [they] did give unto them."<sup>5</sup><br><br>After discussing how the Liahona worked, Nephi drew this significant conclusion: "And thus we see that by small means the Lord can bring about great things."<sup>6</sup> From this we learn that there is real power in these so-called "small means" because they open up pathways for frequent and accurate spiritual feedback. The wonderful thing is that we all have access to this power that comes from being faithful, diligent, and heedful, and fortunately it doesn't require us to have our own real Liahona hardware.<br><br>Later in the Book of Mormon, in Alma 37, Alma was nearing the end of his life, and he spoke to his son Helaman about the Liahona and reiterated much of what Nephi had taught about its operation.<sup>7</sup> Alma further explained that when their fathers "were slothful, and forgot to exercise their faith and diligence," the Liahona failed to function, and they wandered and were afflicted in their journey.<sup>8</sup> We could say that their feedback had become intermittent.<br><br>Alma then followed with some of my ­favorite verses of scripture:<br><br><i> And now, my son, I would that ye should understand that these things are not without a shadow; for as our fathers were slothful to give heed to this compass ... they did not prosper; even so it is with things which are spiritual.</i><br><br><i> For behold, it is as easy to give heed to the word of Christ, which will point to you a straight course to eternal bliss, as it was for our fathers to give heed to this compass, which would point unto them a straight course to the promised land.</i><br><br><i> ... For just as surely as this director did bring our fathers, by following its course, to the promised land, shall the words of Christ, if we follow their course, carry us beyond this vale of sorrow into a far better land of promise.</i><br><br><i> O my son, do not let us be slothful because of the easiness of the way; for so was it with our fathers; for so was it prepared for them, that if they would look they might live; even so it is with us. The way is prepared, and if we will look we may live forever.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>The Liahona was a literal source of navigational feedback for Lehi and his family. It helped them find their way through the wilderness to the promised land. The Liahona is also a metaphor for the spiritual feedback that is available to us--namely, the words of Christ, of which the scriptures are one example. Remember, for feedback to be effective in helping us stay on the path, it needs to be accurate and frequent. The scriptures are true and thus accurate, and they are as frequent and consistent as we allow them to be. They are a beacon of truth and a source of divine feedback that can guide us on our path through life.<br><h2><b>The Holy Ghost as a Source of Divine Feedback</b></h2><br>In the case of Lehi and his family, the words of Christ that were written on the ball represented revelation and inspiration from the Lord. In the same way, the Holy Ghost can be a source of inspiration in our lives. Elder DavidA. Bednar has taught about the Liahona and how it is a type and a shadow for the Holy Ghost in our day. He said:<br><br><i> As we strive to align our attitudes and actions with righteousness, then the Holy Ghost becomes for us today what the Liahona was for Lehi and his family in their day. The very factors that caused the Liahona to work for Lehi will likewise invite the Holy Ghost into our lives. And the very factors that caused the Liahona not to work anciently will likewise cause us to withdraw ourselves from the Holy Ghost today.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>Alma and Nephi used the words <i>faith, heed,</i> and <i>diligence</i><sup>11</sup> to describe the key factors governing the function of the Liahona. These same small means are the principles by which the Spirit can bless and guide our lives. We must have the faith to look to the Savior, and we must believe that we can receive guidance through the Spirit. We must be persistent in our efforts to seek the influence of the Spirit in our lives, and we must pay careful attention to feel and follow the guidance we receive.<br><br>Elder Bednar has also emphasized the influential role of the Holy Ghost in our mortal journey. He taught:<br><br><i> Faithfully obeying God's commandments is essential to receiving the Holy Ghost. We are reminded of this truth each week as we listen to the sacrament prayers and worthily partake of the bread and water. As we pledge our willingness to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ, to always remember Him, and to keep His commandments, we are promised that we may always have His Spirit to be with us (see D&amp;amp;C 20:77). Thus, everything the Savior's gospel teaches us to do and become is intended to bless us with the companionship of the Holy Ghost.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>The gift of the Holy Ghost is an amazing form of spiritual feedback for us. It is the primary means by which our Heavenly Father influences our lives. It is real and it is individualized. The scriptures teach that "by the power of the Holy Ghost [we can] know the truth of all things"<sup>13</sup> and that "the Holy Ghost... will show unto [us] all things [that we] should do."<sup>14</sup> The companionship of the Holy Ghost is a wonderful gift! As feedback, it is perfectly accurate, and it can be frequent.<br><br>We can come under the Holy Ghost's influence with greater frequency and power by being faithful and diligent in praying, in searching the scriptures, in partaking of the sacrament worthily and renewing covenants with real intent, in worshiping in the temple, and in remembering the Savior <i>always</i>. You might know of ways to bring the Spirit into your life that are uniquely effective for you. We must be careful not to neglect these small things that strengthen the divine feedback channel that the Spirit represents.<br><br>President HenryB. Eyring taught that if we want the companionship of the Spirit to be more frequent, we need to heed the promptings that we receive. He said:<br><br><i>The most valuable inspiration will be for you to know what God would have you do. .</i>..<i> Whatever it is, do it. When you demonstrateyour willingness to obey, the Spirit will send you more impressions of what God would have you do for Him.</i><br><br><i> As you obey, the impressions from the Spirit will come more frequently, becoming closer and closer to constant companionship. Your power to choose the right will increase.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>If you live close to the Spirit in your life, I am confident that you will receive promptings and guidance that will push you far outside of your current comfort zone. You may be prompted to take a job in a location far away from family and friends. You may feel inspired to serve a mission and to accelerate your preparation. You may be guided to pursue an advanced degree even though you have a growing family and are not sure how it could possibly work out. You may even be prompted to ask someone out on a date.<br><br>Whenever my wife, Amber, has the opportunity to introduce us to a new ward of young single adults, she always works in the story of how she asked me out first. Even though she keeps repeating the story, which is a little embarrassing for me, I am grateful for that inspired act, as things have worked out really well for us together. I invited her to join me at the podium today to share her version of our courtship story one more time to a really big audience, but, understandably, she politely declined.<br><br>The Spirit will guide you to do hard things that challenge you to the core. The Liahona did not direct Lehi and his family to go back to Jerusalem to a life of comfort and convenience. It led them farther into the wilderness. It directed them, a land-loving people, to cross an ocean. Of course the Liahona was guiding them to their promised land, but the path that they were required to follow stretched their faith and their capabilities.<br><br>The guidance you receive through the Holy Ghost may at times feel risky or may even induce within you feelings of inadequacy and fear of failure. Don't be afraid. Recognize the source of the promptings you are receiving and have the faith to act. You may be humbled by the circumstances you find yourself in, but remember that God's grace is sufficient to strengthen you.<sup>16</sup><br><br>Many of the great pathfinders in the scriptures were humbled by the situations they were placed in. Moses felt inadequate and overwhelmed with God's directive to lead Israel out of Egypt.<sup>17</sup> Nephi was at times immensely frustrated with his own weakness and inability.<sup>18</sup> In this dispensation, the Prophet Joseph Smith was humbled by his lack of a formal education.<sup>19</sup> In spite of their weaknesses, God accomplished His will through them--and He will do so with you as well if you follow HisSpirit.<br><h2><b>Receiving Feedback from Inspired Friends, Leaders, and Loved Ones</b></h2><br>As we move through life, we can sometimes become distracted from our important objectives. It is critical to remember that helpful guidance and feedback in our journey can come from inspired friends, leaders, and loved ones.<br><br>After I completed my master's degree at BYU, I accepted employment as a staff engineer at the University of Utah. The work was exciting and fast paced. Amber and I were enjoying life. Our finances were suddenly much improved. We were working on starting our family, and we were serving in the Church in new and more responsible ways. Everything was going great for us.<br><br>Leading up to this time, I had thought a lot about pursuing a doctoral degree. Over time, however, because I was enjoying work and life was going so well, my commitment to pursue additional education had begun to fade. I had not made a decision one way or the other and had simply let other things take precedence. By not making a conscious effort to prayerfully consider my future, I was in essence letting life's circumstances decide for me. In a sense, I was not acting but rather was being acted upon.<br><br>One afternoon, after I had been working for almost a year, I received a phone call in my office from Professor Joseph C. Free. Joe, whom I called Dr. Free back then, was a professor in the BYU Mechanical Engineering Department. He had taken an interest in me as an undergraduate student and had later served as my graduate advisor. He was a trusted mentor and friend with whom I had talked quite a lot about graduate school.<br><br>We caught up a bit on what had been going on in our lives, and after some conversation he asked me how my PhD plans were shaping up. I shared with him how well things were going for me at work and in life generally. I told him that Amber was expecting our first child and that I thought I would stay put where I was.<br><br>In response, he expressed his happiness that things were going so well for me, and then he said something that I will never forget. He said, "I am disappointed that you aren't going forward with your plans for a PhD."<br><br>Not a lot more was said, and we wrapped up our call together. I was not surprised by Joe's comment, and initially I did not think too much about it. But his words stuck in my mind for weeks, and I eventually concluded that I needed to prayerfully consider my future and seek the guidance of the Spirit.<br><br>Amber and I did pray, and together we decided that more school was the right thing for us and that sooner was better than later. About nine months later, on a hot summer evening, we drove west out of Salt Lake City into the setting sun with our twin baby girls strapped in their car seats to begin six of the most challenging, fulfilling, and fun years of our lives.<br><br>This story has a nice ending. About seven years after Joe's phone call to me, I accepted employment as a professor here at BYU. I was hired into Joe's position and began to teach the classes he had once taught. Interestingly, the phone number that he had once called me from became, and is to this day, my phone number.<br><h2><b>"Fail Often to Succeed Sooner"</b></h2><br>By starting my message today showing video clips from several successful unmanned aircraft flight tests, I may have given the misleading impression that successful flight tests are easily achieved and that we are just out having fun all the time. The truth is that a successful flight test that yields five minutes of video can require a graduate student or a team of students a year or more of preparation and effort to successfully complete. A little calculation shows that one minute of good video results requires about 50,000 minutes of preparation and effort--along with numerous setbacks and failures. Just like life, nothing ever goes exactly according to plan.<br><br>As we fly along our path through life, at times we may crash. Sometimes, despite our best efforts, we may feel like we just keep going down. Unlike what may happen with drones, our crashes in life--whether due to our own sins or weaknesses or to the random difficulties of life--do not result in permanent damage. We can be repaired and made whole again through the atoning sacrifice of the Savior.<br><br>Because we are each intimately familiar with our own weaknesses, the repeated setbacks that we all experience on a personal level can be discouraging. These feelings are amplified as we view the lives of those around us, especially through the lens of social media. All we tend to see are the highlight reels of others' successes, too easily forgetting that they also have bloopers that are simply too embarrassing or painful to share. As we assess our progress toward our goals, we must avoid the temptation to compare our progress with that of those around us. Comparisons to others generally do not provide the personalized, accurate feedback that we each need to reach our inspired goals in life.<br><br>Since we all fail at one time or another, it is important to realize that some failures can and should be avoided while others are a natural consequence of our efforts to progress and become better.<sup>20</sup> You are in a phase of your life in which much of your effort is focused on personal growth and development as you consider your education, careers, and relationships. These things are difficult, and the risk of failing is real.<br><br>Sometimes, when we face big decisions or challenges in life, we can be slow to act for fear of making a mistake. In the field of engineering design, a common exhortation is to "fail often to succeed sooner."<sup>21</sup> Of course the objective is not to fail. Instead, this saying can inspire us to act decisively under the guidance of the Spirit when we face uncertainty. We must remember that if we try something hard and then fail, we will always learn something beneficial in the process. It is often better to act in the best way we know how and to learn from our mistakes than to be paralyzed to the point of inaction because of fear.<br><br>President BoydK. Packer once shared a story in which, as a new General Authority, he sought the counsel of President DavidO. McKay. But after receiving the prophet's counsel, he saw no possible way of following it. He explained his situation to Elder HaroldB. Lee, who said, "The trouble with you is you want to see the end from the beginning."<br><br>President Packer then received what he called "the lesson of a lifetime" from Elder Lee, who continued, "You must learn to walk to the edge of the light, and then a few steps into the darkness; <i>then the light will appear and show the way before you</i>."<sup>22</sup><br><br>This principle was also taught by Nephi. As he sought to retrieve the gold plates from Laban after two failed attempts, he went forth in faith a third time, even when he wasn't sure what to do. He said, "I was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which I should do. Nevertheless I went forth."<sup>23</sup> We must go forward too.<br><h2><b>Seek the Influence of the Holy Ghost</b></h2><br>It is comforting to know that we need not wander alone on our mortal journey through life. Through consistent, seemingly small acts ofdevotion, we can have the guiding influence of the Holy Ghost with us continually, and by following His guidance we can bring to pass great things. This is the power of the Holy Ghost. Its importance cannot be overemphasized, as it can influence every aspect of our spiritual navigation system.<br><br>The Holy Ghost can bless us with an expansive vision of our future. He can provide essential feedback to help us correctly assess our progress on our journey and where we are relative to our desired path. He can guide us to make inspired choices and decisions. And He can give us the courage and resolve to act, both in recognizing and in following His guidance. With the divine feedback of the Spirit that is available to us, we need not ever feel spiritually lost.<br><br>In his most recent conference address, President ThomasS. Monson taught:<br><br><i>Our goal is to obtain celestial glory, and the choices we make will, in large part, determine whether or not we reach our goal. .</i>..<br><br><i> . . . It </i><b><i>does</i></b><i> matter which way we go, for the path we follow in this life leads to our destination in the next life.</i><sup>24</sup><br><br>It is my belief that we can obtain this goal of celestial glory as we seek and follow the divine feedback that comes through the still, small voice of the Holy Ghost. It is my hope that we can be faithful and diligent in doing the small things that will allow this guiding feedback to be both frequent and perfectly accurate, leading us to the great things that God has intended forus.<br><br>I bear my witness that God lives, that we are His children, and that He loves each of us. Because of that love, He sent His Son to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world and to give us hope and a path to return to Him. That we may seek the influence of the Holy Spirit to find and follow that path is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Timothy W.

<h1> Seeker: The Way, the Truth, and the Life - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning, brothers and sisters! I am grateful to see many friends and family and wonderful students. It humbles me to be with you today.<br><br>I believe in truth in advertising: what I share today is far more important than I am capable of expressing. Those of us who teach the gospel soon realize that we are just not good enough. But I know that with the Lord's help I can do what needs to be done. I pray for that help for all of us as we spend the next few minutes together.<br><br>There is power in truth. The Savior taught that "the truth shall make you free."<sup>1</sup> In theory, we have all come to BYU in search of truth. I realize that there are many other possible motives for being here, from career preparation to the supposed mystery of marriage preparation. Much of my career has been spent helping my students learn how to date, court, and marry well.<br><br>I was tempted to speak on those issues today but decided to speak on another issue I am passionate about. Thirty minutes will not allow a full exploration of this topic, but it will allow an introduction. I will be teaching a four-day version of this speech at Campus Education Week this August for any who are gluttons for punishment and would like more detail.<br><h2><b>Courage in the Quest for Truth</b></h2><br>We live in a world filled with differing views, opinions, and philosophies. Never have we had more access to information. Our task is to decide what is true and what is false. On some issues, that decision is not so crucial, such as whether Cafe Rio or Costa Vida is best. Other issues are fraught with immense--at times even eternal--consequences.<br><br>For example, my dear friend Daniel Judd and I chaired the committee that created the new Eternal Family cornerstone class in Religious Education. I don't have to work hard to convince my single students of the importance of knowing how to select an eternal companion. Understanding the vast consequences of that decision, most students are strongly motivated to understand truth. In fact, many students are terrified that they don't know and can't know that truth.<br><br>A 2002 BYU study asked students how they would know they had found the one they wanted to marry. Most gave a few possible answers, but a full 11 percent simply answered, "I don't know," with men being almost twice as likely to express that fear.<sup>2</sup><br><br>In humility, it is wise for us all to acknowledge our imperfection in determining truth. None of us have all the answers, least of all me. President DieterF. Uchtdorf explained, "It seems to be part of our nature as human beings to make assumptions about people, politics, and piety based on our incomplete and often misleading experience."<sup>3</sup><br><br>An example I often use in my Eternal Family class is of a husband who observed his wife turning back and forth in front of a mirror. Since her birthday was not far off, he asked what she would like for her birthday. Still looking in the mirror, she replied, "I'd like to be six again."<br><br>Well, on the morning of her birthday, he rose early, made her a big bowl of Lucky Charms, and then took her to a Six Flags theme park. After five hours enjoying every ride, he took her to McDonald's, where he ordered her a Happy Meal with extra fries and a chocolate shake. Then it was off to the movies, with popcorn, soda, and candy. They finally wobbled home, and with a big smile he asked, "Well, dear, what was it like being six again?"<br><br>Her eyes slowly opened, and her expression suddenly changed: "I meant my dress size."<br><br>So, are we hopeless? Are we unable to know truth? Of course we can know truth! Heavenly Father has not sent us here without revealing the principles and practices we need to recognize and follow truth. And yet for many--even within the Church--there appears to be a crisis of confidence in our ­ability to know truth.<br><br>We see the same scenario play out over and over again. Friends or loved ones come across information that seems to contradict what they thought they knew. They investigate further and find out that their past understanding really was flawed. Church history turns out to be far more complex than the basic Sunday School narrative. Church leaders, past and present, turn out to be mere mortals indeed. The unfairness of life challenges their understanding of the results of righteous living. And the list goes on and on.<br><br>Have you experienced this? Has someone you loved experienced it? I guess there is not a person here who has not been touched by such circumstances. Though you may not have personally experienced such a crisis, each of us must continue to grow in light and truth. What are we to do? How do we make it through such a crisis ourselves, or how do we help those we love? When such questions arise--and they will arise for us all--<i>how</i> we approach them will have almost as much impact on the outcome as will the truthfulness of the issues we are grappling with.<br><br>When questions and doubts arise, it is easy to feel vulnerable. We may feel like our whole world is crashing down. Finding that our understanding of one issue is in error can lead us to doubt everything else we thought we knew. With wounded hearts, some people come to the conclusion that they have been purposefully deceived--that they have been lied to. For some, such feelings of betrayal are harder to deal with than the historical or doctrinal issue that began the crisis. My heart hurts for those who feel this way. The feeling is real, even if the purposeful deception is not.<br><br>Others faced with such a crisis may begin to question the possibility of knowing any truth. Since their past efforts to know truth seem to have proven faulty, they question whether their current efforts are also destined to fail. It does not have to be this way. It should not be this way. I testify that there is a better way. We and our loved ones can approach these moments in a way that leaves us more--not less--confident in our ability to know and live truth. If we face our questions with courage and integrity, our knowledge can continue to expand and our faith can continue to be strengthened.<br><br>President HowardW. Hunter made a ­promise that I would like to echo today:<br><br><i>These doubts can be resolved, if </i>[those who doubt] <i>have an honest desire to know the truth, by exercising moral, spiritual, and mental effort. They will emerge from the conflict into a firmer, stronger, larger faith because of the struggle. They have gone from a simple, trusting faith, through doubt and conflict, into a solid substantial faith which ripens into testimony.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>How do we help ourselves or our loved ones in our combined quest for truth? There are three crucial steps: (1) Become a seeker--do not fear questions; (2) love and respect all, regardless of whether we agree with the conclusions they reach; and (3) learn and share the vital principles and practices for knowing truth.<br><h2><b>Become a Seeker--Do Not Fear Questions</b></h2><br>Far too many of us fear questions. We have nothing to fear. President Uchtdorf explained, "My dear young friends, we are a question-­asking people because we know that inquiry leads to truth."<sup>5</sup> The scriptures make it clear that we are commanded to seek.<sup>6</sup> They are replete with examples of those who went from darkness to light through seeking: Enoch, Abraham, Moses, Paul, Alma, Joseph Smith. Even Jesus Christ grew "from grace to grace"<sup>7</sup> through seeking for and adhering to truth.<br><br>As we ask questions, we must avoid a fate similar to that of a character in C.S. Lewis's classic book <i>The Great Divorce</i>. This character became so driven by questions and questioning that he ceased to believe in the possibility of answers. This character was counseled:<br><br><i>Once you were a child. Once you knew what inquiry was for. There was a time when you asked questions because you wanted answers, and were glad when you had found them. Become that child again: even now.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>That is great advice. The scriptures command us to seek and warn us not to be "ever learning, [but] never able to come to the knowledge of the truth."<sup>9</sup> This way of being is as bad as its evil twin: "Never learning but always believing we know the truth."<sup>10</sup><br><br>We must become seekers. We must encourage learning. We must "hunger and thirst after righteousness,"<sup>11</sup> which just happens to be another name for truth and for Jesus Christ Himself.<sup>12</sup><br><br>I must make one important clarification: many people use the words <i>questioning</i> and <i>doubting</i> synonymously. I believe this leads to serious epistemological confusion. <i>Epistemology</i> refers to how we know what we know. I will use this word several times today. Conflating doubt with asking questions leads people to value doubt as if it were itself a virtue. You hear sayings such as "If a person has never doubted, they have never thought." But doubting and questioning are not the same thing.<br><br>Doubt is part of the belief spectrum, which goes from disbelief to doubt to hope to belief. Where do questions fit on this spectrum? Can you see that questions can occur at any point on the spectrum? So what is the role of doubt? Is it evil? Is it good?<br><br>Doubt in many ways is neither moral nor immoral but rather amoral. If the object of our doubt is false, such as believing in prophetic infallibility--that any human error disqualifies a person from being a prophet--then doubting that falsehood leads to good outcomes. However, if the object of our doubt is true, such as God commanding us to give heed to the words of His servants the prophets even with their imperfections, then doubting that truth leads to bad outcomes. One thing is for sure: doubt has consequences.<br><br>Elder BruceC. Hafen quoted the famous American philosopher William James, who explained:<br><br><i>Belief and doubt are living attitudes, and involve conduct on our part. .</i>.<i>. If I doubt that you are worthy of my confidence, I keep you uninformed of all my secrets just as if you were </i><b><i>u</i></b><b><i>n</i></b><i>worthy of the same. If I doubt the need of insuring my house, I leave it uninsured as much as if I believed there were no need. .</i><i>.</i><i>. There are</i> ... <i>inevitable occasions in life .</i>.<i>. when not to be for is to be practically against</i>.<sup>13</sup><br><br>So should we never doubt? Of course not--there are too many false ideas to safely navigate through life without doubt. But doubt must never be seen as a final destination or as proof of our intellectual honesty.<br><br>Elder JohnA. Widtsoe explained:<br><br><i>Doubt, therefore, can be and should be only a temporary condition. .</i><i>.</i><i>.</i><br><br><i> In other words, doubt .</i><i>.</i><i>. must never itself be an end. Doubt as an objective of life is an intellectual and a spiritual offense. .</i><i>.</i><i>.</i><br><br><i> . . . Doubt, unless transmuted into inquiry, has no value or worth in the world. Of itself it has never lifted a brick, driven a nail, or turned a furrow.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>It may be for this reason that the scriptures never, not even once, speak of doubt as a positive.<sup>15</sup><br><br>The Lord counsels against doubt, not to create guilt but to give guidance. Think about the following scriptural admonitions, which, when paired together, teach similar lessons: "doubt not" and "be believing"; "fear not" and "be of good courage"; "be not dismayed," "be steadfast and weep not," and "be of good cheer." God is not trying to create guilt with His command to fear not. Similarly, He commands the positive in each couplet not to make us feel guilty but to help us escape the negative consequences that come from doubting truth. We should never feel guilty or make others feel guilty for having doubts. Please do not do that. But as the Savior encourages, we should seek to answer our questions and act on those answers, not wallow in our unsurety.<br><h2><b>Love and Respect All</b></h2><br>Though we should not villainize those who have questions or concerns, we should not lionize doubt either.<br><br>Elder M.Russell Ballard clearly taught:<br><br><i>When someone comes to you with a question or a concern, please do not brush the question off--do not tell him or her to not worry about the question. Please do not doubt the person's dedication to the Lord or His work. Instead, help the person find the answers to their questions.</i><sup>16</sup><br><br>There is no place for condescension or ­judgment on our part. If we would be of help, if we would have the right to share in another person's journey, we must respect and love them. We must see their goodness and value their insights and integrity, even as we may not always agree with their conclusions. It is okay. They may also not always agree with our conclusions, yet we hope they will love, value, and respect us as well.<br><h2><b>Learn and Live Truth</b></h2><br>Heavenly Father has given us every tool needed to discover and live by truth--both temporal and eternal. I would like to spend the remainder of our time discussing three ways of knowing truth. At the risk of sounding cliché, I am going to liken these methods to the legs of a stool.<br><br>A one-legged stool can serve a purpose but will be much less stable than a stool with more legs. A two-legged stool would be more stable but still be fairly easy to topple. But a three-legged stool provides solid stability.<br><br>There are three methods I want to speak on today: (1) using our best thinking (logic or reason); (2) learning from our lived experience (sometimes called utilitarianism or pragmatism); and (3) seeking revelation, which, I will work hard to explain, is a relational concept. This point is crucial. It is the main point I want toget across.<br><br>The ordering of these methods is not ­random. I will try to show how each method builds on the other and leads to capital-T truth itself.<br><h3><b><i>1. Our Best Thinking (Logic or Reason)</i></b></h3><br>Blind faith has no productive role in the acquisition of truth. The Lord requires us to use not only our hearts but our minds in seeking truth. Both faith and knowledge are dependent on "<i>evidence</i> of things not seen," to quote Paul.<sup>17</sup> Peter counseled us to "be ready always to give an answer [for] a <i>reason</i> of the hope that is in you."<sup>18</sup> Alma admonished us to "experiment upon [the] words"<sup>19</sup>--a clear allusion to seeking evidence. The Lord promised that He would witness to both our mind and our heart.<sup>20</sup> Clearly God requires us to think, reason, and weigh evidence.<br><br>Joseph Smith taught:<br><br><i>The things of God are of deep import; and time, and experience, and careful and ponderous and solemn thoughts can only find them out. Thy mind, O man! if thou wilt lead a soul unto salvation, must stretch as high as the utmost heavens, and search into and contemplate the darkest abyss, and the broad expanse of eternity.</i><sup>21</sup><br><br>Such mind-stretching effort, far from being discouraged, is required if we would know the things of God.<br><br>But our best reasoning will not be enough. Because of this, many who begin to doubt stall in their search for truth. We cannot simply reason our way to ultimate truth. If we refuse to exercise the faith sufficient to add the other two necessary ingredients for knowing truth--that is, sincerely acting on what we want to know the truth of and seeking revelation from the source of all truth--we will likely be stuck "ever learning, [but] never able to come to the knowledge of the truth."<br><br>Fearing that we are deceiving ourselves or are being deceived, we may cease to exercise the faith necessary to act so that we can receive the very evidence we seek. We become like a chef who purchases all of the ingredients for a master meal but refuses to prepare and eat the food. Such a chef will never know the possible result of their effort. They may believe that the process is flawed, when in reality they are only doing a portion of what must be done to reap the rewards they seek.<br><br>You see, logical argument and sound reasoning, as important as they are, were never intended to be sufficient for knowing truth,<sup>22</sup> but they do provide the ground upon which such knowledge can grow.<br><br>Elder NealA. Maxwell regularly quoted a statement made by Austin Farrer regarding C.S. Lewis:<br><br><i>Though argument does not create conviction, the lack of it destroys belief. What seems to be proved may not be embraced; but what no one shows the ability to defend is quickly abandoned. Rational argument does not create belief, but it maintains aclimate in which belief may flourish.</i><sup>23</sup><br><br>Sound reasoning not only leads to faith but can also help us avoid many of the sincerely believed but unsound arguments that cause people to doubt their faith. We must learn to reason more soundly to know truth. Whether that reasoning takes the form of authoritarianism, rationalism, empiricism, or any other cognitive epistemology, that support can provide the scaffolding on which to build a living, breathing faith and come to a correct understanding of truth.<br><br>Besides the obvious spiritual challenges, there are numerous cognitive challenges that keep our best thinking from being sufficient alone. For example, authoritarianism is only as dependable as the expert we are relying on. Rationalism simply tells us that what we are learning agrees with the premises we already believe in. Add to this the other challenges of confirmation bias, and rationalism cannot be the sole means of determining truth. Empiricism, as with its cousins ­statistical ­empiricismand scientific empiricism, is only asreliable as our methods and ­interpretations are. None of this negates the necessity and ­profitability of using our best thinking. It sim­ply helps us see that there are limits to what wecan claim based solely on reason and logic.<br><br>Perhaps an example would help to clarify. Understanding our history provides crucial context with which to understand God's work among His children. But as mentioned above, our history is far more nuanced than the summaries contained in most of our curriculum. With the subjectivity of historical recorders and reporters and the vast differences in the quality and reliability of historical sources, it requires our best thinking to interpret and comprehend that history.<br><br>Elder BruceC. Hafen once explained that most historical "evidence" would never be allowed in a modern court of law because it is nearly impossible to verify its accuracy.<sup>24</sup> Ifwe wouldn't want to be judged on the basis ofsuch weak and biased evidence, why do we feel it is sufficient to definitively judge others with such evidence?<br><br>But even supposing we had a completely accurate and bias-free history (which, of course, we do not), we would still be fairly limited in the conclusions we could draw regarding much of what is most important. History may be able to show the possibility and, in some cases, the plausibility of an event, but rarely its inevitability or actuality.<br><br>For example, what can we really know of Jesus Christ from a purely historical point of view? Some even question whether there was a Jesus Christ, based solely on the historical record, let alone the reality of His miraculous birth, the details of His ministry, the truth of His teachings, the miracles He performed, or, most important of all, His Atonement and ­triumphant Resurrection.<br><br>The same can be said regarding a historical study of His servants. History can give us valuable context, but history alone cannot confirm the Savior's appearance to Paul or to Joseph Smith. History has value, especially if we learn some basic yet essential principles of historical analysis.<sup>25</sup> We simply have to be careful not to ask of it more than it can deliver.<br><h3><b><i>2. Lived Experience (Utilitarianism or Pragmatism)</i></b></h3><br>I believe a careful reading of Alma 32 helps us understand that the experiment Alma recommended involves more than simply thinking about what we are trying to prove true. Heavenly Father is not interested in turning His children into bright, philosophically sophisticated adults who value thinking above being. We were not sent here to simply gain a cognitive knowledge of truth but rather to live by truth to become as He, meaning God, is.<br><br>For this reason, the second means of ­discovering truth--lived experience, which philosophically may be referred to as utilitarianism or pragmatism--seems perfectly designed to augment and deepen what we can learn through our best thinking.<br><br>The Savior instructed us to discover and ultimately live truth based on our own lived experience. Hestated:<br><br><i>My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</i><br><br><i> If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak ofmyself.</i><sup>26</sup><br><br>I marvel at how perfect this arrangement is. The only way we can deepen our knowledge oftruth beyond mere philosophy is to be willing to live it. Heavenly Father and Heavenly Mother's ultimate goal is "to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man."<sup>27</sup> They want us to become as They are. By Their requiring us to believe, to choose, and to act, we are required to move beyond mere supposition to the work of becoming.<br><br>But more than disinterested action is required. God is not interested in empty ­gestures. Mere curiosity or even scientific inquiry won't work. God requires a deep sincerity and real intent. President RussellM. Nelson explained that "'real intent' means that one <i>really intends</i> to follow the divine direction given."<sup>28</sup> This is exactly what the Lord desires--not just our actions but our heart.<sup>29</sup> Asthe scriptures explain, we are required to "follow the Son, with full purpose of heart, ­acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God, but with real intent."<sup>30</sup><br><br>Just as with logic and reason, acting alone has limitations and is insufficient for knowing ultimate truth. There are challenges that must be understood. For example, the law of justice demands that there be a fitting consequence to every thought, word, or deed.<sup>31</sup> However, one reason we left God's presence for a time was to learn to act because we wanted to, not because we were compelled to act based on immediate and overwhelming consequences. The law of justice is real but not immediate. People who do evil do not necessarily reap the reward of that evil immediately any more than people who do good reap the reward of that good immediately. But the results will always come.<br><br>Because of this reality, it is not enough to simply "check our pulse" immediately after we act. We must examine more deeply the consequences of actions. An immoral life may feel wonderful in the short run, but as even social science clearly attests, it is a very poor philosophy of life in the long run. True principles should bear good fruit in the long run. There is a reason why studies of active, believing Latter-day Saints find that Mormons are almost always near the top when compared with other groups, whether the studies be about finances, health, education, happiness, prosocial behavior, or family life. Though Latter-day Saints are far from perfect, and we must become better, the research is overwhelmingly affirmative. Toquote President Uchtdorf, the gospel "works wonderfully."<sup>32</sup><br><br>There is another caveat to consider: neither we nor our actions are totally evil or totally good. There is usually some good mixed with some bad--both of which will bear fruit in our lives. We sometimes see a person doing something we know to be wrong and yet see that they aren't miserable and hence conclude that what they are doing must not really be wrong. It behooves us to learn to better understand cause and effect.<br><br>Let me use the example of immorality again.Two people who have allowed immoral behavior to become part of their relationship may also treat each other kindly and do many other good things. Though the immoral behavior will have consequences, this does not mean that everything about their relationship is based on unrighteousness. Therefore it would be simplistic and wrong to believe that their relationship can only produce misery. Wewill all reap the fruits of both the good and the bad we do. Understanding this reality helps us more intelligently learn truth through livedexperience.<br><h3><b><i>3. Revelation: The Relational Epistemology</i></b></h3><br>As helpful as our best thinking and our lived experience are for knowing truth, neither of them are sufficient in and of themselves. God is not limited to our mortal sphere and therefore stands outside of man's ability to measure and investigate by using nothing but secular means.<br><br>In the Book of Mormon, Jacob taught:<br><br><i> Behold, great and marvelous are the works of the Lord. How unsearchable are the depths of the mysteries of him; and it is impossible that man should find out all his ways. And no man knoweth of his ways save it be revealed unto him; wherefore, brethren, despise not the revelations of God.</i><sup>33</sup><br><br>Elder BruceR. McConkie once stated: "True religion is revealed religion; it is not a ­creation of man's devising; it comes from God. ... God stands revealed or he remains forever unknown."<sup>34</sup> Any attempt to know the truth ofGod and His gospel while denying or denigrating the need and utility of revelation is doomed to fail.<br><br>A popular refrain in the blogosphere is that revelation cannot be trusted. It is pointed out that people of many faiths claim revelatory experiences and come to disparate conclusions. The question is asked, "How can you trust a process that leads to such disagreement?" There are a dozen reasons why convergence, meaning mutual agreement, will never be a valid means of judging the epistemological value of revelation, but suffice it to say that outside of concrete, naturalistic scientific experiments, convergence is limited--not absent, but ­limited--for all methods of knowing truth.<br><br>You generally do not hear educated people denigrating the value of using our best ­thinking--be that historical, logical, or ­scientific--simply because people reach different conclusions. This same reality exists for lived experience. People often draw different conclusions as a result of their actions. And yet, when it comes to revelation, the popular argument persists that because people come to different conclusions, revelation cannot be trusted. This argument is sophistry--pure and simple.<br><br>It is definitely true that our interpretations of revelation can vary or be flawed. Just as with our best thinking and our lived experience, our interpretation of revelation is not sufficient to carry the load alone--not because of any inadequacies in God's revelations but rather because of our less-than-perfect power to interpret them. However, as we learn the principles that govern the receipt of revelation and combine revelation with our best thinking and our lived experience, we can have great confidence in our ability to come to a knowledge of truth.<br><br>Again, I marvel at how perfect an arrangement this epistemological triad is. We were not intended to merely become philosophic sophisticates, nor were we intended to simply become good people by living truth. We are here on earth to learn what we need to learn so that we can become what we are intended to become and return to the presence of our loving Heavenly Father and Mother for eternity. We are meant to more fully develop those sacred relationships.<br><br>Our theology clearly teaches us that we cannot be saved through our own unaided efforts.<sup>35</sup> We totally and completely depend on God's grace, specifically the redeeming love of our Savior Jesus Christ. Is it any wonder that we are also dependent on God for our deepest understanding of truth?<br><br>For this reason I titled this section of my talk "Revelation: The Relational Epistemology." It is also the reason for part of the title of my complete address: "The Way, the Truth, and the Life."<sup>36</sup> Jesus Christ is not simply the truth we are trying to ascertain; He is also the deepest, most poignant, and most sure means of knowing that truth. He will reveal Himself and all truth to us.<sup>37</sup> True spirituality is simply another way of describing a close relationship with God.<br><br>So, unsurprisingly, many of the same principles that lead to strong relationships apply to learning truth. Both require a choice. They are both acts of agency. No one can make the choice for you--not even God. Does a person choose to love their sweetheart or do they not? If not, they will never know the depth and exultant ecstasy that could be the result of that relationship. Similarly, God requires us to choose Him, to choose to believe, and to choose to come to Him. He won't force us or overwhelm us with incontrovertible evidence. We choose whether to respond to His invitation or not. He has already chosen; it is now up to us.<br><br>Similarly, you will never build a meaningful relationship on earth without a deep ­commitment, without sacrifice, without great effort, or without great love. Likewise, if we would know the truth of God, it will require that same type of commitment, that same sacrifice, that same heart-stretching effort, and that same love. Those who refuse to give these things will never understand the deep and powerful love of a companion in this life. Likewise, those who refuse to give these same things in their search for God will fail to know the truth of His love for them. We cannot passively--or even passionately--study and expect that our best thinking will find God. We cannot simply go through the motions of being a Mormon and expect that the power, joy, and might of the Holy Spirit will bring us near to God. If we would come unto God, we must ultimately bring all that we have--all that we are--and lay it on the altar. The good news is that all God requires of us to start is to turn our softened hearts to Him, and He will draw near unto us.<sup>38</sup><br><h2><b>A Firm Conviction</b></h2><br>I have shared three ways of knowing truth. Ithen showed how each is insufficient in and ofitself. However, by combining all three methods, we stand on solid ground in our search for truth. For this reason God has instructed us to use every method He has put at our disposal to know truth. Every branch of science has a version of this same process--called triangulation--to come to more firm conclusions. By using our best thinking, by choosing to act with real intent, and by seeking direct revelation from God, we can come to a humble yet firm conviction of the truth of all things. Our "confidence [can] wax strong"<sup>39</sup> and our foundation of faith can be steadfast.<br><br>Do not buy the argument that you cannot know truth. Do not fear to ask questions and to be a seeker. Do not fear that God or His gospel cannot stand up to scrutiny.<br><br>I testify that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ. I testify that Joseph Smith was God's prophet. I testify that the Book of Mormon is the word of God. I testify that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is led today by Jesus Christ Himself and that He directs His living prophets. And I testify that if we will courageously use all means of knowing truth, we and our loved ones can know these things for ourselves. I leave that testimony in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Michael A.

<h1> Earth&quot; - Wade J. Hollingshaus - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Roughly one decade after the end of World War II, Samuel Beckett completed his second play, <i>Endgame</i>. The title refers to the final portion of a chess match--the outcome pretty much decided but the pieces still needing to be moved. At one point, just over halfway through <i>Endgame</i>'s action--if one can call it that--the character Hamm, frustrated with the unassailability of his reality, utters, "You're on earth, there's no cure for that!" (Samuel Beckett, <i>Endgame: A Play in One Act </i>[New York: Grove Press, 1958], 53, 68).<br><br>In the decades since I first came across this line, I have spent a good deal of time thinking about its implications in the context of the play, in the context of Beckett's life, and in the context of life in the contemporary Western world. But what have occupied my thinking much more often are the implications of this line in the context of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>I speak today as one "on earth"--as one subject to the pains, hardships, and uncertainties constituent of life on earth. As such, I do not know that I will provide many answers. Instead, what I hope to do is raise questions. More correctly, my intention today is to invite you to join me in engaging in the conditions of uncertainty that are a divinely designed part of what it means to be on earth. This is aninvitation to examine what it means to be on earth while being subject to the restrictions of being on earth. So I invite you to explore along with me. This is admittedly more difficult in a lecture environment, but I believe we can move together in thought, each making his or her own momentary excursions into familiar or uncharted waters but returning intermittently to common questions and issues.<br><br>My hope is that we can learn together. In his discussion of learning, the philosopher Gilles Deleuze asserted that there is only so much a swimming instructor can teach a student on the sand. The instructor needs to take the student into the water, where the swimmer's body can learn to negotiate the weight and movement of the waves (see Gilles Deleuze, <i>Difference and Repetition, </i>trans. Paul Patton [New York: Columbia University Press, 1994], 23). By the same logic, at some point the instructor must also let go of the swimmer.<br><br>Those of us on earth know about being let go. It is frightening but exhilarating too. It is a burdensome and wonderful thing. I ask you to keep this in mind for the next little while, for while some patches of what I have prepared will be quite clear--maybe even a Sunday School review for us--other patches may be a bit purple as I attempt to negotiate the weight and movement of the waves that I have been experiencing. Thus it is with soberness and joy that I speak to you today as we think together here "on earth." Ipray that the Spirit of the Lord attends us.<br><br>My talk comprises three sections: (1) The Blessed Fall, (2) Thinking and Playing on Earth, and (3) The End of Art.<br><h2><b>Part One: The Blessed Fall</b></h2><br>To be sure, Hamm's sentence reeks of nihilism: "You're on earth, there's no cure for that!" But at the same time, for one who shares the broader perspective afforded by the gospel, the two phrases also open up a space for hope. To be on the earth, to live in the world--not exactly the same thing, but close enough for our purposes today--is to live in conditions of pain, hardship, and uncertainty. It is to live among thorns and thistles and sweat, as the book of Genesis put it (see Genesis 3:18–19). Beckett had been reading Genesis during his years of writing <i>Endgame--</i>the character name Hamm being an allusion to that first book of the Bible.<br><br>In the context of the gospel, we recognize these conditions as those attendant to what we call the Fall--a duration initiated by transgression in the Garden of Eden, a duration in which the earth and its inhabitants, then and future, exist in a state of separation from the God who created them. Alma calls it a "probationary state" and a "preparatory state" (Alma 42:13), explaining that it is a period in which men and women become "subjects to follow after their own will" (Alma 42:7).<br><br>In this regard, Latter-day Saints would agree with the sentiment of Hamm's words. Indeed, we live in a state of malady; a state of pain, hardship, and uncertainty; a state in need of a cure. But at the same time, we would also be quick to point out that, contrary to Hamm's latter statement, there is in fact a cure for this malady: the Savior, Jesus Christ. Amulek taught that, in response to the Fall, "it is expedient that an atonement should be made; for according to the great plan of the Eternal God there must be an atonement made, or else all mankind must unavoidably perish" (Alma 34:9). He further asserted that "that great and last sacrifice [the Atonement] will be the Son of God" (Alma 34:14). Then, seventy-five years later in another part of the world, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, meekly declared, "It is finished" (John 19:30)--an utterance soon punctuated by those miraculous words of the angel: "He is risen" (Matthew 28:6).<br><br>The Atonement of Jesus Christ conquered the physical and spiritual death ushered in by the Fall. But even though Jesus Christ can be seen as the cure, insofar as His Atonement does redeem us all from the Fall, this does not mean that humankind will not endure the fallen conditions that constitute the earth in its current state. It is essential to the exaltation of each and every one of us that we pass through this fallen condition. In this sense the Fall--with the pain, hardship, and uncertainty that define it--is in actuality a blessing.<br><br>This idea is powerfully expressed in the words of the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith when the Prophet was imprisoned in Liberty Jail. In Doctrine and Covenants 122 the Lord pronounced a litany of trials reflective of what the Prophet had experienced and would yet experience in his life. One glimpse of this is inverse 7:<br><br><i> And if thou shouldst be cast into the pit, or into the hands of murderers, and the sentence of death passed upon thee; if thou be cast into the deep; if the billowing surge conspire against thee; if fierce winds become thine enemy; if the heavens gather blackness, and all the elements combine to hedge up the way; and above all, if the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good.</i><br><br>To some extent, the severity of the trials that Joseph experienced were directly proportionate to the significance and sacredness of the calling he had as prophet. We may not suffer trials as severe, but we are all, without exception, subject to trials: "You're on earth, there's no cure for that!"<br><br>At the time he penned this line for Hamm, even Beckett had been undergoing his own unique set of trials. Born in Dublin, Ireland, Beckett was living as an expatriate in France while writing <i>Endgame.</i> In the year prior to the completion of the first version of the play, he was in the middle of a multiyear creative block, had endured and lost a bitter land dispute involving his home, and had spent an enervating winter caring for his brother Frank, who was suffering through the final months of lung cancer (see Anthony Cronin, <i>Samuel Beckett: The Last Modernist</i> [New York: HarperCollins, 1997], 444, 458; and James Knowlson, <i>Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett</i> [London: Bloomsbury, 1996], 404–5). Beckett, too, lived "on earth." But the same promise that came to Joseph Smith came to Beckett and comes to every one of us: "Know thou, my [child], that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good." To be on earth, to exist in conditions of pain and hardship, is a profound blessing.<br><br>Latter-day Saints often share this account of Joseph Smith when discussing the trials they endure in this life, and rightfully so. Often, when sharing the account, we also continue into verse 8 of section 122, which reads, "The Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou greater than he?"<br><br>In this verse Joseph was reminded--and so are we--of the divine Atonement of our Savior and the saving grace that it is. Moreover, we are reminded that the Lord too lived on earth and was thus not exempt from the blessed malady that is the Fall. This, I believe, is captured by the double prepositional phrase "in and through" that occurs a handful of times in the Book of Mormon--such as, for example, in 2Nephi 2:6: "Wherefore, redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah; for he is full of grace and truth." In order to overcome the Fall <i>for</i> us, Jesus had to endure the Fall <i>as</i> us. Being on earth was just as necessary for His exaltation as it is for ours.<br><br>There are, of course, ways to mitigate some of the trials we face in our lives. Because of what He suffered in the Atonement, the Savior can comfort us in times of need. And just knowing that Jesus Christ "hath descended below" everything can help significantly.<br><br>It helped me during my first month as a missionary in Finland, when I became immensely frustrated with my inability to speak Finnish well enough to do missionary work at the level I desperately wanted to be doing it. I would often read section 122 and find comfort in the Lord's words to Joseph. Of course I was comforted to know that I would be blessed for continuing in the work and studying the language. I had had enough experience in the gospel to know that my obedience to the mission rules, my adherence to the teachings that Ireceived from those with stewardship to train me as a missionary, and my alignment with the spiritual promptings my mission companion and I were receiving would provide their own blessings. Knowledge of and faith in the gospel can help to comfort us in times of pain and hardship.<br><br>But what about one who does not share this same knowledge or faith, or what about one who at one point had faith in the gospel but is now struggling or has struggled with that faith, asking, "Is the gospel true?" It can be difficult to use faith to comfort us in times of trial when it is the state of our faith that is the trial. As I have already noted, even if only cursorily, pain and hardship are part and parcel of the Fall. Uncertainty is equally essential. What is true? How do we know? MichaelA. Goodman adeptly treated these and similar questions in a BYU devotional a couple of weeks ago (see "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/michael-a-goodman_way-truth-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Become a Seeker: The Way, the Truth, and the Life</a>," BYU devotional address, 12 July 2016). He spoke about the epistemological challenges we face when it comes to ascertaining truth in this life.<br><br>I too spend a good deal of time thinking about this. As a missionary I thought a lot about it in terms of helping others gain faith in the principles and ordinances of the gospel. Today, as a university professor and a father of five, I think a lot more about how uncertainty has led a number of those in my life to leave either their faith or their membership in the Church or both. I also think about it in terms of my own spiritual journey and why I persist stalwartly in my faith. Struggling with questions of truth in and of the world is again what it means to be "on earth." And just as with the struggles with pain and hardship, the struggle with uncertainty is a blessed malady that is necessary for our exaltation and eternal progression in the kingdom of God.<br><h2><b>Part Two: Thinking and Playing on Earth</b></h2><br>As one who primarily teaches critical studies courses in the areas of theatre and performance, I have dedicated much of my teaching efforts to inspiring students to think about (1) how they think and (2) how art, performance, literature, and philosophy are or can be or should be a part of that thinking.<br><br>Thinking is tricky business. It is what we use to construct for ourselves everything that we know of the world--including the concepts of <i>construction, selves,</i> and <i>world.</i> Of course, because thinking also includes itself among the concepts that it constructs, we must also ask ourselves what we mean by <i>thinking.</i> The reflexivity that occurs in thinking about thinking may be disheartening in its own air of nihilism--"there's no cure for that"--but it is also liberating in its potential for imagining the possibility of something better, truer, and more perfect. For me, thinking about thinking has been, literally, a godsend. Thinking has not been the thing that has led me out of my faith but rather the very thing that has brought me deeper into it.<br><br>Thinking is dangerous, but it is also freeing, and, more profoundly, the danger inherent in thinking is also necessary for thinking to be that liberating force that it is. This is well expressed in one of what BYU calls its foundation documents--a collection of speeches that both inform and extrapolate on BYU's educational mission.<br><br>In an address to the BYU student body in 1969, Elder HughB. Brown, who at the time was First Counselor in the First Presidency, stated the following:<br><br><i>One of the most important things in the world is freedom of the mind; from this all other freedoms spring. Such freedom is necessarily dangerous, for one cannot think right without running the risk of thinking wrong, but generally more thinking is the antidote for the evils that spring from wrong thinking. More thinking is required, and we call upon you students to exercise your God-given right to think through every proposition that is submitted to you and to be unafraid to express your opinions, with proper respect for those to whom you talk and proper acknowledgment of your own ­shortcomings.</i> [HughB. Brown, "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/brown-hugh-b_eternal-quest/">An Eternal Quest--Freedom of the Mind</a>," BYU devotional address, 13 May 1969; see also "An Eternal Quest--Freedom of the Mind," in JohnW. Welch and DonE. Norton, eds., <i>Educating Zion</i> (Provo: BYU Studies, 1996), 84]<br><br>This passage resonates with me for a number of reasons, most of all for the way it captures the paradoxical tension that is central to ­thinking--the way that thinking opens up a space of indeterminacy in which anything is possible for the moment.<br><br>Thinking is subjunctive. It is neither this nor that but always perhaps, if, maybe, the possibly possible. Thinking is a gesture of play. It leverages possibility from the bedrock of reality. It is perhaps not surprising that thinking about thinking as an act of play would be compelling to a theatre professor. It is, after all, what theatre folks do: they play and they pretend, engaging in an activity that theatre maker Herbert Blau called "blooded thought" (see Herbert Blau, <i>Blooded Thought: Occasions of Theatre</i> [New York City: Performing Arts Journal Publications, 1982]).<br><br>Just as President Brown recognized the inherent dangers of thinking, theatre ­makers are acutely aware of the inherent dangers of their art. Allow me to illustrate with an ­anecdote from my home.<br><br>Years ago, one of my daughters, who was about seven years old at the time, had a friend over at our home for a play date. The two of them were playing pretend.<br><br>When my wife went to check on them, she observed that they were pretending to shoot each other. She explained to them that she was thrilled that they were using their imaginations and playing pretend but that it was not a good idea to pretend to shoot each other. "We don't shoot people in real life, and so we don't pretend to shoot them either," she said.<br><br>The children nodded, and my wife left them to resume playing.<br><br>A little while later she went to check on them again, and again they were shooting each other. Patiently, my wife said, "I thought I told you that we don't pretend to shoot people."<br><br>My daughter responded, "I know, but now we are pretending that you didn't say that."<br><br>Pretending--a form of playing--allows us the liberty to imagine and live in, even if only momentarily and subjunctively, someplace better and purer than our current reality. It is the lifeblood of creativity and invention, but it also provides us with the liberty to suspend authority, defy spiritual law, and practice sin. Playing can be dangerous. And because play is not exclusive to theatre makers, it is not only theatre makers who are familiar with its dangers. The dangers are familiar to scientists, philosophers, artists, historians, and anyone with the spirit of curiosity and the courage to learn.<br><br>We should not be afraid of the danger in play. It is necessary for the blessings of play to be possible. We should not fear the danger, but we must respect it. As one committed to building up the kingdom of God here on the earth, I regularly ask myself, "Is theatre perhaps the worst thing that we could be doing for the kingdom?" Or, if I am feeling less hyperbolic, I ask, "Is theatre hurting more than it is helping?" I ask these questions not because I believe that theatre is inherently evil. On the contrary, I think that theatre, in its essence, is absolutely necessary for comprehending life itself, not because theatre shows us in its story and characters and place what life is or could be but rather because theatre is the exact opposite of life. Death is not the opposite of life; theatre is. Theatre is the life that occurs within life, making "life" appear in the disappearance of the performance.<br><br>I ask myself about the possible dangers of theatre for the building up of the kingdom of God because not to do so potentially holds theatre as something as important as or maybe even more important than the kingdom itself. Too often artists allow their romanticized notions of art to eclipse the critical thinking that is necessary to justify art. In order for LDS artists to have the courage necessary to create the type of work that truly makes significant contributions to the building of the kingdom, they need to be willing to question severely the nature and function of their art and of art itself.<br><h2><b>Part Three: The End of Art</b></h2><br>For all that we know about how art functions in the world, we also know so little. What we think we know, however, suggests that engagement in the various forms of artistic creation can help us to become familiar with how to negotiate the truths of the world, including a truth we presume when we say "the world."<br><br>Art can be used to communicate messages about the world: morals, maxims, ideas, themes, and so on. Art also presents representations of the world--representations that can be both reflections of the world and constitutive of it. Ofthe former, William Shakespeare, via Hamlet, explained that theatre specifically and art generally is "to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature" (<i>Hamlet,</i> act 3, scene 2, line 25).<br><br>In more recent years, the German theatre maker Bertolt Brecht is rumored to have responded, "Art is not a mirror held up to reality but a hammer with which to shape it." We heard a fascinating exploration of this sentiment two months ago in SarahM. Coyne's discussion of princess and superhero representations in the media (see "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/sarah-m-coyne_fantasy-reality-royal-identity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Fantasy and the Reality of Your Royal Identity</a>," BYU devotional address, 31May 2016).<br><br>But beyond the messages and representations that we are familiar with and often tout as the ends of art is the material delimitation that the most profound artists embrace as the challenge of artistic engagement. Art provides an opportunity to enter into the materiality of the world and mobilize it in an act of play. The whole of this process is emblematic of the condition of being on earth. While works of art can be utilized to present messages and representations of the world, the fact that they do so through materials of the world means that the encounter the artist has in creating the art and also the encounter the audience has on the other end are, in significant ways, shaped by the materiality of the world. In artistic encounters, creator and audience are embroiled in a struggle with the material factuality of the world, a factuality that necessarily affects all involved. In other words, and to return to our earlier metaphor, the swimmer must adapt to the weight and movement of the waves.<br><br>The world does not stop while we take time to experiment in art. Sure, in the moment that Benedict Cumberbatch, while acting as Hamlet<i>, </i>said, "To be, or not to be," he was not Cumberbatch, he was Hamlet--but he was also not not Cumberbatch (see Richard Schechner, <i>Between Theater and Anthropology</i> [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1985], 110; Shakespeare, <i>Hamlet,</i> act 3, scene 1, line 56). Artists, in their playing, may create and be in a second world, but they are also not not in the first world, in God's world. They are on earth.<br><br>A similar thing may be said for the university classroom, in which we play with different ideas and experiment with different possibilities. We always run the risk of thinking wrong. We are always in the world, always working with it and through it. This is perhaps the most challenging aspect of God's plan for us here on earth. At the same time, it is perhaps also the most magnificent aspect of that plan.<br><br>Artistic pursuits allow us the glorious opportunity to explore the divinity of creativity. Indeed, our Father in Heaven is, as the prophet Jacob called him, "the great Creator" (2Nephi 9:5, 6). In this sense, artistic pursuits allow us opportunities to become more like God, not just as we create but as we learn to create in a world of eternal, material law and with godlike privilege and responsibility--in short, with agency. Artistic pursuits provide us the opportunity to seek for truth in the depths of ambiguity and uncertainty. Artistic pursuits let us be on earth while being on earth. Artistic pursuits do not solve the problem of ­uncertainty--they do not necessarily move us from not knowing to knowing--but they very well might help us to expand our understanding of what it means to know. Artistic pursuits might very well help us expand our understanding oftruth.<br><h2><b>It Is Glorious on Earth</b></h2><br>Brothers and sisters, we live on earth. We live in the conditions of the Fall. I, for one, am grateful for that. Without the Fall, the play that is essential to our spiritual progression could not be. Without the Fall, there is no thinking--at least no thinking worthy of the name.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, the Atonement of Jesus Christ is real. I feel its power in my life. I do not know this with mathematical certainty, nor do Iknow this for having, as of yet, seen and felt the wounds in the Savior's body. But I know this where it matters--in my living on earth. I have come to know it through the spiritual senses that Michelle Stott James eloquently spoke of in her devotional last month (see "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/michelle-stott-james_empty-centers-fire-lord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Empty Centers and the Fire of the Lord</a>," BYUdevotional address, 21 June 2016).<br><br>Brothers and sisters, we know so much and we know so little. The Lord has so much to teach us. Wisdom will be in how we choose to align with His pedagogy. Will we walk with Him into the waves?<br><br>The world is a wonderful place to be. It is glorious to be on the earth. It is glorious to be on earth. I pray that we rise to the challenge. Inthe name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Wade J.

<h1>: The Watchmen on the Tower - David H. Moore - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
When I was an undergraduate, I had the privilege of studying at the BYU Jerusalem Center for Near Eastern Studies. On one field trip we visited an area in which a large stone tower stood. From the tower a watchman could detect threats before they were visible from the ground, protecting the olive, fig, and grape vineyard from plunder.<br><br>Years later I reenacted this scene with my family in family home evening. We live in a two-story home. Our backyard is relatively flat close to the home but descends rapidly into a wooded area. For our family home evening lesson, all but one member of the family stayed on the main floor and looked out the windows toward the backyard. One family member climbed the stairs to a second-story bedroom with a window that also looked toward the backyard.<br><br>I hid in the backyard and, unbeknownst to my children, was armed with a bow and arrow. Now, with my skills as an archer, I might have been able to harm someone only by accident, but I looked menacing, and that was enough forour lesson.<br><br>As I climbed the wooded ascent toward our home, the members of my family on the main floor could not see me. They saw only the grass and trees in our backyard. I was detected, however, by the child at the upstairs window. Before I could lunge from the woods in surprise, I was spotted, and a warning cry went out to those below.<br><h2><b>Prophets, Seers, and Revelators</b></h2><br>The Lord has described the leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as watchmen on the tower. Members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are prophets, seers, and revelators. In each of these related roles, they, like watchmen on a tower, expand our vision of things of eternal significance.<br><br>Prophets particularly enlarge our understanding of the Savior Jesus Christ. The scriptures teach that "the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."<sup>1</sup> Consistent with this truth, the "primary responsibility [of a prophet] is to bear witness of Christ."<sup>2</sup> From the beginning of the world, prophets have declared the Savior and His Atonement.<sup>3</sup> Prophets bear witness from a unique vantage point as "special witnesses of the name of Christ in all the world."<sup>4</sup> In this way they strengthen our testimonies of Christ, testimonies that are critical to having "peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come."<sup>5</sup><br><br>The prophets also bear testimony of Christ through their actions. In a recent Face to Face conversation with the youth, Elder David A. Bednar explained that members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles certainly participate in large, public events like general conference and temple dedications, "but perhaps most importantly," he said, "it's about ones." The Lord routinely sends His Apostles around the world to minister to the one.<sup>6</sup><br><br>I have caught glimpses of this private, individual ministry in my life. My wife's grand­father, to whom she was very close, passed away when she was a young woman. Elder RichardG. Scott took my wife under his wing and influenced her life in profound ways. On one occasion I had the unusual experience of being at the home of an apostle on Christmas Day. He had carved a breadboard that he was going to deliver with a loaf of bread to a widow who lived nearby.<br><br>The prophets have a worldwide stewardship, but they bear testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ by serving as His ministers to bless individuals. Their witness and example have strengthened my testimony of the Savior Jesus Christ.<br><br>The Lord's watchmen on the tower also serve as revelators. As Amos affirmed, "Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets."<sup>7</sup> The Lord reveals His will to us through the prophets; the scriptures are evidence of this pattern. They contain select accounts of the revelations the Lord gave to the prophets.<br><br>Our understanding of the state of the soul between death and the Resurrection, for example, is informed by the revelation Alma received and shared with his son Corianton.<sup>8</sup> We know that baptism should occur at accountability rather than in infancy because of the revelation received by Mormon.<sup>9</sup> We have the Doctrine and Covenants, with its many precious truths, because of revelations to the Prophet Joseph Smith and his successors. And we receive revelation through the living prophets in general conference and other venues. These revelations have helped me to understand the Lord's word and will, and I am grateful for the prophets' role as revelators.<br><br>The prophets are also seers. "A seer can know of things which are past, and also of things which are to come, and by them ... shall secret things be made manifest, and hidden things shall come to light."<sup>10</sup> The prophetic gift of seership is evident in the Word of Wisdom and the family proclamation. Long before scientists and laymen knew the far-reaching harm of tobacco and before the concept of gender came under serious attack, the Lord's seers foresaw the need to counsel against the use of tobacco and to affirm the eternal nature of gender.<br><br>As prophets, seers, and revelators, members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles help us to see and understand in ways we could not on our own. They are watchmen on the tower. It should be apparent from the roles of prophets, seers, and revelators that these watchmen are a great blessing to us. The scriptures affirm the blessings of following the prophets.<br><h2><b>The Blessings of Following the Prophets</b></h2><br>When the Savior appeared in the Americas after His death and Resurrection, He taught the Beatitudes as He had in the Old World: "blessed are the poor in spirit," "blessed are the meek," "blessed are all the pure in heart."<sup>11</sup> Interestingly, when Christ taught the Beatitudes in the Americas, He added this declaration: "Blessed are ye if ye shall give heed unto the words of these twelve whom I have chosen from among you to minister unto you, and to be your servants."<sup>12</sup> As with the other Beatitudes, we are blessed to come closer to Christ when we develop the gift of believing in and following the living prophets.<br><br>This principle is reiterated in a famous scripture in Ephesians concerning the organization of the Church: "And he gave ... some, prophets."<sup>13</sup> Why?<br><br><i>For the perfecting of the saints ..., for the edifying of the body of Christ:</i><br><br><i>Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>Paul's letter to the Ephesians identifies another blessing that ­prophets provide. They assist us<br><br><i>that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>For Scout camp this summer, we took our Scouts to Flaming Gorge. One day we rafted the Green River below Flaming Gorge Dam. They were letting extra water out of the dam, sothe currents in the river were impressive. Each raft had a guide who told us how and when to stroke--"forward three," "left four," "back two." We responded quickly with the required strokes. In this way the guide directed us to currents in the river in which we could enjoy the rapids as well as safety.<br><br>There are strong currents in the world today as the devil "rage[s] in the hearts of the children of men."<sup>16</sup> Elder Neil L. Andersen said, "The world will not glide calmly toward the Second Coming of the Savior. ... 'All things shall be in commotion.'"<sup>17</sup> In this environment, if we are responsive to the prophets as well as to personal warnings from the Holy Ghost, our strokes can be guided to currents of peace and eternal life.<br><br>President Harold B. Lee summarized the protection that comes from following the prophets when he said:<br><br><i>The only safety we have as members of this church is to ... learn to give heed to the words and commandments that the Lord shall give through his prophet. ... There will be some things that take patience and faith. You may not like what comes. ... It may contradict your political views. It may contradict your social views. It may interfere with ... your social life. But if you listen to these things, as if from the mouth of the Lord himself, ... </i>"<i>the gates of hell shall not prevail against you; .</i>..<i> and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before you."</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>Following the prophets will not only guide us, it will change us. Exercising faith in the words of the prophets can work a mighty change in our hearts. King Benjamin's people reported "a mighty change ... in [their] hearts" that led them to "have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually."<sup>19</sup> Alma the Elder likewise experienced "a mighty change ... in his heart,"<sup>20</sup> as did the people he taught atthe Waters of Mormon.<sup>21</sup><br><br>What occasioned these spiritual changes? The people of King Benjamin explained that it was the faith they had in the words of King Benjamin, their prophet.<sup>22</sup> Alma similarly exercised faith "in the words which were delivered by the mouth of Abinadi[.] And was he not a holy prophet?"<sup>23</sup> Alma then "preached the word unto" those at the Waters of Mormon, who believed his words, "and a mighty change was also wrought in their hearts."<sup>24</sup><br><br>In each circumstance, faith in the words of a prophet led to a mighty change of heart. Have you had that experience? I have felt something of what Alma, his people, and the people of King Benjamin experienced. After participating in general conference, I have felt a change of heart, a feeling of being sanctified, a desire to do better than I have done.<sup>25</sup> This sweet feeling, the feeling of conversion, accompanies the exercise of faith in the words of the Lord's servants.<br><br>Indeed, not only does heeding the words of the prophets contribute to conversion, but we cannot be truly converted until we have gained a testimony of the divine calling and role of the prophets. President Harold B. Lee taught:<br><br><i>Until the members of this church have that conviction that they are being led in the right way, and they have a conviction that these men of God are men who are inspired and have been properly appointed by the hand of God, they are not truly converted.</i><sup>26</sup><br><h2><b>Learning from History</b></h2><br>Given the apparent and express blessings that come from prophets, seers, and revelators, one might expect history to reflect repeated responsiveness to these watchmen on the tower. That has not been the case, to the detriment of many. We often hear the maxim that history repeats itself or that those who fail to learn the lessons of history "are condemned to repeat it."<sup>27</sup><br><br>I recently experienced this firsthand. As I mentioned, as an undergraduate I studied abroad in Israel. Last month I had the opportunity to return to Israel with a group of legal scholars to study the Israeli legal system and legal challenges facing Israel. I didn't have much in the way of business casual clothing to wear in the hot climate, so one evening before departing, I hurried to purchase some short-sleeve shirts. Two were plaid and fairly brightly colored. When I showed them to my wife, she was, shall we say, skeptical. Like a good lawyer, I tried to persuade, offering the observation that this was the sort of shirt I wore when I went to Israel the first time--twenty-five years ago, in the early nineties. She burst out laughing. Those who refuse to learn the lessons of history are condemned to repeat it.<br><br>This principle has serious application when it comes to our relationship with the prophets. One of the lessons of sacred history is the difficulty that comes from rejecting the prophets. The Lord declared at the outset of this dispensation:<br><br><i>The day cometh that they who will not hear the voice of the Lord, neither the voice of his servants, neither give heed to the words of the prophets and apostles, shall be cut off from among the people.</i><sup>28</sup><br><br>So it has been in the past.<br><br>In the Book of Mormon alone, Lehi departs Jerusalem knowing "that Jerusalem must be destroyed, because of the wickedness of the people. For behold, they [had] rejected the words of the prophets."<sup>29</sup> Soon after Lehi's departure, another separation occurs. Nephi "and all those who would go with [him]" are directed to "depart from [their brethren] and flee into the wilderness."<sup>30</sup> Those who accompany Nephi are "those who [believe] in the warnings and the revelations of God" and who "hearken unto [Nephi's] words."<sup>31</sup> Warned by the Lord, Mosiah similarly leaves the land of Nephi with "as many as would hearken unto the voice of the Lord."<sup>32</sup><br><br>While those who follow the prophets are guided, those who reject the prophets have no such protection. The people of King Noah reject the teachings of Abinadi and are brought into bondage.<sup>33</sup> The posterity of King Noah's wicked priests are later killed and hunted, as Abinadi had prophesied.<sup>34</sup> The leaders of Ammonihah who reject Alma and Amulek are slain when the prison walls in which they detained Alma and Amulek fall.<sup>35</sup> Later, the people of Ammonihah are destroyed in one day by invading Lamanites.<sup>36</sup> In the book of Helaman, the Nephites suffer great destruction and the loss of much of their land as a result of their wickedness and their denial of "the spirit of prophecy and of revelation."<sup>37</sup> Not long thereafter, the Nephites suffer from civil war and later famine as they reject the words of Nephi, the prophet.<sup>38</sup><br><br>At the Savior's Crucifixion, the pattern repeats, as had been prophesied. Long before Christ has even been born, Nephi prophesies:<br><br><i>Great and terrible shall </i>[the day of Christ's death]<i> be unto the wicked, for they shall perish; and they perish because they cast out the prophets, and the saints, and stone them, and slay them.</i><sup>39</sup><br><br>The righteous, by contrast, would be spared.<sup>40</sup><br><br>In the wake of Christ's Crucifixion, there is a great tempest; there are whirlwinds, thunder, and lightning; cities are burned, sunk, and covered by mountains.<sup>41</sup> Those who remain are "the more righteous part of the people ... who received the prophets and stoned them not."<sup>42</sup> These survivors lament that the people "killed and stoned the prophets, and cast them out."<sup>43</sup> Thus are "the scriptures fulfilled which had been spoken by the prophets."<sup>44</sup><br><br>Several generations after the Savior's visit to the Americas, the people again reject "the disciples of Jesus."<sup>45</sup> Led by false prophets, they pursue iniquity until the disciples are taken away<sup>46</sup> and Mormon is "forbidden to preach unto them."<sup>47</sup> The Nephites lose the Spirit and ultimately their civilization.<sup>48</sup> The Lamanites plunge into war and darkness for hundreds ofyears.<sup>49</sup><br><br>The experience of the Nephites and Lamanites is that of the Jaredites as well. When the Jaredites disbelieve and persecute the prophets, they face "famines and pestilences," they are unable to retain their property, and they experience "wars and contentions"<sup>50</sup> that become so severe that the stench of rotting flesh troubles them "by day and by night."<sup>51</sup> Ultimately, as the prophets had warned, the Jaredite civilization is destroyed, and the Lord brings "forth another people to possess the land."<sup>52</sup><br><br>We can learn from this history--and its parallels in other scriptural accounts--the personal and communal destruction that comes from rejecting the prophets. In light of this history, it is no wonder that the Beatitudes do not say blessed are those who persecute the prophets but blessed are ye when ye are persecuted, as were the prophets.<sup>53</sup><br><h2><b>Obstacles of Accepting the Prophets</b></h2><br>Given the damage that comes from rejecting the prophets, what stands in the way of accepting them? Let me discuss three matters.<br><h3><b><i>The Natural Man</i></b></h3><br>One difficulty is that their words are hard on the natural man. A prophet "is a preacher of righteousness."<sup>54</sup> As Jarom recounted, the prophets "prick [our] hearts with the word, continually stirring [us] up unto repentance."<sup>55</sup> In this they stand in stark contrast to false ­teachers--like the Book of Mormon's Sherem--who employ flattery.<sup>56</sup> The flatterer speaks "smooth things"<sup>57</sup>: "Do this, and there is no iniquity; do that and ye shall not suffer ...: Walk after the pride of your own hearts ..., and do whatsoever your heart desireth."<sup>58</sup> If we can humble ourselves and set our sights on eternal life, we can welcome the prick to perfection rather than the smooth solicitation to sin.<br><br>In speaking of overcoming the natural man to follow the prophets, I am reminded of an experience Natalie and I had when our son Matthew was three. I had an offer to teach at the Washington and Lee University School of Law, and we were visiting the area in the process of deciding whether to accept.<br><br>As we visited a home with a realtor, Matthew was running around energetically. Natalie pulled him aside and asked if he would behave.<br><br>He responded, "I don't want to behave. Iwant to be Matthew."<br><br>It must be a three-year-old thing. This past Sunday, when I spoke to our youngest son, James, who is currently three, about behaving in sacrament meeting, he replied, "I am have."<br><br>Fortunately for us, the choice is not between behaving and being ourselves. We are children of God. Following the prophets is consistent with our divine nature.<br><br>Remembering that the words of the prophets are the words of a loving Savior will also help us overcome the natural man to follow the prophets. The Savior is emphatic that the prophets' words are His own. "Whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants," He declared, "it is the same."<sup>59</sup> His words will be fulfilled; He Himself acts to fulfill them. Thus, for example, on the night before His birth, the Lord said to Nephi, "On the morrow come I into the world, to ... fulfil all that which I have caused to be spoken by the mouth of my holy prophets."<sup>60</sup><br><h3><b><i>The Mortality of the Prophets</i></b></h3><br>Following the prophets may also be difficult because prophets are mortal. Sometimes it is hard to recognize the divine in the mortal. In the Savior Himself, some could only see "the carpenter's son."<sup>61</sup> The fact that the Savior is able to work through mortal men, however, can be heartening. As Elder Bednar said, "Some people find the human shortcomings of the Brethren troubling and faith diminishing. For me those imperfections are encouraging and faith promoting."<sup>62</sup><br><br>It may also be helpful to remember that a prophet's call does not come by aspiration. As is said generally of those who receive the priesthood, "No man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron."<sup>63</sup> The prophets are called not because they are perfect but by One who is perfect. They often share a profound sense of their own mortality on receiving their call. Yet they <i>are </i>called. And they are qualified by the Savior who calls them, as is evident from studying the ministry of someone like the apostle Peter.<br><h3><b><i>Pride in Learning</i></b></h3><br>One final stumbling block in following the prophets is the tendency to set ourselves up against the Lord and His prophets when we obtain distinction in learning. That distinction may come from advanced degrees, attendance at premier institutions, or accolades for academic performance. As Jacob taught, "When [men] are learned they think they are wise, ... they ... [suppose] they know of themselves," and "they hearken not unto the counsel of God."<sup>64</sup> This "is foolishness."<sup>65</sup> Whatever learning one obtains through years of academic study, attendance at excellent schools, and the hard work necessary to earn high marks is ultimately meager.<br><br>I am about to start my sixteenth year of law school. Even within law I have mastered relatively little. When I look outside the law, I realize I have mastered even less. That is typical. The top legal mind likely knows little about archaeology. The top archaeologist likely knows little about accountancy. The top accountant is unlikely to contribute much in the field of astronomy.<br><br>By contrast, our Heavenly Father is omniscient. If we involve Him, our learning can ultimately be limitless. As a result, in my view true intellectuals follow the admonition to "seek learning ... by study and also by faith."<sup>66</sup> I wish to explore this admonition generally as well as link it specifically to the prophets.<br><h2><b>The Prophets and Learning</b></h2><br>Study and faith together magnify learning. President Joseph Fielding Smith taught:<br><br><i>Men may search, they may study, they may learn, of course, a great many things; they may lay up a great fund of information, but they will never be able to come to the fulness of truth ... unless they are guided by the Spirit of truth, the Holy Ghost, and keep the commandments of God</i>.<sup>67</sup><br><br>Obedience and the Holy Ghost are critical tolearning truth--that is, to obtaining "knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come."<sup>68</sup> "The Holy Ghost ... knoweth all things."<sup>69</sup> The Holy Ghost "speaketh the truth and lieth not."<sup>70</sup> As we live in obedience to the commandments that we receive from the Lord through His prophets, we qualify for instruction from the Holy Ghost. As we receive light from the Holy Ghost and continue in obedience, we receive more light.<sup>71</sup> This virtuous cycle continues: "And that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day."<sup>72</sup> Those who are "filled with light com­prehendeth all things."<sup>73</sup><br><br>By contrast, we lose "light and truth, through disobedience."<sup>74</sup> As Alma taught, "He that will harden his heart, the same receiveth the lesser portion of the word ... until [he] know[s] nothing concerning [the] mysteries" of God.<sup>75</sup> I observed this phenomenon while serving as a bishop. A member of my ward began to drift from the path of righteousness. Although he previously had a testimony, he reached a place in which he could not discern the truth of the gospel. The truth had not changed, but his disobedience had clouded his ability to discern it. Obedience and the Holy Ghost are critical to our pursuit of truth.<br><br>We are blessed to be at Brigham Young University, where we have the overt opportunity to combine faith and study. The Honor Code seeks to ensure that we maintain the righteousness that will qualify us to be taught by the Spirit. Do we link these two things--­living the Honor Code and becoming educated? The Honor Code, which is a reflection of the gospel of Jesus Christ, is not simply a condition of coming to BYU to obtain an education. It is an important part of how we obtain that education.<br><br>I have been blessed as I have tried to combine study and faith in my own learning. After my second year of teaching law, I felt pressure to make significant progress in my scholarship. My life conditions were not ideal for contemplative thinking. Our second child had been born in May, and sleep was at a premium. I remember that one day I was driving in Kentucky, where we lived, and speaking to my mom on the phone about the research topic I was pursuing. I expressed to her that I felt that the idea for the project had come by inspiration.<br><br>Joseph Smith taught:<br><br><i>A person may profit by noticing the first intimation of the spirit of revelation; for instance, when you feel pure intelligence flowing into you, it may give you sudden strokes of ideas ...; and thus by learning the Spirit of God and understanding it, you may grow into the principle of revelation, until you become perfect in Christ Jesus.</i><sup>76</sup><br><br>Consistent with this description of revelation, I had felt that the idea for my project had come to me, not been generated by me. As I worked to write, I discovered there was more to the idea than I had originally thought. As I ran into roadblocks in my thinking, I prayed and felt direction in how I could develop my analysis. I am not here to claim that the ultimate article was "true," but the article was significant, influenced my thinking, and led to additional scholarly opportunities for me. I have had similar experiences as I have looked to combine study and faith through seeking the inspiration of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>Prophets play a unique role in the effort to seek learning by study and by faith. As I mentioned earlier, those we sustain as prophets possess the gift of seership. This is a unique gift. Ammon taught that man can receive no greater gift than the gift of seership.<sup>77</sup> By seers, "things shall be made known ... which otherwise could not be known."<sup>78</sup> As a result, those who possess the gift of seership become "a great benefit to [their] fellow beings."<sup>79</sup> By looking to the prophets, we tap into this great gift, a gift through which we can learn truths we otherwise could not learn. Let us not let our learnedness get in the way of this learning.<br><h2><b>Watchmen and the Second Coming</b></h2><br>Returning to the family home evening I described earlier, after I was discovered approaching the home with a bow and arrow, we repeated the experience with some modification. A different child took the post at the second-story window. This time I placed our family home evening treat in the garden, a sunken area just beyond the grass of our yard. As before, members of the family on the main floor could not see the treat. Again, however, the watchman at the second-story window could spot the treat that awaited us.<br><br>The prophets not only warn of harm but foretell of blessings that lie ahead. Alma proclaimed in his day:<br><br><i>There be many things to come; and behold, there is one thing which is of more importance than they all--for behold, the time is not far distant that the Redeemer ... cometh among his people.</i><sup>80</sup><br><br>That blessing also awaits us today. Christ has come and, as the prophets testify, He will come again. "No one knoweth," save the Father only, the day or hour of the Savior's return.<sup>81</sup> Instead, it will be "as it was in the days ofNoah"<sup>82</sup>:<br><br><i>For until the day that Noah entered into the ark they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage;</i><br><br><i>And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be.</i><sup>83</sup><br><br>I have spoken of the importance of heeding the watchmen on the tower. I wish to close by speaking more directly of our own responsibility to watch. "Watch, therefore," the Savior commanded, "for you know not at what hour your Lord doth come."<sup>84</sup><br><br>Our responsibility to watch involves more than merely registering the signs that precede the Savior's coming. It includes preparing ­ourselves for that coming. As the five ­foolish virgins learned, the preparation required cannot be obtained last minute or borrowed from others.<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball taught:<br><br><i>The kind of oil that is needed to illuminate the way and light up the darkness is not shareable. How can one share obedience to the principle oftithing; a mind at peace from righteous living; an accumulation of knowledge? How can one share faith or testimony? ...</i><br><br><i>. . . In our lives the oil of preparedness is accumulated drop by drop in righteous living. Attendance at sacrament meetings adds oil to our lamps, drop by drop over the years. Fasting, family prayer, home teaching, control of bodily appetites, preaching the gospel, studying the scriptures--each act of dedication and obedience is a drop added to our store. Deeds of kindness, payment of offerings and tithes, chaste thoughts and actions, marriage in the covenant for eternity--these ... contribute importantly to the oil with which we can at midnight refuel our exhausted lamps</i>.<sup>85</sup><br><br>We live in the difficult times preceding the Savior's Second Coming. The world is mainstreaming the "strange roads" of Lehi's dream<sup>86</sup> and straining to embrace the breadth of "the way, that leadeth to destruction."<sup>87</sup> The rains will descend, the floods swell, and the winds blow. The only rock upon which we can build to have "sure foundation"<sup>88</sup> is the Savior, Jesus Christ. We will not find that foundation if we are not watchful, nor can we build upon the foundation of the Savior if we reject or neglect "his servants the prophets."<sup>89</sup><br><br>As I work to prepare for the Second Coming, I cast my lot with the watchmen on the tower. I pray that each of us will do the same, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>David H. Moore was an associate dean and professor in the BYU J.

<h1> the Harbor: the Benefits of Nostalgia - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It was almost six years ago that I walked into my first class at BYU: Calculus 1. It took me some time to find the room because back then they did not have the app that shows all your classes on a map. I walked in and found a seat, and then Professor Denise Halverson started leading a hymn. I looked around, and everyone seemed to think it was normal. I was certainly in the wrong class. Maybe religion? But no--I asked someone, and it was definitely calculus.<br><br>It was astonishing that I could actually learn a subject so technical with the help of God. These spiritual experiences happened over and over again on this campus, and how grateful I am for them. I came to BYU one year after I was baptized, and my experiences here were crucial to my social, intellectual, and spiritual development. I can say that this is the place where I have come to know my Redeemer.<sup>1</sup><br><br>A couple of months ago I was walking by the Creamery on Ninth when the words of Wandle Mace came to my mind. On the banks of the Mississippi River, as the Saints looked at their beloved city for the last time, he wrote, "Farewell, Nauvoo the Beautiful! The City of Joseph! The home of so much joy and happy contentment, and also of the most exquisite sorrow and anguish."<sup>2</sup><br><br>"I am going to miss this place," I thought. "Also myfriends, my professors, the beautiful campus, the classes, the temple, my ward, and Graham Canyon ice cream."<br><br>But what does it mean to miss something? Why do we even feel nostalgia?<br><br>The word <i>nostalgia</i> is a compound of two Greek words, one meaning "homecoming" and the other meaning "pain." It is actually very similar to the word <i>homesickness.</i><sup>3</sup> But is ­nostalgia, in fact, a sickness? It turns out that in other languages these same words do not carry a negative connotation, such as the Portuguese <i>saudade</i> and the German <i>sehnsucht.</i> These imply a deep, underlying love for ­someone or ­something. These are in some ways an expression of that love, like when you say to someone, "I'm gonna miss you!"<br><br>But the role of nostalgia goes beyond demonstrating love. Psychologists have found that those who think about nostalgic experiences feel an increase in positive emotions.<sup>4</sup> So missing past occurrences is not necessarily bad, especially if we remember that experiences make us who we are. I am who I am today because of this wonderful university. The pioneers would not be the same had they never left Nauvoo and traversed to Utah. We too have left our homes and our friends and have traveled miles to come to this institution.<br><br>And we have been stationed here for the past few years, like ships at harbor. It was Elder Claudio R.M. Costa who once read an inscription under a painting of a ship that said, "A ship is safe in harbor, but that's not what ships are for."<sup>5</sup> There always comes a time when the Lord tells us to leave for the open sea. He asks us to face the winds and the waves of the future, and--for us--BYU has been the place to prepare. Buthow can BYU help us?<br><br>It is interesting that many of us come to school during what scientists call the "reminiscence bump," which is the stage of our lives (during our early twenties) of which adults have the greatest recollection of events.<sup>6</sup> The memories we made here will be with us for years. They are moments of joy and also of adversity, like when we had to sacrifice sleep or deal with difficult roommates. Acknowledging whom we have become partially comes from thinking back on these trials, so hopefully we will also feel nostalgia for them.<br><br>Psychologists also found that nostalgia increases self-esteem, perceptions of social connectedness, and perceptions of meaning in life.<sup>7</sup> Remembering the past is a natural response to situations that might make us sad. So when the hail and the mighty storm shall beat upon our vessels, we can remember those things on which we have built our foundations.<sup>8</sup> We can think back on the wonderful lessons we have learned here. We need to remember to always strengthen our spirits, to pursue a character of righteousness, to seek ­knowledge in every discipline throughout our lives, to learn with the guidance of the Spirit of God, and to seek to serve our fellowmen.<sup>9</sup> That is the gift this university has given us--­principles by which we can chart the course of our lives.<br><br>When neuroscientists looked at the brains of people feeling nostalgia in an MRI machine, they noticed that nostalgia enhanced activity in the prefrontal cortex in similar ways seen in people receiving money.<sup>10</sup> So the memories we will keep from this campus are indeed gifts, possibly the greatest gifts this institution could give us.<br><br>It is time for us to cast off and face the open sea. Thus I echo the words of Wandle Mace but liken them to me and you: Farewell, BYU the Beautiful! The home of so much joy and happy contentment, and also of the most exquisite sorrow and anguish. Farewell, BYU, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Marcos Gallo spoke as the representative of his graduating class at BYU commencement on 11August 2016.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1> Trust in God: Alma&#039;s Admonition to His Sons - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, Sister Christensen and I are honored to share this special day with you. We love being back on campus at BYU and appreciate the gracious way we have been received today by Elder KimB. Clark and President KevinJ Worthen and their wives. As we arrived early and walked across campus, we could feel the excitement in the air. We pray that this day--graduation day--will become a beloved milestone in your lives that you will look back on with a deep sense of accomplishment for many years to come.<br><br>On an occasion similar to this one, Elder M.Russell Ballard noted that the longest commencement speech on record was delivered at Harvard University in the early 1800s. It lasted more than six hours and was delivered first in Latin, then in Greek, and then in English. The shortest speech was given by NelsH. Smith, the former governor of the state of Wyoming. When called upon to speak, Governor Smith arose slowly, walked to the podium, scanned the rows and rows of graduates, and simply said, in his down-home accent, "You done real good." He then turned around and sat down.<sup>1</sup><br><br>Since I do not speak Latin or Greek and my desire is to be relatively brief, let me begin today by saying, "You done real good!"<br><br>Like you, we recognize that you have been living and studying for the past several years in a very unique, even sacred environment--one that, in many ways, is quite unlike anything you will find in the world. For example, you have been able to share remarkable experiences with friends and colleagues who embrace your same values. In this spiritually rich setting you have exercised faith in Jesus Christ and have incorporated into your lives the highest possible standards of righteous living. You have also kept your own commitment to excellence, devoting long days and seemingly endless nights to studying and preparing, both academically and spiritually, to enter a world that, quite frankly, needs you desperately.<br><br>Your commitment to live the gospel of Jesus Christ and your willingness to form eternal families will ultimately influence everyone who comes to know you. Because of the foundation you have established while attending BYU, you are now prepared to go forth into the world and make significant contributions in your chosen fields of study, in your families, and in the lives of Heavenly Father's children everywhere.<br><br>There may be some who view this transition into the world with some trepidation. You may feel a little like Alma the Younger, who, after observing the moral state of affairs of his day, felt "grieved for the iniquity of his people, yea for the wars, and the bloodsheds, and the contentions which were among them."<sup>2</sup> Perhaps you can relate to this sorrow that Alma felt as you witness some of the events intoday's world.<br><br>For me, one of the keys to finding personal peace and a sense of purpose in times like these is to study how other faithful disciples, including Alma, responded to similar circumstances. Like you, Alma did not want to accept things as he found them or simply retreat from society and wait for things to change. Yet he also did not want to overreact or take matters into his own hands. He sought for and received guidance from the Holy Ghost. Then, under direction from the Spirit, he went to work. His response was to teach and minister to others and "to stand as [a witness] of God at all times and ... in all places."<sup>3</sup> Alma's indomitable faith in the Savior gave him confidence to do as Nephi had done--to "go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded."<sup>4</sup><br><br>I also find it instructive that, with all that was needed in the world around him, Alma gave priority to ministering to his own family. On at least one occasion Alma's sorrow for the iniquity of his people and his desire to do something about it led him, almost instinctively, to cause "that his sons should be gathered together, that he might give unto them every one his charge, separately, concerning the things pertaining unto righteousness."<sup>5</sup> The admonitions that Alma gave to his three sons--Helaman, Shiblon, and Corianton--found in Alma 36 through 42, are some of the most powerful and touching examples of fatherly counsel found in scripture.<br><br>Now I do not know how old Alma's sons were when he gathered them together, yet I suspect they were about your same age. He indicated that they were "in [their] youth,"<sup>6</sup> and at least two of them were recently returned missionaries. I also don't know whether Alma had any daughters, although if he did, it is reasonable to think his counsel to them would have been similar to the counsel he gave his sons.<br><br>So as I pondered what I might share with you today, I felt impressed to review four of the most prominent admonitions of Alma to his sons. As I review these key principles, I pray that you will feel that your Heavenly Father is speaking directly to you, His sons and His daughters, giving you loving and essential guidance to help you prepare for whatever your futures may hold.<br><h2><b>I. Put Your Trust in God</b></h2><br>First and foremost, Alma wanted his sons to learn to trust in the Lord. "I do know," he told Helaman, "that whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be supported in their trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions, and shall be lifted up at the last day."<sup>7</sup> Learning to trust in the Lord, even in the midst of trials and afflictions, is the way we manifest our love for Him. It is the key to finding true happiness in this life and in the life to come.<br><br>Alma knew this from personal experience, for he had been thrown in prison, mocked, and spat upon for preaching the gospel. Notwithstanding all his experiences, Alma never lost his faith, and he wanted his sons to learn from his example. He shared with them this simple yet certain testimony: "<i>I have been supported</i> under trials and troubles of every kind, yea, and in all manner of afflictions ... ; yea, and I do put my trust in him, and he will still deliver me."<sup>8</sup><br><br>Alma's testimony reminds me of the optimism and faith expressed by President GordonB. Hinckley as he spoke of putting our trust in God:<br><br><i>It isn't as bad as you sometimes think it is. It all works out. Don't worry. I say that to myself every morning. ... Put your trust in God, and move forward with faith and confidence in the future.</i> ...<i> If we will put our trust in Him, if we will pray to Him, if we will live worthy of His blessings, He will hear our prayers.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>My dear friends, I invite you to consider how you will demonstrate your trust in God throughout your lives. What will you do to show God that you trust Him above everything else--above your own wisdom and especially above the wisdom of the world? Placing our trust in God means, as Alma taught his sons, that we do not boast in our own wisdom nor of our own strength.<sup>10</sup> Rather, we should "let all [our] doings be unto the Lord" and should "counsel with the Lord in all [our] doings."<sup>11</sup> As you do this, you will discover that "in the strength of the Lord [you can] do all things."<sup>12</sup><br><br>Perhaps I should share an example from my own experience. Several years ago, when I had returned to Church headquarters after serving in Mexico, I was assigned a parking stall directly behind the space reserved for Elder RichardG. Scott. Often, as I parked my car in the morning, I noticed Elder Scott sitting in his car with his head bowed, praying one more time before he entered the office. Why? Because he trusted in the Lord. He knew he needed Heavenly Father's help and guidance.<br><br>Elder Scott's example has changed how I start my day. When I arrive at work, I spend a few moments in prayer--expressing my trust in the Lord and pleading that my activities that day will be in accordance with His mind and will, that I will remember who I am and act accordingly, and that He will mercifully fill in the many gaps in which I fall short.<br><br>This daily expression has been a meaningful experience for me. Clearly my trials and challenges have not been as severe as those Alma suffered through, yet I can add my testimony to his--that God truly does support all those who put their trust in Him.<br><h2><b>II. Learn to Keep the Commandments of God</b></h2><br>The second powerful admonition from Alma is found in these words: "O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God."<sup>13</sup> I am interested in the fact that Alma connected learning wisdom with being obedient to the commandments of God. Besides the obvious fact that it is wise to keep the commandments, through obedience we become worthy to receive the Holy Ghost, and it is through the Holy Ghost that we are taught wisdom "from on high."<sup>14</sup> Alma also taught that wisdom is not just for those who have years of experience; his counsel was to seek wisdom "in thy youth."<sup>15</sup><br><br>It has been said that we pay for our schooling but that wisdom cannot be purchased.<sup>16</sup> Wisdom comes from life's experiences and from sacred experiences with the Holy Ghost. As you continue your lifelong effort to learn wisdom, remember these priorities established by the Lord:<br><br><i>Seek not for riches but for wisdom, and behold, the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto you, and then shall you be made rich.Behold, he that hath eternal life is rich.</i><sup>17</sup><br><br>In other words, you didn't come to BYU merely to increase your earning power. You came to learn wisdom--to learn the mysteries of God--which requires much more than ­secular learning; it requires that we obey the voice of the Lord and keep His commandments.<br><br>Let me hasten to say that this does not mean you shouldn't or won't be prosperous. Alma also taught his sons, "Inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall prosper in the land."<sup>18</sup> Remember, however, that prosperity must never take priority over obedience. We must never compromise the things we know to be true, and we must always live our lives according to the spiritual laws upon which these eternal blessings are predicated.<sup>19</sup><br><br>Given the perilous times in which we live, in which sin is now being normalized and even celebrated, Alma teaches us to not only develop a spirit of obedience but also to develop what he called "an everlasting hatred against sin and iniquity."<sup>20</sup> As disciples of Jesus Christ, we are charged to love all ­people--even those mired in sin--but we resist anything that would put our spiritual lives in jeopardy. In other words, our "spiritual antennae" must be high and finely tuned so that, through the Holy Ghost, we can distinguish between activities that are "virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy"<sup>21</sup> and activities that are not and know where we "should be anxiously engaged"<sup>22</sup> and when we should simply turn our backs and walk away.<br><h2><b>III. "Bridle All Your Passions"</b></h2><br>A third point we learn from Alma is the admonition to "bridle all your passions."<sup>23</sup> We often view this charge as counsel associated with the law of chastity. It is interesting to note that when Alma gave this charge, he was not speaking to Corianton, his son who had fallen into sin, but to Shiblon, his steady son who was faithful and obedient. When speaking of passions, Alma was referring to <i>all</i> our ­passions--our intense energy, our enthusiasm, our determination, and our zeal for life.<br><br>Passion, in this sense, is a good thing. It motivates our daily efforts, helps strengthen our vision, and drives us to succeed. As the French philosopher Denis Diderot said, "Only passions, ... great passions, can raise the soul to great things."<sup>24</sup><br><br>Alma himself was a very passionate ­person--passionate, in particular, about the gospel and certainly bold in declaring it. Then why the counsel to his son to bridle his passions? I can't help but wonder if Alma didn't see a bit of himself in his sons: intelligent, energetic young men who needed, on occasion, to be warned against letting "boldness" become "overbearance" or being "lifted up unto pride" and boasting of their own talents and abilities.<sup>25</sup> Perhaps he saw in them abundant spiritual energy that, in order to be most effective in the service of the Lord, needed to be properly controlled or channeled.<br><br>The image of a bridle is an interesting one. While horses today are used mostly for recreation, there was a time when owning a horse was essential to daily life. Humans could see early on that these powerful creatures could be quite useful in accomplishing difficult work, but they needed a way to harness or control their power. A bridle became the tool used to direct the horse's head and control its activities. It was not that people resented the horse's power or wanted to limit it in any way. To the contrary, they wanted to maximize it--to focus it, direct it, and put it to its very best use.<br><br>Can you see what Alma was trying to teach his son when he said, "Bridle all your passions"? He wasn't telling Shiblon to limit or smother his passions; he was simply explaining that Shiblon's passions needed to be harnessed or controlled. Heavenly Father wants us to be bold and passionate about important things. He wants us to love the truth, and He values youthful energy and enthusiasm. But He also wants to help us channel this energy into righteous work. He wants us to be boldly committed to doing good in the world and using our talents to accomplish His eternal purposes, rather than wasting them on things that really do not matter much.<br><br>Let me share an interesting example that comes from a talk given by Elder PaulB. Pieper at BYU–Idaho more than three years ago, long before Pokémon Go became a frenzy:<br><br>[One] <i>tactic the adversary employs in this generation is to channel men's natural ambition to work and achieve into dead ends. God placed in young men the desire to compete and achieve, with the intent that they would use this ambition to become a faithful provider for a wife and family. In our youth, this ambition can be channeled into academic, athletic, or other pursuits that help to teach persistence, discipline, and work. However, Satan would subtly intercept that ambition and channel it into a virtual world of video games that eat up time and ambition....</i><br><br><i>... No matter how hard you play a video game, no matter what score you get, virtual work can never bring you the satisfaction that accompanies real work.</i><sup>26</sup><br><br>I am sure you can think of other examples in which God-given gifts are hijacked by Satan to ensure that they are either diluted, rendered useless, or used in activities that have no eternal value. On the other hand, there are many causes that desperately need our interest and committed effort. Consider, for example, the many important moral and social issues facing our families, our nations, and society in general. Some of these include the role of parents and families, the sanctity of marriage, the right to worship and exercise one's religion, the harmful effects of pornography, the best ways to care for the poor and needy, and many other important issues.<br><br>The restored gospel of Jesus Christ sheds considerable light on these issues. As men and women with testimonies of the gospel and a clear understanding of God's plan of happiness, we can make unique and vital contributions in all of these areas. To be frank, the world desperately needs our voices--our impassioned voices--in these conversations. Without them, the discussions almost always go in the wrong direction, and we will wake up one day wondering how things have slipped so far.<br><br>We can make a difference. But our lives, our talents, and our passions must be focused on things that really matter.<br><h2><b>IV. "By Small and Simple Things Are Great Things Brought to Pass"</b></h2><br>Finally, the fourth admonition of Alma comes from this counsel to his sons: "Behold Isay unto you, that by small and simple things are great things brought to pass."<sup>27</sup><br><br>Several years ago, in this same setting, Ishared the example of a family who lived close to a large amusement park. They would drive by the park often, and each time their young son would ask, "Daddy, can we go there? Ireally want to go there and play on allthe rides."<br><br>The father would try to deflect the question by simply saying, "Maybe tomorrow we can go."<br><br>This little interchange repeated itself week after week until finally, early one Saturday morning, the boy came running into his parents' bedroom. He jumped on the bed, startling both of them, and exclaimed with great enthusiasm, "Daddy, tomorrow is today!"<sup>28</sup><br><br>This interesting play on words--­tomorrow is today--illustrates a valuable point. Commence­ment ceremonies naturally point to the future, to the exciting opportunities ahead, and to everything you hope to accomplish. But to a great extent, your success in life and how you prepare for the responsibilities that will ultimately be yours depend on the accumulation of small and simple things you do each and every day. No matter what your ambitions for the future are, you achieve them step by step, one day at atime. In this sense, tomorrow truly is today.<br><br>An example of the small and simple things may be helpful. Dr. TrumanG. Madsen, who passed away several years ago, was a beloved professor here at BYU. When he and Sister Ann Madsen were newlyweds, Truman was pursuing a PhD in philosophy at Harvard University. His young bride, trying to earn enough money to pay the bills, took a job at a local bank.<br><br>One evening she returned home from work exhausted. She found Truman reading the Doctrine and Covenants instead of studying for an important test he had the next morning.<br><br>"What?" she exclaimed. "Why aren't you studying for your classes? Why should I be working to support you in your graduate studies if you are only going to study the scriptures?"<br><br>Truman responded by sitting Ann down and quietly explaining "that the more he studied philosophy, the more he needed to study the revelations of the Prophet Joseph Smith." Truman Madsen's counsel to students was, "Don't study philosophy on an empty stomach."<sup>29</sup><br><br>How thankful we all are that Brother Madsen was able to keep that balance. Not only did he graduate with his PhD and his testimony of the gospel, but he also dedicated his life to helping others learn to strike that same balance, to learn "by study and also by faith."<sup>30</sup> His dedication to small and simple things, such as consistently studying the scriptures, made a big difference in his life and in the lives of many others.<br><br>As you consider the miracles that occurred in Alma's life and as you look to what you hope to accomplish in the future, please take time to plan out the small and simple things you will do each day to bring about your own mighty work. These simple acts, including your personal devotion to daily prayer and to scripture study, will contribute to your long-term happiness and your ultimate success in life. You will witness the hand of the Lord as He works His miracles in you, and you will be an active part of His effort "to bring about his great and eternal purposes."<sup>31</sup><br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>My dear graduates, there are so many more things I could share with you from Alma's counsel. Let me simply conclude with one more line from Alma that seems to be appropriate today:<br><br><i>And now, ... I trust that I shall have great joy in you, because of your steadiness and your faithfulness unto God; for as you have commenced in your youth to look to the Lord your God, even so I hope that you will continue.</i><sup>32</sup><br><br>Of the many emotions you are surely feeling today, I hope that foremost is a sense of the great love Heavenly Father has for you, His spiritual children. He is proud of what you have accomplished so far, and His earnest desire is to see you continue as you have commenced "in the path which [leads] to the tree [of life]."<sup>33</sup> He has given you an abundance of blessings to help you along the way: the opportunity to pray to Him, to <i>talk</i> with Him; the gift of the Holy Ghost as a constant companion; His counsel in the words of scripture, the living prophets, and your own patriarchal blessings; temple ordinances and covenants that endow you "with power from on high";<sup>34</sup> and, above all, the matchless gift of "his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."<sup>35</sup><br><br>As a witness of Him, I assure you that He stands at the door, ready for you to invite Him into your lives as never before.<sup>36</sup> Take His yoke upon you. Learn of Him. And make a firm resolve today to follow Alma's admonitions--to put your trust in Him, to keep His commandments, to bridle all your passions, and to attend to the small and simple things. As you do, you will see His miracles in your lives and find true happiness in the years ahead.<br><br>I testify that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which sponsors this university and much of your education here, is His Church and kingdom on the earth. President ThomasS. Monson is His living prophet. Jesus Christ is our Savior and our Redeemer. His Father is our Father. Their promises to you are certain and will be realized as you continue with faith in Them. May this faith grow and direct your lives is my humble prayer, in the sacred and holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Craig C.

<h1>rnal Learning Process - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
You may wonder, as we gather to recognize and celebrate the <i>end</i> of your university career, why we hold a ceremony that we call a commencement. A commencement is, after all, a beginning, not an end. Some may conclude that this apparent misnomer occurs because university administrators, who organize and name such events, are often so confused that they are never sure whether they are coming or going or beginning or ending. That may be true. However, there are other explanations for this seeming contradiction.<br><br>We celebrate the final act of your university education with a commencement ceremony in part to impress upon you the need for perspective. Whether something is a beginning or an ending depends, in large measure, on the perspective from which things are viewed. A newly married couple--reflecting on the hectic events of the wedding day and all the details and planning that led up to it after a long engagement--was heard to say, "Now that we are married, we are finally at the end of all our troubles."<br><br>A wiser, more experienced couple standing nearby responded, "That is true, but the question is, at which end?" Perspective does matter.<br><br>While you may have taken your final final exam, while you may never again pull an overnighter to complete a research paper, and while you may no longer need to worry about what grade you receive on an assignment, that does not mean that your education is complete. Calling this ceremony a commencement hopefully serves to remind you that while you are graduating from this university, you have not concluded the learning phase of your life; instead, you are at the other end of that ­process, the beginning--the commencement.<br><br>Brigham Young, the founder of this university, put it this way:<br><br><i>We might ask, when shall we cease to learn? Iwill give you my opinion about it: never, never.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>Thus one of the aims of a BYU education is to prepare our students for "lifelong ­learning."<sup>2</sup> And, in that regard, it is important to note that we believe in very long lives. As Brother Brigham explained:<br><br><i>We do not expect to cease learning while we live on earth; and when we pass through the veil, we expect still to continue to learn and increase our fund of information.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>I have met numerous lifelong learners in my life--people who, no matter how much they know or how far along they are in their careers or lives, seem compelled to learn more. One such was Domingo Catricura. Domingo was a student in an Indian law class I team taught at the University of Chile Law School more than twenty years ago. Domingo was in his fifties at the time and was one of about twenty-five non-law students who attended the class along with thirty law students. The non-law students were invited to attend the course because they were leaders in various Mapuche communities--the Mapuches being the largest indigenous group in Chile. They were not there to obtain a degree but just to learn--and to help us learn.<br><br>The course primarily covered the history of Spanish and Chilean interaction with the indigenous peoples of Chile and the first comprehensive Chilean Indian law that had been enacted just the year before. I provided a comparative perspective, contrasting the Chilean experience with that of the United States.<br><br>Though not a law student, and therefore without any hope of obtaining a law degree, Domingo attended the three-hour, once-a-week class every week, occasionally making a nine- to ten-hour bus ride from his small native village of Chiuimpilli in southern Chile in order to attend. He was anxious to learn everything he could about the new Indian law and every other aspect of the course, even that which I attempted to convey about U.S. law in my somewhat rusty Spanish. Though of limited economic means, Domingo purchased a small tape recorder to make sure that he thoroughly remembered and understood everything covered in the class. He also took copious notes, which he frequently reviewed with his two teenage children, who occasionally attended the class with him. He absorbed the information in class and wanted to discuss it after hours.<br><br>Domingo was not there to obtain a college education nor to earn a university degree. He was not there to advance his career nor to improve his job opportunities. He was there to learn anything and everything that might help him maintain the cultural integrity of his native village and improve the lives of its residents. And he was willing to search far and wide for information that might help him achieve that goal--even to consider what might be learned from the experience of what was a faraway country with a different legal system and history.<br><br>When I think of lifelong learners, I picture in my mind Domingo Catricura, his silver-haired head bowed over his desk, vigorously taking notes during a three-hour lecture in an unheated room in winter and then staying after class in order to further discuss the day's subject.<br><br>Some believe that the sole purpose of a college education is to prepare students for their first job. They question the value of a degree that does not have a clear path leading directly to some kind of occupation. Others, noting that the specific tasks of any particular job are likely to change so quickly that most people will end their careers doing something quite different from what they started out doing, assert that college should provide students skills and knowledge that will prepare them for their last job.<br><br>But the main purpose of a BYU education is not to prepare students for their first job nor to prepare them for their last job. The purpose of a BYU education is to help prepare students for what we might call their ultimate job--to help them realize their full potential as sons and daughters of heavenly parents with "a divine nature and destiny."<sup>4</sup> The purpose of a BYU education is, as our mission statement proclaims, "to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life."<sup>5</sup> That is a learning process that must not end here today. It must commence over and over again.<br><br>Still, there are things I hope you learned while you were here--perhaps for the first time or perhaps as a reconfirmation of things you already knew before arriving on campus. Let me share with you two in particular.<br><br>First, I hope you learned to discern and determine the relative value of the different kinds of information you have acquired or might acquire in the future. As Elder NealA. Maxwell once observed:<br><br><i>All knowledge is not of equal significance. There is no democracy of facts! .</i><i>.</i><i>. Something might be factual but unimportant. .</i>.. <i>For instance, today I wear a dark blue suit. That is true, but it is unimportant. .</i>.. <i>As we brush against truth, we sense that it has a hierarchy of importance. .</i>.. <i>Some truths are salvationally significant, and others are not.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>Furthermore, as Elder Maxwell also accurately noted:<br><br><i>Certain knowledge comes only by revelation and, thereby, is only "spiritually discerned" (1Corinthians 2:14).</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>If you learned, or reconfirmed, those truths here, your BYU education is very much worth celebrating today.<br><br>Second, I hope you have come to understand that learning is more powerful and truths are better understood when they are shared with others in an effort to help them improve. There is something deep within us that wants to share newfound truth with others. It is in our spiritual DNA. When we act on that deep-seated instinct by attempting to explain the truth to someone else, we often find new insights into what we thought we already fully understood. True learning is not a selfish endeavor. True learning is most power­fully experienced and most deeply ingrained when it is used to improve the lives of others.<br><br>President HenryB. Eyring encouraged those of us at BYU to become a "community of learners and lifters,"<sup>8</sup> urging us to follow Brigham Young's admonition:<br><br><i>Put forth your ability to learn as fast as you can, and gather all the strength of mind and principle of faith you possibly can, and then distribute your knowledge to the people.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>I hope that during your BYU years each of you has experienced the mind and soul-expanding experience of using newly discovered truths to bless the lives of others around you.<br><br>And so I congratulate each of you graduates for having completed this formal stage of your learning process, but I do so with the hope that this is just the beginning--the ­commencement--of the next phase of your eternal learning process, a process that, if successful, will lead to the fulness of joy that comes from discovering the most important eternal truths and from sharing those truths with others to improve their lives. May this be your destiny is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Kevin J Worthen, president of Brigham Young University, delivered this commencement address on 11 August 2016.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1>BYU Stories - to the New BYU Alumni - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Graduates, you are a beautiful sight. It is a privilege to stand before an audience as full of promise and potential as this one. As president of the BYU Alumni Association, it is my privilege to hereby confer on each of you graduates lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. I offer you congratulations and welcome you into this great association of more than 420,000 alumni.<br><br>Our alumni association has an ad campaign that prompts us to remember our time at BYU with the tagline "Remember when; remember why." We all have a BYU story. Recently Iasked some of you graduates why you chose to attend BYU.<br><br>One of you said:<br><br><i>Both of my parents went to BYU. Hearing their stories and seeing the relationships they built here made me want to have that experience for myself.</i><br><br>Another graduate answered:<br><br><i>I chose BYU because of the concentration of goodness I found when I first visited the campus.</i><br><br>I can relate to these reasons. I fell in love with BYU at a young age, when my family lived in Heritage Halls for a couple of summers while my dad worked on his doctorate.<br><br>But some of you might have had very ­different reasons for attending BYU. My husband came here on an athletic scholarship. He knew very little about Mormons then. Imagine his surprise on the first fast Sunday when the Cannon Center did not open for breakfast.<br><br>Regardless of why we chose to attend this university, we all now have in common a BYU experience. Here are some of the fond memories that you graduates have shared with me:<br><br><i>Professors knew my name, wanted to hear about my life, and cared about me as a person.</i><br><br>Another graduate shared the following:<br><br><i>One of my professors asked our class to tour the</i> <i>Education in Zion exhibit. During my visit, I realized that I was part of something greater than just earning my bachelor's degree. I realized the sacrifice that was required to build such an elite institution, and I realized that I had a part to play in continuing the tradition of educating Zion, wherever I went forth to serve.</i><br><br>Finally, here is something recalled by another one of you:<br><br><i>We would meet for church every Sunday in the Clyde Building foyer. I will never forget ­watching from the long windows as the snow fell when I received the prompting that I should serve a mission.</i><br><br>Our BYU stories have played a major role in shaping us. We all leave this place with memories and experiences that impact our future for good and serve as a springboard for the next phase of life.<br><br>The BYU Alumni Association is really all about this next phase. Our purpose is to help you stay connected to BYU. We want to know how your story continues. You can tell us your story at rise.byu.edu. A visit there will introduce you to inspiring alumni and give you the opportunity to share your own personal and professional experiences and successes. We want to see the realization of the potential for good contained in this audience.<br><br>Congratulations, graduates. Your fellow alumni are rooting for you. We love you and want the best for you. As you go out into the world, remember your BYU story and stay ­connected for good.<br><br><i>Amy Fennegan was president of the BYU Alumni Association when this commencement address was given on 11August 2016.</i><br><br>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>: Bound by Loving Ties - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
One of my BYU professors of yesteryear--actually quite a few yesteryears--was EdwardL. Hart, who wrote the text of a much-loved hymn in the Church. The second verse of that hymn, <i>Our Savior's Love,</i> reads this way:<br><br><i>The Spirit, voice</i><br><i>Of goodness, whispers to our hearts</i><br><i>A better choice</i><br><i>Than evil's anguished cries.</i><br><i>Loud may the sound</i><br><i>Of hope ring till all doubt departs,</i><br><i>And we are bound</i><br><i>To him by loving ties.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>An omnibus word familiar to us all that summarizes these "loving ties" to our Heavenly Father is <i>religion.</i> Scholars debate the etymology of that word just as scholars and laymen alike debate almost everything about the subject of religion, but a widely accepted account of its origin suggests that our English word <i>religion</i> comes from the Latin word <i>religare,</i> meaning "to tie" or, more literally, "to re-tie."<sup>2</sup> In that root syllable of <i>ligare</i> you can hear the echo of a word such as <i>ligature,</i> which is what a doctor uses to sew us up if we have a wound.<br><br>So, for our purpose today, religion is that which unites what was separated or holds together that which might be torn apart--an obvious need for us, individually and ­collectively, given the trials and tribulations weall experience here in mortality.<br><br>What is equally obvious is that the great conflict between good and evil, right and wrong, the moral and the immoral--conflict that the world's great faiths and devoted religious believers have historically tried to address--isbeing intensified in our time and is affecting an ever-wider segment of our culture. And let there be no doubt that the outcome of this conflict truly matters, not only in eternity but in everyday life as well. Will and Ariel Durant put the issue squarely as they reflected on what they called "the lessons of history." "There is <i>no</i> significant example in history," they said, "of [any]society successfully maintaining moral life without the aid of religion."<sup>3</sup><br><br>If that is true--and surely we feel it is--then we should be genuinely concerned over the assertion that <i>the single most distinguishing feature of modern life is the rise of secularism</i> with its attendant dismissal of, cynicism toward, or marked disenchantment with religion.<sup>4</sup> How wonderfully prophetic our beloved Elder NealA. Maxwell was--clear back in 1978--when he said in a <a href="http://speeches-alpha.byu.edu/talks/neal-a-maxwell_meeting-challenges-today/">BYU devotional</a>:<br><br><i>We shall see in our time a maximum</i> ... <i>effort</i> ... <i>to establish irreligion as the state religion.</i> [These secularists will use] <i>the carefully preserved</i> ... <i>freedoms of Western civilization to shrink freedom even as</i> [they reject] <i>the value</i> ... <i>of our rich Judeo-Christian heritage.</i><br><br>Continuing on, he said:<br><br><i>Your discipleship may see the time come when religious convictions are heavily discounted.</i> ... <i>This new irreligious imperialism</i> [will seek] <i>to disallow certain</i> ... <i>opinions simply because those opinions grow out of religious convictions.</i><a href="http://speeches-alpha.byu.edu/talks/neal-a-maxwell_meeting-challenges-today/"><sup>5</sup></a><br><br>My goodness! That forecast of turbulent religious weather issued nearly forty years ago is steadily being fulfilled virtually every day somewhere in the world in the minimization of--or open hostility toward--religious practice, religious expression, and, even in some cases, the very idea of religious belief itself. Of course there is often a counterclaim that while some in the contemporary world may be less committed to religion per se, nevertheless many still consider themselves "spiritual." But, frankly, that palliative may not offer much in terms of collective moral influence in society if "spirituality" means only gazing at the stars or meditating on a mountaintop.<br><br>Indeed, many of our ancestors in generations past lived, breathed, walked, and talked in a world full of "spirituality," but that clearly included concern for the state of one's soul, an attempt to live a righteous life, some form of Church attendance, and participation in that congregation's charitable service in the community. Yes, in more modern times individuals can certainly be "spiritual" in isolation, but we don't live in isolation. We live as families, friends, neighbors, and nations. That calls for ties that bind us together and bind us to the good. That is what religion does for our society, leading the way for other respected civic and charitable organizations that do the same.<br><br>This is not to say that individual faith groups in their many different forms and with their various conflicting beliefs are all true and equally valuable; obviously they cannot be. Nor does it say that institutional religions collectively--churches, if you will--have been an infallible solution to society's challenges; they clearly have not been. But if we speak of religious faith as among the highest and most noble impulses within us, then to say that so-and-so is a "religious person" or that such and such a family "lives their religion" is intended as a compliment. Such an observation would, as a rule, imply that these people try to be an influence for good, try to live to a higher level of morality than they might otherwise have done, and have tried to help hold the socio­political fabric of their community together.<br><br>Well, thank heaven for that, because the sociopolitical fabric of a community wears a little thin from time to time--locally, nationally, or internationally--and a glance at the evening news tells us this is one of those times. My concern is that when it comes to binding up that fabric in our day, the ligatures of religion are <i>not</i> being looked to in quite the way they once were. My boyhood friend and distinguished legal scholar Elder BruceC. Hafen framed it even more seriously than that:<br><br><i>Democracy's core values of civilized religion .</i>..<i> are now under siege--partly because of violent criminals who claim to have religious motives; partly because the wellsprings of stable social norms once transmitted naturally by religion and marriage-based family life are being polluted ...; and partly because the advocates of some causes today have marshaled enough political and financial capital to impose byintimidation, rather than by reason, their anti-­religion strategy of "might makes right.</i><i>"</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>There are many colliding social and cultural forces in our day that contribute to this anti-religious condition, which I am not going to address in these remarks. But I do wish to make the very general observation that part of this shift <i>away</i> from respect for traditional religious beliefs--and even the right to express those religious beliefs--has come because of a conspicuous shift <i>toward</i> greater and greater pre­occupation with the existential circumstances of <i>this</i> world and less and less concern for--or even belief in--the circumstances, truths, and requirements of the next.<br><br>Call it secularism or modernity or the technological age or existentialism on steroids--whatever you want to call such an approach to life, we <i>do</i> know a thing or two about it. Most important, we know that it cannot answer the yearning questions of the soul, nor is it substantial enough to sustain us in times of moral crises.<br><br>Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks, formerly Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the British Commonwealth for twenty-two years, a man whom I admire very much, has written:<br><br><i>What the secularists forgot is that</i> Homo sapiens <i>is the meaning-seeking animal. If there is one thing the great institutions of the modern world do not do, it is to provide meaning.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>We are so fortunate--and grateful--that modern technology gives us unprecedented personal freedom, access to virtually unlimited knowledge, and communication capability beyond anything ever known in this world's history, but neither technology nor its ­worthy parent science can give us much moral guidance as to how to use that freedom, where to benefit from that knowledge, or what the best purpose of our communication should be. It has been principally the world's great faiths--religion, those ligatures to the Divine we have been speaking of--that do that, that speak to the collective good of society, that offer us a code of conduct and moral compass for living, that help us exult in profound human love, and that strengthen us against profound human loss. If we lose consideration of these deeper elements of our mortal ­existence--divine elements, if you will--we lose much, some would say most, of that which has value in life.<br><br>The legendary German sociologist Max Weber once described such a loss of religious principle in society as being stuck in an "iron cage" of disbelief.<sup>8</sup> And that was in 1904! Noting even in his day the shift toward a more luxurious but less value-laden society, a society that was giving away its priceless spiritual and religious roots, Weber said in 1918 that "not summer's bloom lies ahead of us, but rather a polar night of icy darkness."<sup>9</sup><br><br>But of course not everyone agrees that religion does or should play such an essential role in civilized society. Recently the gloves have come off in the intellectual street fighting being waged under the banner of the "New Atheists." Figures like Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Daniel Dennett, and the late Christopher Hitchens are some of the stars in what is, for me, a dim firmament. These men are as free to express their beliefs--or, in their case, ­disbeliefs--as any other, but we feel about them what one Oxford don said about a colleague: "On the surface, he's profound, but deep down, he's [pretty] superficial."<sup>10</sup><br><br>Rabbi Sacks said that surely it is mind-boggling to think that a group of bright secular thinkers in the twenty-first century really believe that if they can show, for example, "that the universe is more than 6,000 years old" or that a rainbow can be explained other "than as a sign of God's covenant after the Flood," that somehow such stunning assertions will bring all of "humanity's religious beliefs ... ­tumbling down like a house of cards and we would be left with a serene world of rational non-believers,"<sup>11</sup>--serene except perhaps when they whistle nervously past the local graveyard.<br><br>A much harsher assessment of this movement came from theologian David Bentley Hart, who wrote:<br><br><i>Atheism that consists entirely in vacuous ­arguments </i><i>afloat on oceans of historical ignorance, made turbulent by storms of strident self-righteousness, is as contemptible as any other form of dreary fundamentalism.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>We are grateful that a large segment of the human population <i>does</i> have some form of religious belief, and in that sense we have not yet seen a "polar night of icy darkness"<sup>13</sup> envelop us. But no one can say we are not seeing some glaciers on the move.<br><br>Charles Taylor, in his book with the descriptive title <i>A Secular Age,</i> described the cold dimming of socioreligious light. The shift of our time, he said, has been<br><br><i>from a society in which it was virtually impossible </i><b><i>not</i></b><i> to believe in God, to one in which faith, even for the staunchest believer, is</i> [only] <i>one human possibility among</i> [many] <i>others.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>Charles Taylor also wrote that now, in the twenty-first century, "belief in God is no longer axiomatic."<sup>15</sup> Indeed, in some quarters it is not even a convenient option, it is "an embattled option."<sup>16</sup><br><br>But faith has almost always been "an embattled option" and has almost always been won--and kept--at a price. Indeed, many who have walked away from faith have found the price higher than they intended to pay, such as the man who tore down the fence surrounding his new property only to learn that his next-door neighbor kept a pack of particularly vicious Rottweilers.<br><br>David Brooks hinted at this but put it much too mildly when he wrote in his <i>New York Times</i> column, "Take away [the] rich social fabric [that religion has always been,] and what you are left with [are] people who are uncertain about who they really are."<sup>17</sup> My point about "too mildly" is that a rich social fabric, important as that is, says absolutely nothing about the moral state of one's soul, redemption from physical death, overcoming spiritual alienation from God, the perpetuation of marriage and the family unit into eternity, and so forth--if anyone is considering such issues in a postmodern world.<br><br>In fact, religion has been the principal ­influence--not the only one, but the principal one--that has kept Western social, ­political, and cultural life moral, to the extent that these have been moral. And I shudder at how immoral life might have been--then and now--without that influence. Granted, religion has no monopoly on moral action, but centuries of religious belief, including institutional church- or synagogue- or mosque-going, have clearly been preeminent in shaping our notions of right and wrong. Journalist William Saletan put it candidly: "Religion is the vehicle through which most folks learn and practice morality."<sup>18</sup><br><br>I am stressing such points this morning because I have my eye on that future condition about which Elder Maxwell warned--a time when if we are not careful we may find religion at the margins of society rather than at the center of it, when religious beliefs and all the good works those beliefs have generated may be tolerated privately but not admitted or at least certainly not encouraged publicly. The cloud the prophet Elijah saw in the distance no larger than "a man's hand"<sup>19</sup> is that kind of cloud on the political horizon today. So we speak of it by way of warning, remembering the storm into which Elijah's small cloud developed.<sup>20</sup><br><br>But whatever the trouble along the way, Iam absolutely certain how this all turns out. Iknowthe prophecies and the promises given to the faithful, and I know our collective religious heritage--all the Western world's traditional religious beliefs, varied as they are--is remarkably strong and resilient. The evidence of that religious heritage is all around us, including at great universities, or at least it once was--and fortunately still is at BYU.<br><br>Just to remind us how rich the ambiance of religion is in Western culture and because this is Campus Education Week, let me mention just a few of the great religiously influenced non-LDS pieces of literature that I met while pursuing my education on this campus fifty years ago, provincial and dated as my list is. I do so while stressing how barren our lives would be had there not been the freedom for writers, artists, and musicians to embrace and express religious values or discuss religious issues.<br><br>I begin by noting the majestic literary--to say nothing of the theological--influence of the King James Bible, what one of the professors I knew later at Yale called "the sublime summit of literature in [the] English [language],"<sup>21</sup> the greatest single influence on the world's creative literature for the last 400 years. I think also of what is probably the most widely read piece of English literature other than the Bible: John Bunyan's <i>Pilgrim's Progress.</i><br><br>Five decades after I first read them, I am still moved by the magnificence of two of the greatest poems ever written by the hand of man: Dante Alighieri's <i>Divine Comedy</i> and John Milton's <i>Paradise Lost.</i> Certainly the three greatest American novels I read at BYU were Herman Melville's <i>Moby Dick,</i> Nathaniel Hawthorne's <i>The Scarlet Letter,</i> and Mark Twain's <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry </i><i>Finn--</i>each in its own way a religious text and all more meaningful in my reading of them now than when I was a student on this campus so long ago. So too it is with my encounter with Russian writers, especially Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Leo Tolstoy.<br><br>Then--to name only a handful--you add British giants like George Herbert, John Donne, William Blake, and Robert Browning; throw in Americans like Emily Dickinson, William Faulkner, and Flannery O'Connor; then an American who became British, like T.S. Eliot, and a Briton who became American, like W.H. Auden; and for good luck throw in an Irishman like W.B. Yeats and you have biblical imagery, religious conflict, and wrenching questions of sin, society, and salvation on virtually every page you turn.<br><br>Having mentioned a tiny bit of the religiously related literature I happened to encounter as a student, I now note an equally tiny bit of the contribution that religious sensibility has provoked in the heart of the visual artist and the soul of the exultant musician. [Anaudiovisual presentation was shown.]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, my testimony this morning, as one observer recently wrote, is that "over the long haul, religious faith has proven itself <i>the most powerful and enduring force in human history."</i><sup>22</sup> Roman Catholic scholar Robert Royal made the same point, reaffirming that for many, "religion remains deep, widespread, and persistent, to the surprise and irritation of those who claimed to have cast aside [religious] illusion"<sup>23</sup>--to those, I might add, who under­estimated the indisputable power offaith.<br><br>The indisputable power of faith. The most powerful and enduring force in human ­history. The influence for good in the world. The link between the highest in us and our highest hopes for others. That is why religion ­matters. Voices of religious faith have elevated our vision, deepened our human conversation, and strengthened both our personal and collective aspirations since time began. How do we even begin to speak of what Abraham, Moses, David, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Nephi, Mormon, and Moroni have given us? Or of what Peter, James, John, the Apostle Paul, Joseph Smith, and ThomasS. Monson mean to us?<br><br>It is impossible to calculate the impact that prophets and apostles have had on us, but, putting them in a special category of their own, we can still consider the world-shaping views and moral force that have come to us from a Martin Luther or a John Calvin or a John Wesley in earlier times, or from a Billy Graham or a Pope Francis or a Dalai Lama in our current age. In this audience today we are partly who we are because some 450 years ago, men like Nicholas Ridley and Hugh Latimer, being burned at the stake in Oxford, called out to one another that they were lighting such a religious fire in England that it would never be put out in all the world. Later William Wilberforce applied just such Christian conviction to abolishing the slave trade in Great Britain. As an ordained minister, Martin Luther KingJr. continued the quest for racial and civil justice through religious eloquence at the pulpit and in the street. George Washington prayed at Valley Forge, and Abraham Lincoln's most cherished volume in his library, which he read regularly, was his Bible--out of which he sought to right a great national wrong and from which, in victory, he called for "malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right."<sup>24</sup><br><br>So the core landscape of history has been sketched by the pen and brush and word of those who invoke a Divine Creator's involvement in our lives and who count on the ligatures of religion to bind up our wounds and help us hold things together.<br><br>Speaking both literally and figuratively of a recurring feature on that landscape, Will Durant wrote:<br><br><i>These </i>[church] <i>steeples, everywhere pointing upward, ignoring despair and lifting hope, these lofty city spires, or simple chapels in the hills--they rise at every step from the earth to the sky; in every village of every nation on the globe they challenge doubt and invite weary hearts to consolation. Is it all a vain delusion? Is there nothing beyond life but death, and nothing beyond death but decay? We ­cannot know. But as long as men suffer these steeples will remain.</i><sup>25</sup><br><br>Of course, those of us who are believers have very specific convictions about what we <i>can</i> know regarding the meaning of those ubiquitous church steeples.<br><br>In that spirit let me conclude with my heartfelt apostolic witness of truths I do know regarding the ultimate gift true religion provides us. I have been focusing on the social, political, and cultural contributions that religion has provided us for centuries, but I testify that true religion--the gospel of Jesus Christ--gives us infinitely more than that; it gives us "peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come,"<sup>26</sup> as the ­scripture phrases it.<br><br>True religion brings understanding of and loyalty to our Father in Heaven and His uncompromised love for every one of His spirit ­children--past, present, and future. True religion engenders in us faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and hope in His Resurrection. It encourages love, forbearance, and forgiveness in our interactions with one another, as He so magnanimously demonstrated them in His.<br><br>True religion, the tie that binds us to God and to each other, not only seals our family relationships in eternity but also heightens our delight in those family experiences while in mortality. Well beyond all the civic, social, and cultural gifts religion gives us is the mercy of a ­loving Father and Son who conceived and carried out the atoning mission of that Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, suturing up that which was torn, bonding together that which was ­broken, healing that which was ill or imperfect, "proclaim[ing] liberty to the captives, and ... opening ... the prison to them that are bound."<sup>27</sup><br><br>Because my faith, my family, my beliefs, and my covenants--in short, my religion--mean everything to me, I thank my Father in Heaven for religion and pray for the continued privilege to speak of it so long as I shall live. May we think upon the religious heritage that has been handed down to us--at an incalculable price in many instances--and in so remembering not only cherish that heritage more fervently but <i>live the religious principles we say we want to preserve.</i> Only in the living of our religion will the preservation of it have true meaning. It is in that spirit that we seek the good of our fellow men and women and work toward the earthly kingdom of God rolling forth, so that the heavenly kingdom of God may come.<br><br>May our religious privileges be cherished, preserved, and lived, binding us to God and to each other until that blessed millennial day comes, I earnestly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Jeffrey R.

<h1>d Requireth the Heart and a Willing Mind” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Our university conference theme comes from Doctrine and Covenants 64:34:<br><br><i>Behold, the Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind.</i><br><br>It seems quite natural to talk about "a willing mind" in this setting of academics--with nearly 1,500 of you whose training and trade is thinking, sharing the products of your thinking with your disciplines, and guiding and focusing the thinking of students. The product of the mind is our business. However, in undertaking <i>His</i> work, the Lord requires both a willing mind <i>and</i> the heart. Nelson Mandela once wrote, "A good head and a good heart are always a formidable combination."<sup>1</sup><br><br>One might ask why the Lord needs both our minds and our hearts. It can be argued that the heart is the center of our humanity and the source of our love, motivation, desire, joy, anguish, satisfaction, hope, and aspiration. Consider for a moment how references to the heart are woven so frequently into our everyday idiomatic conversation: soft heart, hard heart, kind heart, halfhearted, bleeding heart, broken heart, heartthrob, heavy heart, faint of heart, eating your heart out, aching heart, from the bottom of your heart, the heart of the matter, follow your heart, heart of stone, heart of gold, bless his heart, heart-to-heart, learn by heart, sinking heart, makes my heart sing, my heart skips a beat, young at heart, pure in heart, my heart isn't in it, pour your heart out, take heart. ... I am sure you can think of even more examples. It seems that it is more the heart than the mind that defines us.<br><br>You may have read in the national media in recent weeks the touching story of a woman from Swissvale, Pennsylvania, by the name of Jeni Stepien. In 2006 Jeni's father was shot by a sixteen-year-old assailant in a robbery. He was mortally wounded, and the family made the difficult decision to donate his organs. Arthur Thomas from New Jersey, then sixty-two years old and suffering from congestive heart failure, was the recipient of Mr. Stepien's heart.<br><br>Late last year, ten years after losing her father, Jeni Stepien was engaged to be married, and her first thought after her engagement was, "Who will walk me down the aisle?"<br><br>At her fiancé's suggestion, Ms. Stepien asked Arthur Thomas--the recipient of her father's donor heart--to do the honors, and he agreed.<br><br>The wedding took place in the church in Swissvale in which Ms. Stepien's parents had been married. Mr. Thomas suggested that as they walked down the aisle, Jeni grip his wrist, where his pulse was the strongest: "I thought that would be the best way for her to feel close to her dad," he said, adding, "That's her father's heart beating."<br><br>After the ceremony the bride was photographed with her hand on Mr. Thomas's chest. "I felt wonderful about bringing her dad's heart," said Mr. Thomas. "If I had to, I would've walked."<sup>2</sup><br><br>In our Latter-day Saint scriptural canon there are 1,534 references to the heart--roughly one every page and a half, on average. There are 475 references to the mind. In our university conference theme, the Lord declared to His servants that He required both. His need for both heart and mind in the lives of those who embark in His work of building Zion should not surprise us, since we are taught that "the Lord called his people Zion, because they were of one heart and one mind" (Moses7:18).<br><br>I have long thought that, physiologically, the brain was in charge of our body--that it was the master control center. It stands at the head, sending signals to govern our motion, sensing and reacting to sensory input, telling us when to eat and when to sleep, and processing what we see and hear and touch.<br><br>Recent research has revealed that the heart has much more control over the brain than was previously known. There are tens of thousands of sensory neurons that relay information from the heart to the brain. In fact, the heart sends more information to the brain than the brain sends to the heart. "The heart produces hormones released into the bloodstream" that affect the entire body. "The heart emits an electrical field 60 times greater in amplitude than the activity in the brain and an electromagnetic field 5,000 times stronger than that of the brain." Like the brain, the heart has a complex network of neurons, neurotransmitters, proteins, and support cells that equip it to act independently of the cranial brain.<sup>3</sup><br><br>What seems very clear is that physiologically, the heart and the brain work in tandem, communicating with and complementing each other, each with its own set of unique responsibilities in the body's operation. Emotional and psychological health are linked intimately to the health of the heart. Interestingly, for so many who dread and feel extreme stress at work, researchers have shown that more people have heart attacks on Monday than on any other day of the week.<sup>4</sup><br><br>Now I don't know whether the anatomical heart is the center of our emotions, but if it does play a role, we should not wonder why the Lord asks for both heart and mind in His work. To attempt His work with the mind only is, well, even less than halfhearted. Especially at BYU, the Lord needs the willing mind; He needs your extraordinary intellect, shaped and sharpened through extensive study. He also needs your heart. As President SpencerW. Kimball stated in 1967:<br><br><i>The uniqueness of Brigham Young University lies in its special role--education for eternity--which it must carry in addition to the usual tasks of a university. This means concern--curricular and behavioral--for not only the "whole man" but for the "eternal man."</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>As a university, we will not achieve our mission "to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life"<sup>6</sup> without bringing our minds <i>and</i> our hearts to bear. If we approach our assignment here without both mind and heart, BYU will be <i>only</i> a superb university, not unlike other very fine universities. However, our charge and our aspirations are much grander.<br><br>In the remainder of my remarks today I wish to explore several ways that serving from our hearts magnifies serving only with very able minds. I will share six observations I see generally in you whose hearts guide your service here, and along the way I will provide some information relevant to us at this time. Throughout our time together we will hear from some of our faculty colleagues and the students they have influenced. Our story is best told by you and the students you touch.<br><br><b>1. My first observation is that faculty guided by their hearts are profoundly and energetically interested in the learning of their students.</b> This is crucial when we realize that the university must now deny admission to one applicant for every one that is admitted. One of the many ways this observation is manifest is through careful attention to program learning outcomes. Students should understand what they can expect from a program, and faculty should understand how their courses contribute to those expectations.<br><br>In an effort to effect continued improvement of learning outcomes at the university, last summer and fall we undertook a campuswide effort to improve the assessment process in all colleges, including General Education. Associate deans on the University Curriculum Council and their college curriculum councils worked with departments to improve and update the learning-outcomes alignment tables for their programs. The Center for Teaching and Learning provided important assistance in this task. Associate deans reported changes made by each department, including examples of improvement, to the university administration. These changes were compiled in a report to our accreditor, the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities.<br><br>I express deep appreciation for this significant effort to improve the quality of learning outcomes and assessment methods across the university. I hope this will improve the learning experience for our students. We will continue to refine our assessment methods and touse assessment to improve student learning.<br><br>Achieving the aims of a BYU education is at the core of our student-learning experience and should serve to guide the details of our teaching. Let me introduce you to Shu Pei Wang of the Department of Asian and Near Eastern Languages, who will describe how she seeks to put her students on the path of lifelong learning--both in what she teaches and inwhat she models herself. [Video<sup>7</sup>]<br><br>Professor Wang has distinguished herself as an attentive, caring instructor whose efforts are centered on the learning of her students. I share one student comment from her teaching evaluations:<br><br><i>It may seem exaggerated, but what I have learned from Wang Laoshi and her testimony has altered the trajectory of my life. She has taught--no, shown--me how to continually seek improvement, to take risks, and to have faith that we ultimately </i><b><i>can</i></b><i> succeed.</i> [She is] <i>one of my favorites, if not my absolute favorite teacher, at BYU. She has a gift for teaching, a gift for loving her students, and a gift for speaking the language of the Spirit using both Chinese and English. It was an honor to take a class from her.</i><br><br>Student perception of our teaching effectiveness is a valuable tool in assessing our attention to their learning. We are just completing our first full year using the new student ratings instrument. You will recall that a faculty committee worked on the development of this new instrument for seven years. The new survey tool is shorter, focuses more specifically on student perception of the instructor's effectiveness and the achievement of the four aims of a BYU education, and provides an opportunity for student comments on all survey questions. Students seem to be happier with the new instrument. Average student response rates have climbed from 67 percent in 2014 using the old tool to 73 percent in winter semester 2016. These response rates are considerably higher than rates for similar student evaluations of which we are aware at other universities.<br><br>One of the significant advantages of the new tool is that it gives us an estimate of the margin of error for the instructor composite score, the number derived from student responses to the five questions seeking to gauge instructor effectiveness. We have encouraged department chairs, deans, and faculty members to interpret the student ratings in light of these uncertainty ranges. With each new semester we accumulate ratings information that can be used to more reliably track the historical trends in our student evaluations. The more data we gather, the tighter the margin of error, lending greater confidence to the results. We continue to evaluate the reliability of the instructor composite score means, the stability of ratings across semesters, and other statistical properties of the ratings.<br><br>Last year we met with all department chairs to present and discuss the new ratings instrument. We have made some refinements to the instrument based on their input and on your helpful suggestions. Minor formatting changes were made to the survey questions to improve clarity, to encourage student narrative response to the survey items, to provide additional context, and to increase usefulness for both faculty and administrators.<br><br>Some of you were concerned that the item-specific comment boxes did not permit students to summarize their overall experience in the course. Consequently, we added an additional question to the tool: "What additional comments do you have about the instructor or course?" We counsel you to strongly encourage student participation in the evaluations for each class, since higher response rates reduce the margin of error.<br><br>As we rolled out the new student ­ratings instrument, we wondered how it would impact the formative evaluations used in annual stewardship interviews and the summative evaluations used in rank and status reviews. General feedback is that the new instrument has been beneficial in the annual stewardship evaluations. Coupled with mid­semester evaluations, data from the new instrument serve to guide faculty in improving their teaching. Rank and status files ­submitted in the past year to the various evaluation committees included student-­evaluation data from both the previous and the new student-ratings instruments. It appears that the inclusion of data from the two different instruments resulted in few challenges during these reviews. Calibration between the old and new instrument was facilitated by earlier pilot studies revealing a very high correlation (in the high 90 percent) between the overall instructor ratings for the previous instrument and the composite rating of the new instrument.<br><br>We understand that student evaluations have limitations.<sup>8</sup> In all of our discussions of the new student-ratings instrument, I have stressed that student ratings are only one element of a comprehensive strategy for assessing student learning and instructor effectiveness. Our next step in pursuing that strategy is the exploration of a robust approach to peer evaluation of teaching. This year we are assembling a task force to undertake the development of an approach for effective and efficient peer evaluation of teaching. As we launch this effort, we recognize that peer evaluation of teaching can be a time-intensive endeavor. We will seek to develop a principle-based methodology that can be adapted to disciplines across campus but that is also sensitive to the load of the peer evaluator. You will undoubtedly hear more about this in the future.<br><br>Our mission is to "assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life ... in a stimulating setting where a commitment to excellence is expected and the full realization of human potential is pursued."<sup>9 </sup>I suspect that you routinely seek the best for your students, often imploring heaven in their behalf.<br><br>In his address on this campus in 1967, President Kimball stated to the faculty:<br><br><i>I would want</i> [the students] ... <i>to know instinctively by your spirit that you were that morning on your knees with your family and that there were soft words of pleading to your Heavenly Father for guidance, not only for your little family kneeling with you but for your larger family also at that moment scurrying about their apartments to get ready for your class.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>This is done quietly and invisibly as you "pour out your souls in your closets, and your secret places, and in your wilderness" (Alma 34:26)--and, I might add, in your classrooms, your studios, your laboratories, and your clinics. Your interactions with students every day reflect your deep interest--interest from the heart--in their learning and growth.<br><br>The experience of one of our nursing students, Ragan Porter, illustrates this kind of influence by Kent Blad, associate dean in the College of Nursing. [Video<sup>11</sup>]<br><br>President GordonB. Hinckley's declaration on the occasion of President CecilO. Samuelson's inauguration in September 2003 isrelevant here:<br><br><i>We should not have failures on this campus. We are more than teachers. We are shepherds. And we know that the spirit of shepherding resides in the hearts of those who serve here as members of the great Brigham Young University faculty.</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/gordon-b-hinckley_remarks-inauguration-president-cecil-o-samuelson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>12</sup></a><br><br><b>2. Faculty who are motivated by the heart are more interested in what they give than in what they get.</b> President Kimball stated, "This university is not the place for mercenaries."<sup>13</sup> So many of you could be elsewhere--with higher salary, more space, more time for research, and more equipment--but you have chosen BYU, often at some sacrifice. Despite sacrifices, I believe we have compensatory help. With increasing frequency, it seems, our faculty and students are recognized nationally and internationally for their accomplishments. Faculty are drawn here by our mission, with a preeminent commitment to students and a deep desire to contribute in unique ways in this unique environment. Professor Brad Bundy of the Department of Chemical Engineering articulates the sentiment of so many of you. [Video<sup>14</sup>]<br><br>I am grateful for the influence you have in students' lives. We have a rich tradition of this kind of influence. I want to commend departments for careful attention to quality hiring in building this kind of unique faculty. Irecognize that faculty recruitment is a time-intensive process, but it is an opportunity to continue to build and strengthen programs.<br><br>Faculty hiring at BYU is nominally a three-decade commitment for the large majority of faculty. When new department chairs and deans are appointed, I tell them that they will deal with a variety of issues--students, financial management, space allocation, curriculum, research, etc. I try to reinforce that, while all of these matters are important, the single most important decision they will make will be their recommendation of new faculty for hire and the subsequent development of thosehires.<br><br>We begin each search process with a pool of applicants who are equipped--through the quality of their graduate programs and the rigor of their preparation in the discipline--<br>to contribute in significant ways through their scholarship. Of that candidate pool, a subset is identified who are also passionately committed to teaching here and for whom interaction with students will be their priority. The pool is further filtered as we select applicants who are uniquely and unapologetically anxious to both intellectually enlarge and spiritually strengthen students--applicants who are ­prepared to serve with both mind and heart.<br><br>In the last seven years, after 904 faculty campus interviews, we have hired 435 continuing faculty status–track faculty. Think of the impact of your hard work. In those seven years we have replaced nearly one-third of the total complement of continuing faculty status–track faculty at the university.<br><br>We approach our rank and status decisions with the same care, and we see retention and promotion through the same lens as we do the hiring process. We hire only those who we think will be successful here, and we seek university processes and resources to maximize the possibility of success. I hope the motivation for qualifying for continuing faculty status and promotion at the university comes from the heart rather than from the Rank and Status Policy.<br><br>Since 2010, after careful review at multiple levels, 271 faculty have been awarded continuing faculty status, 226 faculty have been promoted to the rank of associate professor, and 175 have been promoted to the rank of full professor. Based on the quality of the faculty we hire and the mentoring provided, we believe our success rates in the rank and status process are higher than at comparable universities. BYU's fulfillment of its core mission rises and falls on your contributions as faculty, and your influence extends far beyond the development of students' ability to think.<br><br><b>3. Faculty serving with the heart are committed and equipped to bring heaven's influence into their interactions with students.</b> Let me quote from a 1975 address President Kimball gave here at BYU:<br><br><i>Your light must have a special glow, for while you will do many things in the programs of this university that are done elsewhere, these same things can and must be done better here than others do them. You will also do some special things here that are left undone by other institutions.</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/spencer-w-kimball_second-century-brigham-young-university/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>15</sup></a><br><br>Learning seems to flourish when it is ­cultivated in an inspired environment. Before they are hired, all full-time faculty at BYU are approved by the BYU Board of Trustees, which is chaired by the First Presidency of the Church. The finest disciplinary preparation of faculty is a baseline expectation for them, and the board trusts us to make that evaluation. My sense is that what they are most keenly interested in is our ability to build faith in the students. That sets you apart from any other faculty body in the world.<br><br>The "double heritage and dual concerns with the secular and the spiritual"<sup>16</sup> that President Kimball spoke of and that we embrace here are exemplified by Doug Prawitt of the School of Accountancy in the Marriott School. [Video<sup>17</sup>]<br><br>Each of us approaches this dual stewardship in our own way, and part of the beauty of the student experience during the students' time at BYU is that they see multiple personalities and multiple approaches to faithful learning. Imagine the impact on a student who sees a faculty member who has distinguished herself in her discipline <i>and</i> who is thoughtful and open about her faith.<br><br><b>4. Passionate learning is driven by the heart, and passionate faculty learners seek to imbue students with that same love.</b> In his address at the inauguration of President Kevin J Worthen, President HenryB. Eyring observed:<br><br><i>This is a vibrant and determined community of learners and lifters. Students, faculty, and staff here are driven by a desire and a strength of mind to learn as fast as they can. ...</i><br><br><i>It goes beyond learning for ourselves. The vision at the founding was that all here will seek truth not for themselves alone but will also distribute what they have learned to bless others.</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/henry-b-eyring_leader-learners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>18</sup></a><br><br>I could draw examples from so many of you whose appetite for knowledge is infectious. Listen to Kristin Matthews from the Department of English and her students. [Video<sup>19</sup>] Professor Matthews's skill at shaping character through the transformational power of learning may be summarized in one student comment:<br><br><i>Everything I learned in Dr. Matthews's class encourages me to be a more thoughtful, kind, open, questioning, considerate, brave, and diligent person.</i><br><br>Learning is part of our doctrine. "Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection" (D&amp;amp;C 130:18). As faculty, we are likely here because we were inspired by engaging teachers. It is our opportunity now to extend this chain of learners as we interact with our students.<br><br><b>5. Our motivation to continually improve the student experience comes from the heart, and it bears fruit both in and out of the classroom.</b> This happens through regular revision of ­syllabi; modification of learning outcomes; refinement of curriculum; invitations to students to join us in the lab, the library, the field, or the studio; and pursuit of career-­development opportunities for them. You have heard President Worthen's emphasis on the student experience and particularly on the kind of inspiring learning that occurs in experiential settings. Last year President Worthen authorized the distribution of a significant sum of one-time money as direct support for student experiential learning. Such learning spans a wide range of activities, including field studies, study abroad, on- and off-campus internships, mentored research, and capstone experiences. That our students highly value these experiences is seen in the numbers:<br><br>•<br>By their own report in the most recent Senior Survey, 53 percent of our students have worked regularly with a faculty member outside of class for at least one semester--up from 47 percent five years ago.<br><br>•<br>Last year the university awarded $615,000 in ORCA Grants and $1.9 million in Mentoring Environment Grants. In the last decade the university has supported, on average, more than 500 students per year in mentoring experiences through these grant programs.<br><br>•<br>Fifty-seven percent of our graduating students in 2014–15 held an off-campus internship for at least one semester--an increase from 41 percent ten years ago. More than 4,000 students registered for credit-bearing internship opportunities last year.<br><br>•<br>This year the International Study Programs office processed more than 1,800 students abroad in foreign experiences, with roughly one-fifth of those in international internships. Student applications to the International Study Programs office increased from 1,800 students in 2001 to more than 4,200 students this past year.<br><br>All of these numbers illustrate our intense interest in the student experience at BYU. Such enriching experiences require faculty interest, thought, and time beyond traditional classroom teaching. Thank you for facilitating these opportunities for our bright undergraduates.<br><br>As one example of a colleague who continually seeks to improve the student experience, let me introduce you to Greg Stallings from the Department of Spanish and Portuguese. Asan introduction to this video clip, I will share a student comment from one of his Spanish literature courses:<br><br><i>From the time my teachers started assigning homework</i> [in middle school] <i>until the time I took this class, I had completely forgotten that reading is cool. If not for</i> [this class,] <i>I likely would have gone years without checking out a book from the library--something which I have already done multiple times this semester. ... Professor Stallings was indeed successful in sharing his love for the fine arts, and for that I am grateful.</i><br><br>[Video<sup>20</sup>]<br><br>A new campus initiative to enhance the student experience is the expanded opportunity for BYU-hosted online courses. The online delivery of educational content is becoming increasingly important in educational institutions across the country. While definitive data are difficult to find, a 2010 survey estimated that more than one-fourth (27 percent) "of all high school students took at least one class online," which was "up from 14 percent the year before."<sup>21</sup><br><br>An increasing number of states are enacting legislation requiring students to take at least one online course for high school graduation.<sup>22</sup> In the last eight years, the number of online high school courses offered through state-sponsored virtual schools in this country increased from just over 300,000 to nearly 750,000.<sup>23</sup> Nationally, the number of students who access online learning resources as part of their college experience is significant and appears to be growing. The 2012 Survey of Online Learning showed that 32 percent "of higher education students now take at least one course online."<sup>24</sup><br><br>Our BYU matriculated students have accessed online courses through Independent Study for a number of years. Students have paid tuition for these courses beyond their day-school tuition, underlining their motivation to pursue part of their education in this delivery format. In the past, Independent Study students have had a year to complete the course with little supervision, although new federal regulations will now require our students who enroll in Independent Study courses to complete the course in one semester. In the last ten years, between one-fourth and one-third (22 percent and 31 percent) of students completed Independent Study to fulfill graduation requirements. Our students clearly appreciate the flexibility that comes with online classes.<br><br>At President Worthen's direction, we have undertaken the development of online courses that our students can take as part of their day-school load and tuition. The motivations for this initiative are several, but all of them seek to enhance the experience of our own students:<br><br>1. Students seek the scheduling flexibility ofonline courses.<br><br>2. It is believed that online courses may relieve pressure on our classrooms and other physical facilities.<br><br>3. Finally, it is our feeling that when they leave here, students will enter professional ­settings in which they will need to know how to learn independently online.<br><br>President Worthen's goal has been that by 2020 all entering freshmen at BYU can take fifteen credits online toward graduation. It is estimated that to reach this goal we will need 600 to 700 sections of online courses. We are determined to ensure that these courses preserve the BYU experience. We are calling this effort BYU Online to distinguish it from Independent Study. As with traditional classroom courses, BYU Online is available only to our students, is semester or term based, and may be taken as part of their day-school tuition. BYU Online courses feature regular checkpoints with students during the semester to ensure their progress. These courses are being developed in a partnership between faculty in departments across campus who have the disciplinary expertise and Continuing Education, which has the online design and pedagogical experience and provides support to academic departments for course development and delivery.<br><br>My office is providing funding for departments whose faculty are relieved of other duties to help in the development of BYU Online courses. Students will substitute enrollment in traditional courses with enrollment in their online counterparts. Thus, because these courses enroll our day-school students, teaching these courses will be done as part of faculty load. As with traditional day-school courses, adjuncts may be carefully considered to teach BYU Online courses and will be funded as adjuncts have been funded in day-school courses. When teaching assistants are used in BYU Online courses, it is anticipated that they will be funded from a combination of department and college day-school resources, university funds, and resources from Continuing Education.<br><br>We currently have thirty-one BYU Online courses ready for fall semester, representing forty-nine sections with 2,284 enrollments so far. The BYU Online courses currently implemented are in seven colleges, as well as student-development courses in Student Life. Generally, student demand exceeds the enrollment ceiling we currently impose on these courses, and there is a large waiting list for each course. There are eleven BYU Online courses under active development, and eight more courses were approved for development in the last two weeks. New courses are regularly being proposed and evaluated for adoption. We have been open to the exploration of hybrid courses in those departments in which the combination of traditional classroom instruction and online content delivery seems preferable. Extensive mechanisms are in place to assess learning outcomes from our online courses, and those processes are being continually refined.<br><br>I express appreciation for your engagement in the BYU Online initiative and for the partnership of Continuing Education in this effort. I believe this will enhance our students' experience here.<br><br>As we pursue BYU Online, we recognize that the new student-ratings instrument we now use may not be appropriate for online courses. The instrument focuses on student perception of <i>instructor</i> effectiveness, and online courses are formatted differently: the student experience seems more likely to be centered on the course than on the instructor. Beginning this fall, under the leadership of Associate Academic Vice President Brad Neiger, a task force will begin to explore an appropriate assessment tool for BYU Online courses.<br><br>I must acknowledge that not all is rosy with regard to the student experience. One concern has weighed on me for several years. We currently have fifty-two limited-enrollment programs at the university. Students seeking entrance to these programs complete a set of prerequisite courses and are admitted competitively on the basis of their performance in these courses. For the most recent university admission class (2015), approximately one-fourth of admitted applicants did not specify a preferred major that they wish to pursue. Of those who did specify a major preference, five of the top seven preferred majors are limited-enrollment programs, and one-third (33.6 percent) of admitted students declare limited-enrollment programs as their major ofpreference.<br><br>We have a university total capacity in all limited-enrollment programs of approximately 5,600 students--roughly one-fifth of the undergraduate student body. Over the past four years these programs have been able to accommodate an average of fewer than 60 percent of the applicants. So it is not uncommon for applicants to the university to have crossed the extraordinarily high bar in gaining admission to BYU only to find that they cannot pursue their major of choice. Indeed, it may be concluded that as many as 4,000 of our students may not be in their major of choice. I am quick to acknowledge that there are real limits to capacity in these programs, and some students are not equipped to be successful in them. Iwould hope that through creative strategies and other efficiencies we could accommodate more of those who apply to limited-enrollment programs. We will continue to explore ways to open this bottleneck.<br><br>I pause here to state that the video clips we have viewed today are part of the Faith and Learning Initiative in the Faculty Center. They are samples of multiple video segments and university addresses focusing on our unique mission. I thank the Faculty Center for their vision and their good work in this area, and I invite you to visit the Faith and Learning website to explore other ways to expand your ability to achieve the mission of BYU.<sup>25</sup><br><br><b>6. I end today with the final observation that BYU faculty who serve with heart seek and see the influence of the Holy Ghost in their work.</b> This happens in their teaching, in their research, in the development of curriculum, in their interaction with colleagues elsewhere, and in devotionals. You have experienced that subtle and sacred guidance in your teaching, and I see the influence of Spirit-guided teaching in student comments as part of teaching evaluations. I am sure the same can be said of your research activities. We repeatedly hear faculty describe the role of revelation in their research in devotionals and forums. President Kimball made the following observation, which I believe applies in the classroom and the laboratory:<br><br><i>We expect the natural unfolding of knowledge to occur as a result of scholarship, but there will always be that added dimension that the Lord can provide when we are qualified to receive and he chooses to speak.</i><sup>26</sup><br><br>Our covenants put us in the position of qualifying for divine guidance in our work. If this place is as central to the building of the kingdom as declared in so many prophetic statements, we should not doubt that the windows of heaven will be flung open to permit the flow of knowledge in our stewardships. Itstrikes me that this may be the most critical reason that the Lord requires both "the heart and a willing mind" in the important work we do here. The Lord declared in Doctrine and Covenants 8:2–3:<br><br><i>Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart.</i><br><br><i>Now, behold, this is the spirit of revelation.</i><br><br>Revelation is critical for this work, and revelation can come only when both mind and heart are aligned and engaged. Let me show one last video that illustrates this linkage in the context of the research activity of one of our colleagues. Tom Sederberg is a faculty member in the Computer Science Department with nearly forty years of outstanding teaching at BYU and international recognition and distinction in his research. [Video<sup>27</sup>]<br><br>Prophets have declared powerfully their vision for this university. While we may not see as they do, our hearts can feel the truth of what our minds may not yet conceive. In President Kimball's remarks in 1975, quoting Ernest L. Wilkinson, past president of BYU, wefind:<br><br><i>There were Brethren who had dreams regarding the growth and maturity of Brigham Young University</i> ...<i>, yet "dreams and prophetic utterances are not self-executing. They are fulfilled usually by righteous and devoted people making the prophecies come true."</i><sup>28</sup><br><br>Thank you for the central role you play in the realization of those prophecies. I am not sure we have yet achieved what has been foreseen, but I am confident we will have heaven's help to get there. Adding heart to mind in our work will transform our teaching to learning, our knowledge to wisdom, our study to discovery, and our sacrifice to consecration. Iexpress my wish for a productive year.<br><br><i>BrentW.

<h1>g Learning - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a joy to be with you this morning. There is something about the beginning of a new school year that brings hope and optimism. Perhaps it is the chance to start out fresh--no matter how challenging the prior semester has been. Perhaps it is the promise that fall, with its crisp air and changing leaves--and, for me, football season--will soon arrive. Hopefully for all of us it is the thrill you feel in being involved in the intellect-expanding, soul-­refining, celestializing endeavor in which we are all engaged.<br><br>This last year has brought many successes and a few challenges. Since we last met in this setting,<b> </b>more than 7,700 of our students graduated and moved on to the next phase of their lifelong learning process. During their stay here,<b> </b>many accomplished great things, ranging from receiving a Truman Scholarship to temple marriage. Others excelled as they represented the university in various settings.<br><br><b> </b>The BYU Ballroom Dance Company won the Blackpool competition in modern formation, a feat they have accomplished every time since 1989 that their three-year cycle has taken them back to England. They also took first place in Latin American formation--another repeat championship. The men's volleyball team, the men's rugby team, and the women's rugby team all competed in their respective national championship games, all on the same day. Hopefully you can identify and celebrate other successes in your areas. They are evident all around us.<br><br>Improvements have also been made to our campus infrastructure. We completed fund-raising for the new Engineering Building, and construction is now underway. Expansion of the Harman Building has begun, in large part to expand the online learning environment here on campus, and the new Marriott Center Annex, housing our men's and women's basketball teams, is nearing completion. My thanks to all those involved in these and numerous other projects on campus.<br><br>We have also faced challenges in this past year--challenges that give us opportunities to improve. As I am sure you are all aware, we are examining in depth the reporting process for our students and other aspects of the way we handle sexual assault cases. It causes us deep sorrow to know that members of our community would be victimized in such a devastating way. We are anxious to help them.<br><br>A group of faculty and administrators have worked tirelessly during the summer to help us know how best to do that. We anticipate that this fall the advisory council will present their recommendations to the President's Council. We will then address the topic with the campus community more in depth. In the meantime, let me emphasize that the top priority in this extensive effort is the safety and well-being of our students, especially those who have been the victims of sexual assault. Efforts will continue until sexual assault is eliminated from our campus environment.<br><h2><b>Learning at Brigham Young University</b></h2><br>I think by now you know me well enough to correctly predict that my message today will somehow focus on the mission statement. I continue to be impressed with how the language in this three-decade-old document sheds clarifying light on many of the new situations, new challenges, and new opportunities we encounter. I believe there was inspiration in the creation of that document and that inspiration will come from continued reflection on itsprinciples.<br><br>So, as we reflect on this year's conference theme, which reminds us that "the Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind,"<sup>1</sup> Ihope that what occupies a good portion of our hearts and minds is the role we are to play in assisting our students "in their quest for perfection and eternal life."<sup>2</sup> The mission statement makes it clear that our primary role in that process is to help our students learn. We are to provide them "a period of intensive learning."<sup>3</sup> That phrase describes the rigor of the learning experience our students should have. Other portions of the mission statement describe the content and outcomes of that learning.<br><br>In terms I hope are now familiar to all ofyou, the mission statement indicates that, above all else, our students should learn "the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ."<sup>4</sup> In addition, they should experience learning that is "broad"--learning that enables them to<br><br><i>think clearly, communicate effectively, understand important ideas in their own cultural tradition as well as that of others, and establish clear standards of intellectual integrity.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>Our students should also experience learning "in the special fields of their choice"-- learning that will enable them to compete "with the best in their fields."<sup>6</sup> In addition, they should experience learning that renders them<br><br><i>not only .</i>.<i>. capable of meeting personal challenge and change but .</i>..<i> also</i> [of bringing] <i>strength to others in the tasks of home and family life, social relationships, civic duty, and service to mankind.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>The Aims document effectively boils all these down to four main points: we are to provide learning that is "(1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building, leading to (4) lifelong learning and service."<sup>8</sup><br><br>Notice how each aim is directly connected to specific portions of the mission statement. The spiritually strengthening aim links to specific portions of the mission statement. The intellectually enlarging aim links to other portions, as does the character building aim. Other sections of the mission statement explain the lifelong learning and service aim. And there are even more links.<br><br>These convey the truth that one cannot fully understand the aims unless one fully understands the mission statement. While the aims may be easier to remember--I venture to guess that more people can recite the aims than can provide a word-for-word rendition of the mission statement--they are not independent and freestanding ideas that supplement the mission statement. They derive directly from the mission statement and provide a shorthand description of its key learning principles.<br><h2><b>The Term "Inspiring Learning"</b></h2><br>Perhaps out of a desire to simplify things as much as possible--and perhaps as a result of a diminishing capacity to remember even four things--but largely in an effort to succinctly explain what we are about in a way that allows people to easily remember, I have tried to simplify the core learning goals even more while still emphasizing that a full understanding requires a return to the mission statement. After discussions with many of you in many settings, I have concluded that one two-word description that achieves that end is "inspiring learning." Note again that one cannot understand the full meaning of the term "inspiring learning" without a full understanding of the mission statement. Just as the Aims document is a summary and not a replacement for the mission statement, the two-word description "inspiring learning" is a summary and not a replacement.<br><br><i>Inspiring</i> is an interesting word. It derives from the Latin term <i>inspirare,</i> which means "to breathe into" and, more specifically, "to breathe life into."<sup>9</sup> <i>Inspiring</i> is both a noun and an adjective. The noun can be defined as the act of inspiring or motivating. In this sense, the term "inspiring learning" describes actions that inspire or motivate students to learn. As an adjective, <i>inspiring</i> is a modifier. In this context it describes a kind of learning: learning that inspires--or, more precisely, in our setting, learning that leads to inspiration or revelation.<br><br>When I use the term "inspiring learning," I have in mind both meanings of the word <i>inspiring.</i> I hope we inspire our students to learn. And I hope that learning leads to inspiration. When both things happen, inspiring learning occurs, and we can then know we are on the right track to achieve the core goals set forth in our mission statement.<br><br>While the term "inspiring learning" may not be familiar to you, my guess is that many of you are familiar with the phenomenon. Inspiring learning occurs in many of our classrooms for many of our students on a regular basis. Indeed, it may happen so often that we fail to appreciate how exhilarating it can be. We grow used to it. Sometimes it takes someone from outside the university to point it out to us. Here is one example.<br><br>This past January, New York University professor of journalism Jay Rosen came to campus as a guest lecturer. Let me share with you what he posted shortly after his visit:<br><br><i>This was the scene a few days ago when I gave a guest lecture at Brigham Young University, which of course is a Mormon school. .</i>.<i>.</i><br><br><i>A most unusual thing happened before I was introduced. Unusual for me, normal at Brigham Young. Dale Cressman, who organized the event and guided me around campus, asked a student to begin the event with a prayer. The student stood and prayed for help in "feeling grateful for the opportunity to learn." I wish more college students felt that way and expressed it as well as she did.</i><br><br><i> I found the BYU students a joy to teach. They were extremely engaged. With good humor they tolerated me asking and reasking them the same question ten times, answering in a slightly different way each time, which allowed me to make a new point in response. After the talk, at least a dozen of them thanked me, and each one shook my hand, looked me in the eye, and made a personal connection. "Grateful for the opportunity to learn" .</i>..<i> that wasn't just words to them.</i><br><br><i> It was one of the best experiences I have had in 30 years as a professor.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>That is an example of inspiring learning. And classrooms are the central places in which that kind of learning occurs. I hope we can make each of our classrooms a place of inspiring learning, a place in which students become excited about learning and in which that learning leads to revelation.<br><h2><b>Learning by Experience</b></h2><br>While it is essential that our formal classrooms be sites of inspiring learning, that by itself will not completely fulfill our mission. Let me return to the mission statement, this time to the second paragraph:<br><br><i>All instruction, programs, and services at BYU, including a wide variety of extracurricular experiences, should make their own contribution toward the balanced development of the total person.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>Note "all instruction," including "a wide variety of extracurricular experiences." Some of the most important inspiring learning opportunities occur outside the formal classroom setting through experiences that are, in that sense, extracurricular. And, without implying either that we have fully perfected classroom instruction or that we are going to emphasize classroom instruction less, let me suggest that one way we can enhance the quality of inspiring learning at BYU is to expand both the quantity and quality of the kind of learning that occurs outside the formal ­classroom--the kind of instruction that many call "experiential learning." Just like classroom learning, experiential learning can produce the kind of inspiring learning that our mission statement challenges us to provide.<br><br><i>Experiential learning</i> has become somewhat of a buzzword in academia in recent years. However, for us there is a deeper, even doctrinal reason for pursuing learning by experience in a systematic way. We are all quite familiar with the scriptural injunction that we "seek learning, even by study and also by faith."<sup>12</sup> That describes two key ways by which we learn important truths: by study and by faith. But those are not the only ways by which we learn essential knowledge and skills. Gospel teaching instructs us that we learn by study, we learn by faith, and we learn by experience.<br><br>Learning by experience is a central purpose of our mortal journey. As Elder DavidA. Bednar once observed, "Learning by faith and from experience are two of the central features of the Father's plan of happiness."<sup>13</sup> We could not have simply memorized celestial laws in our premortal life and declared ourselves fit for the celestial kingdom. We needed to come to this mortal existence to experience certain things we could not experience in our premortal life and to learn from those experiences. Experience is a key part of our mortal learning process.<br><br>Similarly, students cannot learn all they need to learn by memorizing or even discussing principles in a classroom, as exhilarating as that may be. Experience connects theory with application and deepens our understanding of the principles and truths we learn.<br><br>And, in my view, experiential learning can be inspiring learning in both senses of that term. It can both inspire students to deeper learning and be the type of learning that leads to inspiration.<br><br>There is ample evidence that experiential learning can inspire and excite students to learn in ways that have a deep and long-lasting impact. Describing the results of his study about student learning at Harvard, Professor Richard J. Light observed:<br><br><i>I assumed that most important and memorable academic learning goes on inside the classroom, while outside activities provide a useful but modest supplement. The evidence shows that the opposite is true. .</i><i>.. When we asked students to think of a specific, critical incident or moment that had changed them profoundly, four-fifths of them chose a­situation or event outside of the classroom.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>Likewise, in a 2008 study, George D. Kuh, the founding director of the widely used National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE), identified ten teaching and learning practices that have especially high impact on students. Five of those--including such things as internships, service learning, and undergraduate research--involved activities that would easily fit into the category of experiential learning.<sup>15</sup><br><br>Other studies underscore the point. A 2014 survey of approximately 30,000 college students conducted by Purdue University and the Gallup Poll evaluated the relationship between various college experiences and subsequent success at work and overall life well-being. The survey sought to correlate high measures of work engagement and well-being with various college experiences.<br><br>The results were telling. Workplace success did not correlate with the size of the university attended, large or small, or with whether the university was private or public. But other factors did seem to matter. Specifically, the study found that the chances that individuals would thrive at work--the highest measure of work ­engagement--doubled if during college they "had an internship or job where they were able to apply what they were learning in the classroom, were actively involved in extracurricular activities and organizations, and worked on projects that took a semester or more to complete."<sup>16</sup> The first two clearly involve experiential learning; the third may as well.<br><br>Evidence from our own campus also illustrates the ways in which experiences outside the classroom can inspire students to learn. Let me cite as one example the Phage Hunters program in the College of Life Sciences. This program enlists students early on--sometimes as freshmen on their very first day of class--tobegin original research. The students collect soil samples and for the next two semesters work to isolate and identify a bacteriophage that has never been seen before.<br><br>One project involved students working under the direction of Professor Sandra Hope, who was searching for a viable way to treat a disease that affects honeybee hives. Notice in this video the involvement of the students. [Avideo presentation was shown.]<br><br>As noted, the student most prominently featured in the video, Bryan Merrill, signed up for the Phage Hunters class as a sophomore. After completing the class, Bryan was hired as a TA and worked as a research assistant and mentor to other students in the class. By the time he graduated from BYU with his master's degree in molecular biology, Bryan had already published (or copublished) eight research articles and had worked on twenty-three genome sequences. He is currently pursuing a doctoral degree in microbiology and immunology at Stanford University. Bryan's initial experience with phages clearly inspired lifelong and career-enhancing learning.<br><br>I believe such experiential learning activities can also help students learn to be inspired. Given the nature of the phenomenon being measured, there are no academic studies--at least none that I could find--that address the impact that experiential learning may have on a person's ability to receive inspiration or revelation. But there is other evidence that, at this unique institution, is at least as persuasive.<br><br>We are all familiar with the Book of Mormon account of Lehi's sons going back to Jerusalem to obtain the plates of brass. In a sometimes overlooked portion of that account, Lehi noted three times that the Lord commanded him that he should send his sons back to get the plates,<sup>17</sup> thereby making it clear that Lehi was not supposed to do this himself.<br><br>Having been the father of sons who were the ages of Nephi and his brethren at the time, I have some sense that had Lehi been given the simple direction just to go get the plates, he would have attended to the task himself. It would have been simpler and easier. That is how it is with teenage boys sometimes. However, the Lord made it clear that Lehi was to send his sons.<br><br>Why? I suggest that at least part of the reason is that the Lord wanted Nephi and his brethren to have an experiential learning opportunity. It may have been easier and faster for Lehi to get the plates himself, but God was not interested just in getting the plates. He was also interested--more interested--in helping Lehi's sons in their quest for perfection and eternal life. And He furthered that process by providing those sons with a learning experience that caused at least one of them, Nephi, toreceive inspiration.<br><br>When Nephi returned to the camp after that learning experience, he came back not only with the plates but with a greater faith in God and a greater understanding of how inspiration comes. He had experienced inspiring learning.<br><br>Nephi's experience in obtaining the plates--or, more precisely, Lehi's experience in facilitating that experience--demonstrates an important truth about the kind of inspiring learning that comes from experience. It requires that the teacher have great patience and a clear understanding of the larger purpose involved. Perhaps as a result of God's commanding him multiple times that he should send his sons, Lehi came to realize that, as important as the plates were--and they were of great importance, as demonstrated by the fact that Nephi took Laban's life to obtain them--securing their possession was not the main object of the experience. The main purpose was to refine Lehi's children, who were also God's children.<br><br>Similarly, as important as our research may be--and some of it is of enormous importance, some of it life-changing, even lifesaving--it is, in the long run, not as important as the ­eternal development of our students. I applaud and admire the way so many of you pursue both these ends with full purpose of heart and mind, without sacrificing either. But it is hardwork.<br><br>Again, one illustration will stand as proxy for numerous others that might be provided. [A video presentation was shown.]<br><br>Taking students, especially undergraduate students, into such projects as the Antarctica study of nematodes requires a great amount of perspective and faith. In an email, Professor Byron J. Adams explained:<br><br><i>Supporting a single human being in Antarctica is the most expensive, most difficult, and most precious part of doing research down there. If something happens and a single slot opens up .</i>..<i>, we have</i> [to select] <i>a person best suited to help with the project....</i> <i>Most of the time that means bringing down other famous scientists, or postdoctoral fellows</i> [who] <i>are highly skilled in a single area. However, on several occasions I've been able to justify bringing students down because I can train them very well .</i>..<i> on exactly what they need to do. And because my students have always been exceptionally awesome (hard working, skilled, fun to be around), my colleagues are happy to have them on the team.</i><br><br>So far, six different students have accompanied Professor Adams to Antarctica, three of them undergraduates. This coming year he will take two other graduate students. And while there are risks, there are also enormous rewards. Professor Adams reported:<br><br><i>The first undergrad I brought to Antarctica is now a faculty member in another department in my college. The second one is a faculty member at the University of California, Riverside. The third is just beginning his medical residency in OB/GYN. The first grad student I brought down is now a geneticist at a USDA research center; the rest are still in my program working toward graduation.</i><br><h2><b>Enhancing Inspiring Learning at BYU</b></h2><br>Inspiring learning requires faith both by the students and by the faculty member. It is not an easy task, but it is an inspiring one.<br><br>So we might ask ourselves: What can we do to enhance the impact of these kinds of ­inspiring learning experiences at BYU in the coming year and in the coming years? Let me make three simple suggestions.<br><br>First, we can expand the number of students who have a meaningful experiential ­learning opportunity. We can, for example, look for ways to provide more faculty mentoring opportunities for them. The impact of faculty mentoring can be enormous. In a report summarizing a large number of academic studies, clinical psychologist and professor of psychology W. Brad Johnson said:<br><br><i>Compared to nonmentored individuals, those with mentors tend to be more satisfied with their careers, enjoy more promotions and higher income, report greater commitment to the organization or profession, and are more likely to mentor others in turn.</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>The impact is even greater at a place like BYU, where we are interested in more than academic or temporal success. Because we challenge faculty members to be leaders in their fields of research and because we also askthem to be faithful in the gospel, BYU faculty members provide living examples of the power of learning by study and by faith. Students can first see, then work with, and eventually emulate role models who have demonstrated that they can excel in both their fields and their faithfulness. Experience of that kind is truly inspiring in both senses of the word.<br><br>However, there is a limit to the number of faculty mentorship opportunities we can provide. As good as they are, our faculty have only twenty-four hours in a day, and they are already stretched almost to the limit. Fortunately, other experiential learning opportunities can also promote inspiring learning. Internships, study abroad programs, fieldwork, service learning opportunities, and even on-campus work are all experiences that, when properly structured, can provide opportunities to both inspire students to learn and help students learn to be inspired.<br><br>To increase the number of students who can have such experiences, this year the university provided substantial additional funding to each college, with the central stipulation that the funds be directed to students to facilitate a structured experiential learning opportunity. Because the calendar year is not yet complete, it is too early to measure the overall impact of this increased funding in terms of the number of students having such opportunities. However, anecdotal reports from every college indicate that the funds have allowed numerous students to have an experiential learning opportunity that they otherwise would have had to forego for economic reasons.<br><br>The results have been encouraging--enough that we are working to provide additional funding again in 2017 and to make securing even more funds one of the top fund-raising priorities for the university.<br><br>Second, in addition to increasing the number of opportunities for inspiring learning experiences, we can work to make the opportunities have even more impact by being more purposeful and intentional about what happens in those activities. While traveling in a foreign country can be a life-changing experience, through careful and thoughtful planning, the impact of the experience can be magnified severalfold. Similarly, internships provide insights into the skills required to succeed in an occupation, but increased planning and foresight can make the experience considerably more meaningful by ensuring that certain kinds of activities occur and that there is adequate opportunity for reflection. I challenge all involved in such activities to make sure we are maximizing the amount of good that can result from them.<br><br>Finally, we can increase the number of inspiring learning moments for our students if we recognize that both experiential learning and classroom learning are enhanced by the quality of the relationships we develop with our students. Research has shown that "high impact [learning] practices are powerful in part because they are relationship rich."<sup>19</sup> The 2014 Gallup-Purdue survey I mentioned earlier found that one of the key factors that correlated with success in <i>both</i> work engagement <i>and</i><b> </b>overall well-being was a high-quality relationship with a faculty member. According to that data, a graduate's chances of thriving at work <i>and</i><b> </b>in life <i>doubled</i> if the student "had a professor who cared about them as a person, made them excited about learning, and encouraged them to pursue their dreams."<sup>20</sup><br><br>BYU should be a leader in this regard. Our mission statement provides that<br><br><i>all relationships within the BYU community should reflect devout love of God and a loving, genuine concern for the welfare of our neighbor.</i><sup>21</sup><br><br>If our students feel this, they will be inspired to learn, and they will learn to be inspired in profound ways.<br><br>Let me share one example. Four years ago one of our graduate engineering students, Shannon Zirbel, received a $100,000 fellowship from NASA to work on a project with laminate-compliant mechanisms in space. She received a lot of attention, and we used her success in our fund-raising efforts for the new Engineering Building. People resonated with the idea that their donations might help bright students like Shannon be involved in cutting-edge work. She was very articulate and very gracious to share her time in informing people about her work as part of our fund-raising effort.<br><br>It was only some time later that I learned the more complete story of her BYU experience that led to the fellowship. I share portions of her account with her permission:<br><br><i>When I graduated from high school, I went to</i> [Georgetown] <i>University. .</i>.. <i>I had a misconception about BYU--I thought girls just came here to get married, .</i>..<i> so I didn't even apply to BYU. .</i>.<i>. Two years later I went on a mission. During my mission I served with several companions who were students at BYU, and my opinion of BYU changed entirely. When I came home from my mission, Iapplied to and was accepted at BYU. .</i>..<br><br><i>I'm not brilliant. But I work hard, so I know Ican accomplish good things, and hard things. But I need ready reassurance. Maybe it's because I'm a</i> [woman]. <i>A</i> [woman] <i>in a male-dominated field, surrounded by men who, by nature, think differently than I do. Do you know how hard that is sometimes?</i><br><br><i>One of my biggest concerns about staying for a PhD was the qualifying exams. Just prior to my taking them .</i>..<i>, Dr.</i> [Larry] <i>Howell gave me a blessing. Being able to receive a priesthood blessing from my advisor was one of the highlight experiences of attending BYU. Every morning of the exam week Iwent in to get "words of encouragement" from Dr.Howell.</i><br><br><i>On Wednesday morning (before the dynamics exam), as I was leaving his office, I said, "I'll try tomake you proud."</i><br><br><i>He replied, "You already have."</i><br><br><i>Can I tell you how much of a difference that made for me? I went into the exam feeling blissful, feeling like I didn't have anything I needed to prove. I just had to do my best, and that was going to be enough. He couldn't have said anything more perfect. I've had many experiences like that with professors at BYU, where they have shown such genuine concern for me.</i><br><br>Inspiring learning will be greatly enhanced if those with whom we interact feel Christ's love for them through us.<br><br>Our efforts to enhance inspiring learning--the kind of education for eternity described in our mission statement--can have an enormous impact on all of our students. But it need not and should not end there. You will shortly hear from Elder Kim B. Clark about a new global initiative in the Church Educational System--an effort to provide learning to Saints and others throughout the world. This initiative is inspiring and will give us the opportunity to magnify the impact of what we do here. However, I believe we can best accomplish that by focusing on our principal and board-directed role, which is to enhance the learning experience of our students in all the ways described in the mission statement. We need not alter or change our focus; we simply need to do well--to do better--what we are already doing and then look for new ways to share.<br><br>The mission statement succinctly sums up how we can best help in words that, though written nearly thirty-five years ago, seem somehow to have this initiative specifically in mind:<br><br><b> </b><i>In meeting these objectives BYU's faculty, staff, students, and administrators should also be anxious to make their service and scholarship available to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in furthering its work worldwide.</i><sup>22</sup><br><br>We should be anxious to make our service and scholarship available to the Church in this exciting worldwide endeavor, but we can best do so by meeting the objectives set forth in the mission statement.<br><br><b> </b>Our mission is clear and simple. It can, in one sense, be captured in the phrase "inspiring learning." But it is more accurately and more fully described in our inspiring and inspired mission statement. As we face the opportunities and challenges of the coming year, I urge you to return to that mission statement often and to contemplate what your role is in carrying out that mission. I promise that as you do so, inspiration will come. It will come to you and it will come to your students.<br><br>You are not here by accident and they are not here by accident. Our coming together will allow God's work to go forward, both in our own individual lives and in the lives of others on this campus and throughout the world. I so testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Kevin J Worthen, president of Brigham Young University, delivered this university conference address on 22 August 2016.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1>ducation Initiative: The Lord&#039;s Pattern - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I count it a great blessing and a privilege to speak today at this university conference. Ilove to come to this campus.<br><br>Before I begin my formal remarks, I am going to tell you a little story about why I feel so strongly about this place. It is not only because as a student here for a year after my mission Ifound my professional calling to be a teacher and a scholar at the feet of truly, truly inspiring teachers like LarryT. Wimmer and others, but it is also because I met Sue here.<br><br>I want to tell you this little story about why I get a chill that just covers me when I walk on this campus. I had met Sue, and we were in the same family home evening group. We went for a walk one night, and I had the very distinct impression from the Spirit: "This is your ­eternal companion." Fortunately, she had the same feeling.<br><br>Just a couple of days later I was walking along a diagonal sidewalk toward where in those days the sidewalks met in a big X, right about where the HaroldB. Lee Library annex is now. I was walking along toward that X when the national anthem began playing, so I stopped. When it finished playing, I walked along the sidewalk and came to where the sidewalks crossed in an X. I ran into Sue right there in the middle of the X. It was on a Wednesday afternoon, and there were thousands of students in that area. And I ran into my eternal companion in the center of the X! Ididn't say this to the Lord, but <i>I got it.</i><br><br>Just a few weeks ago we celebrated our forty-fifth anniversary. She is the love of my life. I came here to find her because she wasn't in Boston. She was here. I am so grateful. And whenever I walk on this campus I feel the same way.<br><br>So I love to come here. And I love you. The Lord has blessed me with the gift of love for you. I believe He wants me in my responsibilities now to see you and love you the way He sees you and loves you.<br><br>I pray that you will feel that love today. I also pray that the Holy Ghost will be with us as we consider together the implications of a very simple message. This message has come to me personally, but I feel that I should share it with you.<br><h2><b>The Need to Be Better</b></h2><br>Here it is: Whatever level of spirituality we now enjoy in our lives; whatever degree of faith in Jesus Christ we now have; whatever strength of commitment and consecration; whatever degree of obedience, hope, or charity is ours; and whatever level of professional skill or ability we have obtained, it will not be sufficient for the work that lies ahead.<br><br>I believe this message fits into a beautiful pattern the Lord has established in the Restoration, beginning with His appearance with His Father to Joseph Smith in 1820. Line upon line, precept upon precept, and step by step, Jesus Christ has built up His Church and His people. He has said:<br><br><i>For I will raise up unto myself a pure people, that will serve me in righteousness.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br><i>That the work of the gatheringtogether of my saints may continue, that I may build them up unto my name upon holy places; for the time of harvest is come, and my word must needs be fulfilled.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br><i>My people must be tried in all things, that they may be prepared to receive theglory that I have for them, even the glory of Zion.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>This is the Lord's pattern: He is raising up, building up, and preparing His people and His Church. President ThomasS. Monson's call to all of us to rise up and build the kingdom of God is evidence of that pattern in our day. Listen to President Monson's invitations to us to do more and to be better:<br><br>[Our] <i>challenge is to be more profitable servants in the Lord's vineyard.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br><i>Wishing will </i><b><i>not</i></b><i> make it so. The Lord expects our thinking. He expects our action. ... He expects our devotion.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br><i>There are feet to steady, hands to grasp, minds to encourage, hearts to inspire, and souls to save.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br><i>I testify to you that our promised blessings are beyond measure. Though the storm clouds may gather, though the rains may pour down upon us, ... there will be nothing in this world that can defeat us.</i><br><br><i>My beloved brothers and sisters, fear not. Be of good cheer. The future is as bright as your faith.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>Brothers and sisters, you and I need to be much better than we are now. The scriptures teach us that the world is now and will continue to be in commotion. Wickedness and darkness will increase. Yet in that darkening world there will be increased divine light. The Lord Jesus Christ has a great work for us to do with the rising generation. It is a greater work than we have ever done before. The Lord is working in power to strengthen teaching and learning in His true and living Church. He is hastening His work, and He is preparing the earth and His kingdom and us for His return. The Lord is opening more opportunities for education to many more of His children.<br><h2><b>Two Assignments of the Church Educational System</b></h2><br>In that spirit I believe there are two overarching assignments we have in the Church Educational System.<br><br><i>First,</i> we need to educate more deeply and more powerfully than we have ever done before--more than <i>anyone</i> has ever done before. As President Henry B. Eyring said many years ago, education in God's kingdom is "the struggle for perfection."<sup>8</sup> It only happens through learning that enlightens the mind, strengthens understanding of the heart, and deepens spirituality and conversion unto the Lord. This is what President Kevin J Worthen called "inspiring learning."<sup>9</sup> That kind of learning leads to increased skill, capacity, and power to act and increased strength of character.<br><br>Deep learning is inherently a spiritual experience. The rising generation will learn deeply as they diligently work and seek learning and as the redeeming and strengthening powers of Christ work more powerfully in their lives.<br><br>Inspired teaching that supports deep learning is also a spiritual experience. Like President Worthen, I want to reinforce this important idea that no matter what you do, every person who works on this campus teaches and every person influences students. So all of us need the Atonement of the Savior to work more powerfully in our lives so that we can help the rising generation learn more deeply.<br><br><i>Second,</i> we have a sacred responsibility to do all we can to help many more of the rising generation and many of the older generation to obtain that kind of education. Increased opportunities for education are vital for building up the kingdom of God and establishing Zion all across the earth. That not only means we need to open up greater access, but we need to do it in a way that lowers relative cost. Whatever we do needs to be sustainable in and scalable to a much larger Church.<br><br>When I served a mission many years ago, there were 3 million members of the Church. Today there are more than 15 million. There are five times as many members of the Church today as there were when I began my missionary service. I want you to ponder in your minds about a church that is five times bigger than it is now. Think about a church that has 75 million members. Or think about a church that has 100 million members. We live in a time like that, when God will do His work all across the world and the Church will spread and fill the earth.<br><h2><b>The Global Educational Initiative</b></h2><br>One way in which we will address this responsibility that we have to educate many more of God's children is through the Global Educational Initiative that we have launched in the Church Educational System. I would like to share with you today a brief overview of the Global Initiative.<br><br>This work has been inspired and guided by our experience in seminary and in Pathway. The seminary and institute programs and Pathway have been great teachers for us, helping us to see how the Church Educational System might take additional educational opportunities to members of the Church wherever they live.<br><br>In November 2015 the Church Board of Education approved the following proposed concept:<br><br><i>The Church Educational System (CES) will seek to provide opportunities for education to the members of the Church wherever the Church is organized.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>The basic idea is that Church members may access educational opportunities where they live through online courses, classes from local education providers, and local gatherings at chapels and institutes. The opportunities we envision include<br><br>• religious education--this is an essential part of every program we offer<br><br>• English language instruction--from ­novice to intermediate level<br><br>• secondary education support--to help students be successful in their local public or private schools<br><br>• Pathway--a one-year program designed to prepare students for further higher education<br><br>• technical and skills-based training and certificates<br><br>• undergraduate degrees in selected fields (both associate's and bachelor's degrees)<br><br>• and, eventually, master's degrees<br><br>There are four guiding principles in the initiative:<br><br><b>Principle 1:</b> Education--"the struggle for perfection"--is a spiritual experience and is essential for building the kingdom of God and establishing Zion. Religious instruction, gathering experiences, and a spiritual focus in online learning will be essential.<br><br><b>Principle 2:</b> The initiative will be a ­collaborative, systemwide effort--involving all Church Educational System institutions--and will build as much as possible on resources, courses, and programs that already exist.<br><br><b>Principle 3:</b> Instruction will be delivered online and in local gathering activities at institutes and chapels.<br><br><b>Principle 4:</b> Students will access programs through their local Church units, guided by priesthood leaders and supported by the Church Educational System and Self-Reliance Services.<br><h2><b>BYU's Role in the Global Initiative</b></h2><br>Of the many development efforts underway in the Global Initiative, I want to highlight two: one in English language learning and the other in secondary education. BYU is centrally involved in both.<br><br>In English language learning we are developing a suite of programs with the potential to teach individuals who have no English skills to be able to speak, comprehend, read, and write English all the way from novice to an intermediate level. The vision we have is that these programs will be used all across the Church--for students in CES programs, of course, but also for missionaries--at the MTC and in the mission field, in companionship study, and in teaching investigators--and for Self-Reliance Services. Faculty and staff from BYU's English Language Center are working on the project as a whole and are developing a common assessment system for placement and certification.<br><br>Our development work in secondary education is focused on three pilot projects in the Pacific. We are working with BYU Independent Study to adapt their online secondary education courses for use in an educational support program. In the pilot projects we are focusing on educational support for students who have dropped out of school or who are at risk. The programs involve after-school workshops and tutoring to support students in English and math homework, in reading and doing math at grade level, and in preparing for national exams.<br><br>This is an exciting time in the Church Educational System, not only in the Global Initiative but in everything we do. Last year, in all of our programs combined, we taught more than a million students. That number will continue to grow. And the quality of what we do must also rise to meet the imperative of deep learning all across the system--which brings me to you and your work at BYU.<br><br>I began this talk with a simple message: In order to accomplish the great work that lies before us and that lies before you and this university, each of us needs to be better than we have ever been.<br><br>I want to focus on two reasons that apply specifically to BYU:<br><br><b>Reason 1:</b> BYU is under attack in the great war between good and evil.<br><br>People sometimes describe Utah County as "Happy Valley" and the BYU campus as a bubble that is removed from the world. I hope this place will always be a sanctuary of the Holy Spirit and a great temple of learning protected by legions of angels. But the reality is that BYU is on the front lines of the war between good and evil. BYU is a hot spot--a battle zone--in that war.<br><br>A part of that war is fought in the hearts, minds, and souls of God's children who come here to learn. A part of that war is fought in the interactions you have with people all over the world in academia, in government, in the media, in business, in the arts, and in the ­sciences--wherever you love, teach, invite, and stand for truth.<br><br>BYU is the flagship of the Church Educa­tional System. You are called upon to be a great shining light in God's kingdom. And because you are that light and because you stand for truth and righteousness, you are a lightning rod for all who would attack BYU and the Lord's Church. Those attacks may well increase in frequency and intensity. We need the gifts of the Holy Spirit and the protection of angels in greater measure.<br><br>I believe this means that we have to be ­better than we have ever been. I don't think BYU has ever been stronger or better than it is now. But where BYU is as an institution and where we all are personally in our obedience, our faith, and our commitment to the Lord will not be sufficient for what lies ahead.<br><br><b>Reason 2:</b> The Lord will ask you to do hard things.<br><br>This is the Lord's way. He asks us to do things that seem impossible or even unwise. He asks us to build ships that no one has ever built before and to go places that no one has ever gone before.<br><br>In the work that lies ahead, the Lord will call upon us to do exactly those kinds of things--hard things. We all will need much greater faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. We will need more revelation. We will need increased spiritual power. We will need all of these to move forward to do things that seem impossible--such as educate more deeply, serve many more students, and do all of it at a lower relative cost. The Lord will break the trade-offs that seem ironclad. He will open doors that are closed. He will inspire and guide and provide. He is in charge.<br><br>This call of the Lord to do hard things--things that the world thinks are impossible or even unwise--is nothing new for the people of BYU. I am reminded of something President Worthen said at his inauguration:<br><br><i>As we ascend to the tops of the mountains in these ways as a university, we will discover that new peaks lie ahead.</i> ... <i>We will encounter new and exciting challenges and opportunities that we have not seen before. As President Spencer W. Kimball explained some thirty years ago: "It should be obvious to us all that the ultimate future of BYU is partially hidden from our immediate view. Until we have climbed the hills just ahead, we cannot glimpse what lies beyond. And the hills ahead are higher than we think. We cannot be transported over them without meeting demanding challenges. .</i><i>.</i><i>. You will not always be able to see the future, but by drawing close to our Heavenly Father, you will be guided."</i><sup>11</sup><br><h2><b>What We Need to Do Now</b></h2><br>And so what do we need to do now? Each of us needs to do what the Lord wants done in our lives. I hope the following experience will be helpful to you as you ponder and pray about what the Lord wants you to do.<br><br>Many years ago, in a very difficult time in our lives, I felt under attack from the adversary. At that time the Lord made it very clear to me that I needed to do more and to be better. Let me give you just a little background.<br><br>Sue and I had been married at that time for more than thirty years, and we had been active and involved in the Church all our lives. We served in the Church; we attended the temple every week; and we prayed with our children, studied the scriptures with them, and held family home evening. We tried to be good Latter-day Saints. And yet the Lord said to me, "You need to do more."<br><br>One night I had a terrible nightmare. Iawoke very anxious and concerned, and I knelt and prayed to my Father in Heaven for help. As I prayed, there came into my mind a passage from Ephesians:<br><br><i>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>In the morning I looked up the scripture and read these words:<br><br><i>Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</i><br><br><i>Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.</i><sup>13</sup><br><br>When I read the words "put on the whole armour of God," I felt a powerful witness of the Spirit that this was the answer to my prayers. I needed to put on the whole armor ofGod--every bit of it.<br><br>Sue and I talked about what that might mean, and we prayed for guidance. I learned that we needed to ask ourselves two questions. I believe these are the questions whose answers will lead us to do what we need to do to prepare for what lies ahead. Here they are:<br><br>1. What am I doing that I should stop doing?<br><br>2. What am I not doing that I should start doing?<br><br>As we asked those questions in prayer, we received very specific answers. We changed how we spent our time, what media we allowed into our home, how we served in the temple, how we studied the scriptures, and how we served the Lord. We needed to increase our spirituality. Through this process of repentance the Lord Jesus Christ reached out and changed our lives. We felt His mercy, His grace, His love, and His power in greater measure. Through His matchless power He changed our hearts and our minds and lifted us up to Him. It was a turning point in our lives.<br><br>Now my dear brothers and sisters, I know that I am speaking to faithful, covenant-<sup>­</sup>keeping Latter-day Saints. I know that you are very, very good at what you do. Yet I know from my own experience that we need to ask ourselves these two questions regularly. We need to change and repent so that the Atonement of Christ can work even more powerfully in our lives. If we do, our Heavenly Father will bless us with greater spiritual power. I know that is true.<br><br>And that, I believe, is the whole key to meeting the great opportunities and responsibilities that lie before us. Many, many more of the rising generation all across the earth need to learn and to be taught--with increased love, with greater spiritual power, and with deeper impact in their lives.<br><br>I believe that impact will come because the gospel of Jesus Christ will be more powerfully rooted in our hearts and in our minds. The redeeming and strengthening powers of the Atonement of Christ will work more powerfully in our lives. Our lives will more fully and completely reflect the teachings of the Savior. The Holy Ghost will be our constant companion, and we will have greater faith, greater courage, and greater ability to step beyond the light along the path the Lord directs.<br><br>Then, when we create new programs, develop curriculum, implement new pedagogy, hire and train new people, counsel students, write new software, launch a new project, or walk into a classroom to teach God's children, we will receive the revelation we need, we will be magnified far beyond our native ability, and we will do the work with the pure love of Christ by the power of the Holy Ghost. The rising generation will learn deeply; they will rise up in great numbers all across the earth.<br><br>We know this will happen. We know how this all turns out. The Lord Jesus Christ will come, and His people and His Church will be prepared to receive Him.<br><br>When I think of you and of what you are going to do in God's kingdom and are doing now, I think of that marvelous tableau in 3Nephi 17 when the Savior gathered the children around Him. I want you to picture that scene in your minds because you are in that scene: Parents bring their precious children to the Savior, He gathers them around Him, He is at the center, He prays for them and their parents in a miraculous way, and He blesses the children one by one. Then angels descend from heaven "as it were in the midst of fire"<sup>14</sup> and minister to the children--and that holy fire encircles the children.<br><br>In a powerful sense, this is what you do at BYU. Indeed, this is the whole purpose of the Church Educational System: Parents bring their children to us, and the Savior is at the center--the heart of everything that happens to the children. He prays for them and for us, and He is our Advocate with the Father. We are the angels--you are the angels--who come to minister to those children in holy fire. That, my dear brothers and sisters, is who we need to be.<br><br>And that is who we will be, because there is a God in heaven. He is our Father. His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, is the Savior and Redeemer of all mankind. He lives! I bear witness of His holy name. I have seen Him work, I know His mercy and grace, and I feel His love. He has all power to cleanse us from sin, change our hearts, lift us, and strengthen us to become everything He wants us to be. I know that if we turn to Christ, who always stands with His arms outstretched to us, He will bless us to be better and to do more in this, His holy work. I so testify, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Kim B.

<h1>te Program of Real Consequence: The Role of the Law School at BYU - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
What a pleasure it is to be with you this evening. Itfeels like I am back home. While I value all of our programs at the university, I will openly confess that the Law School holds a special place in my heart. It is a place that has greatly shaped my life, both as a student and as a faculty member.<br><h2><b>The Mission of BYU</b></h2><br>Those who have followed my tenure as president know that my focus from the outset has been on the mission statement of the university, a foundational document approved by the BYU Board of Trustees in 1981. It sets forth the key principles that guide the university. Many of you will be familiar with the first sentence of the mission statement, which indicates that, in its broadest sense, our mission as a university "is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life."<sup>1</sup> We are to provide what President Spencer W. Kimball called an "education for eternity,"<sup>2</sup> an education that, in the language of The Aims of a BYU Education, is "(1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3)character building, leading to (4) lifelong learning and service."<sup>3</sup><br><br>A quick review of the mission statement makes two things very clear:<br><br>First, our primary focus is on teaching ­students. That may seem obvious. You may think that every university focuses on teaching students; that is why they exist. That is true. But at many universities the size of BYU, the focus on teaching students is counterbalanced against an emphasis on faculty research, with students sometimes relegated to coequal or even secondary status in some decisions. While research is an important part of what happens at BYU, various features of the mission statement remind us that students must remain the central priority.<br><br>For example, the word <i>students</i> appears in the mission statement seven times. The word <i>faculty</i> appears twice. The word <i>administrators</i> appears only once. Although I am quite confident that the authors of the mission statement did not engage in a careful word count to ensure that the relative importance of each group was precisely represented in the numeric ratio, the relative use of each term serves as a reminder that our mission focuses on the ­students--and not on the faculty oranyone else.<br><br>Second, consistent with the emphasis on students, the vast majority of the mission statement focuses primarily on undergraduates and what they should learn. The description of the type of education students are to receive is geared primarily to undergraduates. According to the mission statement, students are to receive a broad general education with in-depth learning and instruction in a selected major field.<sup>4</sup> In other words, they are to receive a traditional liberal artsand sciences undergraduate education.<br><br>Our enrollment numbers reflect that same undergraduate focus. We have approximately 33,000 full-time students, of which 30,000 are undergraduates; only 3,000 are graduate students. At many major universities the balance is much closer to 50/50 or in some cases is even weighted more heavily in favor of graduate students.<br><br>Thus the mission statement makes clear that BYU is primarily an undergraduate teaching institution, not a graduate research institution. The only reference to graduate programs in the mission statement is in a single phrase indicating that research should be encouraged among both faculty and students, "including those in selected graduate programs <i>of real consequence.</i>"<sup>5</sup><br><br>Given that undergraduate emphasis, one might ask, What is the role of the Law School in fulfilling the mission of BYU? This is a question I first began to ask myself when, as dean of the Law School, I realized that I was the only dean on campus who had absolutely no undergraduates in my college--not necessarily a comfortable position at a university whose primary focus is on undergraduates. So as I sat in Deans Council, I began to ask myself, How does a purely graduate program like the Law School fit in a place like BYU?<br><br>This evening I would like to offer some thoughts on that question. What can--and should--be the role of a law school at a university like BYU, whose clear focus is on undergraduate learning? Or, to use the terminology of the mission statement, what does it mean to be a graduate program "of real consequence" at BYU, and does the Law School fit that definition?<br><h2><b>Law Schools in America's History</b></h2><br>The question of how a law school should fit into the larger university is one that has been debated for much of America's history. Although the early European universities included law as one of the central subjects to be studied,<sup>6</sup> at the time of the American Revolution most lawyers entered the profession via an apprenticeship.<sup>7</sup> Legal education was simply not a feature of most universities at the time.<sup>8</sup><br><br>That trend continued through the nineteenth century as well. Most lawyers in the 1800s began the practice of law without ever attending law school. They became lawyers the way Abraham Lincoln did, by reading the law part-time. Today's first-year law students may contemplate with envy the scene described by one of Lincoln's friends: the future lawyer-president learned his craft by sitting under an oak tree reading law books day after day, moving around the tree to keep in the shade.<sup>9</sup> That sure beats sitting in a sterile classroom, waiting fearfully to hear the sound of your name called by professors who seem to expect you to already know what you thought they would teach you.<br><br>By the end of the nineteenth century there were law programs at a number of universities. Still, an 1891 report found that only one in five lawyers admitted that year had been to law school, and no state required law school attendance as a condition of admission to the bar.<sup>10</sup><br><br>Moreover, even where there were law schools there were serious questions about whether they belonged in a university. Many academics in other fields viewed legal education as vocational training, an endeavor they considered beneath the dignity of institutions dedicated to the lofty ideals of a liberal arts education. The second-class status of early law programs within their universities was demonstrated by the fact that, in 1901, "opponents of Georgetown's athletics program were irritated to discover [that] a disproportionate number of Georgetown's athletes [were] enrolled in the law school."<sup>11</sup> In the eyes of many, law school courses were the "underwater basket-weaving classes" of their time.<br><br>The relatively low esteem in which law schools were held is furthered illustrated by the fact that no one thought it odd that future Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black was not accepted into the college of arts and sciences at the University of Alabama in 1904 but was admitted without difficulty to that university's school of law that same year.<sup>12</sup><br><br>Summarizing the views of many academics at the time, Thorstein Veblen asserted in 1918 that "the law school belongs in the modern university no more than a school of fencing or dancing."<sup>13</sup><br><br>This thinking slowly changed as legal education moved toward a graduate school model. At the beginning of World War I, only two law schools--at Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania--required undergraduate degrees as a condition of admission.<sup>14</sup> Others began to impose that requirement but essentially provided open enrollment to anyone with a college degree, often failing out a large number of students after admission.<sup>15</sup> Yale led the way toward selectivity by limiting its class size to 100 students in 1926 and, in 1928, becoming the first school to require an aptitude test in addition to a college degree.<sup>16</sup><br><br>Over time law schools became more selective and more academic, and as a result they began to gain greater stature within the university system. Today most universities with law schools proudly point to them as examples of excellence within the university. I think few, if any, quibble about whether law schools belong at a university.<br><br>One reason the debate ended is that, over time, law schools became profit centers for their universities. Because the faculty-student ratio in law school is so much higher than that of most graduate programs and because legal research does not require expensive labs or equipment, law schools cost much less per student than most graduate programs, and they typically produce excess revenues that they share with the university. It is easy to welcome as a member of the university a program that regularly generates revenue for the university. By that monetary measure, law schools have generally been "of real consequence" to their universities for quite some time. However, the recent dramatic decline in law school applications may alter the way universities think about their law schools. As enrollments, and therefore revenues, decrease, some universities now find themselves in the position of subsidizing their law schools. My guess is that the term "of real consequence" may be used in quite a different way in conversations between those law schools and universities today.<br><h2><b>The Law School's Role at BYU</b></h2><br>Fortunately, because of BYU's unique funding model--under which basic funding is provided by our sponsoring Church--tuition does not provide the major source of funds for either the Law School or the university. As a result, the Law School's role at the university has never been defined in financial terms. At BYU we must look for some nonmonetary definition of what it means to be a graduate program of real consequence.<br><br>Key insights into what elements might be included in that definition at BYU come from a speech given by President MarionG. Romney at the dedication of the Law Building in 1975. President Romney was one of the prime movers in the establishment of the BYU Law School. Thus it was appropriate, and instructive, for him to explain, in his words, why he "used such influence as [he] had" to establish the Law School.<sup>17</sup> President Romney gave several reasons, three of which I want to highlight tonight.<br><br>First, he said, "I have long felt that no branch of learning is more important to an individual or to society than law."<br><br>Second, he said, "I further felt that the educational base at Brigham Young University--the flagship of our Church educational system--would be and should be broadened by the establishment of a law school."<br><br>Third, he said, "I likewise felt that the atmosphere of honor, integrity, patriotism, and benevolence prevailing at Brigham Young University would be a good influence upon a law school and its student body."<sup>18</sup><br><br>The latter two reasons seem particularly relevant to my topic because they directly address the relationship between the university and the Law School, so I will begin with those. But, as Iwill explain later, I believe that the first reason also sheds clarifying light on why we could consider this law school a graduate program "of real consequence" at BYU.<br><br>With respect to the second and third reasons identified by President Romney, I note the focus on both the impact the Law School could have on the university and the impact the university could have on the Law School. President Romney seemed to envision a symbiotic relationship in which each entity would be helped by cooperating with the other.<br><br>In the interest of time, I will not describe in much detail the things the university can do to enhance the Law School, but let me point out one thing by way of instruction and advice for the law students here. The language President Romney used to describe the positive impact the university would have on the Law School is interesting. He said it was "<i>the atmosphere</i> of honor, integrity, patriotism, and benevolence prevailing at Brigham Young University [that] would be a good influence upon a law school and its student body."<sup>19</sup> It is the atmosphere--the environment, not some specific university program or service--that would benefit the Law School and its student body.<br><br>I don't know exactly what President Romney had in mind, but when I think about the atmosphere that prevails among the undergraduates at BYU, I picture the thousands of eighteen- to twenty-year-olds in the freshman class I greeted just today. They are extremely optimistic, enthusiastic, and, yes, maybe a little naïve. But they radiate goodness and warmth. And I hope that their optimism and enthusiasm are a bit contagious. The study of law can breed cynicism and pessimism. And although you need to advance beyond the level of the somewhat clueless naïveté that afflicts some of the undergraduates on our campus, I hope you follow Elder Bruce C. Hafen's important admonition to "view things not only with [your] eyes wide open but with [your] hearts wide open as well"<sup>20</sup> and "to be as childlike as [your legal] education has taught [you] to be tough-minded."<sup>21</sup> If you find yourself becoming too jaded, too cynical, and too combative--or if others find you that way--I urge you to wander across the rest of campus or attend a student performance or a devotional and soak in the refreshing and rejuvenating atmosphere that these wonderful undergraduates help create on campus. Your life and the lives of your loved ones will be much better in law school if you do.<br><h3><b><i>Helping the University Accomplish Its Mission</i></b></h3><br>With that observation and invitation, let me now turn to the other part of President Romney's vision: what the Law School can do to help the university accomplish its mission. As I noted, the primary focus of the university is on our undergraduate students. One might think that, as a solely graduate program, the Law School might have little or no impact on that portion of the student body. But that is not the case.<br><br>In his most recent annual report to the university, Dean D. Gordon Smith outlined three ways in which the Law School directly enhances the educational experience of our undergraduates. First, in the past few years Law School faculty members have developed and taught undergraduate classes--such as Brigham Daniels's course on environmental policies and Justin Collings's course on the history and workings of the U.S. Supreme Court.<br><br>Second, some Law School faculty have also responded to the university's emphasis on undergraduate mentoring by involving undergraduates in their research projects. For example, this last year Dean Smith, David H. Moore, and D.Carolina Núñez employed thirteen BYU undergraduates in their Law and Corpus Linguistics Project. Another twenty-four undergraduates provided more than 1,300 hours of volunteer time on that project.<br><br>Third, law faculty have also been increasingly involved in interdisciplinary work with other faculty members on campus. These collaborations are developing into faculty "clusters," which lie somewhere between completely informal and ad hoc collaborations to more formal ongoing research and curriculum projects. Clusters have developed on such topics as law and entrepreneurship--with professors Curtis Anderson, Clark D. Asay, Stephanie P. Bair, A.Christine Hurt, and Matthew Jennejohn as well as Dean Smith joining faculty from the Marriott School of Management--and there is a cluster on opportunity and development in which David Moore, Carolina Núñez, and Michalyn Steele are working with faculty from Political Science and Sociology to address issues involving economic and other development in underserved areas.<br><br>This outreach to undergraduates and undergraduate programs should never become the principal focus of the Law School. The Law School's primary role is, and needs to remain, to provide an excellent legal education to our law students. But these examples demonstrate that the recent changes to the west entrance of the Law School are symbolic of a larger movement connecting the Law School to the rest of the university.<br><br>The Law School has, over the years, also made a disproportionate contribution to university leadership. The thirty-six full-time faculty members at the Law School constitute less than 3percent of the more than 1,400 full-time faculty members at the university. Yet three of the six BYU ­presidents--50 percent--who have served since the Law School opened its doors forty-three years ago have been Law School faculty members. In that same time period, law faculty members have also served in the university administration as provost, associate academic vice president (two of them), assistant to the president, and faculty athletic representatives to the NCAA (again, two of them). Numerous other faculty members have headed up important committees or other endeavors at the university. Kent D. Syverud, the president of Syracuse University and a former law dean at two other law schools, observed that this is because "law school ... is genuinely a group of people who are problem solvers, and [they] can be deployed on problems across the university."<sup>22</sup><br><br>Dean JamesR. Rasband often described a law degree as a degree in leadership.<sup>23</sup> While one may question the quality of the current university leadership, BYU provides ample evidence of the truth of that observation. The Law School has provided extraordinary leadership to the university and will continue to do so.<br><br>The Law School also has a positive impact on the university in a number of other less direct but often equally important ways. To cite one example, one of the great challenges currently encountered by religiously affiliated universities, including BYU, is the dramatic increase in regulations that create pressure for those universities to abandon some of their religious norms in order to accommodate other values. In many cases a religious university's ability to continue to pursue its own distinctive vision of education and life will ultimately depend on the extent to which religious liberty is recognized and enforced as an important legal and cultural norm in American society.<br><br>The Law School again has a disproportionate role in helping the university in that regard. The work of the International Center for Law and Religion Studies has an enormous positive impact on the entire university in that respect, not only because of the influence it has on the development of legal norms throughout the world but also because of the relationships it creates with other scholars and religious liberty advocates, who often become key allies in matters directly affecting the university.<br><br>Less obvious are the contributions made by the Law School itself in dealing with such sensitive issues. For a variety of reasons, the Law School is often the first unit in the university to face the challenges that arise when our religious values conflict with other norms. And the positive and productive way the Law School has handled those matters provides guidance to the university on how to work through such issues. In those endeavors the Law School has also built relationships of trust with external entities and developed expertise that the university can draw on when it faces those same issues.<br><br>There is a good reason why former Law School dean JamesD. Gordon III heads up the accreditation efforts of the university. I daresay that no one on campus has thought as deeply about or had as much experience with such important and sensitive issues as has Jim. That expertise and experience alone would be of enough value to qualify the Law School as a program of real consequence for the university.<br><br>There are other indirect benefits that the Law School provides to the university, some of which are even less obvious. As one example, let me return to President Romney's observation about what impact he hoped the Law School would have on the university.<br><br>The language President Romney used to describe that impact might be a bit surprising to those familiar with the nature of most graduate programs. He indicated that "the educational base" of the university "would be and should be <i>broadened</i> by the establishment of a law school."<sup>24</sup> If asked to describe the purpose of most graduate programs, few academics would use the word <i>broaden.</i> <i>Deepen</i> maybe--but not <i>broaden.</i> Most graduate programs require students to narrow their focus--to become more specialized--so they can study the narrower subject more in depth. There is some truth to the old saying that as one ascends the academic ladder from an associate's degree to bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees, students learn more and more about less and less until they know everything about nothing.<br><br>Yet President Romney chose the word <i>broaden.</i> He may have simply been indicating that by adding another program to the university, the university's educational offerings would be expanded. But I suspect that President Romney, who was very careful in the language he used, intended to convey something more significant than that self-evident truth. I believe he was saying something about a distinctive and extremely valuable aspect of a graduate <i>legal</i> education. Dean Rasband articulately made a similar point in his remarks to entering law students, as recorded in the latest edition of the <i>Clark Memorandum:</i><br><br><i>If you consider the nature of most graduate education, its purpose is to narrow your field of vision and train you as an expert in a particular field, the classic example of which is a dissertation on a narrow subject on which no one else has written. </i><b><i>The study of law, by contrast, is designed to broaden your field of vision and equip you with the tools to make judgments across the full range of human experience.</i></b><sup>25</sup><br><br>Legal education is different from most other graduate programs. It is not a more focused study of topics already covered in the undergraduate years. It is a new way of approaching problems, anew way of thinking about matters, even a new, empathetic way of thinking and feeling about people.<br><br>A graduate program that aims to broaden one's horizons, to start anew after finishing college, contributes to the mission of the university by providing a living reaffirmation of BYU's commitment to lifelong learning--learning not just in a particular topic but on every topic.<br><br>And at BYU that kind of lifelong learning is especially important. In describing the broad general education we hope to provide our undergraduate students, the mission statement contains an important introductory phrase explaining the reason why a broad education is important to us. It reads, "<i>Because the gospel encourages the pursuit of all truth,</i> students at BYU should receive a broad university education."<sup>26</sup> We don't provide a broad general education for our students just so they can be well versed enough to be interesting company at dinner parties and receptions. Our educational goals go well beyond that. We are helping prepare students for a postmortal life in which they can know all things.<br><br>Having a graduate school that focuses on broadening rather than narrowing things provides a powerful reinforcement of that message. It makes clear that the broadening form of learning that is at the heart of our general education requirements should not, and does not, end with the receipt of a bachelor's degree but extends into one of our most visible graduate programs and even beyond that.<br><br>That more amorphous but potentially longer-lasting contribution of the Law School to the university's mission underscores another significant role the Law School can play in helping the university achieve its main goal--the goal of assisting "individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life."<br><h3><b><i>Assisting in the Quest for Perfection and EternalLife</i></b></h3><br>In the long run, our primary purpose as a ­university is to help our students acquire the knowledge, attributes, and character that will enable them to realize their full potential as "a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents" with "a divine nature and destiny."<sup>27</sup> We do not provide all they need to attain that lofty status. Ultimately, the full realization of that goal requires adherence to the key principles of the plan of salvation, including receiving saving ordinances, making and keeping sacred covenants, and adhering to the other commandments that God has given us. Most of all it is dependent on our accessing the enabling, sanctifying, and transforming powers that Christ makes available to us through His great atoning sacrifice.<br><br>The university cannot accomplish those things, but I believe there is still a role for it to play in that celestializing process for all our students, including law students. We are to "provide a period of intensive learning,"<sup>28</sup> not just in abstract principles of temporal knowledge but also in actual character and skill development.<br><br>Earlier in my life I believe I had misconceived the full purpose of our mortal experience. In my undergraduate years I thought of life as a longer version of an academic course--"Earth 101," if you will. The primary purpose of the course was to learn enough from life's experience to pass the final exam. And once that happened--once we graduated to the next level of our existence--we could forget what we had learned in this life, just as I quickly forgot much of what I had learned while cramming for a test once the final was over.<br><br>Over the years I have come to appreciate that God effectively and efficiently uses this mortal period of our existence not just to test our ability to survive in this fallen world with all its challenges but also to help us develop the skills and attributes that will enable us to realize our full potential in the next life--to develop what I have come to call celestial skills and attributes, those characteristics that celestial beings possess.<br><br>Most of those characteristics are developed by adherence to the commandments with which we are all familiar. But I believe that God in His economy also provides us with opportunities to develop celestial skills in our day-to-day lives and that skills we might think are valuable only in helping us succeed in our temporal affairs are actually celestial skills that we will use in the next life. To use one example, I believe that the ability to counsel with councils is a skill set that will not only help us in our temporal affairs in this mortal existence but is one that we will continue to use--and will need to perfect--if we are to be exalted.<br><br>I suggest that some of the skills we learn and develop in law school may be celestial skills. As I mentioned, the skill of lifelong learning is not just an aid in making ourselves interesting and interested through our retirement years. It is a celestial skill that we will need to acquire if we are to be like God. I don't think Brigham Young was exaggerating when he said, "When shall we cease to learn? I will give you my opinion about it: never, never."<sup>29</sup> Brigham Young also observed, "We do not expect to cease learning while we live on earth; and when we pass through the veil, we expect still to continue to learn and increase our fund of information."<sup>30</sup> Lifelong learning, an attribute law school helps us develop, is--in my view--a celestial attribute.<br><br>I think there are other celestial skills law school can help us develop. For example, it seems to me that the ability to frame and use questions--a skill widely practiced and modeled in law school--is a skill we may readily employ in the next life. Elder MarlinK. Jensen eloquently explained this in a Law School graduation speech a few years ago:<br><br><i>The use of ... interrogatories by a loving and wise Heavenly Father guides us. The technique enables him to raise relevant issues, to encourage our thoughtful analysis of them, and then to leave us to the exercise of our agency to act. It sounds almost lawyerlike; but Iwould prefer to describe the process as godlike.</i><sup>31</sup><br><br>Similarly, legal education should enhance our ability to empathize with others, to see things from their vantage point, and to understand more fully how they think and feel. Those are skills that help lawyers in the practice of law, but they are also skills that have eternal significance. Let me share what Iobserved in a different setting:<br><br><i>While the traditional study of law emphasizes the utilitarian importance of tolerating the views and differences of others, the laws of God require it as a manifestation of our love for God and His children.</i><sup>32</sup><br><br>The development of empathetic thinking and feeling that a legal education can promote may contribute to the development of our ability to love as the Savior loves and to truly possess charity, a central and essential celestial attribute.<sup>33</sup><br><br>My guess is that there are other celestial skills that this law school can help you develop. That may be one of the many meanings behind President Romney's assertion that "no branch of learning is more important to an individual or to society than law."<sup>34</sup> If we follow President Romney's challenge to learn the laws of man "in the light of the 'laws of God,'"<sup>35</sup> we might discover that there is more glorifying light in a legal education than we may have supposed.<br><br>And so I end where I began, with the university mission statement. Let me suggest that, contrary to what I might have implied or expressed earlier, that document has more application to the Law School and the Law School experience than may appear at first glance. Even though graduate programs are not its main focus, the key components of the mission statement--especially our desire to "provide a period of intensive learning" to assist students "in their quest for perfection and eternal life"--are fully applicable to all BYU students, including--and maybe especially--BYU law students. In that, if in no other way, the Law School provides a graduate experience of real consequence.<br><br>We may not know all the ways in which the Law School contributes to that mission, but I am confident that just as the Lord is "well pleased that there ... be a school in Zion,"<sup>36</sup> He is well pleased that there be a law school in that school. I firmly believe that in the process of time we will come to view with greater appreciation--and maybe even reverence--the role the Law School plays both in influencing a world we wish to improve and in preparing souls for the world to come. May it be so is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Kevin J Worthen, president of Brigham Young University, delivered this J.Reuben Clark Law School Founders Day address on 1September 2016.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. <i>The Mission of Brigham Young University</i> and <i>The Aims of a BYU Education</i> (Provo: BYU, 2014), 1.<br><br>2.

<h1>ip: You Can Choose to Be a Leader - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
BYU is a wonderful place because it has ­wonderful students. I hope you all realize how much potential you have. You are all future leaders. You will lead in the Church, you will lead in businesses, you will lead in communities, you will lead in volunteer efforts, and, most important, you will lead in your families. One of the things Ihope you learn here is how to be better leaders. Ifyou do, you will be an enormous force for good.<br><br>I would like to share with you some things I have learned about leadership over the years, things I wish I had known about leadership when I was your age. I begin with a personal ­experience--one that provides several lessons about leadership.<br><br>From the time we were first married, Kevin and I have gone to visit my parents at their cabin in the mountains about seventy-five miles south of Provo. A number of years ago, while we were preparing to come home after one of those visits, my then young son needed to get something out of our locked car, so I gave him the keys and told him tobe careful to not lock the keys in the car.<br><br>A few minutes later he returned, looking a little sheepish. He then hesitantly, but bravely, confessed that he had locked the keys in the car. What ensued was one of those moments that my children still refer to many years later: "Do you remember what mom did when the keys were locked in the car?"<br><br>Yes, upon hearing the brave confession of my young son, I responded in a way that corresponded more to his age than to mine. I threw a tantrum. I raised my voice, and I even kicked the car tire. I let my emotions take over. Fortunately that lasted only a few moments. My father calmly reminded me that I had roadside assistance insurance for times like this. His calm reminder instantly calmed me. I called roadside assistance, and we were soon on our way home.<br><br>Now you might wonder what lessons could possibly come from an experience like that. Let me suggest four.<br><h2><b>Learn from Your Mistakes</b></h2><br>First, I learned that we can learn from our mistakes. I immediately regretted the way I had behaved that day. I reflected on the fact that, as a mother, I was a leader and a teacher to my children. And I resolved to do better. That experience had a powerful impact on me. While I am not perfect, I think I am doing better in that regard. Fortunately, as Elder Bruce C. Hafen once observed, "Because of the Atonement, we can learn from our experiences without being condemned by them" ("The Temple and the Natural Order of Marriage," <i>Ensign,</i> September 2015). That is a powerful lesson for leaders to learn.<br><h2><b>Learn from the Examples of Others</b></h2><br>Second, I learned that we can learn from the good example of others. My father's calm reaction to my outburst quickly and powerfully reminded me how I should act in those situations. Although I already knew how I should act, seeing his example provided me with a distinct reminder that has guided me throughout the rest of my life.<br><br>It is also important to note that such examples don't always come from those who are more experienced.<br><br>I went to BYU as a nontraditional student--returning to school after our youngest child began elementary school--so I was often the oldest student in the class. A few years after I had returned, I attended a class in which there were only a handful of students. Toward the end of the semester I had become well acquainted with the other students.<br><br>One day before class began, I was visiting with a classmate who was seated in the aisle next to me. While we were visiting, a young man--who also attended the class--walked into the room and started to yell at my classmate. The young man was obviously very angry. I didn't know what had happened between them. However, I was shocked that this was happening at all. I wasn't sure what to do. I even wondered if I should go get security.<br><br>While I was surprised at the original confrontation, what happened next was even more surprising. My classmate, whom I had been talking to, stood up to face the young man. I thought, "Oh no, a fight."<br><br>Just then my classmate quietly and calmly said, "I am sorry that I have upset you. What can I do to make this right?"<br><br>I remember sitting back in my seat thinking that that response was probably one of the most mature things I had ever witnessed. The young man suddenly stopped--as if all the wind had just been knocked out of him. They both sat down in their seats. The two of them began to have a very calm discussion, and that was the end of what could have been a very explosive situation.<br><br>My classmate had totally defused the situation with a quick, quiet, and calm response. Not only did he remain calm, but he responded with the "soft answer" that Proverbs teaches us will turn "away wrath" (Proverbs 15:1). What a powerful example.<br><h2><b>Choose Your Response</b></h2><br>Third, as I thought about that experience and contrasted it with my own less-than-ideal response to my son having locked the keys in the car, I realized another important lesson for leaders. The lesson is that in every situation--even those that are packed with high emotion--we all have our agency to choose how to act.<br><br>Someone observed that "between stimulus and response, there is a space. In that space lies our freedom and power to choose our response" (unknown author quoted by Stephen R. Covey, <i>Living the 7 Habits: Stories of Courage and Inspiration</i> [New York: Simon and Schuster, 1999], 21; see foreword by Covey in Alex Pattakos, <i>Prisoners of Our Thoughts: Viktor Frankl's Principles for Discovering Meaning in Life and Work,</i> 2nd ed., rev. [San Francisco: Berrett-Koehler, 2010], vi). In other words, there is always a space, or an instant, in which we decide whether we will put out the fire or ignite the fuse.<br><br>Elder L. Tom Perry once taught this lesson by telling the story of a young missionary on his first day in Brazil:<br><br><i>He and his senior companion were assigned to open a new city some distance from the mission headquarters. As they arrived in this new city and walked down the street, they passed a church with a minister standing at the front door. As they walked by the church, the minister went in and called to his whole congregation to follow him out into the street. There they followed the missionaries and started calling them names; then they became more violent and started to throw rocks at them.</i><br><br><i>The young elder was excited about this experience--his first day in the mission field and already he was being stoned, he thought. Then, a big rock suddenly hit him squarely in the middle of the back, and his feeling changed to anger. Before entering the mission field he had been quite a baseball pitcher; and in the flush of anger he wheeled around, grabbed the first rock he could find on the ground, reared back in his famous pitching pose, and </i>[was]<i> just ready to let the rock fly at the crowd when suddenly he realized why he was there. He had not been sent all the way to Brazil to throw rocks at people; he was there to teach them the gospel. But what was he to do with the rock in his hand? If he dropped it to the ground, they would think it a sign of weakness and probably continue to throw rocks at them. Yet he could not throw it at the crowd. Then he saw a telephone post some distance away. That was the way to save face! He reared back and let the rock fly directly at the telephone post, hitting it squarely in the middle.</i><br><br><i>The people in the crowd took a couple of steps back. They suddenly realized that that rock probably could have hit any one of them right between the eyes. Their mood changed; instead of throwing rocks at the missionaries, they began to throw them at the telephone post. After this incident, every time the elder went down that street he was challenged to a rock-throwing contest. The rock-throwing contests led to discussions of the gospel, which led to conversions, which led to the establishment of a branch of the Church in that community.</i> [L. Tom Perry, "Prophecies, Visions, and Dreams," BYU fireside address, 7 January 1979]<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>No matter how high our emotions or how acute the crisis, there is always a space in which we can choose how to act. And in that choice, great leaders are made.<br><h2><b>Set a Peaceful Tone</b></h2><br>Fourth, I learned from my experience that how a leader acts in those important moments sets the tone for those around them. My father's calm response immediately calmed me down, just as my young student friend's remarkably tranquil response calmed down his fellow student. On the other hand, my less-than-calm response served merely to upset my children.<br><br>Mosiah 20 provides us an example of how two different leaders set the tone for those within their stewardship with two different responses during a crisis. When the daughters of the Lamanites were captured by the priests of King Noah, the king of the Lamanites assumed that the people of King Limhi were the captors. Based on this assumption, the king of the Lamanites with his armies attacked the people of King Limhi without first verifying what had really happened to their daughters.<br><br>During the attack, the Lamanite king was wounded and left for dead by the Lamanites. The people of King Limhi brought the wounded Lamanite king before King Limhi and demanded that the king of the Lamanites should be slain. Instead of giving into the demands of his people, King Limhi told them not to slay the Lamanite king. Instead, King Limhi simply asked the Lamanite king why the Lamanites had waged war against them.<br><br>The king of the Lamanites replied, "Because thy people did carry away the daughters of my people; therefore, in my anger I did cause my people to come up to war against thy people" (Mosiah 20:15). Through this conversation the two nations were able to reconcile--albeit temporarily--and end the war.<br><br>It was in anger that the king of the Lamanites had attacked the people of King Limhi, choosing to ignite the flame. His choice to do so cost the lives of many of his followers and others. By contrast, King Limhi's choice to put out the fire returned peace to the land and to the souls of those he led.<br><br>I am grateful for all the wonderful examples of leadership I have in my life. It is my hope that as you obtain your formal education here at BYU, you too will strive to learn from your mistakes and from the examples of others and as future leaders choose to set a peaceful tone for those around you--especially in times of crisis. As you do so, I am confident that you will obtain those qualities that will help you to be true leaders and become an enormous force for good. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Peggy S.

<h1>t of the Y - Kevin J Worthen - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Welcome to the start of a new semester. We are so glad to have you students here on campus. Our community comes alive in a new way because you are here.<br><br>Most of our new students arrived two weeks ago. Many of them participated in what is now becoming a tradition: forming the Y at LaVell Edwards Stadium. This is a wonderful and symbolic reminder that you, the students, are the Y--meaning that you are both the reason why we exist as a university and, for those with whom you interact, the embodiment of what BYU stands for. You represent the Y wherever you go. I love this recent tradition.<br><br>There is another BYU tradition, one that began long before any of you were born. In 1924, students hiked up to the block Y on Y Mountain, dipped mattress stuffing in oil, placed the mattress balls around the edges of the Y, and lit them with torches they had carried up the ­mountain--thus lighting the Y for the very first time. Since that time the Y has been lighted every year for Homecoming, graduation, and other special events. Fortunately the torch fires never spread to the rest of the mountain in the ensuing decades.<br><br>By the 1980s, those involved decided not to tempt fate any longer, and the mattress balls and torches were replaced with a generator and a string of lightbulbs stretched around the Y, making the Y brilliantly visible throughout the valley. This past summer, permanent lighting was literally cemented in place, and new technology was installed to allow remote lighting, thereby ensuring that the tradition of lighting the Y will continue for years to come.<br><br>Just as I hope that the more recent tradition of forming the Y in LaVell Edwards Stadium reminds you that you are the Y, I hope that the continuation of the long-standing tradition of lighting the Y reminds you of an invitation that I will give to each of you students today: Don't just light the Y; let the Y light you.<br><br>What do I mean by that? Perhaps it can best be explained by a familiar story told by President JamesE. Faust. In the 1980s, prior to his becoming a member of the First Presidency, President Faust worked alongside many others to establish the BYU Jerusalem Center. In a 2005 general conference address, President Faust recalled one historic meeting<br><br><i>regarding the lease for the land on which the ... Jerusalem Center ... was later built. Before this lease could be signed, President Ezra Taft Benson and Elder JeffreyR. Holland, then president of Brigham Young University, agreed with the Israeli government on behalf of the Church and the university not to proselyte in Israel.</i><br><br>President Faust then said:<br><br><i>To our knowledge the Church and BYU have scrupulously and honorably kept that nonproselyting commitment. After the lease had been signed,</i> [however,] <i>one of our</i> [Israeli] <i>friends insightfully remarked, "Oh, we know that you are not going to proselyte, but what are you going to do about the light that is in their eyes?" He was referring to our students who were studying inIsrael.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>In other words, he was referring to you.<br><br>More than you may recognize, you carry with you a light--a light that others notice. You brought much of that light with you to BYU, thanks to your parents, your friends, your teachers, and the good choices you have made in your life up until now. My invitation to you today is that you <i>enhance</i> that light during your experience at BYU--or, more precisely, that you enhance that light <i>because</i> of your experience at BYU. My­invitation isfor you tolet the Y light you.<br><h2><b>Let the Y Light You</b></h2><br>How can you do that? Let me provide four suggestions, confident that if you apply them, you will receive further individualized insights through personal revelation.<br><h3><b><i>Recognize the Source and the Purpose of the Light</i></b></h3><br>First, and most important, you need to recognize the source of the light and the purpose for which it is given to you. The Lord clearly identified the source of the light in the revelation recorded in Doctrine and Covenants 93:2, saying, "I am the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world."<br><br>In the words of Doctrine and Covenants 88:13, the Lord is "the light which is in all things, which giveth life to all things," including what President Faust described as the light that "shows in our countenances as well as in our eyes."<sup>2</sup> The more our thoughts and actions align with the Lord's, the more we serve and love others as He does, the more His light will shine in us. If we take time each day to reflect on what Christ would have us do, He will use our experiences at BYU to enhance that light in us.<br><br>The reason the Lord provides that light to you is not just to help you but also to help you help others. In the Sermon on the Mount, Christ said, "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven" (Matthew 5:16). Gaining light by your experiences at BYU will help you progress eternally and bring you peace and joy in this life. However, being lighted by the Y is not a selfish endeavor. The light is not given to you for your glory. It is given to help others, as they come to see the Lord through your actions. In the words ofElder NealA. Maxwell:<br><br><i>Brigham Young University seeks to improve and ­"sanctify" itself for the sake of others--not for the praiseof the world, but to serve the world better.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>When you accomplish something significant at BYU--which I hope happens often--think first of how what you have done can <i>help</i> others, not just how it might impress them. Maybe instead of bragging to your classmates about how well you did on an exam, you might humbly find ways to help <i>them</i> prepare for the next exam. If you do, you will increase their and your understanding of the subject. You will also increase their faith and your faith in the goodness of God and of His children. At the end of the day, Christ is the light that we are to "hold up--that which [we] have seen [Him] do" (3 Nephi 18:24). "How would Jesus react to doing well--or poorly--on an exam?" is a great question to ask ourselves if we want to be lighted by the Y.<br><h3><b><i>Live in a Way That Reflects His Life</i></b></h3><br>The second suggestion flows from the first. As we recognize that Christ is the true source of the light and as we remember that He desires His light to shine through us so that others may come unto Him, we can easily see that one way to increase the extent to which our experience at BYU lights us is by living our lives in a way that reflects His.<br><br>Our mission statement challenges us to create "an environment ... sustained by those moral virtues which characterize the life and teachings of the Son of God."<sup>4</sup> That is one of the principal reasons for our Honor Code: to create an environment in which we are reminded of the kind of individuals and community we hope to become--a community reflecting the teachings of the Savior. In that regard, I call particular attention to our personal and collective commitment to treat with respect, dignity, and love all those with whom we interact, both on and off campus, including, and especially, those with whom we may disagree, even on very important matters.<br><br>While others, perhaps well intentioned, may deride us and our values, we must respond the way the Savior did, without compromising either eternal truths and values or the eternal reality that "all human beings [are] beloved spirit son[s] or daughter[s] of heavenly parents," each with "a divine nature and destiny."<sup>5</sup> Our mission statement makes clear that "all relationships within the BYU community should reflect devout love of God and a loving, genuine concern for the welfare of our neighbor."<sup>6</sup> The light of the Y will be most evident in your lives if you live in accordance with that charge and with all the other principles of the Honor Code to which you have committed your integrity.<br><br>There are other daily activities--not expressly included in the Honor Code--that can enhance the light of the Y in your lives. Regular scripture study is one example. I was reminded of that truth by one of our football players a number of years ago.<br><br>Brian Logan transferred to BYU in 2009 after two years at a junior college. I first met him shortly before the opening game of the season against then third-ranked Oklahoma. I quickly discovered that Brian was a person who was full of enthusiasm, energy, and a love of God. Though not a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Brian fully embraced the opportunity to be a part of our covenant community and sought to influence others for good in that regard. He was also a very good defensive back.<br><br>Let me show you a picture of Brian after the Oklahoma game--which BYU won. You can see what I mean about enthusiasm. Like you, I noticed that there was a message written on the eye black beneath his eyes. It was Philippians 4:13. I must admit I did not know off the top of my head what that scripture said, and in the excitement of the victory I did not have a chance to ask Brian. Later that night I looked up the scripture. It reads, "I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me." I imagined in my own mind how this scripture provided Brian with optimism in preparing for a game in which BYU was the decided underdog.<br><br>As I attended the next game, I saw that Brian had again applied the eye black and that there was writing on it. I was at such a distance that I couldn't read the writing. After the game--a resounding victory over an opponent we were expected to defeat--I approached Brian, fully expecting that I would find the same scriptural reference on the eye black and assuming that it was his favorite. Much to my surprise, the writing referred to a different scripture: Luke 14:11. Again, not knowing right off what that particular scripture said, I asked Brian.<br><br>He quickly replied, "For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted."<br><br>I then asked him why he had changed the scripture reference. He told me that as he read the scriptures each day, he sought inspiration about what message God wanted him to focus on for the game that week. Against a highly ranked opponent the first week, it was the message of courage in Philippians 4:13; against an opponent that some players might be tempted to overlook the following week, it was the message of humility found in Luke.<br><br>For the rest of that season I looked forward to my postgame interaction with Brian. I would grab him by the shoulder pads, look him straight on, and say, "Let me read your eyes!" In the ­ensuing weeks I saw references to Proverbs 3:5, Isaiah 54:17, and other relevant scriptures, each reflecting personal inspiration that Brian had experienced as a result of his regular Bible study. For one game he even threw in a Book of Mormon scripture--maybe just for my sake.<br><br>I am confident that many of you have had similar revelatory experiences as you have regularly studied the scriptures in light of your own personal circumstances. I invite all of you to do so. If you do, it will be reflected in your eyes, even if it is not written on eye black.<br><br>I also urge you to engage in other activities that will invite the Spirit in your life, such as involvement in service opportunities through your ward or other organizations such as Y-Serve. As you seek to contribute to an environment that reflects those virtues that characterize the life and teachings of the Savior, your BYU experiences will ­create new light in you.<br><h3><b><i>Discover and Develop Your Talents and Skills</i></b></h3><br>Third, I urge you to discover and develop your talents and skills at BYU. This is one of the main purposes of this distinctive portion of your earth life. Your time at BYU is, as the mission statement says, to be "a period of intensive learning."<sup>7</sup> Such focused learning is designed, in large part, to help you acquire and enhance new knowledge, skills, and attributes.<br><br>All of you have already discovered and refined many of your talents and gifts. You would not be here if you had not. Let me suggest, however, that the Lord sent you here--to BYU--knowing that you could both discover new gifts and enhance those you already know about.<br><br>In the Book of Mormon in the sermon at the temple--in which Christ in His visit to the Americas repeated many of the teachings He had provided in the Sermon on the Mount to those in the Old World--the Savior repeated the essence of the commandment in Matthew that we are to be a light to the world. However, as my son recently pointed out to me, there is a slight but significant clarification in the message in the Book of Mormon.<br><br>In Matthew 5:14 the Lord stated simply, "Ye are the light of the world."<br><br>In 3Nephi 12:14 the Lord said, "I give unto you to be the light of this people."<br><br>This sounds more like a gift--more like an opportunity than a commandment. Like all divinely provided opportunities, it implies confidence in our abilities. God often gives us opportunities because He knows He has prepared us in ways we may not fully recognize or appreciate at the time.<br><br>In that regard, the language the Savior used in 3Nephi--"I give unto you"--is instructively similar to that in the Doctrine and Covenants when the Lord stated that "to every man [and woman] <i>is given</i> a gift by the Spirit of God. To some <i>is given</i> one, and to some <i>is given</i> another, that all may be profited thereby" (D&amp;amp;C 46:11–12; emphasis added).<br><br>God has given each of you individualized gifts to prepare you to contribute to His work in individual ways. God has given other people other individualized gifts so that they can contribute in their own individual ways. When you apply these truths to this educational phase of your life, two things become apparent.<br><br>1. You should search broadly to discover and develop all the gifts God has given you, lest you not accomplish all God wants you to do. We know from the scriptural promise in section 46 of the Doctrine and Covenants that all of you have at least one gift, and I am confident that for all of you the number can be multiplied many times. I am also confident that you don't know all the talents you have. And the only way you can know what those talents are is to explore a variety of topics--which our general education requirement encourages you to do--and to take some chances in doing new things that may stretch you in new ways. Don't become so concerned with protecting your GPA that you miss out on one of the most exciting parts of your education: discovering and enhancing the gifts God gave you so that you can better serve Him and His children.<br><br>2. Because your gifts are individually tailored to you, don't measure your progress or importance by comparing yourself to others. Such comparisons will not only cause you to miss out on some of the important things you can learn from others but also interfere with your ability to develop productive, joyful relationships with the many good people around you. If you view everyone as a potential competitor, you will soon find yourself surrounded by enemies. If you view those around you as guides who can help you learn, you will soon find yourself surrounded by friends.<br><h3><b><i>Never Underestimate the Power Your Light CanHave</i></b></h3><br>Fourth, and finally, never underestimate the power your light can have on others. Let me illustrate this with a reference to a lighthouse. All of us are familiar with lighthouses. They send out a beacon of light that can hopefully be seen in the worst weather. They mark the line where the sea ends and the land begins--a very important marker for those who are piloting boats, especially in bad weather.<br><br>But lighthouses also have another role to play for those who are piloting boats. In addition to marking the place at which the sea ends and the land begins, lighthouses can, with the help of other lights, guide sailors through treacherous waters in which reefs and other unseen barriers might sink the ship. In such situations there is often only one safe passage to the harbor, and the only way the pilot knows the ship is in that passage is by maneuvering the ship so that the light at the top of the lighthouse aligns with a carefully placed light on the shore. Once the ship is in that position, it can proceed safely as long as those lights--the one in the lighthouse and the one on the shore--are in alignment with each other. If they are out of alignment, the ship is off course, and there is considerable risk of a tragic shipwreck.<br><br>One writer related the following true example:<br><br><i>More than a hundred years ago, a well-known Protestant preacher, Dwight L. Moody, shared a story of a ship trying to enter the Cleveland harbor on a very stormy night.</i><br><br><i>The ship's captain could see the bright light of the Cleveland harbor lighthouse. However, the lower lights weren't visible at all. The lower lights were the way that ships identified the centerline of the safe entry to a harbor.</i><br><br><i>Because the lower lights were not burning that night, the ship missed the entrance to the harbor and crashed into rocks. Many lives were lost.</i><br><br><i>At the end of his sermon, Moody said, "Brethren, the Master will take care of the great lighthouse; let us keep the lower lights burning."</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>One of the members of Moody's congregation that day was a man named Philip Paul Bliss, a musician. Bliss was so inspired by the lesson in Moody's sermon that he wrote a hymn, which in our hymnbook is entitled "Brightly Beams Our Father's Mercy." Many of you will be familiar with the hymn. All of you should be. With the image of the lighthouse and this experience in mind, consider the message of the first verse of that hymn:<br><br><i>Brightly beams our Father's mercy</i><br><i>From his lighthouse evermore,</i><br><i>But to </i><b><i>us</i></b><i> he gives the keeping</i><br><i>Of the lights along the shore.</i><br><br><i>Let the lower lights be burning;</i><br><i>Send a gleam across the wave.</i><br><i>Some poor fainting, struggling seaman</i><br><i>You may rescue, you may save.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>The lighthouse of God's love for His children is ever present and never moving. It is constant and always available. Some people will see it and will be drawn to it, but they may not know how to get to it. Your example may provide the lower light they need to see the safe passage. More may depend on how you use your time at BYU than just your own well-being. The light you gain here may influence others for eternity.<br><br>There is a remarkable promise in Doctrine and Covenants 88:67, a promise Elder Dallin H. Oaks once called "the most significant promise ever given pertaining to education."<sup>10</sup> It reads:<br><br><i>And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things.</i><br><br>I urge you to let the Y light you in such a way that you are filled with that light. You will then be successful not only in this particular educational endeavor but also in the rest of your life.<br><br>As I recently told the faculty and staff, and as I also recently told those at new student orientation, I now say to you all: You are not here by accident. God has a work to perform through you. Make Him the center of your efforts. Do what He would want you to do. Let His light shine more brightly through you as a result of your experiences at BYU. If you do, miracles will happen in your life and you will see the majesty of the Lord work in the lives of others. May you realize this ­blessing--may the light in you shine more brilliantly because of what you do at BYU--is my prayer, inthe name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Kevin J Worthen, president of Brigham Young University, delivered this devotional address on 6September 2016.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1>s, Hope, and Religious Freedom - Dallin H. Oaks - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am pleased for the opportunity to speak at this BYU devotional. The first BYU devotional I addressed was exactly forty-five years ago, in 1971. That audience included my oldest <i>daughter,</i> just enrolling as a freshman here. Many years later I spoke at this devotional assembly to an audience that included several of my <i>grandchildren.</i> Today this audience includes our oldest <i>great-granddaughter,</i> a­sophomore here. Time goes on.<br><br><b>I.</b><br><br>This opportunity comes at a unique time. I am the only General Authority assigned to address this BYU audience between the beginning of school this fall and the election on November8. And this audience includes thousands who will soon have their first opportunity to vote. I, therefore, begin by speaking about our national and local elections.<br><br>The few months preceding an election have always been times of serious political divisions, but the divisions and meanness we are experiencing in this election, especially at the presidential level, seem to be unusually wide and ugly. Partly this results from modern technology, which expands the audience for conflicts and the speed of dissemination. Today, dubious charges, misrepresentations, and ugly innuendos are instantly flashed around the world, and the effects instantly widen and intensify the gaps between different positions. TV, the Internet, and the emboldened anonymity of the blogosphere have facilitated the current ugliness and have replaced whatever remained of the measured discourse of the past. Nevertheless, as the First Presidency always reminds us, we have the responsibility to become informed about the issues and candidates and to independently exercise our right to vote. Voters, remember, this applies to candidates for the many important local and state offices as well as the contested presidential election.<br><br><b>II.</b><br><br>We should also remember not to be part of the current meanness. We should communicate about our differences with a minimum of offense. Remember this teaching of the Prophet Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>While one portion of the human race</i> [is] <i>judging and condemning the other without mercy, the great parent of the universe looks upon the whole of the human family with a fatherly care and paternal regard; he views them as his offspring, and without any of those contracted feelings that influence the children of men.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>I spoke about this subject two years ago in an October general conference talk titled "Loving Others and Living with Differences." My message focused on doctrine and its application to the differences we face in our diverse circumstances in Church and family and in public, but the principles I taught are also relevant to political differences. I said:<br><br><i>We are to live </i><b><i>in</i></b><i> the world but not be </i><b><i>of</i></b><i> the world. We must live in the world because, as Jesus taught in a parable, His kingdom is "like leaven," whose function is to raise the whole mass by its influence (see Luke 13:21; Matthew 13:33; see also 1Corinthians 5:6–8). His followers cannot do that if they associate only with those who share their beliefs and practices. ...</i><br><br>[The Lord also taught that] <b><i>"he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another"</i></b> [3Nephi 11:29]<i>. ...</i><br><br><i>Even as we seek to ... avoid contention, we must not compromise or dilute our commitment to the truths we understand. We must not surrender our positions or our values. ...</i><br><br>[In] <i>public discourse, we should all follow the gospel teachings to love our neighbor and avoid contention. Followers of Christ should be examples of civility. We should love all people, be good listeners, and show ­concern for their sincere beliefs.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>Today, I say that if the Church or its doctrines are attacked in blogs and other social media, contentious responses are not helpful. They disappoint our friends and provoke our adversaries.<br><br>Finally, as I said two years ago:<br><br><i> When our positions do not prevail, we should accept unfavorable results graciously and practice civility with our adversaries.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br><b>III.</b><br><br>In the distressing circumstances that surround us, we must trust in God and His promises and hold fast to the vital gospel teaching of hope. The prophet Nephi taught that we must "press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men" (2 Nephi 31:20). Later, the apostle Paul told the Corinthians:<br><br><i>We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; weare perplexed, but not in despair;</i><br><br><i>Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed.</i> [2Corinthians 4:8–9]<br><br>When we trust in the Lord that all will work out, this hope keeps us moving. Hope is a characteristic Christian virtue. I am glad to practice it and to recommend it to counter all current despairs.<br><br>Hope based on trust in the Lord and His promises has sustained me through all the circumstances of my life. For example, when I approached my first enrollment at BYU, sixty-six years ago, the Korean War had just begun. I had just celebrated my eighteenth birthday, and my Utah National Guard field artillery group had just been alerted to join the war in Korea. Two of our battalions had already been mobilized and sent to training locations in the United States. Only the group headquarters here in Provo, to which I belonged, had not yet received its mobilization orders. We were expecting to be sent any day.<br><br>As we waited, it came time for freshmen to enroll for the fall quarter at BYU. What should Ido? I decided to enroll, pay tuition, start school, and trust in the Lord for whatever happened. If my unit was mobilized, I would leave. If not, Iwould at least be proceeding forward with my education. Incidentally, the total enrollment at BYU that quarter was only 4,500 students<sup>4</sup> and the tuition and fees were only $45.<sup>5</sup> As it turned out, our small headquarters group was never mobilized, so I continued and completed my formal education.<br><br>Every generation has challenges that can cause discouragement in those without hope. The future is always clouded with ­uncertainties--wars and depressions being only two examples. While some abandon progress, you of faith should hope on and press on with your education, your lives, and your families.<br><br>Some years ago President Thomas S. Monson gave this valuable counsel:<br><br><i>My brothers and sisters, today, as we look at the world around us, we are faced with problems which are serious and of great concern to us. ...</i><br><br><i>My counsel for all of us is to look to the lighthouse of the Lord. There is no fog so dense, no night so dark, no gale so strong, no mariner so lost but what its beacon light can rescue. It beckons through the storms of life. The lighthouse of the Lord sends forth signals readily recognized and never failing.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>Those words comfort me as I view the terrible conflicts in today's world and the extreme moral and policy divisions that separate different citizens and different aspiring leaders. We all should rely on this assurance in modern revelation: "Fear not, little flock; do good; let earth and hell combine against you, for if ye are built upon my rock, they cannot prevail" (D&amp;amp;C 6:34).<br><br>With faith and hope, and with God's help, we will prevail against our challenges. As Elder Kim B. Clark told your teachers and ­leaders a few weeks ago, BYU and its values are under attack. We are all being asked to do hard things, for which we need "greater faith in the Lord Jesus Christ," who "will open doors that are closed. He will inspire and guide and provide. He is in charge."<sup>7</sup><br><br><b>IV.</b><br><br>I now speak of one of the challenges that face us: the meaning and application of the vital constitutional guarantees that government authority shall make no laws or regulations "abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble."<sup>8</sup> Those rights are fundamental to our constitutional order--not just to protect citizens against repressive government action but also to foster the cherished open society that is the source of our freedom and prosperity. Beyond that, the free exercise of religion is vital because it insures citizens the rights of worship and action that are fundamental to their being.<br><br>For many years I have paid close attention to the social and legal trends that are likely to affect the fundamental guarantees that are so vital to fulfill our Church's mission and to accomplish BYU's educational mission. I am convinced that a worldwide tide is currently running against both religious freedom and its parallel freedoms of speech and assembly.<sup>9</sup><br><br>I believe religious freedom is declining because faith in God and the pursuit of God-centered religion is declining--worldwide. If one does not value religion, one usually does not put a high value on religious freedom. It is looked at as just another human right, competing with other human rights when it seems to collide with them. I believe the freedoms of speech and assembly are also weakening because many influential persons see them as colliding with competing values now deemed more important. Some extremists have even opposed free speech as an obstacle to achieving their policy goals.<br><br><b>V.</b><br><br>In our current cultural and political atmosphere, we are distressed to see official and private infringements on free speech, free association, and the free exercise of religion that pose threats to our free and open society. While a political party in power at the federal or state level has greater potential to sponsor official threats, such threats can also be made by others.<br><br>Most of the examples I will give are in higher education, but comparable examples could be given in the broader society, including the media, the arts, business, politics, and other areas of culture. I have chosen to concentrate on higher education, since these examples are most appropriate for discussion with a university audience at BYU. Free speech has always been highly valued in education, but open inquiry and communication are currently being replaced on too many campuses by a culture of intellectual conformity and the silencing or intimidation of opposition. This culture even includes formal or informal punishment of those with political views not currently in favor.<br><br>As I provide my list of examples, I invite you to augment or challenge these with observations of your own. Weigh the whole and reach your own conclusions. As you do, note the close relationship between the free exercise of religion and the associated rights of free speech and freedom of assembly.<br><br>1. Earlier this year a group in the California legislature sought to deny state funding to students of private colleges and universities that rely on religious exemptions from Title IX non-discrimination requirements. Fortunately that effort was blocked, but it will return next year.<sup>10</sup> Title IX is the same federal statute that was sought to be used to force BYU to have coed dorms when I was president forty years ago.<sup>11</sup> BYU prevailed in that earlier contest, but in today's political climate, such attempts to override the freedoms of­religious colleges seem certain to continue.<br><br>2. A more common and more personal challenge to free speech in current policy debates is the labeling of opposition arguments as "hate speech" or "bigotry." This kind of name-calling chills free speech by seeking to penalize the speech of opponents--personally, socially, or professionally. A legal scholar's recent book, which advocates pluralism, mutual respect, and coexistence, states that the label "bigot" is a "conversation stopper" because it "attributes a particular [negative] motive to an action."<sup>12</sup> The author observed that this kind of labeling "frequently appears against religious believers and groups that maintain traditional beliefs about sexuality in their internal membership requirements."<sup>13</sup> Incidentally, my dictionary defines <i>bigot</i> as "a person who is utterly intolerant of any creed, belief, or opinion that differs from his own."<sup>14</sup> Who fits that description in this contest of motives and opinions?<br><br>3. Of greater concern are the institutionalized "free speech zones" established by some universities to provide a small designated space in which students may speak freely. The rest of the campus is then a restricted speech zone, in which certain words and ideas (including what are called "microaggressions") are not to be spoken.<sup>15</sup> Such general restrictions on campus speech seem unlikely to survive their current legal challenges. Academic freedom should not be limited to those who agree with prevailing political views. But the fact that some educators have succumbed to pressures to create such restrictions is worrisome.<br><br>4. Free speech and association are also chilled when campus pressures result in administrations canceling commencement speaking invitations or honors to persons whose prior actions or words are being attacked by faculty or students. Although institutions of course exercise judgment about whom to honor or invite, once invitations are extended, they should not be canceled just because a segment of campus is hostile to the ­honoree's or speaker's political views.<br><br>5. Consider another action of some state institutions. Students seeking official campus status for some religious, social, or political clubs have been told that they must not have any limitations on their membership or leadership. Campus organizations must "take all comers" and let them seek organizational leadership, even if they oppose the organization's principles and standards.<br><br>6. A new and rising right being urged is the right not to be offended in the public square and on campuses. Consider how that alleged "right" would suppress religious teaching and free speech by giving any objector the right to police and control the communications of adversaries. Such a concept would also compromise the mission of universities. On that subject, we cannot doubt the wisdom of Clark Kerr, first chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley, and twelfth president of the University of California:<br><br><i>The university is not engaged in making ideas safe for students. It is engaged in making students safe for ideas. Thus it permits the freest expression of views before students, trusting to their good sense in passing judgment on these views. Only in this way can it best serve American democracy.</i><sup>16</sup><br><br>7. In recent years, some scholars whose work has questioned or opposed majority thinking in their disciplines or contradicted the current dogmas of political correctness have faced dismissal or other academic sanctions or, in any event, have had difficulty having their work published in professional journals. Similarly, colleges and universities--especially religious institutions or those associated with conservative causes--are facing increasing pressures from some professional associations and accrediting bodies to conform. Less visible are the many reports of hiring decisions that discriminate against persons who hold or are presumed to hold unpopular views. These examples of discrimination to defend prevailing positions are almost impossible to prove, but their effect--evident in the faculty composition and in the hiring decisions of various academic departments and other ­organizations--makes them obvious to the critical eye.<br><br>8. Finally, I cannot refrain from citing the tactics of public shaming, boycotts, and other actions to punish opponents and intimidate further opposition. Such tactics, which our Church and its California members experienced during and after the Proposition 8 same-gender marriage referendum, obviously poison the atmosphere for open discussion and inquiry. Although often invoking the popular rhetoric of equality and rights, those who employ these tactics erode the vital protections of freedom of thought, speech, religion, and assembly and diminish our country's beacon light of freedom to the world.<br><br><b>VI.</b><br><br>We are fortunate that there are leaders whose examples and words promote the values of freedom. Two years ago the leadership of the University of Chicago noted "recent events nationwide that have tested institutional commitments to free and open discourse." They established a faculty Committee on Freedom of Expression, whose report has now been influential with other senior institutions. That report gave expression to such traditional ideas as these:<br><br><i>It is not the proper role of the University to attempt to shield individuals from ideas and opinionsthey find unwelcome, disagreeable, or even deeply </i><i>­offensive....</i><br><br><i> ... The University's fundamental commitment is to the principle that debate or deliberation may not be suppressed because the ideas put forth are thought by some or even by most members of the University community to be offensive, unwise, immoral, or wrong-headed. It is for the individual members of the University community, not for the University as an institution, to make those judgments for themselves.</i><sup>17</sup><br><br>That report of course acknowledged that the university may restrict certain kinds of expressions, such as those that are illegal, defamatory, threatening, or harassment. Significantly, it also recognized restrictions on speech "that is otherwise directly incompatible with the functioning of the University."<sup>18</sup><br><br>As some universities continue to cave in to pressures for prohibition and academic censorship, I fervently hope that most will follow the principles stated in that persuasive Chicago report.<br><br><b>VII.</b><br><br>Some of you are wondering whether I will speak of how my concerns for freedom in higher education apply to BYU. I have obviously pondered deeply on that subject, especially during the nineteen years of my service in important positions of academic leadership, first at the University of Chicago and then at BYU. The similarities between those two great universities are far larger than their differences, but there are differences, which I will describe.<br><br>Both are private universities. Both must be free to pursue their separate declarations of mission and purpose and to define and advocate the freedom necessary to achieve them. Both are vital contributors to the valuable but threatened diversity of higher education in America.<br><br>The differences are rooted in BYU's unique religious mission and the method of learning inherent in it. As stated in BYU's official policy on academic freedom, dated more than twenty-three years ago, "The BYU community embraces traditional freedoms of study, inquiry, and debate, together with the special responsibilities implicit in the university's religious mission."<sup>19</sup> Those special responsibilities include some limits on academic freedom. Limitations are common to all universities, as the Chicago report conceded, but BYU's limitations are express and well publicized. Its policy states:<br><br><i>BYU defines itself as having a unique religious mission and as pursuing knowledge in a climate of belief. This model of education differs clearly and consciously from public university models that embody a separation of church and state. ...</i><br><br><i>... Religion offers venerable alternative theories of knowledge by presupposing that truth is eternal, that it is only partly knowable through reason alone, and that human reason must be tested against divine revelation.</i><sup>20</sup><br><br>In that context, BYU students commit to a code of honor that prohibits speech that is dishonest, illegal, profane, or unduly disrespectful of others. The limitations on faculty expression apply to expression that<b><i>seriously and adversely</i></b><i> affects the university mission or the Church. ... Examples would include expression with students or in public that:</i><br><br><i> • contradicts or opposes, rather than analyzes or discusses, fundamental Church doctrine or policy; </i>[or]<br><br><i> • deliberately attacks or derides the Church or its general leaders.</i><sup>21</sup><br><br>Consider those limitations, which are closely related to BYU's declared method of learning, and I believe you will conclude that BYU's Academic Freedom Policy is correct when it says that "individual freedom of expression is broad, presumptive, and essentially unrestrained except"<sup>22</sup> for these narrow limits. Indeed, in many ways, academic freedom at BYU exceeds that at many colleges and universities that pretend to have unqualified academic freedom and then apply or submit to the kinds of exceptions I described earlier.<br><br>BYU's policy concludes with this important affirmation:<br><br><i>For those who embrace the gospel, BYU offers a far richer and more complete kind of academic freedom than is possible in secular universities because to seek knowledge in the light of revealed truth</i> [and I would add <b>by the methods of revealed truth</b>] <i>is, for believers, to be free indeed.</i><sup>23</sup><br><br><b>VIII.</b><br><br>And so I have spoken of elections, hope, and freedom. In these distressing times our freedom and hope can best be fostered by five actions:<br><br>1. We must concentrate on what we have in common with our neighbors and fellow citizens.<br><br>2. We must strive for mutual understanding and treat all with goodwill.<br><br>3. We must exercise patience.<br><br>4. We should all speak out for religion and the importance of religious freedom.<br><br>5. We must, above all, trust in God and His promises.<br><br>I testify of the reality of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and of the promise expressed by His servant Mormon, who said:<br><br><i>And what is it that ye shall hope for? Behold I say unto you that ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ and the power of his resurrection, to be raised unto life eternal, and this because of your faith in him according to the promise.</i> [Moroni 7:41]<br><br>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Dallin H. Oaks, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, delivered this devotional address on 13 September 2016.</i><br><br>© by Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>g the Eternal: A Spiritual Journey with the Book of Mormon</h1>
<br>
<br>
My friends, I commend each of you for taking time in your busy lives to consider the things of eternity. May the Lord bless you for it.<br><br>I was originally scheduled to speak at a devotional in March, but two weeks before that day, I had a heart attack. While having three titanium stents put in my heart, I went into cardiac arrest and experienced what doctors call "clinical death."<br><br>Alas, I did not see a tunnel of light, nor was I asked about whether I wanted to stay on earth. If asked, I think I would have said, "I do miss my parents and grandparents, but my children and grandchildren still need me. And I really need my wife, Mary. May I please stay?"<br><br>Well, the doctors got my heart beating again, and I am <i>very</i> happy to be here with you today--especially with Mary!<br><br>My purpose today is to speak about the blessings found in receiving the eternal into our lives and also to speak a little on the related need to resist the ephemeral. <i>Ephemeral</i> means fleeting, transitory, and momentary. Most things in this life are ephemeral. It is easy to forget that we are actually eternal beings in the midst of a temporary mortal journey.<br><br>In Lehi's dream of the tree of life,<sup>1</sup> there were various ephemeral things that posed challenges for those making their way to the tree, including great mists of darkness and a great and spacious building with finely dressed people pointing fingers of scorn.<sup>2</sup> The things that helped people get to the tree included a strait and narrow path, an iron rod, and the examples of people pressing forward to the tree, whose fruit was "sweet above all that is sweet."<sup>3</sup><br><br>A central purpose of the Book of Mormon is to convince "the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God."<sup>4</sup> I was brought to Christ through the Book of Mormon when entirely undeserving of this blessing. Thus I embrace a sacred obligation to stand as a witness of God's love and mercy "at all times ... and in all places"--including this one.<sup>5</sup> The best way I know how to do this is to tell you about my journey to Christ.<br><h2><b>Conversion to Christ and the Restored Gospel</b></h2><br>I was born and raised in Marin County, California--at that time the fifth-wealthiest county in the nation. Living just north of San Francisco, I grew up literally surrounded by great mists, since on most days a heavy, dark fog rolled in off the Pacific Ocean.<br><br>My parents raised me in the Episcopal Church. I was baptized by Father Ewald, my dad's adoptive father. My godmother was my mom's best friend, a wonderful Jewish woman named Ann, and my godfather was my Uncle Gene, who became an Episcopal priest. From age nine to twelve I served as an altar boy.<br><br>However, I stopped attending church at age twelve and spent my youth playing sports. I cared nothing for books or schooling, only for baseball, basketball, tennis--and girls. I lived the superficial and worldly life typical of teens in that time and place.<br><br>My dad was a police officer and my mom an office manager, so we had only moderate means. But I spent my youth surrounded by spacious designer homes, expensive cars, exclusive tennis clubs, and well-dressed wealthy people living the so-called good life of parties, vacations, and the partaking of substances that brought ephemeral pleasures. I aspired to have all this. My goals were to play professional tennis and teach at a fancy tennis club. In other words, I wanted to live in the great and spacious building.<br><br>Meanwhile, one of my mother's coworkers, Mrs.LoDonna Leininger, shared a copy of the Book of Mormon with Mom. Mom did not read the book but put it on the top shelf of her bookcase in the living room.<br><br>One day, at the end of November 1977, when I was nearly nineteen and was a freshman at the local junior college, I was at home relaxing and watching TV. Then I had what was--for me--a most unusual thought: since I was now a college student, I should perhaps try to become an "educated person" and actually read a book not assigned by a teacher. I went over to Mom's bookcase. My eyes were drawn to a blue paperback book in the left-hand corner of the top shelf. I had a strong feeling that I should read <i>that</i> book.<br><br>So I reached up and took the Book of Mormon down and began to read. From the first verse I experienced a strange, powerful, and wonderful feeling, kind of like shivers up and down my spine. I thought a window must be open, so I checked the windows for a draft. After about twenty minutes of reading, I had to leave for work.<br><br>When I got home that night, I had that same strong feeling to read the Book of Mormon. So I brought it up to my room, sat at my desk, and read. I read through the night until about six in the morning, repeatedly experiencing this strange, strong feeling. The next day I read for a few more hours.<br><br>That evening when I came home from work, Iwas very tired and looking forward to sleep. But again I had the strong feeling that I should read the Book of Mormon. So I sat at my desk and again read through the night. I had many questions: Could these things really be true? Could God really exist? I came to 3 Nephi 11 and was deeply impressed with all that Jesus said and did.<br><br>At about 5 a.m. I was out of energy, sore all over, and nodding off to sleep. At about twenty pages from the end of the book, I decided that Iwould get some sleep and finish the book later. Then I had an overwhelming feeling and a very clear thought to <i>finish the book now</i>.<br><br>At the same time, I felt renewed energy, and the soreness disappeared. So I stayed in the chair and continued reading. I came to some verses that Mrs. Leininger had marked. She had underlined the verses in red pen, highlighted them with a yellow highlighter, and written in the margin in all caps, "Very important verses. Read these carefully!"<br><br>So I carefully read these marked verses--yes, they were Moroni 10:3–5--that included the invitation "And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true."<sup>6</sup> I had never prayed from my heart before, although as a kid in church I had knelt and recited written prayers from the Episcopal Book of Common Prayer. So I knelt at the side of my bed and, with faith in the Jesus Christ I had read about in the Book of Mormon, I asked God to forgive my sins and asked if the Book of Mormon was true.<br><br>It is not possible for me to adequately express what then happened, but I will try. I felt the same type of wonderful spiritual feelings I had felt since I first began reading the Book of Mormon but at an incredibly intensified level of power and depth. It was as if a river of pure water rushed through me, washing away all my sins. It was also like a ­raging fire purged away my old self. I felt completely clean and like an entirely new person.<br><br>Not only was there great power, but the depth of love I felt surpasses my ability to express it. I felt that although I did not know God, God knew me <i>perfectly</i>. And although God knew me ­perfectly--with all my sinfulness, pride, vanity, and selfishness--He still loved me perfectly. Likewise, the sure knowledge that the Book of Mormon was the word of God was seared into mysoul.<br><br>I was changed in a profound way. I no longer wanted to be what I was and do what I was doing. I wanted only to do what God wanted me to do. I wanted only to love and serve others and tell them about Jesus Christ and the Book of Mormon. In my mind's eye I saw glimpses of myself teaching various people and groups about Jesus Christ and the Book of Mormon. I somehow knew that <i>this</i> would be my future.<br><br>I climbed into bed but felt more wide awake and filled with enthusiasm than I ever had in my life. As I lay in my bed thinking about what had just happened, I heard Mom downstairs getting ready for work. I went down and told her I had read the Book of Mormon that her coworker Mrs.Leininger had given her. I asked if she would ask Mrs. Leininger to call me and answer some questions that I had about the book.<br><br>Mrs. Leininger called that evening, and we spoke for about three hours. She invited me to come to a "special church meeting" the next day, and I accepted.<br><h2><b>Ways of Receiving the Eternal</b></h2><br>As I look back after nearly thirty-nine years on those life-changing two nights reading the Book of Mormon for the first time and on my first prayer that early morning, I marvel at the tender mercy of my Heavenly Father in guiding me toward the restored gospel. From this and other experiences, I know for myself that the veil between heaven and earth is thin and that the Lord orchestrates actions on both sides of that veil to bless His children.<br><br>Despite the fact that I had done <i>nothing</i> to merit this gift, I had been invited to receive eternal truth, love, and forgiveness. The answer to that one prayer has eternally impacted everything for me. Neither I nor my life has ever been the same. I had tasted of the love of God, which, indeed, "was most sweet, above all that I [had] ever before tasted."<sup>7</sup><br><br>Lehi's dream is filled with universal themes that apply across time and culture. All of us can learn from careful study of that dream. On the other hand, my journey to the joy of God's eternal love is personal and unique. My hope is that the ways the Lord has worked with me will remind each of you how God has blessed you. I also hope my story provides you with another witness of God's infinite and eternal love for each one of us.<br><br>Sadly, many of the people I grew up with have suffered the full range of troubles and sorrows that often befall those without the blessings and protections of the gospel of Jesus Christ. They have suffered the dark and dreary bondage of a life without eternal meaning that so often results in addiction, abuse, adultery, divorce, and suicide. I have no doubt that I would have suffered many of these things and more had I not chosen to accept the eternal gift of divine love and forgiveness. If you, or someone you know, think it is hard to be a Mormon, imagine life without the light and power of Christ's gospel.<br><br>Of course a person can taste something of the eternal and yet not fully receive it into his or her life. The Lord honors our moral agency. We must choose to repeatedly receive the eternal and to resist the ephemeral at crucial crossroads in life as well as in daily habits. The word <i>receive</i> suggests receptivity, even hospitality. <i>To receive</i> implies to open up to, accept into, and be willing to accommodate that person or thing. It is about opening and enlarging our heart, our mind, our will--indeed, our entire life--to the eternal.<br><br>Soon after we have come into the Church by baptism, someone with priesthood authority lays hands on our head and directs us to "receive the Holy Ghost" and thus partake of a marvelous eternal gift. Throughout our lives as members of Christ's Church, we are invited to receive an abundance of eternal blessings, including receiving the sacrament, receiving a patriarchal blessing, receiving the priesthood, receiving our own endowment, receiving a mission call, receiving another person as our eternal companion, and then, together, receiving all the blessings of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>Despite the ever-present mists of mortal temptations, the sneering taunts of those in spacious towers, the strange roads and forbidden paths that beckon away from the eternal, and the veil that separates us from the eternal beings and powers all around us,<sup>8</sup> an important part of earth life is learning how to fully receive the sweet fruits of the eternal.<br><br><i>Eternal--</i>what a wonderful word! When the evocative word <i>eternal</i> is paired with certain sublime words, each phrase becomes a kind of short, sacred poem: Eternal Father, eternal salvation, eternal life, eternal progression, eternal family, eternal marriage, eternal companion.<br><br>Nephi taught, "To be spiritually-minded is life eternal."<sup>9</sup> The Savior said, "This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent."<sup>10</sup> What a marvelous blessing it is to know God, our Eternal Father, and His Eternal Son.<br><br>Throughout our mortal lives all of us are given opportunities to receive greater knowledge about our Eternal Father and how He communes with us. Often this comes through the inspired and<br>loving actions of others.<br><h2><b>First LDS Meeting and Meeting the Missionaries</b></h2><br>The day after I talked with Mrs. Leininger, I attended my first LDS meeting. I woke up on Saturday, November 26, 1977, and drove thirty minutes to the San Rafael stake center. I parked, got out of my car, and walked up to a side door of the church, where I saw Mrs. Leininger waiting for me.<br><br>As we walked into the building, I expected to see crucifixes, candles, statues, and all the other things I associated with a religious building. Mrs. Leininger brought me into a large basketball gym that she called the "cultural hall." Rows of folding chairs were facing a stage, where several people sat behind a podium.<br><br>Mrs. Leininger led me to a seat near center court. This was familiar to me, since I had played many games on basketball courts attached to churches with my friends in the Catholic Youth Organization. As I looked around, I saw no crosses, no altars, no candles, no statues, and no pews with kneelers. I saw no stained-glass windows, but I did see two nice and clean glass basketball backboards with brand-new nets. Ithought, "This is a <i>great</i> church!"<br><br>The church I grew up in mostly included elderly women, so when I saw that most of those in attendance were teenagers and included a number of attractive young women, I again thought, "This is a <i>great</i> church!"<br><br>As an Episcopal altar boy, I had worn robes and a crucifix and had carried a large wood and gold cross at the front of the procession into church services. So I was waiting for the organ to begin playing and the acolytes, priest, deacon, and choir to parade into the meeting dressed in robes.<br><br>Instead a man in a suit simply stood up and began conducting the meeting. We sang, someone prayed, and then someone introduced Brother Brenton Yorgason from Utah as the special youth conference speaker. He spoke for about an hour and told a number of wonderful stories, and there was a lot of laughing. This surprised me, since the church I was raised in included a lot of incense but not much laughter. Again I thought, "This is a <i>great</i> church!"<br><br>I was feeling really good about my experience in church until suddenly I realized that I had forgotten to bring money for the offering or collection. I assumed that after the sermon they would pass a collection plate to receive the monetary offering. As a kid, if I had forgotten to bring money, I felt awkward when the plate was passed to me and I had to just pass it on.<br><br>So I turned to Mrs. Leininger and whispered, "I'm sorry. I feel really bad, but I forgot to bring money for the offering."<br><br>She said, "For the what?"<br><br>I said, "For the offering. You know, when they pass the plate around."<br><br>She said, "Oh, we don't do that."<br><br>I thought, "Wow, you get to sit in a gym with people your own age and listen to funny stories, and you don't have to pay <i>anything</i>. This is a <i>great</i> church!"<br><br>After Brother Yorgason finished speaking, nearly all the young men and women there stood, one by one, and "bore their testimony" of what they believed. I experienced the same feelings I had had while reading the Book of Mormon and while praying.<br><br>At the end of the meeting we all stood, and Mrs. Leininger asked me what I thought. I said it was incredible and asked how I could join her church. She smiled very widely and, while nodding, waved over a couple of young guys in suits with name tags. It seemed like they were expecting this signal.<br><br>To me these guys with their short hair and dark suits looked quite strange (this was the 1970s California of long hair and short shorts), but their enthusiastic smiles and vigorous handshakes were warm and welcoming. Elders Hawkes and Christensen asked if they could teach me about the gospel. I said that would be great. After a luncheon, where I was seated across from Brother and Sister Yorgason, we went to the Leiningers' home.<br><br>I sat on the sofa surrounded by Brother and Sister Leininger, a few of their adult children, and Elders Hawkes and Christensen, all of whom seemed <i>really</i> excited to teach me about their faith. These Idaho farm boys looked, spoke, and acted unlike anyone I had ever met. Yet because of what I had experienced during my prayer, I wanted to be like these ­missionaries and do what they were doing.<br><br>They told me about Joseph Smith's First Vision and the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. Everything I was being told was new and strange, but somehow it all made sense to me. And I was having the same feelings I had had while reading the Book of Mormon and saying my prayer and attending the youth conference meeting.<br><br>I was wondering what these feelings could be when the elder who was speaking stopped--mid-sentence--closed his flip chart of pictures, looked me in the eyes, and said, "Dave, what you are feeling <i>right now</i> is the Holy Ghost telling you that what we are teaching you is true. That is what you felt when you read the Book of Mormon and today at church."<br><br>I was astounded! This guy I had just met, who was only a little older than I was, somehow had read my mind and knew that I was feeling ­something--and that I had felt it before. There was no way he could have known that unless God had told him.<br><br>The elder then said, "Dave, the Lord wants you to be baptized into His Church. Will you be baptized two weeks from today?"<br><br>I said, "Yes, I will! And then can I go and do what you are doing?"<br><br>The elders looked extremely happy and very surprised. They said they were thrilled that I wanted to be baptized but that I would need to wait for a year before I could be a missionary.<br><br>I said, "I don't want to wait a year; I want to go right now!"<br><br>One elder said, "Well, you need time to learn more about the gospel and prepare to enter the temple before your mission."<br><br>I said, "Okay, what should I do to prepare to be a missionary?"<br><br>One of the elders said, "You should go to BYU and take religion classes."<br><br>I said, "Okay, what is BYU?"<br><br>He said, "It is a Mormon university in Utah."<br><br>I said, "Okay, where is Utah?"<br><br>He said, "In the Rocky Mountains."<br><br>I said, "Where are the Rocky Mountains?"<br><br>I was a dumb teenage jock from California who had never paid any attention to geography. To me there was California, then blah, blah, blah, and then New York City (where <i>Saturday Night Live</i> came from).<br><br>I said I would go to BYU and prepare to serve a two-year mission for a church I had only been to once.<br><h2><b>How Some of Our Friends of Other Faiths Receive the Eternal</b></h2><br>Because God loves all His children, He pours out the full measure of blessings each of us is ready and willing to receive.<sup>11</sup> All are given the opportunity to receive marvelous gifts from our Eternal Father. Happily, Latter-day Saints are joined by billions of other people of faith in a desire to receive the eternal.<br><br>As part of a scholarly research initiative called the American Families of Faith<i> </i>Project,<sup>12</sup> my colleagues and I have interviewed 201 wonderful Christian, Jewish, and Muslim families from across the United States. We have been blessed to learn about a variety of ways that our friends of other faiths make efforts to resist the ephemeral and receive the eternal in their lives. Here are just four examples.<br><h3><b><i>Jewish Acts of Faith</i></b></h3><br>Our Jewish friends sanctify many aspects of daily life. Jewish women light candles to welcome in the Sabbath, and Orthodox Jewish men wear a sacred, fringed, white garment--called a <i>tallit katan </i>in Hebrew--beneath their shirts to remind them of the commandments. One father we interviewed said that when faced with unwanted thoughts, he touches the fringes to remind himself to think of God.<br><h3><b><i>Orthodox Christian Acts of Faith</i></b></h3><br>Our Orthodox Christian friends have prayer corners in their homes that contain scriptures, holy water, incense, candles, and blessed icons--many portraying the countenance of Christ--to bring a bit of the eternal into their home and family life.<br><h3><b><i>Muslim Acts of Faith</i></b></h3><br>Our Muslim friends perform sacred ­washings--called <i>wudu</i> in Arabic--before daily prayers (<i>salat</i>). In solemnity they wash the top of their head and their eyes, ears, nose, hands, arms, legs, and feet to prepare for sacred prayers.<br><h3><b><i>Evangelical Christian Acts of Faith</i></b></h3><br>Our Evangelical Christian friends lift up their hands in prayer, pointing their minds and hearts heavenward in praise to the Lord Jesus.<br><br>These practices represent intentional efforts by our friends of faith to receive the eternal into their lives. They are sacredly similar to our own efforts in homes, chapels, and temples to make and keep eternal covenants through participation in priesthood ordinances.<br><h2><b>Receiving and Resisting Opposition</b></h2><br>Similar to many others who have converted to the restored gospel, I faced significant opposition before and after my baptism. This included many challenging conversations with family, friends, and others who strongly opposed the Church. The first of these conversations was with Mom on the evening I arrived home from my first day with my new Mormon friends. That Saturday included the youth conference, a luncheon, multiple discussions with the elders, dinner with the Leiningers, and an evening fireside.<br><br>When I arrived home at 10 p.m., Mom asked where I had been.<br><br>I said, "Church!"<br><br>She said, "What do you mean, 'church'? You have been gone all day and evening."<br><br>After I explained all the other events, Mom sighed and asked, "So what did you think?"<br><br>I said, "It was incredible. I'm going to be ­baptized in two weeks!"<br><br>She cried out, "You certainly are <i>not </i>being ­baptized in two weeks!"<br><br>"<i>Yes</i>, I am," I said.<br><br>She said, "No<i>,</i> you are <i>not</i> joining that church in two weeks. You don't know anything about that religion or your own religion or any other religion. So here is what you will do: You will take a year and study your own religion, the Mormon religion, and other religions. And then, at the end of that year, if you still want to be baptized, then you may do so."<br><br>I said passionately, "No, that is <i>not</i> what I'm going to do. <i>This</i> is what I'm going to do: I'm going to be baptized in two weeks, and then I'm going to go to BYU in the fall, and in a year I'm going on a two-year, full-time mission for the Church."<br><br>To say the least, my parents were not happy. They quickly arranged what turned out to be a long, difficult, and painful conversation with my beloved Uncle Gene--my godfather and a wise and caring Episcopal priest. He spoke passionately and tried valiantly but unsuccessfully to convince me that the Mormon Church was a non-Christian cult. Many others tried to convince me that the Mormon faith was wrong. This kind of ­opposition--and the study and prayer on gospel matters that accompanied it--only served to strengthen my testimony of the Restoration.<br><br>Mom and Dad reluctantly accepted my decision by attending my baptism and trying to support me in my new life. I went to BYU, served a mission, returned, and married my eternal companion. And together we have shared thirty-three years of marriage, have raised seven great kids, and have three grandchildren--so far. Talk about eternal bliss! I am profoundly grateful to LoDonna and Ray Leininger for their incredible support of me along that path.<br><h2><b>An Invitation to Receive the Eternal</b></h2><br><b></b>I have shared a few personal experiences through which I was blessed to receive the sweet fruits of the eternal when I was the age of many of you BYU students. I have done so in order to stand as a witness of the goodness of God in my life and to offer my own testimony of the deep reality and transforming power of God's eternal love. From these experiences I know for myself that God, our Eternal Father, lives, that He loves us with a depth and power we cannot fathom, and that He answers our earnest prayers.<br><br>I also know that I am <i>not</i> the star of the experiences I have shared but merely a grateful recipient and witness of the love of God. My experiences have been a result of the profound love and tender mercies of God toward someone who must have needed such experiences to convert and stay faithful. All I did was be willing to receive eternal blessings when they were offered. All glory and honor and praise be to the Eternal Father and His Beloved Son.<br><br>The dramatic experiences received by the prophet Jonah, Saul of Tarsus, and Alma the Younger--not to mention Laman and Lemuel--demonstrate that God, in His mercy, sometimes provides dramatic spiritual manifestations to those--like me--who, because of pride or unbelief, really do not deserve to receive them. To the apostle Thomas, who had required a dramatic manifestation in order to believe, the Savior said, "Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed."<sup>13</sup><br><br>Personally, my spiritual heroes are not those who have experienced dramatic spiritual experiences. I most admire the many marvelous Saints I have known who continue in faithful devotion and service to God despite never having experienced an overpowering spiritual witness.<br><br>My friends, wherever you find yourself spiritually, I say to you in love and humility: I know that God lives and will answer your sincere prayers. I know that Jesus is the Christ. I know that only through faith in Christ and His atoning sacrifice can sin be washed and burned from the soul.<br><br>I hope that hearing my story has prompted you to think of times in your life when the Lord and His servants have touched your soul, enlightened your mind, sent others into your life to bless you, and helped you recognize the workings of the Holy Spirit. I invite you to record and share those sacred times when you have received the eternal into your life. Doing so will be a blessing for you, for others, and for future generations.<br><br>My intention has been to point you upward to prayerful communion with your Eternal Father; downward into deep study and pondering of the Book of Mormon and other scripture; inward into the depths of your soul, where you will find an eternal being yearning for the things of eternity; outward to sharing the glorious gospel of Jesus Christ with others; and forward to a future of faith and devotion to the Lord Jesus Christ and His restored gospel.<br><br>I invite us all to join with those in Lehi's dream who pressed forward to the tree of life by "continually holding fast to the rod of iron, until they came forth and fell down and partook of the fruit of the tree."<sup>14</sup> In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>David C. Dollahite, professor of family life, delivered this devotional address on 27 September 2016.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1>de, the Holy Land, and Brigham Young University - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, brothers and sisters, for taking time from your busy schedules to be here today. From years of personal experience I know the demands and pressures of attending a large university. How grateful I am that you would step away from your studies or other responsibilities to participate in this devotional. Let me also thank those who provided me with this opportunity to speak.<br><br>My wife, Tina, and I returned from Jerusalem in mid-August, after a three-year assignment at BYU's Jerusalem Center for Near Eastern Studies. We were blessed to have been in a unique university facility, where we worked closely with administrators, faculty members, staff, volunteer couples, and hundreds of students in a way rarely afforded most people. Let me also thank my lifelong and eternal companion for her constant support in what has been a very intense and very rewarding three years. Her sacrifices were many and her influence on others immense.<br><br>Life is often filled with surprises. While I ­recognize the need we all have to set goals and tohave lifelong plans in place, we often find ourselves taking detours. Some of these can be scenic and short lived. Others take us down unforeseen paths. I suppose my speaking to you today is one of those shorter detours.<br><br>Let me explain: After three years in the Holy Land, my wife and I decided a change of pace was in order when we returned to Utah. Instead of me going back to my office right away, we would spend time with family, find a home, buy a car or two (we sold our home and cars before moving to Jerusalem), and arrange for a trip to Florida to visit Magnolia, our nine-month-old grand­daughter, whom I have never met in person. Itwasa good plan.<br><br>Our first week back could not have gone better. We retreated to my in-laws' cabin for some welcome family time, they loaned us a car so that we could get around, and our oldest daughter and her husband graciously took us into their home. Life was good!<br><br>Then it happened: two weeks after being back, I received an unexpected invitation to speak today--clearly a deviation from the plan, a few ripples on the calm waters of life. In between finding cars (we have), a home (we closed on it last Friday), and spending time with family, I have quietly been slipping into my office on campus to prepare for this wonderful opportunity. I moved the piles of mail that had accumulated during my absence to one side of my desk and set to work, having determined to say something about the Holy Land.<br><br>My first exposure to Jerusalem was in 1984, long before most of you were born. Sister Whitchurch and I had spent a couple of years saving money so that we could participate on a three-week Lands of the Scriptures Workshop offered through LDS Seminaries and Institutes. Our travels took us to Italy, Egypt, and many places throughout the Holy Land. From the minute the plane touched down on the tarmac at the Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv, Ifelt like I had come home to see a long-lost ­family member--like my granddaughter. The ­emotions were intense and unanticipated. I somehow felt connected to a land I had only imagined, the home of my biblical ancestors and the land where our Savior was born, lived, died, and was resurrected.<br><br>I am not the first to have had such an experience. Many people who travel to the Holy Land express similar feelings. For example, when Elder Orson Hyde arrived in Jerusalem on Thursday, October 21, 1841, he said:<br><br><i>As I gazed upon it and its environs, the mountains and hills by which it is surrounded, and considered, that this is the stage upon which so many scenes of wonders have been acted, where prophets were stoned, and the Saviour of sinners slain, a storm of commingled emotions suddenly arose in my breast, the force of which was only spent in a profuse shower of tears.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>In 1873, Elder Lorenzo Snow, his sister ElizaR. Snow, and President George A. Smith of the First Presidency, along with a few others, traveled to the Holy Land. Elder Snow described his experience this way:<br><br><i>One hour's ride from our lunching place will bring us to Jerusalem. We move on and at length ascend an eminence, and gaze on the "Holy City," Jerusalem. Away to the right is Mount Zion, the city of David. Off to our left, that lofty eminence, with an aspect so barren, is the Mount of Olives, once the favorite resort of our Saviour, and the spot last pressed by his sacred feet before He ascended into the presence of His Father. These interesting historic scenes, with all their sacred associations, inspire thoughts and reflections impressive and solemn. Yes, there is Jerusalem! Where Jesus lived and taught, and was crucified, where he cried "It is finished," and bowed his head and died!</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>Even Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, made a personal connection with the Holy Land upon his arrival in 1867. He came as part of a five-month-long cruise called "The Grand Holy Land Pleasure Excursion."<sup>3</sup>As the seventy-five passengers arrived in Beirut, Clemens and seven others decided to ride overland by horse to Jerusalem, where they would meet up with their shipmates.<sup>4</sup><br><br>After leaving Lebanon, Clemens and his company stopped at Caesarea Philippi,<sup>5</sup>the traditional site where Jesus asked His disciples, "Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?"<br><br>Peter answered, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the ­living God."<sup>6</sup><br><br>Clemens said of his visit:<br><br><i>I can not comprehend yet that I am sitting where a god has stood, and looking upon the brook and the mountains which that god looked upon, and am surrounded by dusky men and women whose ancestors saw him, and even talked with him, face to face, and carelessly, just as they would have done with any other stranger.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>Here we have a humorist and social satirist who more often than not expressed skepticism about religious matters, yet on this occasion he stepped back from his normal writing style to share what seems to have been a sincere moment of personal reflection.<br><br>Time and time again I have seen people come to the Holy Land and express feelings of connection. What is it about this part of the world that evokes such emotion in so many people? Today I would like to respond to that question by sharing with you three miraculous events connected to the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ that occurred in the Holy Land:<br><br>1. The travels and dedication of the Holy Land by Elder Orson Hyde.<br><br>2. The beautification and dedication of the Orson Hyde Memorial Garden on the Mount of Olives.<br><br>3. The acquisition of land for and subsequent construction of the BYU Jerusalem Center for Near Eastern Studies.<br><br>The timing of today's speech should not go unnoticed. October 24--twenty days from now--marks 175 years since Elder Orson Hyde, an apostle of the Lord, climbed to the top of the Mount of Olives to pray over the Holy Land. He traveled from Commerce, Illinois (Nauvoo, if you will), to Jerusalem, an endeavor that took him away from home and family on a journey that lasted one week short of thirty-two months and onwhich hetraveled more than 18,500 miles.<sup>8</sup><br><br>October 24 also marks the thirty-seventh ­anniversary since President Spencer W. Kimball dedicated the Orson Hyde Memorial Garden on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem. March 8, 2017--five months from now--will be the thirty-year anniversary of BYU students packing up their belongings at Ramat Rachel, a kibbutz near Bethlehem, and surprising most everyone by moving into the Jerusalem Center. While portions of the building remained unfinished, an occupancy permit had been issued that allowed them to be there, giving the students an opportunity to establish residency in a building that provoked much unwanted international attention.<br><br>You might guess that all of these events are integrally connected and deserve some comments. My aims are ambitious, so brevity is in order.<br><h2><b>The Travels and Dedication of the Holy Land byElder Orson Hyde</b></h2><br>The Church's connection with Jerusalem rightfully begins with the Prophet Joseph Smith. While we often credit Orson Hyde for the Church's involvement in the Holy Land, we should not overlook the role of the Prophet. He certainly knew the historical and prophetic significance of the Holy Land. The word<i>Jerusalem,</i>for example, is used more than 900 times in the standard works.<sup>9</sup>Add to that many stories and prophecies about the Holy Land and we begin to get a sense of the significance of this geographically small corner of our Heavenly Father's vineyard. Joseph Smith was well acquainted with the promises of God to bring His people back to "the land of Jerusalem."<sup>10</sup><br><br>As early as 1831, right after Hyde's baptism, Joseph Smith told Orson Hyde:<br><br><i>Thou shalt go to Jerusalem ... and be a watchman unto the house of Israel; and by thy hands shall the Most High do a great work, which shall prepare the way and greatly facilitate the gathering together of that people.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>Four years later, when Hyde was called to the apostleship in 1835, Oliver Cowdery, in the presence of Joseph Smith, blessed Hyde that "he [would] be made mighty, and be endued with powers from on high, and go forth to the nations of the earth ..., both to Jew and Gentile, and to all nations, kingdoms and tongues."<sup>12</sup><br><br>During the 1836 dedication of the Kirtland Temple, Joseph prayed:<br><br><i>We therefore ask thee to have mercy upon the ­children of Jacob, that Jerusalem, from this hour, may begin to be redeemed;</i><br><br><i>And the yoke of bondage may begin to be broken off from the house of David;</i><br><br><b><i></i></b><b><i>And the children of Judah may begin to return to the lands which thou didst give to Abraham, their father.</i></b><sup>13</sup><br><br>The story of Elder Hyde's journey is both remarkable and miraculous. He was born in Oxford, New Haven County, Connecticut, on January8, 1805, making him almost a year older than Joseph Smith. Hyde's mother died when he was seven,<sup>14</sup>and his father accidently drowned when he was twelve.<sup>15</sup>At age fourteen he moved from Connecticut to the Western Reserve, near Kirtland, Ohio. On his eighteenth birthday he announced his independence to his caregiver and set off on his own. For his first job he worked at an iron foundry, where he earned six dollars a month. Other jobs would follow, but it was not long before he got a job clerking at the Gilbert and Whitney store in Kirtland.<sup>16</sup><br><br>In 1827, at the age of twenty-two, Hyde attended an evangelical camp meeting that resulted in his baptism into the Methodist Church. Soon afterward he met Sidney Rigdon, who convinced him to join a reformed religious movement started by Thomas and Alexander Campbell. Recognizing his inadequacies and motivated by feelings that he would someday be called upon to teach his new faith, he determined to get a better education.<br><br>He began his schooling in the home of Sidney Rigdon, where he was instructed in English grammar.<sup>17</sup>After several months of studying "day and night" with Rigdon, he entered the Burton Academy in Burton, Ohio, to study grammar, geography, arithmetic, and rhetoric. By the time he moved back to Kirtland, he had acquired the tools he needed to take advantage of studying on his own at the local library, where he pored over history, science, and literature.<sup>18</sup><br><br>In 1830--the same year the Church was ­organized--four Mormon missionaries stopped by the town where he was then living, some distance from Kirtland. They preached about "Mormonism." Hyde wrote of their visit:<br><br><i>Perceiving that they were mostly illiterate men, and at the same time observing some examples of superior wisdom and truth in their teaching, I resolved to read the famed "golden bible," as it was called.</i><br><br><i>Accordingly, I procured the book and read a portion ofit, but came to the conclusion that it was all a fiction.</i><sup>19</sup><br><br>Hyde's problem came when he found out that people he knew in the Kirtland area, including his mentor Sidney Rigdon, were converting to Mormonism. After a careful and complete reading of the Book of Mormon, he moved to Kirtland, where he was eventually baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by Rigdon.<sup>20</sup><br><br>As a new member, Hyde wanted to know what the Lord would have him do, so he asked Joseph Smith. The revelation that followed stated:<br><br><i>My servant, Orson Hyde, was called by his ordination to proclaim the everlasting gospel ... from land to land, in the congregations of the wicked, in their synagogues, reasoning with and expounding all scriptures unto them.</i><sup>21</sup><br><br>And so he did. Orson Hyde spent his lifetime preaching the gospel, serving one mission after another.<br><br>In September 1834, Orson married MarindaN. Johnson.<sup>22</sup>The following story is told by a descendant of Orson Hyde:<br><br><i>By the time of his wedding Orson had saved $500. He thought that this fact was unknown, but Joseph Smith came to him and said that he was aware of the money being in Orson's possession. Orson believed that the Prophet had gained this knowledge through divine means and gave him the money to aid in a Church publication.</i><sup>23</sup><br><br>Many of you are familiar with Orson Hyde's remarkable story about his mission to Jerusalem. Orson Hyde was called to serve in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on February 14, 1835.<sup>24</sup>In early March 1840 he was in Nauvoo recovering from a serious ailment. He went to bed one night, but before falling asleep he started thinking about "the field of [his] future labors," and a vision was opened before him. For the next six hours he did not close his eyes as he saw, among other things, "the cities of London, Amsterdam, Constantinople and Jerusalem." During the vision Hyde was ­commanded to go to the cities he was shown.<sup>25</sup><br><br>One month later, on April 6, 1840, Elder Hyde spoke at general conference. He said that "it had been prophesied, some years ago, that he had a great work to perform among the Jews; and that he had recently been moved upon by the Spirit of the Lord to visit that people."<sup>26</sup><br><br>When Hyde finished speaking, Joseph Smith motioned to those in attendance and "resolved" that Hyde should proceed on a mission to Jerusalem.<br><br>Elder JohnE. Page, also a member of the Twelve, then got up and "spoke with much force on the subject of Elder Hyde's mission, the gathering of the Jews, and the restoration of the house of Israel."<sup>27</sup><br><br>On the last day of the conference, Joseph Smith "stated that since Elder Hyde had been appointed to visit the Jews, he had felt an impression that it would be well for Elder JohnE. Page to accompany him on his mission."<sup>28</sup><br><br>Elder Hyde left Nauvoo about a week later, on Wednesday, April 15, 1840. The next day he met up with Elder Page in Lima, Illinois, a town about thirty miles away.<sup>29</sup>For the next few months Hyde and Page traveled as circumstances dictated, sometimes together and at other times apart.<br><br>While preaching at a public meeting in Philadelphia, Hyde declared that he was on a mission to Jerusalem so that he could dedicate that land for the gathering of the Jews. He also mentioned that Mormon missionaries travel without purse or scrip and that he was looking for financial assistance for his mission. Afterward, a stranger gave him a purse of gold and asked that when he delivered his prayer in the Holy Land, hepray for the donor.<sup>30</sup><br><br>Since he did not know the name of the donor, Hyde supplicated God during his prayer in Jerusalem to<br><br><i>look with favor upon all those through whose liberality I have been enabled to come to this land. ... Particularly do Thou bless the stranger in Philadelphia, whom I never saw, but who sent me gold, with a request that Ishould pray for him in Jerusalem.</i><sup>31</sup><br><br>The identity of the anonymous giver was not made public until 1924. During a sermon given in the Salt Lake Tabernacle, NephiL. Morris<sup>32</sup>mentioned the offering given by the stranger to Orson Hyde when Hyde was in Philadelphia. Two months later Morris received a letter from JohnF. Beck, who had been in the audience when Morris had spoken at the Tabernacle. Beck told him that the stranger in Philadelphia whom he had spoken about was his father, Joseph Ellison Beck. John Beck wrote the following in his letter to Morris:<br><br><i>My father ... was the man who sent the purse of gold to Elder Orson Hyde, with which to bear his expenses on his mission to Palestine. He did not have much to say about it, but all our family knew very well that he did that generous deed. ... He did not become rich, but always had money laid aside for a time of need. I have heard the prayer Elder Hyde offered up in his behalf, and am a witness that every feature of it was wonderfully fulfilled.</i><sup>33</sup><br><br>Let me add a personal connection about Elder Hyde and the stranger who gave him gold. This past summer I was on a field trip with a group of BYU students in the Old City of Jerusalem. After talking about Orson Hyde and his achievements, Iasked the students if any of them happened to be a descendant of Orson Hyde. Bryson Ensign, one of the students on the trip, raised his hand and told me he was a direct descendant.<br><br>I asked Bryson if he had anything he wanted to add about Elder Hyde. He said that one of his favorite family stories growing up was about the stranger who gave Hyde the purse of gold that helped finance his mission to Jerusalem. I was thrilled to tell him that my son-in-law Joseph Paul Beck was a direct descendant of the person who gave the gold to Orson Hyde.<br><br>I took advantage of my speaking assignment today by requesting that JosephP. Beck offer the invocation for today's meeting. Joseph is the great-great-grandson of Joseph Ellison Beck. I also asked if Bryson Ensign, the great-great-great-great-grandson of Orson Hyde, would offer the closing prayer. It is a fortuitous ancestral meeting, of sorts, through their posterity.<br><br>By December 1840, Elder Hyde was in New York waiting for Elder Page. In January, after receiving a copy of the Nauvoo newspaper, the<i>Times and Seasons,</i>Hyde saw a notice written by Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>Elders Orson Hyde and John</i><i>E. Page are informed, that the Lord is not well pleased with them in consequence of delaying their mission, (Elder John</i><i>E. Page in particular,) and they are requested by the First Presidency to hasten their journey towards their destination.</i><sup>34</sup><br><br>Imagine being called to repent by the prophet for all to see in the local newspaper. Talk about pressure. Worried about what to do, Elder Hyde wrote to Joseph Smith to ask if he should go ahead on his own. Without waiting for an answer, he left New York on February 13, 1841--alone.<sup>35</sup>As he had seen in vision, Elder Hyde ­proceeded unaccompanied to London, Amsterdam, Constantinople, and Jerusalem.<br><br>Hyde endured many hardships throughout his travels. In a letter he wrote to Joseph Smith while on the Danube en route to Jerusalem, Elder Hyde eloquently expressed gratitude for Joseph's ­support during such difficult times:<br><br><i>The friendship and good will which are breathed towards me through all your letters, are received as the legacy which noble minds and generous hearts are ever anxious to bequeath. They soften the hard and rugged path in which heaven has directed my course. They are buoyancy in depression--joy in sorrow; and when the dark clouds of despondency are gathering thick around the mental horizon, like kind angels from the fountain of mercy, they dispel the gloom, dry the tear of sorrow, and pour humanity's healing balm into my grieved and sorrowful heart.</i><sup>36</sup><br><br>Hyde concluded this particular letter with a plea for his family: "Lord, bless my wife and children, and the hand that ministers good to them."<sup>37</sup><br><br>One of the more difficult legs of Hyde's journey came while traveling from Smyrna (modern-day İzmir, Turkey) to Beirut, Lebanon, when his ship was becalmed. With little to no wind to move his ship forward, it took nineteen days to arrive at his destination instead of the anticipated four. He ran out of food and resorted to eating snails to sustain his life, of which he said, "The greatest difficulty was, I could not get enough of them." When he finally arrived in Lebanon, he was so weak that hedid not have the energy to get off the ship.<sup>38</sup><br><br>Upon his arrival in Beirut, he found the ­country at war, in which eight hundred people had recently been killed not far from Beirut. In addition, he described a horrific state of lawlessness, murder, and theft going on about him while traveling throughout the Levant.<sup>39</sup><br><br>Finally he arrived in Jaffa to make the forty-mile trek overland to Jerusalem. Three days later--on October 24, 1841--Hyde got up early inthe morning to fulfill the long-awaited mission he had come to Jerusalem to do.<br><br>He wrote of this occasion:<br><br><i>As soon as the gates</i>[of the Old City]<i>were opened,</i>[I]<i>crossed the brook Cedron, and went upon the Mount of Olives, and there, in solemn silence, with pen, ink, and paper, just as I saw in the vision, offered up the ­following prayer to Him who lives forever and ever.</i><sup>40</sup><br><br>Here are only small portions of the prayer:<br><br><i>Be pleased, O Lord, to forgive all the follies, weaknesses, vanities, and sins of Thy servant, and strengthen him to resist all future temptations.</i>...<br><br><i>Now, O Lord! Thy servant has been obedient to the heavenly vision which Thou gavest him in his native land; and under the shadow of Thine outstretched arm, he has safely arrived in this place to dedicate and consecrate this land unto Thee, for the gathering together of Judah's scattered remnants, according to the predictions of the holy Prophets....</i><br><br><i>Let that nation or that people who shall take an active part in behalf of Abraham's children, and in the raising up of Jerusalem, find favour in Thy sight.</i><sup>41</sup><br><br>It was over a year before Elder Hyde returned to America. He traveled back by way of Regensburg, where he spent a number of months working on a Church publication in German.<sup>42</sup>He finally arrived in Nauvoo on December 7, 1842.<sup>43</sup>Gone for a few months shy of three years, he arrived home to his wife and two daughters. What a reunion that must have been. I think about our own experience in Jerusalem, having been gone slightly over three years. With the advantages of modern communication and home leaves, our hardships pale in comparison to those of Elder Hyde.<br><h2><b>The Beautification and Dedication of the OrsonHyde Memorial Gardens</b></h2><br>Hyde was not the only Latter-day Saint to travel to Jerusalem. Between 1873 and 1933 other presiding authorities of the Church came to the Holy Land to offer up their prayers unto God. You may recognize from your studies of Church history some of the names of those who traveled there: Albert Carrington, Lorenzo Snow, GeorgeA. Smith, AnthonH. Lund, FrancisM. Lyman, JamesE. Talmage, and JohnA. Widtsoe. All of these men were either members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles or the First Presidency, and all traveled to the Holy Land to offer up special prayers, blessing that sacred land.<sup>44</sup><br><br>Latter-day Saints continued traveling to the Middle East in the decades that followed. Elder SpencerW. Kimball visited in 1961.<sup>45</sup>That April his entire general conference address was about his trip to the Holy Land.<sup>46</sup>It wasn't long before the BYU Department of Travel Study made a proposal to the BYU Board of Trustees asking them to approve a program in Jerusalem. The matter was referred to the First Presidency. President DavidO. McKay approved the request with a provision that the program be balanced between time in Arab territory and time in Jewish territory.<sup>47</sup>That proviso continues to this day.<br><br>In 1968, under the direction of DanielH. Ludlow, dean of Religious Education, twenty students and two faculty members (Professors LaMarC. Berrett and T.Ellis Rasmussen) inaugurated the Jerusalem study abroad program.<sup>48</sup>Throughout the following years, Church leaders continued coming to the Holy Land: N.Eldon Tanner (1971), HughB. Brown (1971), HaroldB. Lee (1972), GordonB. Hinckley (1972), HowardW. Hunter (1972), NealA. Maxwell (1972),<sup>49</sup>and JamesE. Faust (early 1980s).<br><br>With an expanding Church presence, the mayor of Jerusalem, Teddy Kollek, was introduced to members of the Church. During the mid-1970s he contacted Church leaders in Salt Lake City to see if they were interested in developing a five-acre property on the Mount of Olives. He recommended it be named after Orson Hyde. President Kimball took immediate action. The needed funds were raised through donations, and the garden was dedicated by President Kimball on October 24, 1979. Six apostles also attended the dedication, along with nearly two thousand members of the Church.<sup>50</sup><br><h2><b>The Construction and Dedication of the BYU Jerusalem Center for Near Eastern Studies</b></h2><br>A search for property for BYU was approved as the Jersualem study abroad program continued to grow. Elder HowardW. Hunter made six trips to the Holy Land in 1979. The day before the Orson Hyde Memorial Garden dedication, President N.Eldon Tanner went to see some twenty-six possible land sites. From those he selected seven or eight to show President Kimball. The eventual site of the center on Mount Scopus was not on the list.<sup>51</sup><br><br>The story is told that a party of twelve people went to look at potential properties. The group included SpencerW. Kimball, N.Eldon Tanner, their wives, six members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and others. The last stop of the day was a site slightly south and east of where the current Jerusalem Center building is now located. At some point President Kimball broke off from the others and began to walk northward along the hillside, looking down toward the Kidron Valley. After he had walked a hundred yards or so to a spot overlooking an empty field, he stopped and said, "This is the place."<br><br>President Tanner, who had been following close behind and was accompanied by the other members of the party, then said, "All in favor raise your right hand."<sup>52</sup>When a prophet asks you to raise your hand, it is hard to refuse.<br><br>Suffice it to say that the land President Kimball chose was not for sale.<sup>53</sup>It was disputed land located on property designated as green space. The acquisition of the property and the subsequent building of the Jerusalem Center is, in its own right, as miraculous as were Elder Hyde's travels to dedicate the Holy Land. The project would come directly under the office of the First Presidency, with the university as the chief beneficiary.<sup>54</sup>The First Presidency appointed Elder HowardW. Hunter, assisted by Elder JamesE. Faust, to represent the Church in this building project. The executive oversight committee was chaired by BYU president JeffreyR. Holland.<sup>55</sup>Many others--too many to name--played significant roles in the successful completion of the Jerusalem Center.<br><br>One whom I will mention is RobertP. Thorn. Brother Thorn, who had considerable real estate experience, was asked by the Church if he would go to Jerusalem to oversee the acquisition of the property on Mount Scopus. He anticipated being there for a few weeks. It turned out that navigating and getting approval from various politicians and numerous agencies kept him there for one and a half years.<sup>56</sup><br><br>Construction on the Jerusalem Center started in August 1984 and continued nonstop until 1988.<sup>57</sup>An effort to halt the project began as soon as construction on Mount Scopus began and people found out that the Mormons were the ones doing the building. The Haredi Jewish community, a sect of Orthodox Judaism, feared that the center would provide a foothold for the Church to do missionary activities in the Holy Land.<sup>58</sup>Every sort of pressure possible was brought to bear against the Church and the university. It became an international news item.<sup>59</sup>The Knesset and various government officials and offices were involved. Israelis took both sides of the issue, some supporting cultural and religious diversity and others seeing Mormon proselyting and conversion of anyJew as a loss of Jewish identity.<sup>60</sup><br><br>After a thorough investigation, the attorney general of the State of Israel determined that everything the Mormons had done had been done correctly.<sup>61</sup>In the meantime, the work on thebuilding continued.<br><br>As already mentioned, BYU students moved into the Jerusalem Center on March 8, 1987, prior to its completion. The center was dedicated in a quiet ceremony on May 16, 1989, by President HowardW. Hunter. There was no press. Those present included President Hunter, ThomasS. Monson, BoydK. Packer, JeffreyR. Holland, personnel of the Jerusalem Center,<sup>62</sup>and a few BYU faculty and Arabic-speaking students who happened to be at the Jerusalem Center on the day it was dedicated.<sup>63</sup><br><br>The impact of the Jerusalem Center has been profound. When the Jerusalem Center was finished, JeffreyR. Holland (then president of BYU) took Mayor Kollek on a tour of the building. Mayor Kollek hardly said anything until the end of the tour, when he said:<br><br><i>You have taken the most beautiful piece of property we could have given you and have done more with it than Ithought possible. I consider it the most beautiful building built in Jerusalem in recent years.</i><sup>64</sup><br><br>Another view of the Jerusalem Center property is provided by the well-known, best-selling author Giles Milton in his book<i>The Riddle and the Knight: In Search of Sir John Mandeville, the World's Greatest Traveller</i>. In his description of modern Jerusalem, Giles Milton wrote:<br><br><i>In the east, the Hebrew University is sprawled across a hilltop, while the Mormons have recently built a university on the northern hills--a vast building occupying the most enviable site in Jerusalem.</i><sup>65</sup><br><br>The first resident director of the Jerusalem Center was DavidB. Galbraith. He was followed by MartinB. Hickman, GeorgeA. Horton, TrumanG. Madsen, S.Kent Brown,<sup>66</sup>PaulH. Peterson, R.J. Snow, ArnoldH. Green, and Eran Hayet. A few years after its dedication, James<b></b>R. Kearl, a former dean of Honors and General Education and, at the time, the associate academic vice president of BYU, was brought on board as the assistant to the university president to oversee the center.<sup>67</sup>He remains in that position today, playing a key role in the ongoing success and operation of the Jerusalem Center. Much of the student program, the maintenance of the building, the humanitarian efforts, and the weekly concert series have been influenced by Professor Kearl. Oversight and approvals for the center continue to come under the direction of BYU's president, currently Kevin<b></b>J Worthen, who in turn reports to the BYU Board of Trustees.<br><br>The arrangement of the local administration at the Jerusalem Center is unique. It consists of Eran Hayet (an Israeli) as the Jerusalem Center's executive director; Tawfic Alawi (a Palestinian Christian) as the associate director responsible for logistics and administration; and a BYU faculty representative, such as myself, who oversees the academic program.<br><h2><b>Hope for the Future of the Holy Land</b></h2><br>Let me conclude by saying a few words about the current situation in the Holy Land. There is no simple way to describe the Holy Land. Jerusalem itself has been continuously inhabited for millennia, during which time it has frequently been the epicenter of religious, political, and cultural conflict. Prophetically, however, we know that these conflicts must be resolved. Isaiah described Jerusalem as a city in which only the righteous will live:<br><br><i>Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion;</i><b><i>put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.</i></b><sup>68</sup><br><br>Our students and those associated with the Jerusalem Center in some ways provide a model of cooperation and peace in the Holy City. Kaye Terry Hanson, from her time as the associate director at the Jerusalem Center (1994–96), observed how the Palestinian and Israeli workers at the center provided a "microcosm" of resolving conflict as "they worked [together] side by side."<sup>69</sup><br><br>I have had similar experiences throughout my tenure at the Jerusalem Center. The center is a model community of students, administrators, faculty, staff, and service volunteers--from varying religious, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds--who live and work together in harmony. In many ways the center establishes an idyllic pattern of what can happen in this sacred land. It is not perfect by any means, but it is moving in the right direction.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, I hope for the day when those who reside in the Holy Land will do so in harmony with one another. It remains unclear to me just how or when the needed events will unfold to bring about this holy status. What remains certain is that the Lord's divine hand will be part of the process.<br><br>There is a story in the Bible that I have reflected on many times. As you may recall, Jacob fled from his brother, Esau, under very unfavorable circumstances. The tension between these two brothers was palpable: "Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob."<sup>70</sup><br><br>Understandably, Jacob was unnerved as he heeded the Lord's command to return to the Holy Land.<sup>71</sup>Jacob petitioned the Lord for protection and prepared in every way possible as he nervously anticipated meeting his brother from whom he had fled years earlier.<sup>72</sup>The Lord's divine intervention was obvious as these two brothers reunited:<br><br><i>And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.</i><br><br><i>And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.</i><br><br><i>And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.</i><br><br><i>And</i><b><i>Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.</i></b><sup>73</sup><br><br>This reconciliation required a softening of the heart from both Esau and Jacob. The thirteenth article of faith reminds us to "hope all things." Brothers and sisters, hope is an essential ingredient that must be maintained throughout our mortal journey. We should not be confused about it and its definition.<br><br>In our everyday language we frequently use the word<i>hope</i>to convey uncertainty. We hope for certain things, knowing the odds are not in our favor. When events transpire contrary to our hope, we nonchalantly take little notice of what it was we had hoped. For example, "I hope I make it to class on time." How unlikely that will be when we have hit the snooze button once too often. Or what about the hope that we won't eat too much over Thanksgiving? Good luck on that one!<br><br>In a religious context, however, hope is defined differently. It is a confident expectation of and longing for the promised blessings of righteousness. It demands from us total trust and confidence. Much like faith, hope is unwavering and active. The outcome is certain. Prophets speak of having "a firm hope"<sup>74</sup>and "a lively hope."<sup>75</sup>The prophet Ether taught, "Whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a better world, yea, even a place at the right hand of God, which hope cometh of faith."<sup>76</sup>Paul said, "For we are saved by hope," and then he added, "If we hope for that [which] we see not, then do we with patience wait for it."<sup>77</sup><br><br>Located north of the Old City, not far from Damascus Gate, is the Garden Tomb. Those who have been there know it well. In the garden is a sign that reads, "Pray for the peace of Jerusalem"--a quote from Psalm 122:6. And so we must. We must hope for and pray for peace.<br><br>President HowardW. Hunter spoke in the Marriot Center a few months prior to the dedication of the Orson Hyde Memorial Garden. He entitled his talk <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a style="color: #33cccc;" href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/howard-w-hunter_all-alike-unto-god/">"All Are Alike Unto God."</a></span><sup>78</sup>President Hunter's message was a reminder that God loves His children--all His children. He said:<br><br><i>We need to discover the supreme truth that indeed our Father is no respecter of persons....</i><br><br><i>At the present time we are engaged in a project of beautifying the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem by a garden, in memory of Orson Hyde, an early apostle of the Church, and the dedicatory prayer he offered on that site.

Orson Hyde departed Nauvoo, Illinois, on April 15, 1840, and returned to Nauvoo on December 8, 1842. Hyde provided limited details about much of his journey to and from Jerusalem. It appears, however, that he used waterways throughout his travels. This type of travel added significantly to the total miles because of meandering rivers and indirect routes. For example, the distance from Amsterdam, the Netherlands, to Regensburg, Germany, using today's Autoroute 3 (Dudelange motorway) is 470 miles. Traveling via the Rhine and Main Rivers adds 109 miles to the trip. Total travel distance from Nauvoo to Jerusalem and back to Nauvoo is estimated to be 18,567 miles. Some of the water routes he traveled include the Ohio River, Atlantic Ocean, Rhine River, Main River, Danube River, Black Sea, Sea of Marmara, Dardanelles, Aegean Sea, Mediterranean Sea, Nile River (different branches in the Nile Delta), Ionian Sea, Adriatic Sea, English Channel, and Mississippi River.<br><br>9. A simple word search from the standard works shows that the word<i>Jerusalem</i>is used 939 times (626 times in the Old Testament, 141 in the New Testament, 148 in the Book of Mormon, 19 in the Doctrine and Covenants, and 5 in the Pearl of Great Price).<br><br>10. 3 Nephi 20:29; see also 3 Nephi 20:33; Ether 13:5, 11; D&amp;amp;C 45:48–53; D&amp;amp;C 77:15; D&amp;amp;C 133:20; Zechariah 2:12; Zechariah 14.<br><br>11. Joseph Smith, quoted by Orson Hyde in<i>HC</i>4:375. In June 1841 Hyde wrote Joseph Smith Jr. while en route to Jerusalem. In his letter he reported progress of his travels and included a copy of a letter he wrote to Solomon Hirschell, the chief rabbi of England (1802–42). Hyde wrote the following in his letter: "About nine years ago, a young man with whom I had had a short acquaintance, and one, too, in whom dwelt much wisdom and knowledge--in whose bosom the Almighty had deposited many secrets, laid his hand upon my head and pronounced these remarkable words." While the letter does not mention a name, from the description it seems likely that the young man he was referring to was Joseph Smith Jr.<br><br>12. Oliver Cowdery,<i>HC</i>2:189.<br><br>13. D&amp;amp;C 109:62–64; emphasis added. Joseph Smith continued to talk about Jerusalem after Orson Hyde's journey to dedicate the Holy Land. During a conference in April 1843, the Prophet said that "Jerusalem must be rebuilt. Judah must return ... before [the] Son of Man will make his appearance" ("Journal, December 1842–June 1844; Book 2, 10 March 1843–14 July 1843," 75, josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal<br>-december-1842-june-1844-book-2-10-march-1843<br>-14-july-1843/83; in Andrew H.

Esplin, and Richard Lyman Bushman (Salt Lake City: Church Historian's Press, 2011), 338–39; see also<i>HC</i>5:337. The details of how these promises will be fulfilled remain unclear.<br><br>14. Due to the death of his mother when he was seven years old, Orson Hyde was placed under the care of a farmer named Nathan Wheeler. Hyde provides very little information about the Wheelers other than that they were a "very good" and "penurious" family (Orson Hyde, quoted in "History of Brigham Young: History of Orson Hyde,"<i>Millennial Star</i>26, no. 47 [19November 1864]: 742).<br><br>15. See Hyde, "History of Brigham Young," 19November 1864, 742. Orson's father, Nathan Hyde, joined the military shortly after his wife passed away and participated in the U.S. campaign against Britain. Nathan drowned when Orson was twelve years old. Orson described his father as "kind and affectionate" and "quick, ­athletic, and naturally witty and cheerful."<br><br>16.

Three days after his baptism, Hyde reported: "The Spirit of the Lord came upon me in so powerful a manner, that I felt like waiting upon no one, and withdrew in private to enjoy the feast alone. This, to me, was a precious season, long to be remembered" (page 761).<br><br>21. D&amp;amp;C 68:1; see also verse 8.<br><br>22.

The story of Joseph Smith asking for money is included in a letter written by Mrs. RalphE. Woolley to MarvinS. Hill, dated May 19, 1955. Woolley, the granddaughter of Orson Hyde, was told the story by her father, JosephS. Hyde. In MarvinS.

Nephi Lowell Morris was the president of the Salt Lake City Stake from 1904 to 1929 (see Andrew Jenson,<i>Encyclopedic History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</i>[Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1941], 761).

Beck to author (18April 2012). Julie Beck's husband, Ramon Beck, is the great-grandson of Joseph Ellison Beck. Joseph Ellison Beck joined the Church in 1842. He and his family migrated to Utah in 1850.<br><br>34.<i>Times and Seasons</i>2, no. 6 (15January 1841): 287; also<i>HC</i>4:274.<br><br>35. See Orson Hyde to Joseph Smith, 17 April 1841, in "Communications,"<i>Times and Seasons</i>2, no. 18 (15July 1841): 482–83. Elder Page wrote Joseph Smith from Philadelphia six months later to explain why he had not left for Jerusalem. Page was noticeably upset with Hyde in his letter for various reasons, including having insufficient funds because of Hyde (see letter from Elder JohnE. Page to the president and council of the Church, 1September 1841, in<i>Journal History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</i>[1841], LDS Church Archives).<br><br>However, in June 1841, Elder GeorgeA. Smith, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, had met Page in Philadelphia and had advised him to catch up to Hyde in England by taking up contributions so that he could sail on a ship named<i>Garrick</i>that was leaving for England in three days. Elder Smith offered to assist Page in every way possible to help him succeed. Page rejected Elder Smith's suggestion, and "Elder Smith subsequently learned that Elder Page had sufficient money, without collections to have taken him through to England" (<i>HC</i>4:372).<br><br>Hyde also wrote Joseph Smith on June 15, 1841, to explain why he had left New York without waiting for Page (see letter in<i>HC</i>372–79; also in "History of Joseph Smith,"<i>Millennial Star</i>18, no. 36 [6September 1856]: 564–68; also in<i>Journal History</i>). This letter by Orson Hyde is important in three ways: (1) It recounts an exchange between himself and Solomon Hirschell, the chief rabbi of England. (2) It is where we learn Joseph Smith told Orson Hyde as early as 1831 that he would travel to Jerusalem and "be a watchman unto the house of Israel." (3) It reveals more details of Hyde's six-hour vision that he experienced in early March of 1840.<br><br>36. Orson Hyde,<i>HC</i>4:387.

In 1842 the<i>Millennial Star,</i>a paper published in Liverpool, wrote of Hyde's travels: "He has been in perils by land and sea, in perils among robbers, in perils among Heathens, Turks, Arabs, and Egyptians; but out of all these things the Lord hath delivered him, and hath restored him in safety to the shores of Europe, where he is tarrying for a little season" ("Highly Interesting from Jerusalem,"<i>Millennial Star</i>2, no.11 [March 1842]: 167; see also<i>HC</i>4:496).<br><br>44.

<h1>s Faith: the Singular Appeal of LDS Doctrine - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The International Center for Law and Religion Studies officially began on January 1, 2000. The choice of date was purposeful, coinciding with the beginning of a new millennium. It also makes it easy for us to remember the answer when we are asked how long the center has been operating.<br><br>In my role as associate director and now director of the center, I interact on an almost daily basis with people from around the world of almost every imaginable religious background--and with many who are not religious at all. Occasionally, usually at a reception or dinner toward the end of a conference, I am asked to explain something about what Mormons believe. Usually someone will want to know what is unique and distinctive about the Church or how it fits with other Christian denominations.<br><br>I have come to welcome opportunities like these because they give me a chance to talk about not only similarities between The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and other faiths but also some of the things that make us different. It is these differences--as well as a few of the ­similarities--that I would like to speak of today.<br><h2><b>Audacious Faith</b></h2><br>I have entitled my remarks "Audacious Faith: Appreciating the Unique Power and Singular Appeal of LDS Doctrine." The<i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>defines the word<i>audacious</i>as "daring, bold, confident, intrepid."<sup>1</sup>I have come to believe that many basic LDS doctrines are audacious in this sense.<br><h2><b>A Peculiar People</b></h2><br>I remember when I was a boy being taught to take pride in the things that make us different. We were taught that Mormons are and should be "a peculiar people"<sup>2</sup>and that we were to be in the world but not of it.<sup>3</sup><br><br>But in the second half of my life, which coincides with the entire life of most in this room, it seems to me that we as a church have become better at explaining and are more inclined to emphasize our similarities with other Christian churches. This is an understandable part of an effort of the Church and its people to be viewed as less odd and more like others. As recently as Mitt Romney's presidential campaigns, the Church and its members were still expected to address the tired, old question of whether Mormons are Christians.<br><br>We have sometimes found ourselves in exasperation repeating the name of the Church: The Church of<i>Jesus Christ</i>of Latter-day Saints. The Church has even changed its logo to emphasize the centrality of Jesus Christ. I, for one, welcome this renewed emphasis on Jesus Christ and His Atonement.<br><br>But it is also true that some of our understandings of even basic doctrines are quite distinctive.<br><h2><b>The Premortal Existence</b></h2><br>I learned this fact as a freshman at Georgetown University. I was assigned to a dormitory called Darnall Hall and a roommate named Tom Warner, who was a good Catholic boy from Queens, New York. His father was a police officer, and Tom was the first person in his family to go to college. He and I became fast friends, and soon I felt that perhaps it was no accident that we had found ourselves as roommates.<br><br>One night while we were lying on our cots, Iasked him, "Tom, do you think we knew each other in the premortal existence?"<br><br>His bedside light snapped on, and he looked at me incredulously: "The premortal existence--what's that?"<br><br>I answered casually, "You know, the pre-earth life, where we lived as spirit children of our Heavenly Father."<br><br>Now he was looking at me like I was from another planet or, perhaps more likely, as if I were a member of a strange religious cult, as others on our dormitory floor had already warned him.<br><br>"There is no such thing as a premortal existence," he said, "and if there is, I wasn't there." His life, he explained, began at conception. Then the light snapped off.<br><br>I was stunned. I thought of myself as a reasonably sophisticated and well-educated person, but I had no idea how unique and unusual the doctrine of the premortal existence is. I had thought it was a shared part of Christian heritage, and although I believe the doctrine has a power and appeal that is very strong, and although there is scriptural and other evidence that many early Christians embraced the doctrine of the premortal existence,<sup>4</sup>it is not a part of orthodox Christian or Protestant theology.<sup>5</sup><br><br>My law school colleague Dean D.Gordon Smith joined the Church as a student here at BYU. The premortal existence, he says, is one of the doctrines that first gripped him. As he explained it:<br><br><i>Even when I was a very young man, questions about cosmic justice occupied my mind, and the teachings about the plan of salvation made sense of a world that seemed unjust and inequitable. Equipped with even a basic understanding of the premortal existence, I can view the varied circumstances of the people in this world neither as a product of chance nor as a reward or punishment for prior behavior but instead as part of a grand plan of learning designed by a loving God. This understanding helps me to remain optimistic that even our deepest trials and most profound struggles have meaning and purpose.</i><br><br>If you think about it, it is an audacious claim that we as human beings are coeternal with God,<sup>6</sup>that we existed with Him through the eternities, and that this earth life is but the middle act in a three-act play,<sup>7</sup>with premortal and postmortal life bookending and giving meaning to mortal life.<br><h2><b>The Godhead</b></h2><br>Consider another very basic Mormon doctrine: the nature of the Godhead. A few years ago at the BYU Law School, we were hosting a conference on religious iconography. An orthodox Christian priest from Oxford University had been invited to participate. He was an imposing fellow who wore dark robes, had a long beard, and wore a heavy cross around his neck. He explained that as part of his preparation for coming to Provo, he had decided to do some homework about what Mormons believe. He didn't want a dry academic account, so he called the Mormon missionaries and invited them over. Can you imagine how nervous they must have been?<br><br>He described them as earnest and polite and a little naïve--a description with which many of us can probably relate. He explained:<br><br><i>I asked them to tell me what was unique and ­different about the Mormon Church, and they began to tell me about how Joseph Smith as a teenager was visited by God the Father and Jesus Christ. Then they showed me a truly remarkable piece of religious iconography. It was a picture of God and Jesus, depicted as two men in white robes and with white hair, standing in the air, with Joseph on the ground leaning back in astonishment.</i><br><br>Like me, you can probably picture the exact illustration from the Gospel Art Kit. Then he projected it onto the screen.<br><br>"What a remarkable piece of religious iconography," he said, "depicting God and Jesus Christ as two men with bodies." This, he explained, was a complete recalculation of the Christian doctrine ofthe Trinity.<br><br>I have to admit I had never thought of this illustration as noteworthy religious iconography. But think about it: it depicts, in an illustration a child can understand, something profound about the nature of God and Jesus Christ.<br><br>God is not a distant, abstract being without body parts or passions; He is a perfect and exalted and embodied man. The implications of this doctrine are rather stunning. When Mormons quote from Genesis that man is created "in the image of God,"<sup>8</sup>that we are His children, it is not a metaphor; it is a rather audacious claim about the nature of God and the nature of man.<br><h2><b>The Nature of God</b></h2><br>Joseph Smith often taught that the most important thing for us to understand is the true nature of God. Only then, he taught, can we understand the true nature of man. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.22?lang=eng#21">Doctrine and Covenants 130:22</a> states:<br><br><i>The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit. Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us.</i><br><br>In the King Follett Sermon, recorded in April 1844, only a few months before he died, Joseph said:<br><br><i>God himself was once as we are now, and is an exalted man, and sits enthroned in yonder heavens!...</i><br><br><i>These are incomprehensible ideas to some, but they are simple. It is the first principle of the gospel to know for a certainty the character of God, and to know that we may converse with Him as one man converses with another.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>This view of God is so audacious that it is dismissed as blasphemous by some and as unbelievable by others. But it is one of the most simple, elegant, and brilliant truths of the restored gospel. God is our Father, and His work and His glory is to bring us home to Him.<sup>10</sup><br><br>Brigham Young put it this way:<br><br><i>When you . . . see our Father, you will see a being with whom you have long been acquainted, and He will receive you into His arms, and you will be ready to fall into His embrace and kiss Him ..., you will be so glad and joyful.</i><sup>11</sup><br><h2><b>Human Nature</b></h2><br>Along with its remarkable teachings about the nature of God, Mormon doctrine propounds one of the most optimistic and progressive understandings of human<i></i>nature that exists in any religious or philosophical account of what it means to be human. This understanding requires us to think positively about ourselves and each other. In Joseph Smith's understanding, not only is God more like us, but we are more like God and are oriented to become even more like God than in many other Christian understandings. Thus for Mormons it is more than metaphor when Christ appealed in His Intercessory Prayer: "That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me."<sup>12</sup><br><br>For those, like me, who may be inclined as a matter of disposition toward melancholy, the account of who we are as human beings and who we may become, which we are taught in the restored gospel, is a powerful antidote to pessimism or discouragement.<sup>13</sup>It is audacious to believe that God uses the simple things of the world (us) to confound the wise. It is audacious to believe that God loves broken things (including us and, in particular, our hearts) and that it is from the crooked timber of humanity (again us) that God accomplishes His ends. It is audacious to believe that when we come unto Him, God gives and shows us our weaknesses that we may be humble and that then, through our faith in Him, He will make weak things strong.<sup>14</sup>It is audacious to believe that we are His children.<br><h2><b>The Restoration</b></h2><br>When I am asked how Mormons fit in with other Christians, I usually emphasize the idea of restoration. I explain that we believe that when Christ was on the earth, He established His Church and gave priesthood authority to the apostles to continue His work after He was gone. In time the doctrines were changed and the priesthood authority was lost. When Joseph Smith received priesthood authority from John the Baptist and Peter, James, and John, it was a restoration of the priesthood authority that existed when Christ had established His Church on the earth. Today the Church is led by apostles and prophets, just as it was when Jesus set up His Church. To be sure, these are audacious claims.<br><br>A few years ago I was sitting in a café in Istanbul overlooking the great Hagia Sophia, now a museum and before that a mosque and before that a Christian church dating back to the year 537.<br><br>I was explaining to a Muslim friend that Mormons are "restoration Christians." He is a law professor and is translating one of my books into Turkish. After listening to my explanation, he looked at me and said, "I like that. I think I'm a restoration Muslim; I'm just waiting for the restoration."<br><h2><b>The Standard of Truth</b></h2><br>The Prophet Joseph understood that what he claimed to have experienced was almost unbelievable. Near the end of his life he said, "I don't blame any one for not believing my history. If I had not experienced what I have, I would not have believed it myself."<sup>15</sup>But Joseph had no choice but to believe what he had seen. As he put it, "For I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it."<sup>16</sup><br><br>Elder JeffreyR. Holland reminded us that it is remarkable that Joseph never once in his life wavered in his testimony, even when he was ­facing death.<sup>17</sup><br><br>But let us recognize the audacity of Joseph's claims and the confidence with which he made them. In the Wentworth Letter, in which Joseph was asked to provide a sketch of the basic history and beliefs of the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Joseph wrote, in addition to the Articles of Faith, what has come to be known as the Standard of Truth.<br><br>Consider the audacity of what he wrote, keeping in mind that this was written in the year 1842, two years before his death at a time when the Church probably had fewer than 25,000 members:<br><br><i>The standard of truth has been erected: no unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing, persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished and the great Jehovah shall say the work is done.</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>We should not be surprised when self-righteous evangelical atheists reserve a special chapter in their book of contempt for the Church. If the very idea and existence of God is ridiculous and irrational, then the testimony of an embodied God who is the Father of our spirits, whose heart beats in sympathy with ours, and who cries over our suffering and weeps with us must be rejected as especially ludicrous.<sup>19</sup><br><h2><b>Critics</b></h2><br>Lehi's dream of the tree of life includes the powerful image of the "great and spacious building" floating as if it were in the air.<sup>20</sup>I sometimes think of the Internet, with its capacity for scorning and flaming others, as the modern equivalent. What I don't understand is why we would think that those who point fingers of scoffing derision and mocking contempt are our friends or have our best interests at heart. Derision and contempt, scoffing and scorn, may have been the stock-in-trade of the cool kids in high school, but aren't we ready to be done with such immature attitudes toward others and the things they hold sacred? There are plenty of religious beliefs held by others with which I do not agree, but it would not occur to me that I am helping someone to the truth by blaspheming, mocking, scorning, or ridiculing their beliefs. Let scoffers scoff, but don't mistake them for friends or for seekers of truth and understanding.<br><h2><b>Noncreedal Christianity</b></h2><br>I also sometimes emphasize that Mormons are noncreedal Christians. Joseph often distinguished The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from other Christian faiths by noting that the Church rejected Christian creeds. The most influential creeds during Joseph's lifetime included the Westminster Confession of Faith, which declared that God "is infinite in being and perfection, a most pure spirit, invisible, without body, parts, or passions."<sup>21</sup>From the First Vision, Joseph knew this to be mistaken. He thought creeds were too limiting of our search and recognition of truth. Indeed, in his expansive imagination, he asserted that the Church embraced all truth, from whatever source. As Joseph Smith put it:<br><br><i>Mormonism is truth; and every man who embraced it felt himself at liberty to embrace every truth: consequently the shackles of superstition, bigotry, ignorance, and priestcraft, falls at once from his neck; and his eyes are opened to see the truth.</i><sup>22</sup><br><br>This is truly audacious. The heavens were opened to Joseph, and he received visions and the gift of translation. Yet he studied German so that he could read Martin Luther's translation of the Bible, Hebrew so that he could better comprehend the Old Testament, and Egyptian because it was related to the language of the Nephites. Virtually everywhere he settled during his ministry, the Prophet Joseph built or planned to build a temple, and next to it he built or planned to build a university.<sup></sup><br><h2><b>Congregationalism</b></h2><br>Another audacious component of Mormon doctrine is the idea that there is no professional clergy in the Church. We are all expected to be ready and worthy to receive a call to serve in whatever position. Sometimes church seems like what Elder Neal A. Maxwell described as a "laboratory of life,"<sup>23</sup>and sometimes, like when I was asked to play the piano as a missionary in Japan, it feels more like "amateur hour." The Holy Spirit does not necessarily make us a competent organist or bishop.<br><br>I love that there is no corporate ladder that we are climbing in the Church. I am grateful that my daughter Ella had a nursery leader who was a former stake president and who adored her and taught her in powerful and simple ways that she is a child of God. I am grateful that another daughter, Sophie, was loved by another member of our ward, a former regional representative, who often asked to hold her during church and who would tell her parents that this little baby was an old soul with incredible wisdom and depth. And you know what? He was right. And I am grateful that our son, Elliot, had Young Men leaders who were very successful in their professional lives but who showed in word and especially in deed that it is possible toput Heavenly Father and our Savior first.<br><br>When we moved to Utah and I began teaching at BYU, my calling was to teach the five-year-olds, and I still have a vivid image of Max, who had stripped down to his underwear in the chapel where we were rehearsing for the Primary program and had flailed furiously as I carried him out to find his parents, screaming at the top of his lungs, "Bishop, save me!" Max, if you are here, I am sorry I was not a better Primary teacher.<br><br>Then I was called to be the bishop of a BYU student ward, and I felt a confidence and a success that had utterly eluded me as a teacher in the Primary. When I was released, I was called to teach the teachers quorum in our home ward, and I went back to feeling like an abject failure, as the boys shot spit wads at me while I was writing on the blackboard. Now those boys are returned missionaries, and a few of them are probably trying to teach Primary kids or young men in the teachers quorum.<br><h2><b>The Price of Mortality</b></h2><br>Mormon doctrine also provides a unique ­perspective on the purpose of mortality, human suffering, and what is sometimes called "the problem of evil" by theologians: How is it that an all-powerful and all-loving God can permit somuchevil and suffering in the world?<br><br>Let me share a story with you about the ­powerful and attractive answer that Latter-day Saint doctrine provides to this question.<br><br>My wife, Deirdre, and I were a two-tuition family at Yale, which is to say that it was not inexpensive. She completed her MBA on the same day I finished my law degree. In fact, we missed each other's college convocations because they were held at the same time. Then we moved to Washington, DC, where Deirdre was working for Paul Mellon and his private art collection and I was clerking for a judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.<br><br>My calling in our ward was Cub Scout leader, and there were two young brothers in my Webelos group. That summer their family was in a terrible car accident. One of the brothers was in critical condition for weeks, and I visited him in the hospital, where he was wrapped nearly head to toe in bandages. This was the early 1990s, when AIDS was not well understood, and this young boy contracted the HIV virus from a blood transfusion. It took many months, but he eventually recovered from most of his injuries, yet at that time being infected with the HIV virus was akin to a death sentence.<br><br>He was asked to speak in Church about what he had learned from his experience. Although he was only twelve, he gave what I think is the most profound and insightful address on the problem of evil that I have ever heard. He said:<br><br><i>Some people have asked me what I did wrong to deserve what happened to me. I'm not perfect, but I'm a good boy, and I know this is not something I deserved.</i><br><br><i>Others have said, "You must be a really strong person for God to give you such a difficult trial."</i><br><br><i>I don't feel strong, and anyway, I don't believe God did this as a reward for my being particularly righteous.</i><br><br><i>No, I don't think this happened because I'm particularly bad or particularly good. I believe it happened because I'm mortal, and this is part of the price of mortality. We come to earth, we exercise our agency, and other people exercise theirs, and sometimes we hurt each other, and sometimes accidents happen.</i><br><br>Think about that--"the price of mortality."<br><br>Let us return to the great Council in Heaven, when Heavenly Father laid out His plan for us and explained that a Savior would be necessary. Lucifer came forward with his own plan that he claimed would save everyone. We often emphasize the distinction between moral agency, which was the defining feature of Heavenly Father's plan, and coercion, which was the defining feature of Lucifer's plan. But as Terryl and Fiona Givens have reminded us, it may not have been the prospect of agency that led a third of the host of heaven to follow Lucifer; perhaps it was the clear and vivid understanding of the pains and suffering that are an inevitable part of exercising that agency in mortal life. Perhaps it was not freedom to choose that was so daunting but a full appreciation of the consequences that follow from moral agency--our own and that of others.<sup>24</sup><br><h2><b>The Closeness and Distance of God</b></h2><br>In the doctrine of the premortal existence we learn something profound about the character of God. He wants us to experience the full range of human life, including the extremes of human suffering that mortality entails, not because He wants or wills our suffering but because He wants and wills our growth and development. He has provided a blueprint and road map--involving the Savior, His Atonement, the ordinances of the gospel, obedience, and repentance--for us to return to Him.<br><br>One of the audacious things Joseph Smith taught was that God is close, not far, and that the heavens are open, not closed, but that did not mean that Joseph had easy access to God at every moment. In a way, and to an extent that might seem paradoxical, there were times when Joseph felt alone, confused, and uncertain about what God's intentions or desires were.<sup>25</sup>God did not save Joseph from the pains of mortality: Joseph lost children, was unjustly imprisoned, saw his people persecuted and driven from their homes as he watched powerlessly from prison, and was ultimately murdered by a mob that likely included people whom he had counted as friends.<br><br>But Joseph taught that God is with us--by our side--and that His love and sympathy are fully extended to us in all our extremities. He does not leave us alone or comfortless, even when we feel alone and in need of comfort. As disciples of Christ, we must be prepared to stand alone, although we are never really alone.<sup>26</sup>God is powerful and "mighty to save,"<sup>27</sup>but He also refrains from intervening too much in human affairs, lest we forfeit the full impact of the lessons of mortality.<sup>28</sup><br><h2><b>Religious Freedom</b></h2><br>The mission of the International Center for Law and Religion Studies is to promote freedom of religion and belief for all people in all places. This comes naturally because for Mormons, religious freedom is, quite literally, an article of faith.<sup>29</sup>It is also one of our most basic doctrines.<sup>30</sup><br><br>Religious freedom has powerful appeal even to those from religious traditions that are often thought of as being suspicious of religious freedom. A friend of mine, Lena Larsen, is a Muslim from Norway.<sup>31</sup>Recently Lena told me she reads the Koran every year during Ramadan, the Islamic month of fasting.<br><br>"Each time I find something different," she said, echoing my own view about the value of rereading the Book of Mormon.<br><br>During one recent reading she noticed a powerful defense of religious freedom in the story of Noah. We are familiar with Noah and the ark from the Old Testament and Sunday School, but there is a version in the Koran as well. In that telling of the story, Noah had a rebellious son who wouldn't get on the ark. Even when the rain was falling, his son scrambled up a mountain as the ark floated by, and Noah pled with his son to get on board.<br><br>Noah said, "O my son, come aboard with us and be not with the disbelievers."<sup>32</sup><br><br>The exchange involved an Arabic term that is intimate and endearing:<i>yabunayya,</i>which is a very sweet and caring way of saying "O my son."<br><br>Noah's son replied, "I will take refuge on a mountain to protect me from the water."<sup>33</sup><br><br>Noah, Lena said to me sadly, let his son go. "When I read these verses," she said, "I feel Noah's pain. As a caring father, he wants the best for his son, but he has to accept that the son chooses his own destiny." On a personal level, Lena told me, this means that "religious freedom includes the right for every individual to choose freely."<br><h2><b>Similarities with Other Religions</b></h2><br>Many of the truths of the restored gospel find interesting expression in the beliefs of other people.<br><br>For example, my daughter Ella and I were visiting the sacred Daoist mountain of Wudang in China. As we climbed up the mountain toward the Dayue celestial palace, we noticed the railings were covered in padlocks. One interesting feature of these padlocks was that they did not have a keyhole or a combination. Once you locked them, they could not be unlocked. Our guide explained in halting English, "Honeymoon lovers will carve their names on the lock and then lock it to the railing so that their love will last forever. Or someone will engrave the name of a grandparent who has died so that they can be locked together for eternity." This, of course, reflects the deep desire for belonging and connection that we see realized in the sealing ordinances of the temple.<br><br>A few weeks ago at a conference at Oxford University, a distinguished Jewish professor from Israel, Asher Maoz, expressed the amazement he felt when visiting Temple Square and seeing a depiction of the temple's baptismal font. He noted the similarities with the Jewish<i>mikveh</i>bath, which is a washing and immersion ritual in the Jewish faith that is used in the ceremony for when someone converts to Judaism.<sup>34</sup><br><br>I have been helping organize programs in Myanmar (also known as Burma) in partnership with a leading Buddhist monk, a Catholic cardinal, and the Myanmar Council of Churches. In August I was at a Buddhist pagoda in Bagan, Myanmar, where there was a large statue of the Buddha. When I was looking up at him from close range, his facial expression was stern; at thirty feet back he had a slight smile; and further back still, from the very back of the large room, he appeared to be smiling broadly.<br><br>My Buddhist friend explained, "The rich and powerful would pray in front, and Buddha looks down at them sternly; the shopkeepers and professionals (including the professors, she said pointedly) were in the middle, and Buddha has a slight smile for them; and the poorest farmers and peasants would pray from the back, and Buddha felt closest and most warmly toward them."<br><br>I couldn't help recalling the scriptural injunction that the first will be last and the last will be first in the kingdom of heaven.<sup>35</sup><br><br>Recently I was at the magnificent Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon, Myanmar, with Anshin Thondara, who is a Buddhist monk I admire greatly. I asked him what he thinks about when he prays. He told me he reflects on the character traits of Buddha--his compassion, his wisdom, his patience, and his love--and tries to implant them in his heart. This has affected my prayers and my meditation, as I now pray to inculcate specific traits of the Savior.<sup>36</sup><br><h2><b>With Full Purpose of Heart</b></h2><br>Recently I was watching carpool karaoke on YouTube from an episode of<i>The Late Late Show with James Corden</i>that featured the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Corden complimented Flea for his skill as a bass player, saying that he admired how committed he was to his playing.<br><br>Flea brightened noticeably and said that it was something he had learned from reggae artist Bob Marley. He quoted from a book Marley had written, saying, "The only thing that really mattered when you're playing music was the motivation and the intensity and commitment to what you were doing in the moment." This was the key, Flea said, to his success as a rock musician.<sup>37</sup><br><br>I have been thinking about being fully committed. In the gospel context, being fully committed is often expressed as being engaged "with full purpose of heart." The Book of Mormon speaks of the importance of following the Savior "with full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God, but with real intent."<sup>38</sup><br><br>I love the verse in 3 Nephi in which the Savior said:<br><br><i>O ye house of Israel whom I have spared, how oft will I gather you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, if ye will repent and return unto me with full purpose of heart.</i><sup>39</sup><br><h2><b>Judge Wallace</b></h2><br>Not long ago I participated in a two-week training program on religion and the rule of law in China. The students in the class were professors, graduate students, religious leaders, judges, and government officials from all over China. The faculty members consisted of about a dozen law professors and judges from eight or ten different countries. We had invited Judge Clifford Wallace, an emeritus chief judge of the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, to participate.<br><br>Judge Wallace has visited China at least once a year since 1974 and is well known throughout the country. He joined the Church as a young adult and has served as a stake president and temple president in San Diego.<br><br>One of the students asked Judge Wallace what his religious beliefs were and how they affected his work as a judge.<br><br>Judge Wallace answered with the textbook answer I have heard from many U.S. judges--that his religious beliefs do not affect his work as a judge because he has taken an oath to uphold and follow the Constitution and the laws of the United States.<br><br>The student pressed, asking, "But what are your personal religious beliefs?"<br><br>Judge Wallace answered in a way that made a deep impression on me. "I'm a Mormon," he said, "a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints." He paused for a moment and then continued: "And I'm a believing and faithful member of my church. I really believe it. I don't just believe part of it or believe it some of the time. I believe all of it all of the time. It teaches me that we are all created in the image of God and that we are all His children. It teaches me that I have to love and show respect to everyone."<br><h2><b>Ironic Distance and Skeptical Detachment</b></h2><br>I think our era is often marked by those who hold something back, who maintain "ironic distance" or "skeptical detachment."Some of us are like little chicks, running hither and fro. But I believe that what Flea said about being a rock musician is just as true of us when we are trying to live the gospel: If we are not fully committed, we will be overcome with doubt or performance anxiety. We can't be too worried about how we look. If we are fully committed, we will live fully, joyfully, and audaciously. We can dance as if no one is watching.<br><br>Earlier this month, after spending the better part of a week at BYU, a scholar from Lebanon told me why he thought Mormons were going to be so successful in the coming century: "Young Mormons are going to get educations, get married, and have children, while the rest of America is going in a different direction."<br><br>He probably has an exaggerated sense of how different we are from the rest of the culture, but in the world in which we live, it is actually quite radically counter-cultural to do these rather ordinary-seeming things. In a country in which almost half of all children are born to single mothers,<sup>40</sup>we can be peculiar people by getting an education, getting and staying married, and having and raising responsible and respectful children.<br><h2><b>Audacious Faith</b></h2><br>Like Judge Wallace, I too count myself as a believer--someone fully committed and someone who strives to live the gospel with full purpose of heart. Everything I think and everything I believe is probably in some way affected by my faith. Ibelieve in the power of love because of my faith in a Heavenly Father who loves His children. I believe in truth because I believe in a God who is beholden to truth. I believe in goodness and beauty and in light and right because I believe that God is the Creator of this universe and that He radiates these characteristics.<sup>41</sup><br><br>I believe Joseph Smith when he said that LDS doctrine embraces all truth and that there are great and marvelous things yet to be revealed. Ibelieve we should strive to be a peculiar people. I love the truths that can be found in other religions, but I believe in the unique and singular restoration of Christ's Church, with living apostles and prophets and with priesthood authority, which authorizes those agents to act with the authority of God.<br><br>Joseph Smith revealed a tremendous volume of holy writ. Recently I have been reading the same chapter of scripture, preferably out loud, each day for a month as I have tried to really internalize the scriptures. Each month I choose a new chapter. This month I have been reading section 93 of the Doctrine and Covenants. If you want to know what I mean by audacious faith, try reading ­section 93 every day for a month.<br><br>It is audacious to believe that God has a tangible, perfected body, that He communicates with His Children today, and that His Church has been restored and is led by prophets and apostles. It is audacious to believe that we can receive personal revelation pertinent to our own lives and that of our family; that the priesthood has been restored to the earth; and that families can be sealed and bound together in cords that tie past, present, and future generations into eternal relationships. It is audacious to believe that God is our Father--really our Father--and that we are His children--really His children. We have every reason to be fearless and bold, confident and courageous in our audacious faith.<br><br>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Brett G.

"audacious" [definition 2]). Occasionally Mormons, especially in the Prophet Joseph's day, were accused of being audacious in this sense as well.

TerrylL. Givens explained:<br><br><i>Of all the Christian doctrines Mormonism purported to restore, few have been so thoroughly eclipsed in Christian history as the soul's pre-mortal existence. Both Semitic and Greek sources fed into early church traditions of ante-mortal humans that were widespread though not universal.

From the same era, the</i>Apocalypse of Abraham<i>(70–150 CE) describes "a multitude of tribes who existed previously" along with "the ones I have prepared to be born of [Abraham] and to be called my people." Even more authoritative--especially in the early Christian centuries--was the</i>Wisdom of Solomon,<i>dating from the first or second century BCE, and included in the first known listing of Christian canonical writings, the Muratorian Canon of the second century.

A few years later, when I told Deirdre, the Catholic girl I was falling in love with, about the premortal existence, I took it even worse when she laughed out loud at me. But Deirdre, who joined the Church three years later and is now my eternal partner, will tell you that the doctrine of the premortal existence was one of the things that took hold of her heart and would not let her go.<br><br>6. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.29?lang=eng#28">See D&amp;amp;C 93:29</a>: "Man was also in the beginning with God.

The scriptures describe it as our first estate (see Jude 1:6; Abraham 3:26, 28). Act 2, from birth to the time of resurrection, is "The Second Estate."

Like immortality, this gift is made possible through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.

Joseph Smith also said in the King Follett Sermon:<br><br><i>You don't know me; you never knew my heart. No man knows my history. I cannot tell it: I shall never undertake it.

I have actually seen a vision; and who am I that I can withstand God, or why does the world think to make me deny what I have actually seen? For I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it; at least I knew that by so doing I would offend God, and come under condemnation.</i><br><br>17.

When Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum started for Carthage to face what they knew would be an imminent martyrdom, Hyrum read these words to comfort the heart of his brother:</i><br><br><i>"Thou hast been faithful; wherefore . . . thou shalt be made strong, even unto the sitting down in the place which I have prepared in the mansions of my Father.</i><br><br><i>"And now I, Moroni, bid farewell . . . until we shall meet before the judgment-seat of Christ"</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.37,38?lang=eng#36">Ether 12:37–38</a>; see also <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/135.5?lang=eng#4">D&amp;amp;C 135:5</a>].<br><br><i>A few short verses from the 12th chapter of Ether in the Book of Mormon. Before closing the book, Hyrum turned down the corner of the page from which he had read, marking it as part of the everlasting testimony for which these two brothers were about to die. I hold in my hand that book, the very copy from which Hyrum read, the same corner of the page turned down, still visible. Later, when actually incarcerated in the jail, Joseph the Prophet turned to the guards who held him captive and bore a powerful testimony of the divine authenticity of the Book of Mormon. Shortly thereafter pistol and ball would take the lives of these two testators.</i><br><br><i>As one of a thousand elements of my own testimony of the divinity of the Book of Mormon, I submit this as yet one more evidence of its truthfulness. In this their greatest--and last--hour of need, I ask you: would these men blaspheme before God by continuing to fix their lives, their honor, and their own search for eternal salvation on a book (and by implication a church and a ministry) they had fictitiously created out of whole cloth?</i><br><br><i>. . . They were willing to die rather than deny the divine origin and the eternal truthfulness of the Book of Mormon.</i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/10/safety-for-the-soul?lang=eng">Safety for the Soul</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2009]<br><br>18.

But what if we are wrong and LDS doctrine is untrue, or what if we are wrong and God does not exist? I am willing to be wrong in this way if it means believing and treating others as though they are children of God, created in His image with the potential to become beings like unto a perfect and perfectly loving God. I would rather make the mistake of attributing meaning and love to a universe that is meaningless and indifferent than vice versa. And besides, I do not think we are wrong. I believe love is the most powerful force in the universe, and I am not sure we have any reason to believe love is real if we reject the existence of God.<br><br>20. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.26?lang=eng#25">1 Nephi 8:26</a>.

Letter from Joseph Smith to Isaac Galland, 22March 1839, "Communications,"<i>Times and Seasons</i>1, no. 4 (February 1840): 53; quoted in Givens,<i>Wrestling,</i>38.<br><br>Joseph Smith also said, "The Latter-day Saints have no creed, but are ready to believe all true principles that exist, as they are made manifest from time to time" (<i>HC</i>5:215; quoted in Givens,<i>Wrestling,</i>38).<br><br>And, as paraphrased by Terryl L. Givens, the Prophet stated: "If the Presbyterians have any truth, embrace that. If the Baptists and Methodists have truth, embrace that too. Get all the good in the world if you want to come out a pure Mormon" (sermon given 23 July 1843; in Givens,<i>Wrestling,</i>38; see<i>HC</i>5:517 and<i>The Words of Joseph Smith: The Contemporary Accounts of the Nauvoo Discourses of the Prophet Joseph,</i>comp. and ed. Andrew F. Ehat and Lyndon W. Cook [Provo: BYU Religious Studies Center, 1980], 234).<br><br>On another occasion Joseph said, "The first and fundamental principle of our holy religion is" to be free "to embrace all, and every item of truth, without limitation or without being circumscribed or prohibited by the creeds or superstitious notions of men, or by the dominations of one another" (letter from Joseph Smith to Isaac Galland,<i>Times and Seasons,</i>54; quoted in Givens,<i>Wrestling,</i>38).<br><br>Givens noted that Joseph pushed "in the direction of expansive addition rather than contracting reduction: 'we don't ask any people to throw away any good they have got we only ask them to Come &amp;amp; get more'" (<i>Wrestling,</i>38; quoting Joseph Smith, 22 January 1843; see<i>HC</i>5:259; see also<i>Words of Joseph,</i>159).<br><br>23. Neal A. Maxwell,<i>All These Things Shall Give Thee Experience</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1979), 44. Elder Maxwell said:<br><br><i>Thus there ought to be expectations that in this laboratory of life we will actually see each other in the process of being remodeled, sometimes succeeding and sometimes failing. We will obviously be aware of others who are also in the "furnace of affliction." However, we will not always have a smooth, ready answer to the question, "Why me?" "Why now?" "Why this?"--for as Moroni observed, "Ye receive no witness until</i><b><i>after</i></b><i>the trial of your faith."</i><i>(<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.6?lang=eng#5">Ether 12:6</a>; emphasis added.)</i><br><br>24. Terryl and Fiona Givens wrote:<br><br><i>The Mormon conception of the war in heaven has ill served us in the simplistic, caricatured forms it so often takes. More must have been involved than simple choice between freedom and coercion. Depriving the human family of agency and accountability could only have been tempting to sons and daughters of God if the alternative were unthinkably terrible. The most reasonable explanation of heavenly division was not over some vague risk of failure that we bravely accepted while others cravenly retreated. More likely, as</i>[Congregationalist minister Edward]<i>Beecher argued, was the very real, vivid, inevitable pageant of warfare, genocide, infant mortality, an almost universal anguish for sin and personal bereavement that, once unfolded to our eyes in celestial councils, threatened to derail the entire plan, drawing away a third of the heavenly hosts.</i>[<i>The Crucible of Doubt: Reflections on the Quest for Faith</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2014), 112–13]<br><br>25. See, for example, <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.1,2,3?lang=eng#1">D&amp;amp;C 121:1–3</a>:<br><br><i>O God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place?</i><br><br><i>How long shall thy hand be stayed, and thine eye, yea thy pure eye, behold from the eternal heavens the wrongs of thy people and of thy servants, and thine ear be penetrated with their cries?</i><br><br><i>Yea, O Lord, how long shall they suffer these wrongs and unlawful oppressions, before thine heart shall be softened toward them, and thy bowels be moved with compassion toward them?</i><br><br>26. See, for example, <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/14.18?lang=eng#17">John 14:18</a>: "I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you."<br><br>27. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.19?lang=eng#p18">2 Nephi 31:19</a>:<br><br><i>And now, my beloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this strait and narrow path, I would ask if all is done? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for ye have not come thus far save it were by the word of Christ with unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save.</i><br><br>28. One of the most audacious beliefs of the Church is its understanding of heaven and the afterlife. Joseph Smith was ridiculed for rejecting the Christian conception of hell as a fire of brimstone. His vision of heaven, with its three degrees of glory, is a much sunnier place.<br><br>I was recently having a conversation with my Protestant friend Seng Mai Aung in Myanmar. I asked her what she thought heaven would be like, and she said there would be no families or relationships like we have on earth, but those who were saved would be subsumed into God's love. The idea of being swallowed up into God's love is in a way an attractive and comforting idea, especially in contrast with the pains and suffering of earthly life, but Joseph's vision of heaven was very different. Human beings will retain their identities, and human relationships may endure. Heaven is not so much a place as a way of being and a set of relationships, familial and congregational. Every kingdom of glory is far superior to earth life, but even celestial life will be recognizably human: we will live in families, maintain relationships, and progress together.<br><br>This idea of being together with our families in eternal relationships is one of the audacious and appealing aspects of Mormon doctrine, but it is rather overwhelming. As a young missionary serving in Japan, my companion and I were teaching a beautiful family--a mother, a father, and two young children. Everything was going well. They were accepting gospel principles and were especially drawn to the idea of family home evening. They invited us over nearly every Monday so that we could have family home evening with them.<br><br>I thought it would be a good idea to prepare a lesson about eternal families. "Wouldn't it be wonderful to know that you can be together with your family forever?" I said. Then, looking at the father, I asked, "What would you think if it were possible that your marriage could last forever, not just until death?"<br><br>Something completely unexpected happened. He became uncomfortable and gave an equivocal answer. Having never been married, and seeing his apparently happy home life, I had assumed that he would want that relationship to last forever. But forever is a long time, and if our relationships are broken or unhealthy, the idea of them being eternal may not seem like such a good thing.<br><br>From the beginning Joseph was ridiculed for his doctrine that human beings are coeternal with God and have the capacity and destiny to become beings like unto our Father in Heaven. Some critics have ridiculed Mormons as "god makers." But Jesus Himself was a god maker: He urged His disciples to be one, as He and His Father are one (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/28.10?lang=eng#p9">3 Nephi 28:10 </a>and <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/35.2?lang=eng#1">D&amp;amp;C 35:2</a>), and to become perfect (meaning complete) as He and His Father are perfect (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/5.48?lang=eng#p47">Matthew 5:48</a> and <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.48?lang=eng#p47">3 Nephi 12:48</a>); and He taught that we are "joint-heirs with Christ" of the kingdom of God (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rom/8.17?lang=eng#p16">Romans 8:17</a>). Joseph had the audacity and vision to understand that these promises are not metaphors or gestures but are to be taken literally.<br><br>29. The eleventh article of faith of the Church states:<br><br><i>We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may.</i><br><br>30. Joseph Smith said:<br><br><i>The Saints can testify whether I am willing to lay down my life for my brethren. If it has been demonstrated that I have been willing to die for a "Mormon." I am bold to declare before Heaven that I am just as ready to die in defending the rights of a Presbyterian, a Baptist, or a good man of any other denomination; for the same principle which would trample upon the rights of the Latter-day Saints would trample upon the rights of the Roman Catholics, or of any other denomination who may be unpopular and too weak to defend themselves.</i><br><br><i>It is a love of liberty which inspires my soul--civil and religious liberty to the whole of the human race.</i>[<i>HC</i>5:498; see also<i>Teachings of Presidents: Joseph Smith,</i>345]<br><br>Elder Bruce R. McConkie said:<br><br><i>Freedom of worship is one of the basic doctrines of the gospel. Indeed, in one manner of speaking it is the most basic of all doctrines, even taking precedence over the nature and kind of being that God is, or the atoning sacrifice of the Son of God, or the vesting of priesthood and keys and saving power in the one true church. By this we mean that if there were no freedom of worship, there would be no God, no redemption, and no salvation in the kingdom of God.</i>[<i>A New Witness for the Articles of Faith</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1985), 655; quoted in W.Cole DurhamJr., "The Doctrine of Religious Freedom," BYU devotional address, 3April 2001]<br><br>Religious freedom has a powerful appeal. Katrina Lantos Swett, an LDS member of the U.S. Commission on Religious Freedom, noted, "History is not kind to nor does it ultimately reward those who trample on the religious rights and freedoms of others" ("The State of Religious Freedom in the World,"<i>Clark Memorandum</i>, fall 2015, 6).<br><br>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland praised Swett's "conspicuous devotion and unstinting service" in living the gospel ("Katrina Lantos Swett: A Guardian of Freedom,"<i>Clark Memorandum,</i>fall 2015, 11).<br><br>Joseph Smith said:<br><br><i>If I esteem mankind to be in error, shall I bear them down? No. I will lift them up, and in their own way too, if I cannot persuade them my way is better; and I will not seek to compel any man to believe as I do, only by the force of reasoning, for truth will cut its own way.</i>[<i>HC</i>5:499; quoted in<i>Teachings of Presidents: Joseph Smith</i>, 345]<br><br>31. Lena Larsen and I have worked together with a Lutheran colleague of hers, Tore Lindholm, for years on a program on sharia and human rights in Indonesia, or, as Tore said his skeptical colleagues described it, "fire and water." This program, by the way, has just been expanded into a two-year master's degree program at Muhammadiyah University in Indonesia.<br><br>32. Koran 11:42 (Saheeh International Translation):<br><br><i>And it sailed with them through waves like mountains, and Noah called to his son who was apart [from them], "O my son, come aboard with us and be not with the disbelievers."</i><br><br>33. Koran 11:43:<br><br><i>[But] he said, "I will take refuge on a mountain to protect me from the water." [Noah] said, "There is no protector today from the decree of God, except for whom He gives mercy." And the waves came between them, and he was among the drowned.</i><br><br>34. See Judith Baskin, Shimon Gibson, and David Kotlar, s.v. "mikveh," in<i>Encyclopaedia Judaica,</i>ed. Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik, 2nd ed., vol. 14 (Detroit: Macmillan Reference, 2007), 225, go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve<br>.do?resultListType=RELATED<br>_DOCUMENT&amp;amp;userGroupName<br>=byuprovo&amp;amp;inPS=true&amp;amp;contentSegment<br>=9780028660974&amp;amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;amp;isBOBIndex=<br>true&amp;amp;docId=GALE|CX2587513881#225:<br><br><i></i>Mikveh,<i>a pool or bath of clear water, immersion in which renders ritually clean. ..</i><i>.

We can learn much from other religious traditions. When I heard Anshin's answer, I thought about my own prayers, which often resemble a laundry list of things I am thankful for and an even longer list of petitions or requests. I was a little embarrassed that I didn't spend time in my prayers thinking about and praying to be imbued with the character traits of our Heavenly Father and Savior. Recently in my prayers and as I meditate I have tried to focus on specific characteristics of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, and I pray that I may be endowed with a greater measure of these characteristics. Not surprisingly, when Ilooked into it, this was something Joseph Smith had understood.<br><br>37. "Red Hot Chili Peppers Carpool Karaoke,"<i>The Late Late Show with James Corden,</i>YouTube video, 13 June 2016, 6:45–7:23, youtube.com/watch?v=cfudXO_vzWk.<br><br>38. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.13?lang=eng#p12">2 Nephi 31:13</a>:<br><br><i>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I know that if ye shall follow the Son, with full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God, but with real intent, repenting of your sins, witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take upon you the name of Christ, by baptism--yea, by following your Lord and your Savior down into the water, according to his word, behold, then shall ye receive the Holy Ghost; yea, then cometh the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost; and then can ye speak with the tongue of angels, and shout praises unto the Holy One of Israel.</i><br><br>39. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/10.6?lang=eng#p5">3 Nephi 10:6</a>.<br><br>40.

I have a friend, Neville Rochow, who is a successful barrister from Australia and who joined the Church as a young adult. He told me that what initially grabbed him and would not let him go was the concept expressed in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.36?lang=eng#p35">D&amp;amp;C 93:36</a> that "the glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth."<br><br>Neville told me:<br><br><i>This harmonized with an eternity that articulates the highest in this life into an unending exploration of perfection: family and love. There is a beautiful coalition of absolutes: light, truth, intelligence, and love. Nothing had touched me in heart and mind with such power or wonderment. It captivated me in a way that Icould not deny. All fused into the power of an eternal Atonement. It left indelible impressions on the soul and the heart. In short, once I understood this in the context of the Restoration, the result was conversion. That is why I have remained even when it was unfashionable, inconvenient, and unpopular.</i><br><br>I believe we are eternal beings, intelligences without beginning or end (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.29?lang=eng#p28">D&amp;amp;C 93:29</a>), and also spirit children of our Heavenly Father created in His image, and that as His children our divine destiny is to become beings like unto Him. This does not mean we will ever supplant or become equal to God; He will always be our God and our Father. But the eternal pattern of parents and children is more like the mortal pattern of parents and children than many religious doctrines would have us believe.<br><br>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>a Believe: BYU, A Visionary House - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Over the past several decades my wife, Lisa, faithfully stood at our door to send our children off as they left our home for school. Without exception, she would call to them--usually in her pajamas--and say, "Stand up straight, smile, and remember who you are! You're a Richardson, a child of God!"<br><br>Without taking a breath, she would then say our family motto: "Reverence. Respect. Responsibility. Resourcefulness."<br><br>And then, with the excitement of a cheerleader, she would roll her arms and say the final word: "Reeesolve."<br><br>Oh, but wait, she wasn't quite finished. She would cap it all off with an enthusiastic "Be a light!"<br><br>After our children heard this charge nearly every day of their young lives, is it any wonder that this ritual has been forever engrained in their memories--and in the memories of their friends and quite possibly of our neighbors?<br><br>With this image fresh in your mind, I would like to focus on the first part of my wife's simple but profound instruction: "Stand up straight, smile, and remember who you are." BYU has impacted my ability to stand up straight, has influenced why I smile, and has greatly molded who I am today. I have been privileged to be part of this university as a student, a professor, and now an administrator for more than three decades.<br><br>I know what you are thinking, and yes, three decades is a very long time--and yes, I am old. After all these years you would think that I would know my way around campus, which I do; understand more about honor and integrity from the Honor Code, which I do; know all of "The Cougar Fight Song," which I do; and know and enjoy BYU's history and culture, which I do. Yet there are certain things about BYU that I earnestly hope I will <i>never</i> forget.<br><br>President Ezra Taft Benson once said, "It is our privilege to store our memories with good and great thoughts and bring them out on the stage of our minds at will."<sup>1</sup> Sadly, remembering even the good and great thoughts can be difficult.<br><br>I am confident that you, of all people, understand this well. After all, you have been taking quizzes and midterms lately and probably know that sick feeling in which your head is like a balloon with a small hole and all your preparation at the library is leaking out at an alarming rate as you make your way to the Testing Center. Oh sure, you try and pump your head up again by quickly reading through the stack of note cards as you walk, but you know deep down that all the good stuff is leaking out just as fast as you are putting itin.<br><br>There is great power in knowledge, but it seems that there is even greater power in remembering. President SpencerW. Kimball once asked, "When you look in the dictionary for the most important word, do you know what it is?"<br><br>He then answered, "It could be <i>remember.</i>"<sup>2</sup><br><br>With everything you have tucked away, there are some things you should never forget--like wisdom. More than knowledge and facts, wisdom deals with applied knowledge coupled with experience and good sense. It was Alma who admonished his son Helaman, "Remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth."<sup>3</sup> No wonder President Kimball said, "Our greatest need is to remember," and emphasized that "<i>remember</i> is the word. <i>Remember</i> is the program."<sup>4</sup><br><br>It is not unusual for people to use strategies or objects to help them remember things that are important. Everyone knows about tying a string around one's finger, but I have never met anyone who has actually used this technique. Others use rhyming patterns, flash cards, repetition, or other devices to create, categorize, or even trigger a memory. Some people save mementos<i>. </i>More than just a keepsake or a souvenir, a memento<i> </i>is an object with the purpose of helping one to remember. In fact, the word <i>memento</i> comes from Latin, in which it literally means "remember!" (with an exclamation point, no less).<br><br>I would like to share four personal BYU mementos<i> </i>that continue to help me in my quest to stand up straight, smile, and remember who I am. I realize that some of you may be thinking, "What is the value of this little show-and-tell?"<br><br>Consider Elder JeffreyR. Holland's counsel as my response:<br><br><i>We who have already walked that portion of life's path that you are now on try to call back to you something of what we have learned. We shout encouragement. We try to warn of pitfalls or perils along the way. Where possible we try to walk with you and keep you close to our side.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1995/04/our-priesthood-legacy?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>5</sup></a><br><br>So let's take a walk together.<br><h2><b>Memento 1: A Chemistry 105 Exam</b></h2><br>One treasured memento from my BYU past is a Chemistry 105 exam. In truth, of all the hundreds of papers, quizzes, and exams from my undergraduate degree, this is the only academic memento<i> </i>I saved from my <i>entire</i> undergraduate experience.<br><br>I vividly remember watching the professor hand a big stack of exams to the person on the front row and say, "Find your exam and pass the pile along." This was long before FERPA laws protected privacy, so public humiliation or adoration (depending on how you performed) was always a looming possibility. I hastily retrieved my exam and hurried out of class.<br><br>As I was walking out of the building, I quickly glanced at the exam and saw the number 76 scrawled across the top in red pen--76? I quickly stuffed the exam into my backpack. I felt as if someone had punched me in the stomach. My mind raced and I started thinking that obviously I wasn't smart enough to be at BYU, for surely everyone else in the class had scored much higher than I had. I envisioned my fellow classmates celebrating together at the Cougareat and toasting their success with chocolate milk.<br><br>The number 76 kept flashing over and over in my mind as I walked to my apartment by going down the stairs south of campus leading to the Botany Pond. Nearing the bottom of the stairs, Ipulled the dreaded exam from my backpack, hoping that somehow I had read my score incorrectly. But sure enough, that red 76 was still there.<br><br>Then I saw something I hadn't noticed before. My heart raced when I saw a tiny minus sign. You see, I didn't get a 76 on this exam, I <i>missed</i> 76! And sure enough, in the corner was the number 24! Surely this is the lowest score in BYU history given to someone who actually tried to do well.<br><br>I was so stunned that my first impulse was to jump into the Botany Pond, swim to the bottom, and hide from the entire world. Little did I know that the Botany Pond was less than three feet deep, so that plan would have also received a score of 24, as it too would have been doomed to failure.<br><br>Now you may ask, "Why in the world did you save that particular exam as your only memento<i> </i>of your BYU undergraduate academic experience?"<br><br>I saved it because this experience impacted and shaped me in significant ways--ways I hope to never forget. I am not proud of failing--or of failing with such absolute certainty. What happened next, however, was something that I hope I will always remember. Somehow I resisted the urge to pack all my belongings into my car, drive home, and leave BYU and all my humiliation in the rearview mirror. It was during this time that I came across a quote that read, "Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."<sup>6</sup><br><br>My mother used to tell her children that we were of "pioneer stock." I wasn't sure if I really knew what that meant when I was younger, but I did know the stories about crossing the plains. They were usually filled with unbearable challenges, setbacks, and seemingly impossible odds. And at the end of the day the pioneers circled their wagons, built a fire, sang, and danced--or at least that is the way I remembered the stories. And what was their theme song? "Come, Come, Ye Saints."<br><br><i></i>I always thought this was a strange song for those who were hungry, fatigued, and at the brink of devastation. One verse, for example, reads, "And should we die before our journey's through, Happy day! All is well!"<sup>7</sup><br><br>All is well? Anybody could see that all was <i>not</i> well. And just who were these overly optimistic people anyway? Apparently they were my people. And now, years later, they help me to remember just who I am and what it means to be of pioneer stock.<br><br>Years ago I was sitting on the stand in a chapel in Europe singing "Come, Come, Ye Saints." Aleader leaned over and whispered, "You know, the Polish translation of this song is quite different from the English version."<br><br>"Really?" I countered.<br><br>"It doesn't really read, 'All is well! All is well!'"<br><br>I looked at him somewhat surprised.<br><br>"The real translation," he said, "is 'Not so bad, not so bad.'"<sup>8</sup><br><br>I couldn't help but quietly chuckle. Then I thought of the pioneers who might not have always described their own circumstances as being "all is well." But I could see how with their expanded vision and tremendous dedication they could say, "This is not so bad, not so bad," and then with a deep breath take yet another step and continue to forge on.<br><br>Oh, to be of pioneer stock! Regardless of your heritage, we can all be pioneers, as I learned from one of my favorite Primary songs:<br><br><i>You don't have to push a handcart,</i><br><i>Leave your fam'ly dear,</i><br><i>Or walk a thousand miles or more</i><br><i>To be a pioneer!</i><br><br><i>You do need to have great courage,</i><br><i>Faith to conquer fear,</i><br><i>And work with might for a cause that's right</i><br><i>To be a pioneer</i><i>!</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>Not so bad, not so bad.<br><br>I occasionally look at that exam and remember that "failure is not fatal" and that "it is the courage to continue that counts." I remember that every storm will eventually break if you just hold on long enough. I remember that learning is a process and not an event and that I can do difficult things, even when it takes more time than I have and additional strength and effort. Most important, Iam reminded that life is not determined by a singular performance and that there are times when we need, as my wife so eloquently taught our ­children, to remember who we are and to stand up straight--no slouching, no shrinking, no wilting. Just stand up straight, smile, remind yourself that it is not so bad, and move on.<br><h2><b>Memento 2: Half a Degree</b></h2><br>My next memento came from my graduate studies at BYU several years later. Upon receiving my master's degree, we held a family celebration. As I was running out of our home to the party with my new degree in hand, I had an epiphany. Without thinking, I went to the workbench and cut my degree in half. I drove to the party, walked in the door, and handed my wife half of my degree.<br><br>She looked somewhat stunned and asked, "What's this?"<br><br>"It's my master's degree!" I said.<br><br>"You sawed your degree in half?" she asked incredulously.<br><br>Because of the look on her face and the sound of her voice, it was only then that I started to realize that this might not have been one of my better ideas. I explained that even though the degree had my name on it, it was just as much hers as it was mine. She had worked just as hard as I had and deserved at least half of the credit.<br><br>"But you cut it in half!" she said again.<br><br>Now why would I keep half a degree on my shelf? Because I always want to remember that everything worthwhile comes with the help of others. Life is a collaborative endeavor, and ­success--genuine success--is attributable to a lot more people than just you.<br><br>So please ask for help. Look for support. Seek for those who will cheer you on, support you, celebrate with you, and even push you to be more than you are at the moment. Be that person for others.<br><br>KarlG. Maeser used to tell the students of Brigham Young Academy, "Be yourself, but always your better self."<sup>10</sup> I feel we need more KarlG. Maesers in our life. We need to smile more, encourage more, and help one another more. This is, after all, who we are.<br><h2><b>Memento 3: BYU Foundational Documents</b></h2><br>Every fall I read the BYU foundational documents, a compilation of talks about BYU and who we are--or at least who we must become. These include talks by KarlG. Maeser and past BYU presidents from FranklinS. Harris to our current president, KevinJ Worthen. You will also find the mission statement, The Aims of a BYU Education, and many addresses by prophets, seers, and revelators. I read these documents every fall so that Iwill never forget that at the core of this university are revelations, dreams, and visions.<br><br>There is one particular story that I would like to highlight today. In 1915, BYU was in dire financial difficulties and was preparing to sell the very land on which our campus now stands. The commencement speaker, a student named Alfred Kelly, was given an assignment to promote selling the property in his speech, but he was troubled by the idea. Early one morning he walked to the land that was to be sold. He prayed, and then it happened. He saw what he called a "strange vision" with<i> </i>"thousands of young people who approached me, their arms laden with books." Kelly continued:<br><br><i>I turned around to find the area behind me illuminated as well. In that light I saw hundreds of buildings, large and beautiful temples of learning. Those young people passed by me and entered in. Then, with cheerfulness and confidence, they turned toward the east and lifted their eyes heavenward, where, again becoming part of the sunlight, they gradually disappeared from my view.</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/john-s-tanner_house-dreams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>11</sup></a><br><br>He decided to share this experience in his ­commencement speech instead of promoting the idea of selling the land. After finishing his comments he sat down, and everyone present was silent. I have always loved how Elder JeffreyR. Holland, when he was BYU president, told what happened next:<br><br><i>Longtime BYU benefactor Jesse Knight jumped to his feet and shouted, "We won't sell an acre. We won't sell a single lot." And he turned to President George Brimhall and pledged several thousand dollars to the future of the university.</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/jeffrey-r-holland_god-expects-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>12</sup></a><br><br>Why was this experience so important? Was Alfred Kelly's vision of BYU's future needed to inspire and motivate those like Jesse Knight to invest in BYU with confidence and to ensure its future? If so, this reminds me of a movie about an Iowa farmer working in his fields when he heard a voice say, "If you build it, he will come." He then saw a vision of a baseball field appear in his cornfields.<sup>13</sup> Perhaps the vision of Alfred Kelly was akin to Ray Kinsella's vision: "If you build BYU, they will come." And build it they did--and thousands did come.<br><br>So was the ultimate goal only to ensure that one future day degrees would be awarded, jobs would be secured, and one's eventual contacts on LinkedIn would overflow? If this is what you think, then I would ask you to consider Alfred Kelly's vision more carefully. It is true that his vision did describe <i>a </i>BYU, with thousands of young people laden with books entering into large and beautiful buildings. In this way it was a vision--a crystal-ball view--showing that this educational enterprise was all going to work out in the end.<br><br>I believe that Alfred Kelly's vision, however, did much more than just save the campus. I believe it defined our campus as well. Alfred Kelly not only saw future buildings but purposefully described them--as did Karl G. Maeser earlier<sup>14</sup>--as "temples of learning." And this was not all. Those temples of learning were illuminated by light. Sixty years later President SpencerW. Kimball said that all subject matter at BYU should be "bathed in the light and color of the restored gospel."<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/spencer-w-kimball_education-eternity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>15</sup></a><br><br>With all this in mind, I feel that BYU aptly fits a descriptor that Hyrum Smith once used to describe his own family's household. In the fall of 1829, Solomon Chamberlain visited the Smith farm in Palmyra, New York, to inquire about a gold bible and heavenly visitors.<br><br>Upon entering the Smiths' house, he asked, "Is there any one here that believes in visions or revelations?"<br><br>Hyrum Smith was the first to respond, and he said, "Yes, we are a visionary house."<sup>16</sup><br><br>I have always imagined Hyrum standing up straight and smiling as he said that.<br><br>But consider Hyrum's words carefully. Note that he did <i>not</i> say, "This is a visionary house," but he specifically said, "<i>We</i> are a visionary house." The emphasis here is not on the house, as important as it may be. Hyrum underscored that the occupants created a visionary house.<br><br>With this in mind, consider Alfred Kelly's vision once again. More than just buildings and a campus, he saw future BYU students. I believe that it is very likely that Alfred Kelly may have seen you: you were coming out of those temples of light "with cheerfulness and confidence," and you "turned toward the east and lifted [your] eyes heavenward."<br><br>I love this imagery. If you stand on campus and turn to the east, what do you see? The mountains. In his inaugural address, President KevinJ Worthen taught that "mountains are places of spiritual communication and revelation." He also explained that "mountains are .<i>.. </i>locations where people can be enlightened, uplifted, and changed."<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/kevin-j-worthen_enlightened-uplifted-changed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>17</sup></a> We are nestled in a revelatory setting unlike any other, and the very posturing of students described by Alfred Kelly with their eyes lifting heavenward evokes in my mind images of other learners, such as Joseph Smith in a grove of trees.<br><br>Finally, it must not be lost on us that Alfred Kelly was a student at the time of his impactful vision. It is rather astounding to think that such a dream was had by a visionary student about future visionary students! Every time I read BYU's foundational documents I am reminded that this place is a place of revelation and vision.<br><br>John S. Tanner, former BYU academic vice president, once said: "Over the years thousands of individuals have contributed to the dream of BYU. Every year new students and faculty add their particular hopes and dreams to our collective vision."<sup>18</sup> Thus all of us must continue seeking enlightenment, pursuing revelation, and dreaming dreams for our own futures and the future of this university. "Where there is no vision," the proverb reads, "the people perish."<sup>19</sup><br><h2><b>Memento 4: "You Gotta Believe"</b></h2><br>Let me present one last personal memento from my BYU experience. Every computer I have owned for the past twenty-nine years has had the same screen saver. It is a scrawling custom message that reads, "You gotta believe." This memento helps me recall something I hope to always remember. While there are many more details to this experience, I will offer an abridged<i> </i>version due to our limited time together.<br><br>At the beginning of my senior year at BYU, Ibegan worrying whether I was making the right decision about my future. I was taking entrance exams for graduate programs and even submitting applications, but nothing felt right. To find some guidance, I interviewed doctors, lawyers, businessmen and -women, teachers, and pretty much everyone who had a pulse. Nothing clicked. Lisa and I started fasting and praying for direction. Nothing happened. We kept on praying and fasting.<br><br>One day in the fall Lisa asked me if there was <i>anyone </i>who could possibly help me with whom I hadn't yet already talked.<br><br>Without a moment's hesitation, I said, "Yes. If I could only talk to the president of BYU, JeffreyR. Holland, that would clear everything up."<br><br>So Lisa, who possesses more passion, compassion, and faith than Joan of Arc, Mother Teresa, and Esther of the Old Testament--combined--said, "Then you should go and talk with him!"<br><br>"Are you crazy?" I thought. What would I say? "Um, excuse me, President. I am one of the 30,000-plus students at BYU. Will you please tell me what I should major in?" Oh please!<br><br>Instead I muddled my way through the next seven or so months trying to figure it out. But I couldn't seem to get my bearings. I felt as if I were in a fog. It felt as if <i>everyone </i>else was receiving revelation, direction, and confidence.<br><br>The irony was that while I knew that God would answer the prayers of any who asked with sincere intent, I still wavered in knowing that He would answer my prayers. And when it seemed like it mattered the very most, I felt a little alone--abandoned and even hopeless at times. I reached a point in which I didn't care so much about what I did for a living as much as I cared about receiving divine direction. It was clear that I wasn't standing up very straight, my hands were hanging down, and my feeble knees needed strengthening.<sup>20</sup><br><br>Just several weeks prior to graduation, Iattended my senior capstone classes in the basement of the Jesse Knight Building. As I prepared to leave the building, I noticed a crowd gathered at the west doors. I worked my way to the front of the doors and discovered that the reason no one was leaving was because it was raining--a complete downpour. Having taught at the MTC earlier that day, I was dressed in a suit. I can almost hear myself saying, "Typical, just typical," as I looked outside at the rainstorm and sized up the situation.<br><br>I put a <i>Daily Universe </i>newspaper over my head and started running through the parking lot. The newspaper turned to a pulpy mush, and I was soaked almost immediately. So I walked--slowly.<br><br>"I might as well catch pneumonia and be sent to the hospital," I thought. I was in a blue mood.<br><br>As I walked past the Brimhall Building, I heard someone yell out, "You need this more than I do!"<br><br>I looked across the street, and there was President Holland holding up an umbrella. Ioffered an exchange of my backpack for his umbrella. He responded by opening the rear passenger door and offering me a ride home. I ran across the street, got in, and immediately created a little puddle of water on the backseat. Sister Holland, who was already in the car, greeted me as President Holland got into the driver's seat.<br><br>"Where can I take you?" President Holland asked as he looked at me through the rearview mirror.<br><br>My wife and I were managing apartments south of campus, and I hesitated telling him where I lived because I didn't think he would be very impressed. But with the president of the university looking me in the eye, albeit through the rearview mirror, I confessed the name of the complex.<br><br>President and Sister Holland chuckled, and President Holland said, "Pat and I managed those apartments when we were undergraduates at BYU."<br><br>I was stunned and speechless. My tiny brain couldn't comprehend that President JeffreyR. Holland had actually lived in the same apartments that I was living in. Impossible! You see, I had long admired President Holland and had placed him and Sister Holland in the "Born with a Life" category. I imagined that his life was charmed. He had been a perfect high school athlete, had been a perfect missionary, and had a perfect wife--just perfect. So to think that I actually lived in the same apartments was incomprehensible.<br><br>"Are you married?" they asked.<br><br>"Yes," I answered, my head still spinning.<br><br>"Do you have children?"<br><br>"We have a son," I said.<br><br>"Our first son was born while we were in those apartments," they explained.<br><br>"Really?" I managed to blurt out.<br><br>We drove south on Campus Drive past the Maeser Building. As I sat in the car, I suddenly realized that seven months previous I had told my wife that if I could only talk with President Holland, then I was confident I would receive helpful direction. I mustered my courage and asked, "Did you ever worry about your future?"<br><br>"Oh yes," he replied.<br><br>I was stunned, and all I could say was, "Really?" After all, I thought this was a man who had never had a worry in his entire life.<br><br>I asked several other questions and found my response to be "Really?" every time.<br><br>I finally asked, "President Holland, have you ever been so discouraged that you didn't know if things would ever work out? Did you ever worry that you might not make it after all?"<br><br>He looked at me through the rearview mirror and answered, once again to my surprise, "Yes, Idid."<br><br>True to the pattern of our conversation, I managed an incredulous "Really?"<br><br>I recall Sister Holland saying, "Yes, Matt. Really."<br><br>We drove to my complex (without any directions given, I might add), and I moved toward the door to get out. But President Holland put the car in park, and he and Sister Holland turned in their seats to face me. We talked.<br><br>At one point he said, "Matt, part of your problem is that you don't believe."<br><br>I admit I felt a little badly, as if my testimony was considered subpar.<br><br>"Oh, I'm not talking about your testimony," President Holland said. "You just believe that God will work His mighty miracles for everyone but you."<br><br>His assessment was right.<br><br>And then he said with his typical fervor, "You gotta believe, Matt. You gotta believe."<br><br>He offered me sound counsel and heaps of encouragement, and then I got out of the car. I stood and waved until they were out of sight.<br><br>Upon entering our apartment I shared my experience with my wife. We wept together and then wrote the experience down--so that we would always remember.<br><br>So why the screen saver? While I will always be grateful for President and Sister Holland, I want to make sure that I never forget that God is aware of each us. I want to remember every day that BYU is a place in which students can turn to the mountains, look heavenward, and be filled with light. This is who we are. I want to remember every day that no matter what happens, you gotta believe.<br><br>Twelve years after my ride home in the rainstorm, Elder Holland, in a general conference address, reflected on a personal experience when he was discouraged and unsure about his own future. He offered himself this advice, which brought back memories and renewed my own resolve. Elder Holland said:<br><br><i>Don't give up, boy. Don't you quit. You keep walking. You keep trying. There is help and happiness ahead--alot of it--30 years of it now, and still counting. You keep your chin up. It will be all right in the end. Trust God and believe in good things to come.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1999/10/an-high-priest-of-good-things-to-come?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>21</sup></a><br><br>I hope you will forgive me for being very personal today. At the same time I hope you will understand that a BYU education <i>is </i>personal--or at least it should be personal.<br><br>I realize that your BYU mementos<i> </i>may not be exactly like mine. I am confident, however, that they are probably similar, at least in principle. Itestify that as challenging as it may seem, with faith and diligence it is really "not so bad, not so bad." I testify that if you seek help and invite others into your life, then your life will be fuller, your success will be more meaningful, and you will find peace. I testify that BYU is a place for visions--your visions--and that God will answer your prayers. It may take months, years, or however long is required for you to openly receive His answers, but the vision will surely come. You gotta believe!<br><br>I especially hope that you will stand up straight, smile, and remember who you are. You are a student at Brigham Young University. Reverence, respect, responsibility, resourcefulness, and resolve! Be a light. Don't you ever forget it.<br><br>In the name of our beloved Savior, Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Matthew O.

<h1> of Mormon: God-Given or Man-Made? - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2><b>The Book of Mormon Is the Keystone of Our Religion</b></h2><br>It is good to be with you today. I love BYU. It is where I attended school, where I met my wonderful wife, and where all six of our children have attended.<br><br>The title of my talk today is "The Book of Mormon: Man-Made or God-Given?"<sup>1</sup> Because the Book of Mormon is "the keystone of our religion," as described by Joseph Smith,<sup>2</sup> the Church rises or falls on the truth of it.<br><br>As a result, if the Book of Mormon can be proved to be man-made, then the Church is man-made. On the other hand, if its origin is God-given, then Joseph Smith was a prophet, and if he was a prophet, then The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is true. It is that simple.<br><br>Once we have a foundational testimony of the Book of Mormon, then any question or challenge we confront in life, however difficult it may seem, can be approached with faith, not doubt. Why? Because the keystone of our religion--the Book of Mormon and its witness of Jesus Christ--has also become the keystone of our testimony, which keystone holds our testimony securely in place.<br><br>Thus the Book of Mormon has become the focal point of attack by many of our critics: disprove the Book of Mormon and you disprove the Church and undermine testimonies.<br><br>But this is no easy task--in fact, it is impossible, because the Book of Mormon is true. Eleven witnesses, in addition to Joseph Smith, saw the gold plates, millions of believers have testified of its truthfulness, and the book is readily available for examination. Critics must either dismiss the Book of Mormon with a sheepish shrug or produce a viable alternative to Joseph Smith's account; namely, that he translated it by the gift and power of God.<br><br>What then are those alternative arguments presented by our critics for the origin of the Book of Mormon, and what is the truth?<br><h2><b>Argument 1: Joseph Smith, Alleged to Be an Ignorant Man, Wrote the Book of Mormon</b></h2><br>In 1831 a clergyman named Alexander Campbell proposed that Joseph Smith wrote rather than translated the Book of Mormon:<br><br><i>There never was a book more evidently written by one set of fingers, nor more certainly conceived in one cranium ... , than this ... book. ... I cannot doubt for a single moment that</i> [Joseph Smith] <i>is the sole author and proprietor of it.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>Campbell also declared that "[Joseph was] as ignorant and as impudent a knave as ever wrote a book."<sup>4</sup> But this assertion that Joseph Smith, who was "ignorant" and lacked education, could write such a work as the Book of Mormon seemed so preposterous to other contemporary critics that they readily dismissed it. Even Campbell himself, who proposed this theory, later abandoned it in favor of another alternative.<sup>5</sup><br><br>So the early theories about the origin of the Book of Mormon started to focus on the premise that Joseph Smith, an unlearned man, was simply incapable of writing such a complex book. After all, he was but twenty-three years of age, a simple plowboy from western New York, and he had little formal education. Consequently the early critics concluded there must be some other explanation for the origin of the Book of Mormon than the unlikely possibility that Joseph wrote it.<br><h2><b>Argument 2: Someone Else Wrote It</b></h2><br>Accordingly, some critics proposed the theory that Joseph Smith conspired with someone who had the education, intelligence, and skills to write the Book of Mormon.<sup>6</sup> One candidate for its authorship was Oliver Cowdery. After all, he was a schoolteacher, a scribe, and later a lawyer. But a major problem arose for the critics: Oliver never claimed to have written any portion of the book; in fact, he testified to the contrary:<br><br><i>I wrote, with my own pen, the entire Book of Mormon (save a few pages) as it fell from the lips oftheProphet Joseph Smith, as he translated it by thegift and power of God. ... That book is </i><b><i>true.</i></b><sup>7</sup><br><br>Even though Oliver was excommunicated from the Church and it was some years before he returned, he remained true at all times to his testimony, even on his deathbed. As a result, this argument receives little acceptance today.<sup>8</sup><br><br>Another candidate for authorship of the Book of Mormon was Sidney Rigdon. He was a Protestant minister and theologian. The supreme irony of this argument, however, is that he was converted by the very book he was supposed to have written. ParleyP. Pratt, a former member of Rigdon's congregation, introduced him to the Book of Mormon in October 1830--about six months after the Book of Mormon had already been published. Do we have any witnesses that this is how Sidney Rigdon was converted? We do. In fact, the historical evidence is compelling.<sup>9</sup><br><br>First, Sidney Rigdon's daughter, Nancy Rigdon Ellis, was eight years old when ParleyP. Pratt and Oliver Cowdery presented her father with a copy of the Book of Mormon in their home. She said that she recalled the event because of the conflict that arose:<br><br><i>I saw them hand</i> [my father] <i>the book, </i><b><i>and I am as positive as can be that he never saw it before.</i></b><i> He read itand examined it for about an hour and then threw it down and said he did not believe a word in it.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>Later, however, he did accept the Book of Mormon, joined the Church, and became one of its leaders.<br><br>Second, Sidney Rigdon's son John spoke to his father as he lay on his deathbed: "[Father], you owe it to me and to your family to tell [the truth about the Book of Mormon]."<br><br>In other words, this is the day of reckoning; be totally honest before you go to the judgment bar.<br><br>The son then recounted his father's response: "My father looked at me a moment, raised his hand above his head and slowly said, with tears glistening in his eyes: 'My son, I can swear before high heaven that what I have told you about the origin ofthat book is true.'"<br><br>After this tender moment, the son said, "I believed him."<sup>11</sup><br><br>Later, John joined the Church, and thus another argument fell by the wayside.<br><h2><b>Argument 3: The Book of Mormon Was Plagiarized from Other Books</b></h2><br>Other critics offered a different line of attack; namely, that Joseph Smith plagiarized the Book of Mormon (at least its historical content) from other existing books. One such theory alleged that Joseph Smith copied from the Solomon Spaulding manuscript--an unpublished manuscript written about 1812 by a man named Solomon Spaulding, who had once been a Protestant minister. It is a fictional account of ancient Romans who were sailing for England but were blown off course and landed in North America. When the critics were asked to produce the manuscript for comparison with the Book of Mormon, they conveniently claimed it was lost.<sup>12</sup><br><br>However, with the passage of time, the manuscript was found in 1884 by a Mr.L.L. Rice. He found the alleged smoking gun in the personal historical papers of one of the very critics who had claimed the manuscript was lost. Knowing of its alleged connection to the Book of Mormon, Mr.Rice, Mr.James Fairchild, and others (none of whom were members of the LDS Church), reviewed it and concluded, "[We] compared it with the Book of Mormon and could detect <i>no resemblance between the two, in general or in detail.</i><sup>13</sup><br><br>When I was in my twenties, I saw a notice from the Church History Department that stated that a copy of the Solomon Spaulding manuscript could be purchased for a dollar. I ordered a copy and likewise found no meaningful relationship whatsoever between the two books.<sup>14</sup><br><br>With the demise of this argument, critics alleged that the supposed source for the Book of Mormon was another book titled <i>View of the Hebrews,</i> written by Ethan Smith in 1823. This book was an attempt to prove that the Native Americans were descendants of the lost ten tribes of Israel.<sup>15</sup> In essence, the critics claimed that this was the historical basis for the Book of Mormon.<br><br>There is a simple test to determine if the Book of Mormon was copied from <i>View of the Hebrews:</i> simply compare the two books and decide for yourself. With complete academic honesty, B.H. Roberts, one of the leading scholars of the Church, listed some possible parallels<sup>16</sup> between the two books, but he then reached this conclusion: "I am taking the position that our faith is not only unshaken but unshakable in the Book of Mormon, and therefore we can look without fear upon all that can be said against it."<sup>17</sup> Shortly before his death, Roberts ­further declared, "Ethan Smith played no part in the formation of the Book of Mormon."<sup>18</sup><br><br>I too have read <i>View of the Hebrews</i> and the Book of Mormon. Suffice it to say, these two books have totally different objectives and writing styles. For example, the Book of Mormon's principal focus is to testify of Jesus Christ and His doctrine. Accordingly, the historical setting is not the focus, but it is rather the background music that gives context and emphasis to the doctrine. The principal focus, however, for <i>View of the Hebrews</i> is to historically connect the Native Americans to the ancient Hebrews. In addition, <i>View of the Hebrews</i> is a series of independent quotes and purported evidences to prove its theory. On the other hand, the Book of Mormon is a cohesive narrative--a story of families and prophets who struggled to live God's word. The purpose and style of these two books is most disparate.<sup>19</sup> Any honest reader can determine that for himself.<br><h2><b>Argument 4: Joseph Suffered from a Mental Illness</b></h2><br>Those who advanced this argument alleged that such mental disorders bestowed upon Joseph Smith additional powers and skills that enabled him to write what he could not otherwise have written on his own.<sup>20</sup><br><br>In 1931 HarryM. Beardsley wrote, "<i>The Book of Mormon</i> is a product of ... a mind characterized by the symptoms of the most prevalent of mental diseases of adolescence--dementia praecox,"<sup>21</sup> sometimes referred to as schizophrenia.<br><br>There are fatal defects, however, with such an argument. First, there is no credible evidence that Joseph had any form of mental illness. Second, there is no substantiating evidence that such physical or mental conditions magically bestow upon an untrained writer, such as Joseph Smith, the ability to instantly become a skilled writer. And third, the book is not characteristic of the mentally ill. Even FawnM. Brodie, an avid critic ofJoseph Smith, acknowledged this latter fact:<br><br><b><i>Recent critics who insist that Joseph Smith suffered from delusions have ignored in the Book of Mormon contrary evidence difficult to override.</i></b><i> Its very coherence belies their claims. ...</i><br><br><i>... Its structure shows elaborate design, its narrative is spun coherently, and it demonstrates throughout a unity of purpose.</i><sup>22</sup><br><br>As you would expect, these arguments that Joseph Smith suffered from a mental illness never got much traction.<sup>23</sup><br><h2><b>Argument 5: Joseph Smith Was a Creative Genius Who, Shaped by His Environment, Wrote the Book of Mormon</b></h2><br>This argument has become a principal one used by many if not most critics today. It is a 180-degree turnabout from the premise of earlier critics; namely, that Joseph was illiterate, ignorant, and incapable of writing such a work on his own. In fact, we have come full circle, back to the same argument originally made by Alexander Campbell in 1831, except that now Joseph Smith is considered brilliant rather than ignorant.<br><br>Fawn Brodie, perhaps the chief proponent of this argument, opined that Joseph Smith, the unschooled farm boy, was a creative genius who, fashioned by his environment and the influence of local history books and resources, personally wrote the Book of Mormon. Remarkably, Fawn Brodie wrote:<br><br><i>Never having written a line of fiction,</i> [Joseph Smith] <i>laid out for himself a task that would have given the most experienced novelist pause. </i><b><i>But possibly because of this very inexperience he plunged into the story.</i></b><sup>24</sup><br><br>When one contemplates that assertion, it is nothing short of mind-boggling. Was it this same inexperience that helped him create hundreds of names, weave them into the most complex set of events, and then thread them together in a harmonious story resplendent with profound doctrinal insights? By her very acknowledgment of Joseph's inexperience, she has magnified the improbability of Joseph writing this monumental work on hisown.<br><br>Nonetheless, others have bought into this ­argument--lock, stock, and barrel. Why? Because they have nowhere else to go except to admit that Joseph translated the Book of Mormon by the gift and power of God--a place they desperately do not want to go. These latter critics have added one more ingredient to the mix. Joseph Smith, they said, besides being a genius, was suffering from narcissistic personality disorder or dissociative disorder or depression.<sup>25</sup> Here we are back again to the mental disorder theories that proved so ineffective in thepast.<sup>26</sup><br><br>In order to account for the history of the Book of Mormon, these critics claim that Joseph must have read or been conversant with a staggering number of books or ideas related to them. In fact, one author has suggested that Joseph may have read or gleaned information from more than thirty books in nearby libraries in order to gather necessary information about the early Americans.<sup>27</sup> The claim is then made that these books--or discussions of the same in newspapers or conversations--became the basis for the historical narrative in the Book of Mormon.<sup>28</sup><br><br>How might one counter this argument? Here is a list of questions that an honest seeker of truth might raise:<br><br>• Is there a single reference--just one--in Joseph's journals or written correspondence suggesting he might have read or had conversations concerning any of these historical sources before translating the Book of Mormon? No.<sup>29</sup><br><br>• Is there any evidence he visited the libraries where these books were supposedly located? No.<br><br>• Did Emma Smith, who was married to him, ever comment that he referred to any of these books before the Book of Mormon was translated? No.<br><br>• Is there any record that he had any of these books present when he translated the Book ofMormon? No.<br><br>How many nos does it take to expose the critics' arguments as pure speculation--nothing more than sand castles that come crashing down when the first waves of honest questions appear on the scene.<br><br>Do the critics expect us to believe that Joseph searched out and studied all these resources on Native American life; inhaled the related conversations on the topic; winnowed out the irrelevant; organized the remainder into an intricate story involving hundreds of characters, numerous locations, and detailed war strategies; and then dictated it with perfect recollection, without any notes whatsoever--no outline, no three-by-five cards, nothing--a fact acknowledged even among the critics?<sup>30</sup> And during it all, no one remembered him going to these libraries, bringing any such books home, having any conversations concerning this research, or making any diary entries to the same. Where, I ask you, is the hard evidence?<br><h2><b>Where Did Joseph Get the Doctrine?</b></h2><br>Even if Joseph had obtained historical facts from local libraries or community conversations--for which there is no substantiating evidence--the real issue still remains: Where did he get the deep and expansive doctrine taught in the Book of Mormon--much of which is contrary to the religious beliefs of his time? For example, contemporary Christianity taught that the Fall was a negative, not a positive, step forward, as taught in the Book of Mormon (see 2Nephi 2).<br><br>Likewise, contrary to contemporary beliefs, the Book of Mormon refers to a premortal existence in Alma13 (see Alma 13:1–11) and to a postmortal spirit world in Alma 40 (see Alma 40:11–14). Where did Joseph Smith get these profound doctrinal truths that were in fact contrary to the prevailing doctrinal teachings of his time? Where did he get the stunning sermon on faith in Alma32? Or one of the greatest sermons ever recorded in all scripture on the Savior's Atonement as delivered by King Benjamin (see Mosiah 2–5)? Or the allegory of the olive tree with all its complexity and doctrinal richness (see Jacob 5)? When I read that allegory, I have to map it out to follow its intricacies. Are we supposed to believe that Joseph Smith just dictated these sermons off the top of his head with no notes whatsoever?<br><br>The doctrinal truths taught in the Book of Mormon are overwhelming evidence of its divine authenticity. Nephi prophesied that in our day an exceeding great many would stumble in finding the truth. Why? "Because of the many plain and precious things which have been taken out of the [Bible]" (1Nephi 13:29). Here are but two examples of plain and precious doctrinal truths that were clarified or restored in the Book of Mormon:<br><br>1. Baptism. Much of the Christian world debates whether or not baptism is essential for salvation; they stumble over this issue. Let me read just one of many scriptures on this subject from the Book of Mormon: "[God] commandeth all men that they must repent, and be baptized in his name, ... or they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God" (2Nephi 9:23). Should there be any debate about the necessity of baptism after that scripture? The Book of Mormon makes clear that which is unclear to much of the Christian world.<br><br>The majority of the Christian world embraces sprinkling and pouring as legitimate modes of baptism. The Savior Himself addressed this issue in the Book of Mormon: "Then shall ye <i>immerse</i> them in the water, and come forth again out of the water" (3Nephi 11:26; emphasis added). What is ambiguous for many is crystal clear in the Book of Mormon. Must one be baptized by authority, or is sincerity sufficient? Do we make covenants at the time of baptism, and, if so, what are those covenants? Should infants be baptized?<br><br>Again and again the Book of Mormon comes to the rescue, giving answers and restoring many plain and precious truths about baptism that were distorted or lost during the Apostasy. How did Joseph Smith know all these answers when the rest of the Christian world was so confused? Because he received them by revelation from God as he translated the Book of Mormon.<br><br>2. What about Christ's Atonement--the central doctrine of all Christianity? The clarity and expansiveness of this doctrine as taught in the Book of Mormon is beyond honest dispute. The Old and New Testaments have some scattered doctrinal gems on the Atonement (which we greatly appreciate and benefit from), but the Book of Mormon has numerous sermons--entire master­pieces--on the subject. For example:<br><br>a. 2Nephi2 is a mind-expanding sermon on the relationship between the Fall and Christ's Atonement. While the rest of the Christian world believes that the Fall was a step backward in man's progress, Lehi taught us the truth--that the Fall coupled with the Atonement is a giant step forward.<br><br>b. 2Nephi 9:7 introduces for the first time the phrase "an infinite atonement," revealing the expansiveness, scope, and depth of Christ's saving power.<br><br>c. Mosiah2–5 is King Benjamin's sermon. It gives insights about the depth of Christ's suffering, the retroactive as well as prospective nature of Christ's Atonement, and the power of the Atonement to remove our guilt as well as our sins.<br><br>d. Alma7 explains that the Savior suffered not only for our sins but also for our "pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind" (Alma 7:11).<br><br>e. 3Nephi11 is the most powerful witness we have of the resurrected Lord, as 2,500 believers, consisting of men, women, and children (see 3Nephi 17:25) came forth and "thrust their hands into his side," felt "the prints of the nails in his hands and in his feet," and "did know of a surety and did bear record" (3Nephi 11:15) that He was the Son of God. Who can read that account and not feel the witness of the Spirit testifying of its truthfulness?<br><br>f. The Bible teaches us that, through the Atone­ment, Christ can make us clean; the Book of Mormon teaches us that, through the Atonement, Christ can also make us perfect (see Moroni 10:32–33).<sup>31</sup><br><br>Does anyone honestly believe that Joseph Smith somehow invented these profound doctrines with their compelling powers of reason, their mind-expanding insights, and their language, which is divinely eloquent? If these doctrines were the product of Joseph's creative mind, one might ask, "Were there no other creative geniuses in the 1,800 years following Christ's ministry who could produce similar doctrines?"<br><br>The argument that Joseph Smith wrote the Book of Mormon is simply counter to the realities of life. It is one thing to have creative ideas; it is quite another to put them into a complex but coherent and harmonious whole, inundated with majestic doctrinal truths and all done in a single draft in less than ninety days. Joseph Smith's wife, Emma, the person who knew him better than any other, confirmed this conclusion: "Joseph Smith [as a young man] could neither write nor dictate a coherent and well-worded letter; let alone dictat[e] a book like the Book of Mormon."<sup>32</sup><br><h2><b>A Parable That Counters the Arguments Proposed by Critics</b></h2><br>In response to critics' arguments as to the origin of the Book of Mormon, Hugh Nibley published the following parable:<br><br><i>A young man once long ago claimed he had found a large diamond in his field as he was ploughing. He put the stone on display to the public free of charge, and everyone took sides. A psychologist showed, by citing some famous case studies, that the young man was suffering from a well-known form of delusion. An historian showed that other men have also claimed to have found diamonds in fields and been deceived. A geologist proved that there were no diamonds in the area but only quartz. ... When asked to inspect the stone itself, the geologist declined with a weary, tolerant smile and a kindly shake of the head. ... A sociologist showed that only three out of 177 florists' assistants in four major cities believed the stone was genuine. A clergyman wrote a book to show that it was not the young man butsomeone else who had found the stone.</i><br><br><i>Finally an indigent jeweler ... pointed out that since the stone was still available for examination the answer to the question of whether it was a diamond or not had absolutely nothing to do with who found it, or whether the finder was honest or sane, or who believed him, or whether he would know a diamond from a brick ..., but was to be answered simply and solely by putting the stone to certain well-known tests for diamonds. Experts on diamonds were called in. Some of them declared it genuine. The others made nervous jokes about it and declared that they could not very well jeopardize their dignity and reputations by appearing to take the thing too seriously. To hide the bad impression thus made, someone came out with the theory that the stone was really a synthetic diamond, very skilfully made, but a fake just the same. The objection to this is that the production of a good synthetic diamond</i> [in that day and age] <i>would have been an even more remarkable feat than the finding of a real one.</i><sup>33</sup><br><br>To suggest that Joseph Smith, a farm boy with little formal education, produced a synthetic work of God in 1829 that has baffled the brightest of critics for almost two centuries would be a more remarkable feat than the simple fact that he obtained the gold plates from an angel of God and translated them by the gift and power of God.<br><h2><b>Other Evidences That the Book of Mormon Is NotMan-Made</b></h2><br>What other evidence do we have that the Book of Mormon was a God-given translation and not a man-made creation? There are many evidences, but for the sake of time I refer to but one, because it is personal to me. Emma Smith gave the following testimony, as reported by her son Joseph Smith III:<br><br><b><i>My belief is that the Book of Mormon is of divine authenticity--I have not the slightest doubt of it.</i></b><i> I am satisfied that no man could have dictated the writing of the manuscripts unless he was inspired; for, when acting as his scribe, your father would dictate to me hour after hour; and when returning after meals, or after interruptions, he would at once begin where he had left off, without either seeing the manuscript or having any portion of it read to him. This was a usual thing for him to do. It would have been improbable that a learned man could do this; and, </i><b><i>for one so ignorant and unlearned as he was, it was simply impossible.</i></b><sup>34</sup><br><br>This may seem insignificant to some, but to me it is astounding. For thirty-four years, as a lawyer, I regularly dictated to my secretary. As I did so, Iwas often interrupted by a phone call or a question. After such interruptions I would invariably ask my secretary, "Where was I?"<br><br>But Joseph was not dictating or writing a new work; he was receiving revelation by the power ofGod and therefore did not need to ask, "Where was I?"<br><br>When all is said and done, Joseph Smith's explanation of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon is the only viable option on the table. Why? Because it is as true as true can be.<sup>35</sup><br><h2><b>How We Can Discover the Truth of a DivineWork</b></h2><br>If I were to ask my good Christian friends how they unquestionably know the Bible is the word of God, I do not believe they would cite archaeological discoveries or linguistic connections with ancient Hebrew or Greek as their prime evidence; rather, they would make reference to the Spirit. Italways comes back to the Spirit. The Spirit that helps me know the Bible is true is the very same Spirit that helps me know the Book of Mormon istrue.<sup>36</sup><br><br>The Spirit is the decisive, determining factor--not archaeology, not linguistics, not DNA, and certainly not the theories of man. The Spirit is the only witness that is sure and certain and infallible.<br><br>As a boy of about fifteen or sixteen, I was reading the story of the 2,000 sons of Helaman. Imarveled at their bravery and the Lord's protecting hand. Then a voice came to my mind: "That story is true." Since then, other confirmations have come.<sup>37</sup><br><br>Why is it so important for you individually to gain a testimony of the Book of Mormon? Because if you do, it will become your personal iron rod. The mists of darkness may come and the unanswered questions may arise, but through it all you will have your iron rod to cling to--to keep you on the straight and narrow path that leads to eternal life.<br><br>The Lord has promised that if we pray "with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto [us], by the power of the Holy Ghost" (Moroni 10:4). If we want the truth that badly, if we are willing to pay that price and be unrelenting in that quest, the answer will eventually come.<br><br>By that promised power of the Holy Ghost I bear my personal witness that the Book of Mormon is God-given and that it is all it claims to be--a pure and powerful witness of Jesus Christ, His divinity, and His doctrine. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Tad R.

Greene, 1832), 13. Campbell also opined that Joseph "wrote on the plates of Nephi, in his book of Mormon, every error and almost every truth discussed in N[ew]York for the last ten years" (<i>Delusions,</i> 13).<br><br>4. Campbell, <i>Delusions,</i> 11.<br><br>5. Campbell later endorsed the argument that Sidney Rigdon wrote the Book of Mormon with the help of the Solomon Spaulding manuscript, an argument discussed hereafter. See LouisC. Midgley, "Who Really Wrote the Book of Mormon?: The Critics and Their Theories," in NoelB. Reynolds, ed., <i>Book of Mormon Authorship Revisited: The Evidence for Ancient Origins</i> (Provo: Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies, 1997), 132, note 18.<br><br>6. In this regard, FawnM. Brodie wrote, "Unwilling to credit Joseph Smith with either learning or talent, detractors of the Mormons within a few years declared that the Book of Mormon must have been written by someone else" (<i>No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon Prophet</i> [New York: Vintage Books, 1995], 68).<br><br>7. Reported in "Last Days of Oliver Cowdery," <i>Deseret News,</i> 13April 1859, 48; emphasis in original. On another occasion, Cowdery wrote:<br><br><i>These were days never to be forgotten--to sit under the sound of a voice dictated by the</i><i> </i><b><i>inspiration</i></b><i> </i><i>of heaven, awakened the utmost gratitude of this bosom! Day after day I continued, uninterrupted, to write from his mouth, as he translated, with the</i><i> </i>Urim<i> and </i>Thummim,<i> ... the history, or record, called "The book of Mormon."</i> [<i>Latter Day Saints' Messenger and Advocate</i> 1, no.1 (October 1834): 14; emphasis in original]<br><br>8. If Oliver wrote the Book of Mormon, one must ask, What was his motive? There was no lasting fame, no money, and no lasting power to be gained by remaining silent as to its authorship; rather, Oliver Cowdery was excommunicated from the Church. If there was ever a time to expose Joseph Smith as a fraud, this was it--his chance to get even and to declare who the true author was. But none of that happened. In addition, the original transcript includes the handwriting of several scribes besides that of Oliver Cowdery, evidencing that he alone could not have been its sole author.<br><br>While Oliver was excommunicated from the Church, he tried a murder case as a county attorney. At the beginning of the trial, the defense counsel ridiculed Oliver and his connection with Joseph Smith and the gold plates. With great interest, those in the courtroom waited for Oliver's reply. Oliver arose and declared:<br><br><i>Gentlemen of the jury, I have never denied my testimony, which is attached to the front page of the</i> Book of Mormon, <i>and I declare to you here that these eyes saw the angel, and these ears of mine heard the voice of the angel, and he told us his name was Moroni; that the book was true, and contained the fulness of the gospel.</i> [In B.H. Roberts, <i>AComprehensive History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Century One,</i> 6vols.

Duncan, notary public for the county of Salt Lake, State of Utah, 3 December 1909; LDS Church Archives, Salt Lake City]<br><br>9. Joseph Smith III reported that his mother, Emma, had said that "no acquaintance was formed between Sidney Rigdon and the Smith family till after the Church was organized," which of course was after the Book of Mormon had already been published (Joseph Smith III, "Letter to R.Patterson," 20 January 1883, in <i>Saints' Herald</i> 30, no.12 (24March 1883): 179; letter continued from the previous week in <i>Saints' Herald</i> 30, no.11 (17March 1883): 162–64.<br><br>10.

Doctor Philastus Hurlbut, an apostate of the Church, and EberD. Howe, a newspaper editor who was hostile to the Church, had heard rumors that there were some similarities between the Solomon Spaulding manuscript and the Book of Mormon, so they obtained the manuscript from Mr.Spaulding's widow with the intent to print it and expose the Book of Mormon as a fraud. To their great disappointment, however, they could not find the similarities they had hoped for. Hurlbut admitted, "I obtained a manuscript ..., which was reported to be the foundation of the 'Book of Mormon.' ... Upon examination I found it to contain nothing of the kind, but being a manuscript upon an entirely different subject" (in affidavit, 10 January 1881, quoted in George Reynolds, "The Originator of the 'Spaulding Story,'" <i>Juvenile Instructor</i> 17, no.17 [1September 1882]: 263).<br><br>In light of that discovery, these coconspirators then claimed there was another manuscript that was the source of the Book of Mormon, but it was allegedly lost and therefore, conveniently, could not be compared to see if plagiarism had occurred. No such "later" manuscript has ever been found.<br><br>13. JamesH. Fairchild, "Solomon Spaulding and the Book of Mormon," <i>Bibliotheca Sacra</i> 42, no.165 (January 1885): 174; emphasis added; punctuation modernized; see also 173–74. No wonder Sidney Rigdon, who was falsely alleged to have used the Spaulding manuscript in writing the Book of Mormon, called it "a moonshine story ... [and] the most base of lies, without even the shadow of truth" (letter from Sidney Rigdon to the editors of the <i>Boston Recorder,</i> 27May 1839, quoted in ParleyP. Pratt, <i>Plain Facts: Showing the Falsehood and Folly of the Rev. C.S. Bush, [a Church Minister of the Parish of Peover,] Being a Reply to His Tract Against the Latter-day Saints</i> [Manchester: W.R. Thomas, 1840], 14).<br><br>Oliver Cowdery offered this further damaging testimony: "Sidney Rigdon did not write it. Mr.Spaulding did not write it. I wrote it myself, as it fell from the lips of the Prophet" ("Last Days of Oliver Cowdery," 48; punctuation modernized).<br><br>14. Even other critics of the Book of Mormon saw the massive holes in this theory. Isaac Woodbridge Riley wrote, "The commonly accepted Spaulding theory is insoluble from external evidence and disproved by internal evidence" (<i>The Founder of Mormonism: APsychological Study of Joseph Smith, Jr.</i> [New York: Dodd, Mead, 1902], 172).<br><br>15. One of the chief proponents of this argument, Fawn M. Brodie, acknowledged, "Thus, where <i>View of the Hebrews</i> was just bad scholarship, the Book of Mormon was highly original and imaginative fiction" (<i>No Man Knows My History,</i> 48). She claimed that, evidently, in some mysterious, inexplicable way, Joseph Smith had transformed a sow's ear (<i>View of the Hebrews</i>) into a silk purse (the Book of Mormon)--hardly a rousing endorsement for an alleged act of plagiarism.<br><br>16. Some might ask, Why are there any possible parallels between <i>View of the Hebrews</i> and the Book of Mormon? There is a very reasonable explanation. <i>View of the Hebrews</i> is a collection of the then existing Native American legends and archaeological evidences that pointed to some commonality with the ancient Hebrews. Where did these legends and archaeological remains originate? When the Nephite civilization was destroyed, the Lamanite civilization continued, but without any substantial written records. Their traditions and history were handed down to successive generations, largely by word of mouth. Some of these stories or legends were no doubt altered with time, and others no doubt contained some truth. Those that contained some truth might parallel similar accounts in the Book of Mormon because they may have been describing the same events--one through the written record of the Nephites, the other through the oral legends and stories of the Lamanites.<br><br>17. B.H. Roberts, <i>Studies of the Book of Mormon,</i> ed. BrighamD. Madsen (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1985), 58. Some claim that B.H. Roberts lost his testimony over this analysis done in 1922, but that is simply untrue. In a cover letter to President HeberJ. Grant and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, dated March15, 1922, Roberts wrote:<br><br><i>In writing out this my report to you of those studies, I have written it from the viewpoint of an open mind, investigating the facts of the Book of Mormon origin and authorship. Let me say once and for all, so as to avoid what might otherwise call for repeated explanation, that what is herein set forth does not represent any conclusions of mine. This report herewith submitted is what it purports to be, namely a "study of Book of Mormon origins," for the information of those who ought to know everything about it</i> pro et con, <i>as well that which has been produced against it, and that which may be produced against it. I am taking the position that our faith is not only unshaken but unshakable in the Book of Mormon, and therefore we can look without fear upon all that can be said against it.</i> [In Roberts, <i>Studies,</i> 57–58; quoted in TrumanG. Madsen, "B.H. Roberts After Fifty Years: Still Witnessing for the Book of Mormon," <i>Ensign,</i> December 1983,13]<br><br>18. In his <a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1983/12/b-h-roberts-after-fifty-years-still-witnessing-for-the-book-of-mormon?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #33cccc;"><i>Ensign</i> article in 1983</span></a>, TrumanG. Madsen related the following:<br><br><i>Just before his death in September 1933, Elder Roberts was visited at his office by a long-time friend, Jack Christensen. He placed on Elder Roberts's desk a second edition of the Ethan Smith volume. During the conversation, B.H. Roberts spoke of his Book of Mormon studies and then gave Christensen his considered judgment: "Ethan Smith played no part in the formation of the Book of Mormon."</i> [Interview with Jack Christensen, 25April 1979; from Madsen, "B.H. Roberts After Fifty Years," 17–18]<br><br>Interestingly, critics are quick to quote the possible parallels Elder Roberts cited but for some reason fail to quote his decisive and concluding opinion that <i>View of the Hebrews</i> played no part in the formation of the Book of Mormon. I leave it to you to decide the reason for this recurring omission.<br><br>19. As I gave weight to the few parallels versus the many nonparallels in these two books, it reminded me of the dilemma of the farmer who couldn't tell one horse from another--they both ran at the same speed, carried the same load, and were of the same weight. Finally, as a last resort, he measured them, and, sure enough, the white horse was six hands higher than the black one. Such is the difference between the Book of Mormon and <i>View of the Hebrews.</i><br><br>20. In this spirit Isaac Woodbridge Riley opined that Joseph Smith was an epileptic (see Riley, <i>Founder of Mormonism,</i> 345–66).<br><br>21. HarryM.

Dan Vogel noted that "literary critic Bernard DeVoto's theory that Smith's visions and revelations were entirely the result of paranoid delusions has not fared well" (Vogel, <i>Joseph Smith: The Making of a Prophet</i> [Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 2004], x–xi); see also Bernard DeVoto, "The Centennial of Mormonism," <i>American Mercury</i> 19, no.73 (January 1930):5.<br><br>24. Brodie, <i>No Man Knows My History,</i> 49; emphasis added.<br><br>25. See RobertD. Anderson, <i>Inside the Mind of Joseph Smith: Psychobiography and the Book of Mormon</i> (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1999); see also WilliamD. Morain, <i>The Sword of Laban: Joseph Smith,Jr. and the Dissociated Mind</i> (Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Press, 1998).<br><br>26. These alleged mental disorders are claimed to have given Joseph the incentive and drive to write the Book of Mormon and also served as the source of the book's tone and tenor.<br><br>27. See Dan Vogel, <i>Indian Origins and the Book of Mormon: Religious Solutions from Columbus to Joseph Smith</i> (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1986), 105–32. The suggestion that Joseph Smith researched and read a substantial portion of these books or newspapers is a far distant cry from his mother's observation of him that he was "less inclined to the perusal of books than any of the rest of our children" (Lucy [Mack] Smith, <i>History of the Prophet Joseph </i>[Smith]<i> by His Mother</i> [Salt Lake City: Improvement Era, 1902], 84).<br><br>28. Joseph Smith referred to <i>View of the Hebrews</i> in <i>Times and Seasons</i> in June 1842 (twelve years after the Book of Mormon was published); see Joseph Smith, "From Priest's American Antiquities," <i>Times and Seasons</i> 3, no.15 (1June 1842): 814.<br><br>29. LouisC. Midgley, a Church scholar, added this note:<br><br><i>Critics of the Book of Mormon now seem forced to follow the agenda set out by Brodie--they must locate nineteenth-century sources for all its contents. And they must explain how Joseph Smith was able to locate, digest, winnow, and then fashion these materials into a coherent form.</i> ["Who Really Wrote the Book of Mormon?" 129]<br><br>30. Emma Smith was once asked in an interview if Joseph had read from any books or notes while dictating. She replied, "He had neither manuscript nor book to read from. ... If he had had anything of the kind he could not have concealed it from me" (in Joseph Smith III, "Last Testimony of Sister Emma," <i>Saints' Herald</i> 26, no.19 [1October 1879]: 289–90).<br><br>NoelB. Reynolds noted, "All accounts agree that Joseph never paused to review even the previous page or sentence, and he used no notes, books, or other reference materials" (Reynolds, "Shedding New Light on Ancient Origins," <i>Brigham Young Magazine</i> 52, no.1 [spring 1998]: 39; quoted in K.Douglas Bassett, <i>Doctrinal Insights to the Book of Mormon, Volume One: 1Nephi Through 2Nephi</i> [Springville, Utah: CFI, 2007], 134).<br><br>As one critic admitted, "Smith's method of dictation did not allow for rewriting. It was a more-or-less stream-of-consciousness composition" (Vogel, <i>Making of a Prophet,</i> xix). I don't believe I have ever written a substantive talk or thesis or book without rewriting. Have you?<br><br>31. There are certainly other magnificent chapters on the Atonement, including, but not limited to, 2Nephi 25, Jacob 4, Mosiah 15, Alma 34, Alma 40–42, Ether 12, and Moroni 8.<br><br>32. Emma Smith, in "Last Testimony of Sister Emma," 290.<br><br>33. Hugh Nibley, <i>Lehi in the Desert; The World of the Jaredites; There Were Jaredites,</i> volume5 of The Collected Works of Hugh Nibley: The Book of Mormon, ed. JohnW. Welch, DarrellL. Matthews, and StephenR. Callister (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1988), 121–22.<br><br>34. Emma Smith, in "Last Testimony of Sister Emma," 290; emphasis added.<br><br>35. Recently, as I reread the Doctrine and Covenants, I was reminded of the multiple occasions in which Joseph Smith acknowledged his weaknesses. What does that do for his credibility concerning the origin of the Book of Mormon? It tells me that he was not perfect but that he was honest.<br><br>36. This is consistent with the words of Nephi: "And if ye shall believe in Christ ye will believe in these words, for they are the words of Christ" (2Nephi 33:10; see also Mormon 7:8–9).<br><br>37. Some of those confirmations have come in the form of impressions to be a better person. Joseph Smith taught in reference to the Book of Mormon that "a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book" (<i>HC</i> 4:461).<br><br>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>Lift, Rescue: Becoming God&#039;s Hands - Jodi Maxfield - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
You might recall in the beloved Dr. Seuss children's book <i>Horton Hears a Who!</i> how Horton, who was an elephant, had a chance encounter with a speck of dust, from whence a voice, barely audible, called out for help. Horton recognized that the voice was coming from the speck of dust and proceeded to do all he could to protect and defend this colony of Whos, who were "too small to be seen by an elephant's eyes."<br><br>Horton perceived that someone was in distress and realized that <i>he</i> could help. Instead of discounting his newly discovered friends, and amidst scoffs and scorn from others, he did all he could to give aid. He had a clear understanding of his ability to rescue and protect the Who colony. Through his actions he demonstrated his ability to give aid, share his light, and serve. As Horton exclaimed, "A person's a person, no matter how small."<br><h2><b>Being Grateful</b></h2><br>Having just celebrated Thanksgiving this past week, and as we transition from November into the month of December and celebrate the birth of our beloved Savior, it seems particularly natural that gratitude has taken center stage in our minds and in our hearts--as it should. No matter how humble and meager our circumstances, we each have so much to be grateful for.<br><br>President Thomas S. Monson said of gratitude:<br><br><i>To express gratitude is gracious and honorable, to enact gratitude is generous and noble, but to live with gratitude ever in our hearts is to touch heaven.</i> ["The Divine Gift of Gratitude," <i>Ensign, </i>November 2010]<br><br>He also said:<br><br><i>We can lift ourselves and others as well when we refuse to remain in the realm of negative thought and cultivate within our hearts an attitude of gratitude. </i>["Divine Gift"]<br><br>Gratitude is an expression of our faith. Negativity most certainly breeds despair, depression, lack of enthusiasm, and critical analysis of that which is most likely not our right to criticize or judge.<br><br>Elder JosephB. Wirthlin, in a devotional address on gratitude given at BYU, said:<br><br><i>Gratitude is a mark of a noble soul and a refined character. We like to be around those who are grateful. They tend to brighten all around them. They make ­others feel better about themselves. They tend to be more humble, more joyful, more likable.</i><br><br><i>. . . Gratitude is a commandment of the Father. </i>["<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/joseph-b-wirthlin_live-thanksgiving-daily/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Live in Thanksgiving Daily</a>," BYU devotional address, 31 October 2000]<br><br>Doctrine and Covenants 59:7 reads, "Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things."<br><br>While it may be more challenging to feel grateful when we are in the throes of trials and disappointments, those are the very times when we need to stop, take a look around, and count and list our blessings one by one. It has not been surprising to me throughout my life how much I truly take for granted when I am in a "woe is me" state of mind and how reflecting on my blessings has turned things around almost instantaneously, although not removing the trial. When my outlook is changed, my attitude, perception, and ability to cope are positively affected.<br><br>President DieterF. Uchtdorf said regarding gratitude: "Gratitude is a catalyst to <i>all</i> Christlike attributes! A thankful heart is the parent of all virtues" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2014/04/grateful-in-any-circumstances?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grateful in Any Circumstances</a>," <i>Ensign, </i>May 2014; emphasis added). He has also said:<br><br><i>True gratitude is an expression of hope </i><b><i>and</i></b><i> testimony. It comes from acknowledging that we do not always understand the trials of life but trusting that oneday we will.</i> ["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2014/04/grateful-in-any-circumstances?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grateful</a>"; emphasis in original]<br><br>I am blessed to coach and direct the BYU Cougarettes. One of the areas we have chosen to focus on this year as a team is gratitude. I have seen, firsthand, gratitude in action over and over during the past few months, through numerous handwritten thank-you notes or heartfelt expressions of love for others. Expressions of appreciation for what has been received, individual random acts of kindness, a striving to avoid a sense of entitlement, and a focus on all that is good and uplifting have positively impacted individuals and the team. A focus on recognizing the tender mercies and blessings that have come to this team has truly made a difference and has ultimately added a culture of humility and gratefulness to each team practice.<br><br>Elder Wirthlin gave us a wonderful phrase to remember and implement in our lives: "Come what may, and love it" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2008/10/come-what-may-and-love-it?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Come What May, and Love It</a>," <i>Ensign, </i>November 2008). We would all do well to reflect on and incorporate those six inspiring words into our daily lives. Not all days are easy to love, but within each day is something of value that will expand our vision, increase our horizon, and cause our hearts to truly swell with love, appreciation, and gratitude. We just have to open our hearts and our eyes.<br><h2><b>Sharing Light</b></h2><br>I love BYU Athletics. I love our student athletes, coaches, administrators, and teams, and I love my Cougarettes. I am inspired by them! They encourage me to be a better person and coach. This is a department and an environment in which all are engaged in excellence and in achieving the very best that the human body and spirit can accomplish. I am passionate about and committed to the job I have of coaching our competitive dance team and, more important, of helping provide opportunities for testimonies and lives to be enriched and changed and of helping spiritual moments happen frequently.<br><br>President Kevin J Worthen often quotes from the BYU Mission Statement. He is very passionate and committed to making sure that all at BYU have a clear understanding of what the aims and mission of a BYU education are all about.<br><br>President Worthen has said:<br><br><i>While we will not do everything that other universities do, the expectation is that everything we do will be first-rate. According to the mission statement, "a commitment to excellence" ... is not an aspiration; it is an expectation.</i> ["The Why of the Y," BYU university conference address, 26 August 2014]<br><br>I have been inspired many times, as I am sure you have been, by President and Sister Worthen. There is no doubt that they are committed to BYU and love serving the students and faculty members here.<br><br>I appreciated the messages they shared at the beginning of this semester. President Worthen's message "The Light of the Y" encouraged all "to let the Y light you." His instruction was:<br><br><i>You are not here by accident. God has a work to perform through you. Make Him the center of your efforts. Do what He would want you to do. Let His light shine more brightly through you as a result of your experiences at BYU. If you do, miracles will happen in your life and you will see the majesty of the Lord work in the lives of others. </i>[<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/kevin-j-worthen_the-light-of-the-y/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BYU devotional address</a>, 6 September 2016]<br><br>In 2008, as the Cougarettes were preparing for the national competition, the team decided that they would like to compete with a routine that was unique in nature from those of previous years. The girls wanted to communicate something more heartfelt, and they wanted to seek for missionary opportunities to share their light and the gospel. It was determined that besides creating a special routine, they would also take with them about fifty copies of the March 2008 <i>Ensign</i> to give away and share, hoping for situations to arise in which they could present the magazine to their fellow competitors and share their love of the Savior.<br><br>This particular issue of the <i>Ensign</i> had a beautiful image of the Savior by Carl Bloch on the cover and was described as a special issue devoted entirely to expressing the Church's beliefs of our Savior Jesus Christ. It contained testimonies of our prophets and apostles. It testified of the life, mission, gospel, and Atonement of our Savior.<br><br>None of us could have imagined what would take place following the competition. Our final scores had us finishing in second place that year. Although obviously disappointed at the outcome, we huddled in a circle and said a prayer of gratitude before going to greet our families on the beach. What then ensued on the beach in Daytona was something unexpected and indeed humbling.<br><br>Many fellow competitors as well as members of the audience approached us to share their congratulations and well wishes and to tell us how our performance had touched them. Some expressed that they had experienced a feeling during our performance, and others said they had even been brought to tears. As these moments unfolded on the beach, members of that team of Cougarettes were able to offer those copies of the <i>Ensign</i> as gifts and also to share brief testimonies of their love for the Savior.<br><br>It was very clear and apparent to each member of that team that--we believe--we were not meant to win a title that year. Coming very close to winning and performing a routine that spoke to the heart opened many more doors and provided missionary opportunities that most likely would not have occurred otherwise. God allowed us to have the missionary moments this team had prayed for.<br><br>That particular year and that experience will be forever etched in my mind as one of the most memorable college dance team nationals I have been blessed to be a part of, and it was not a winning year in terms of a national title or trophy.<br><br>We never know who might be watching and how what we say and do might be impacting those around us. Elder D.Todd Christofferson said, "Our example should be such that no one can deny that the Latter-day Saints love the Savior" (in "The Gospel Answers Life's Problems and Challenges," worldwide leadership training meeting, 11 February 2012).<br><br>While we do not know for certain what effect the sharing of the magazines and our testimonies had on those individuals or teams, we do know that through competing at college nationals over several years we were able to inspire one young woman who had also felt something from our performances. She was not a member of the Church at that time, but she wanted to come to BYU because of what she had seen the Cougarettes do at competition.<br><br>She applied for and was accepted to BYU. That led to her investigation of the Church and her baptism shortly thereafter. She then auditioned for and became a member of the BYU Cougarettes 2013 national championship team--during the year the team won in both jazz and hip-hop for the very first time.<br><br>I am so grateful to a loving Heavenly Father who provided a way for us to share a message and our light through our talents.<br><br>Let me repeat what President Worthen said:<br><br><i>Let His light shine more brightly through you as a result of your experiences at BYU. If you do, miracles will happen in your life and you will see the majesty of the Lord work in the lives of others. </i>["<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/kevin-j-worthen_the-light-of-the-y/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Light of the Y</a>"]<br><br>Elder CraigC. Christensen taught:<br><br><i>Heavenly Father knows all about you--your strengths and your weaknesses. He knows perfectly who you are, but He also knows who you can become. And with that knowledge, He has placed you here, now--at the exact place and time in which you can do the most good with the talents and gifts He has given you. </i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2014/08/becoming-children-of-light?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Becoming Children of Light</a>," <i>Ensign, </i>August 2014]<br><br>Every day as I enter campus, I drive past a sign that reads "Enter to Learn; Go Forth to Serve." It thrills me as I watch former members of my team, now BYU alumni, take this phrase to heart. They are in the community serving and setting wonderful examples for those they are teaching, working with, and mentoring.<br><br>Each of you here at this time will have similar opportunities today, tomorrow, and in the future to touch and change lives. The things that you will experience here at BYU will give you so much to offer the world, your community, and, more personally and importantly, your families as you seek to better your circle of influence and make a difference in the lives of others.<br><h2><b>Living by the Spirit</b></h2><br>While I have already spoken about gratitude, Iwould like to share a personal story of which I am eternally grateful that provided an opportunity for growth in my own life and is for me an overwhelming testimony of God's presence in each of our lives.<br><br>In 2004 my home ward planned to participate in a pioneer trek. At that time I was serving in the Relief Society. I had not been called to go, nor was I expected to go, on the trek. My husband was called as the equipment coordinator of the trek, and our youngest son, age sixteen at the time, was eagerly planning to be a part of the trek experience with the rest of our ward youth.<br><br>About six weeks prior to the start of the trek, Ireceived a distinct impression that I needed to go on the trek with the ward. What I need to explain to you is that at that time in my life, I really was not into camping, hiking, getting dirty, or sleeping on the ground with bugs. I think you could safely call me a little spoiled in my nature.<br><br>As I am sure you can probably imagine, Ibrushed off the impression. While I felt that the impression was something I <i>should</i> listen to, my more logical side kept reminding me that this was not something I would enjoy doing, nor would it be a restful or relaxing vacation. There surely would not be a Marriott hotel waiting for me at the end of each day. I felt that I knew what was best for me.<br><br>The problem was that the impression did not go away. It kept coming back to me, all the while getting stronger, until I knew I could no longer ignore it. I met with my bishop and asked if I could volunteer to join a trek family and participate alongside my ward members, my husband, and my son.<br><br>Those of you who have been on a pioneer trek know of what I speak when I say it was not easy. What I experienced physically was not easy, but what I experienced spiritually taught me and prepared me for some very significant challenges that would be coming into my life in a few short weeks and months.<br><br>As I trekked along in the heat and the dirt, lay in my sleeping bag with my legs and feet throbbing at the end of a long day, and sat in the middle of a meadow on a plastic bucket, pouring my heart out in my personal journal, I truly allowed God to speak to me through the Holy Ghost. I was profoundly changed through that experience in ways I could never have been otherwise. It was a refiner's fire of sorts. Heavenly Father gave me a choice, tender gift. I was humbled, and I was taught--not in ways that I would have preferred, planned, or expected but in ways that God, who knows me and you best, knew I needed to be taught. I didn't realize I needed this experience in my life, but indeed I did.<br><br>What was to come were some very challenging trials, and had I not hearkened to these impressions I had received to participate in the trek, I would not have been spiritually, physically, or emotionally prepared for them. I was surrounded by angels from my ward as well as those not seen. The trek was in fact life changing for me.<br><br>That trek was more than twelve years ago, and I often reflect on that journey. I am so grateful for that experience and for the fact that God knew what I needed at that time. I am grateful for the promptings of the Holy Ghost and the impressions I clearly felt, and I am so grateful that I chose not to ignore them but to listen to them, trust them, and rely on the Spirit.<br><br>John 14:27 reads: "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid."<br><br>I lost my precious mother shortly after the trek to a terrible liver disease, and this particular verse of scripture, along with my experience on the trek, provided tremendous strength when I needed it the most. They have also provided great strength since then throughout various other personal trials.<br><br>It is important that we allow ourselves to be in places in which the Spirit can speak to us, we can feel the Holy Ghost, and the distractions of the world do not interfere. Most days I can be found up very early riding my bike through the neighborhoods near my home. While I do not profess to be a professional cyclist--in fact, far from it--­riding my bike is something I enjoy doing to honor my health, commune with nature, and listen as the Spirit speaks to me. It is on these morning rides that I have many opportunities to pray, ponder, and seek inspiration.<br><br>In our day-to-day lives there is so much noise, clutter, stress, and so on, and these distractions can in fact prevent us from hearing promptings and spiritual impressions.<br><br>In a talk titled "<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1996/07/filling-the-world-with-goodness-and-truth?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stand in Holy Places</a>," President Monson taught:<br><br><i>We must be vigilant in a world which has moved so far from that which is spiritual. It is essential that we reject anything that does not conform to our standards, refusing in the process to surrender that which we desire most: eternal life in the kingdom of God. The storms will still beat at our doors from time to time, for they are an inescapable part of our existence in mortality. We, however, will be far better equipped to deal with them, to learn from them, and to overcome them if we have the gospel at our core and the love of the Savior in our hearts. The prophet Isaiah declared </i>[in Isaiah 32:17],<i> "The work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever."...</i><br><br><i>My beloved brothers and sisters, communication with our Father in Heaven--including our prayers to Him and His inspiration to us--is necessary in order for us to weather the storms and trials of life. The Lord invites us, "Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently and ye shall find me"</i> [D&amp;amp;C 88:63]. <i>As we do so, we will feel His Spirit in our lives, providing us the desire and the courage to stand strong and firm in righteousness--to "stand ... in holy places, and be not moved" </i>[D&amp;amp;C 87:8]. [<i>Ensign, </i>November 2011]<br><br>Holy places can be anywhere we allow ourselves to feel God's Spirit.<br><br>God truly has a hand in our lives and will bless us as we prepare for small yet significant miracles to occur. As we draw near unto Him and seek Him diligently, we will find stability and strength to overcome and a source to which we can look for direction. That stability will come as an anchor in our lives and in our testimonies.<br><h2><b>Serving as God's Hands</b></h2><br>An old Quaker saying is:<br><br><i>If thee'll lift me while I lift thee,</i><br><i>We shall go up together!</i><br>[John Townsend Trowbridge, "A Story of the 'Barefoot Boy': Written for J. G. Whittier's Seventieth Birthday," <i>The Poetical Works of John Townsend Trowbridge</i> (Boston: Houghton, Mifflin, 1903), 227]<br><br>President HaroldB. Lee said:<br><br><i>You cannot lift another soul until you are standing on higher ground than he is. You must be sure, if you would rescue the man</i> [or woman],<i> that you yourself are setting the example of what you would have him be. You cannot light a fire in another soul unless it is burning in your own soul. ... The testimony that you bear, the spirit with which you teach and with which you lead, is one of the most important assets that you can have, as you help to strengthen those who need so much, wherein you have so much to give. Who of us, in whatever station we may have been in, have not needed strengthening? </i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1973/07/stand-ye-in-holy-places?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stand Ye in Holy Places</a>," <i>Ensign, </i>July 1973]<br><br>I am so grateful for the many ways in which Ihave truly felt the hand of the Lord in my life in blessing me with many choice spiritual experiences and with opportunities to share His light.<br><br>Back in 2012 the Cougarettes were getting ready to compete in an international festival in Prague in the Czech Republic. We had prepared five numbers to compete with at the festival. One of those numbers was a lyrical dance, spiritual in nature, performed to the hymn "Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing." It was a repertory piece that we had brought back for this occasion. Once again missionary moments were prayed for and sought after.<br><br>At a directors meeting the evening before the kickoff of the festival, I was asked by another director what types of numbers we were planning to compete with.<br><br>I described each of them and then told her that we were also doing a spiritual piece that was very special to us.<br><br>Her response was, "I wouldn't perform that if I were you. Those types of pieces never do well in this competition."<br><br>Needless to say, the Cougarettes took the stage the next day dressed in beautiful white costumes. As the girls began to dance, a hush came over the audience; you could hear a pin drop as those in the audience watched intently. As I looked around, I could see individuals unmistakably moved by what they were witnessing. Each of these girls was bearing a powerful silent testimony of our Savior Jesus Christ through dance. Atthe conclusion of the piece, the audience members sat in silence rather than applauding. The Spirit had truly communicated to them.<br><br>What a blessing it was to be able to use our dancing to touch others. We are taught that "our ability to develop and use our artistic gifts to edify and inspire others depends on our faithful adherence to the Lord's teachings" (from the introductory summary for M.Russell Ballard, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1996/07/filling-the-world-with-goodness-and-truth?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Filling the World with Goodness and Truth</a>," <i>Ensign, </i>July 1996).<br><br>In a small and simple way we are able, through our talents, to do the Lord's work and help spread His gospel. "By small and simple things are great things brought to pass" (Alma 37:6).<br><br>We are serving as the Lord's hands, and He asks for us to give all that we are able to bless the lives of others--to serve; to "lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees" (D&amp;amp;C 81:5); to rescue; and to bless. We have a blessed and sacred opportunity to be a light, to lift, to edify, to recognize a need, and to be the Lord's angels here on earth.<br><br>My husband, Scott, and I have been blessed with five beautiful and precious grandchildren--four girls and a boy. Two of those little girls are twins, Beth and Sadie, so it might come as no surprise that I love this story about some other twins, Kyrie and Brielle Jackson.<br><br>The twin girls were born on October 17, 1995, a full twelve weeks ahead of their due date. Both babies were placed in separate incubators. Kyrie, the larger of the two babies, was making good progress and gaining weight, but her smaller sister had breathing and heart-rate problems. There was little weight gain, and her oxygen levels were low.<br><br>On November 12 tiny Brielle went into critical condition. Her stick-thin arms and legs turned bluish-gray as she gasped for air. Her heart rate soared. Her parents watched, terrified that their little daughter might die.<br><br>After exhausting all other conventional remedies, one of the NICU nurses decided to try a procedure that was common in parts of Europe but virtually unknown in the United States. With parental permission, she placed the twins in the same bed.<br><br>No sooner had she closed the incubator door than Brielle snuggled up to Kyrie and began to calm down. Within minutes her blood-oxygen readings improved. As she dozed, Kyrie wrapped her left arm around her smaller sister. Brielle's heart rate stabilized, and her temperature rose to normal.<br><br>A photograph of Kyrie hugging her little sister, dubbed the "Rescuing Hug," appeared in both <i>Life</i> magazine and <i>Reader's Digest.</i> (See paraphrased story found on the Internet in various places; see also full story: Nancy Sheehan, "A Sister's Helping Hand," <i>Reader's Digest,</i> May 1996, 155–56.)<br><br>Our ability to rescue might be as simple as a smile, a listening ear, an understanding heart, a hug at an appropriate time, or an artistic expression of testimony.<br><br>President Monson reminded us:<br><br><i>We are surrounded by those in need of our attention, our encouragement, our support, our comfort, our kindness. ... We are the Lord's hands here upon the earth, with the mandate to serve and to lift His children. He is dependent upon each of us. </i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2009/11/what-have-i-done-for-someone-today?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What Have I Done for Someone Today</a>?" <i>Ensign, </i>November 2009]<br><br>A picture recently appeared on the Church's Instagram feed that illustrated perfectly just how often throughout any given day we are in a situation in which we have no idea of the burdens others are carrying. Wouldn't it be nice if we could wear an appropriate emoji over our heads, signaling to one and all just how we are feeling at any given moment? Of course that is not possible. How important, then, is it that we have open, compassionate, kind, and nonjudgmental hearts and that we seek to love others unconditionally and hearken to the promptings of the Spirit.<br><br>President SpencerW. Kimball said--and I know and have experienced this many, many times firsthand--that "God does notice us, and he watches over us. But it is usually through another person that he meets our needs" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1974/12/small-acts-of-service?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First Presidency Message: Small Acts of Service</a>," <i>Ensign, </i>December 1974).<br><br>None of us will escape sorrow, disappointment, and trials. There may be times when we will be called upon to be the rescuer or to have the strength, the fortitude, and the means to help, lift, and love another. There may be many other times when we are the one who needs to allow others to rescue us. It is at times a difficult thing to admit we need help. However, when we allow others to help us, we are not only receiving blessings but are allowing the giver to be the receiver as well.<br><br>A poem titled "Touching Shoulders" is one of my favorites:<br><br><i>There's a comforting thought at the close of the day,</i><br><i>When I'm weary and lonely and sad,</i><br><i>That sort of grips hold of my crusty old heart,</i><br><i>And bids it be merry and glad:</i><br><br><i>It gets in my soul and it drives out the blues</i><br><i>And it thrills, through and through--</i><br><i>It is just a sweet memory that chants the refrain,</i><br><i>"I'm glad I touched shoulders with you."</i><br><br><i>Did you know you were brave? Did you know you werestrong?</i><br><i>Did you know there was one leaning hard?</i><br><i>Did you know that I waited and listened and prayed,</i><br><i>And was cheered by your simplest word?</i><br><br><i>Did you know that I longed for the smile on your face--</i><br><i>For the sound of your voice ringing true?</i><br><i>Did you know I grew stronger and better because</i><br><i>I had merely touched shoulders with you?</i><br>[Mrs. FredW. Gage, "Touching Shoulders," <i>TheInland Printer </i>53, no. 4 (July 1914):624]<br><br>So many of our brothers and sisters experience loneliness, heartache, disappointment, and sorrow at this time of year. Take time to listen to the promptings of the Holy Ghost. Pray for opportunities to rescue and to help. As you do so, you <i>will </i>be blessed to be the miracle in someone's life.<br><br>As Horton so perfectly demonstrated, we should be willing to go out of our way to help, to rescue, and to provide aid, encouragement, enlightenment, a listening ear, or a safe place torest:<br><br><i>If thee'll lift me while I lift thee,</i><br><i>We shall go up together!</i><br><br>Our Savior gave us the perfect example of love, compassion, respite, and rescue. He has beckoned us to come unto Him, to be His hands, and to love one another. May we go forward with a commitment to listen to those spiritual promptings; to love, lift, and rescue; to be a light to others; and to be His hands here on earth. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Jodi Maxfield, artistic director of the BYU Cougarettes dance team, delivered this devotional address on 29November 2016.</i><br><br>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>from Joseph Smith - Bonnie L. Oscarson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, it is a surreal experience to be standing here talking to you today. Forty-eight years ago I first set foot on this campus as a seventeen-year-old freshman. I remember attending BYU devotionals in the Smith Fieldhouse (because there was no Marriott Center yet), listening to speakers just like you are doing.<br><br>Things have changed a lot since then. The female students were not allowed to wear pants on campus--yes, we were cold all winter long. We whitewashed the Y on the mountain every year with a very long bucket brigade, and the Ywas lit with real fire. DavidO. McKay was the prophet, LyndonB. Johnson was the president of the United States, and I had lost a good friend in the war in Vietnam. The good news is that I did graduate from BYU. The bad news is that it took me forty-one years to do it. I was very elated at the event, but I do not recommend that educational strategy!<br><br>I can assure you that there is nothing in my life that could possibly have given me the notion that someday I would be standing at a podium in the Marriott Center delivering a devotional address. Just as with so many events that have taken place in my life during the past three and a half years, I truly relate to Sister Marjorie Pay Hinckley, who often said that she was "wondering how a nice girl like me got into a mess like this."<sup>1</sup> Maybe there are some lessons to be learned from this.<br><h2><b>Lessons from the Life of Joseph Smith</b></h2><br>The month of December is the birth month of the Prophet Joseph Smith. With that as inspiration, I would like to talk about three principles inspired by events from the early life of Joseph Smith that might be of value in your current situations and lives.<br><h3><b><i>Lesson 1: You Have an Important Mission toFulfill</i></b></h3><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley once quoted Reverend EdwardT. Sullivan, who said:<br><br><i>When God wants a great work done in the world or a great wrong righted, he goes about it in a very unusual way. He doesn't stir up his earthquakes or send forth histhunderbolts. Instead, he has a helpless baby born.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1978/10/behold-your-little-ones?lang=eng&amp;amp;_r=1"><sup>2</sup></a><br><br>After a long period of apostasy and spiritual darkness, the time had come to fulfill the promises of the Lord that the Church of Jesus Christ would be restored to the earth with all of the keys and authority found in the original Church in Christ's day. How would the Lord accomplish this great task? <i>A baby was born.</i><br><br>On December 23, 1805, a poor farmer's wife by the name of Lucy Mack Smith gave birth to a baby boy who was named after his father, Joseph Smith. He was their fourth child--he had two older brothers and an older sister.<sup>3</sup> Who could have guessed that this little obscure baby boy born in a small rented log house in the woods of Vermont to a family of very meager means would one day be described like this:<br><br><i>Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>And so we can learn our first lesson from Joseph Smith's simple beginnings. I testify that Joseph Smith was foreordained in the premortal life to be the prophet of the Restoration. He was born with certain gifts and abilities that he worked hard to develop. He took advantage of every possible opportunity to learn and grow. He was willing to stretch and extend his capacity--allof which helped him fulfill his mission.<br><br>I also testify that each one of you came to earth foreordained to accomplish certain things. Just as there didn't seem to be anything very remarkable about that little baby boy born in the woods of Vermont, it is perhaps hard to understand that you have the potential to make a great difference in the world. I assure you that every single person sitting in this audience today has the capacity to become a mighty tool in the hands of the Lord in accomplishing deeds of eternal worth. I suspect that if we could see ourselves as the Lord sees us, we would all be astounded by our potential.<br><br>Each of you, both men and women, need to understand that you have been given great opportunities for a uniquely balanced education. My hope for you is that you don't sell yourselves short. We, as a people, put a high priority and premium on marriage, motherhood, and ­fatherhood--and rightly so. Eternal families stand front and center in our theology and doctrine. The role of mother or father is the most important calling you will ever have in this life and in the next. This is the time to be earnestly seeking for an eternal relationship, but it is also the time for education and preparation. All of you should be aiming for the stars!<br><br>Stretch yourselves. Take advantage of every opportunity to grow, to learn, to gain experience, and to further your education and learning. There may never be another time in your life in which the opportunities for expanding your intellectual capacities will be available like they are at this phase of your life.<br><br>Everyone has a different path for his or her life. In all your learning, learn to listen to the promptings of the Holy Ghost, which will help you make important decisions regarding your future. When and if marriage opportunities come, you will be a better wife or husband, mother or father, because you have taken advantage of this time to educate yourself. If marriage is delayed for you, your life will be richer, and you will have more to contribute because you took advantage of every opportunity for learning and knowledge.<br><br>One of the first scriptures I ever memorized was from Doctrine and Covenants 130:18–19:<br><br><i>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i><br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i><br><br>The only things we take with us into the next life are the desires and character traits we have developed, our family relationships, and the knowledge we have gained. May we let that be our guide for where we spend our time and efforts in this life. May we realize that now is the prime time, "through [our] diligence and obedience," for the "gaining knowledge" phase of this equation.<br><br>Intelligence and knowledge are not just educational in nature. They also involve the quest to perfect ourselves in all areas of our lives. Are you living up to your potential and being true to your knowledge of who you are? Too often we become content with mediocrity in our standards, in our behavior, in our relationships, and certainly in our quest for spiritual and intellectual enlightenment. If you are not living up to the privileges you have been given in this life, now is a good time to reevaluate where and who you want to be now and in a few years and to begin making the changes that will help you rise above the commonplace, which the world finds acceptable.<br><br>Joseph Smith was many things, but one thing he never settled for was being average or mediocre! And just as Joseph Smith was chosen to come at a specific time and place to fulfill the mission the Lord had in mind for him, you have also been chosen to come to the earth now and have been and will yet be given gifts, abilities, experiences, and opportunities that will help you fulfill the mission the Lord has in mind for you. Prepare yourselves, follow the promptings of the Holy Ghost, and dare to reach for the stars!<br><h3><b><i>Lesson 2: Stand Up to Criticism</i></b></h3><br>The second lesson I want to talk about from the early life of the Prophet Joseph comes from his experiences with the First Vision. We are all familiar with the great spiritual truths that burst upon the world as a result of young Joseph's experience in the Sacred Grove on that spring day in 1820. The heavens were once again open, and the true nature of the Godhead was revealed. But have you considered the sudden and irreversible changes that this experience caused in the life of a fourteen-year-old boy?<br><br>Here is Joseph's own description of the after­effects of this great event on his social standing inthe community:<br><br><i>Some few days after I had this vision, I happened to be in company with one of the Methodist preachers, ..</i><i>. and .</i>.. <i>I took occasion to give him an account of the vision which I had had. I was greatly surprised at his behavior; he treated my communication not only lightly, but with great contempt, saying it was all of the devil, that there were no such things as visions or revelations in these days; that all such things had ceased with the apostles, and that there would never be any more of them.</i><br><br><i>I soon found, however, that my telling the story had excited a great deal of prejudice against me among professors of religion, and was the cause of great persecution, which continued to increase; and though I was an obscure boy, only between fourteen and fifteen years of age, and my circumstances in life such as to make a boy of no consequence in the world, yet men of high standing would take notice sufficient to excite the public mind against me, and create a bitter persecution; and this was common among all the sects--all united to persecute me.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>Think back to your fourteen-year-old self. How would you have reacted if all the trusted adults outside of your family began to make fun of you and persecute you? Would you begin to doubt yourself?<br><br>What about our current culture? We all have devices that have the capacity to dispense a con­stant stream of information as well as misinformation to us wherever we may find ourselves--­waiting for the bus, sitting in a classroom, or sitting at home in our room. What filters do we have in place for deciding what to pay attention to, what to believe, and what we let influence us?<br><br>Let me read Joseph Smith's words describing the filter he used as he was pummeled with opinions and persecution:<br><br><i>I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light I saw two Personages, and they did in reality speak to me; and though I was hated and persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision, yet it was true; and while they were persecuting me, reviling me, and speaking all manner of evil against me falsely for so saying, I was led to say in my heart: Why persecute me for telling the truth? I have actually seen a vision; and who am I that I can withstand God, or why does the world think to make me deny what I have actually seen? For I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it; at least I knew that by so doing I would offend God, and come under condemnation.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>Even at the tender age of fourteen, Joseph relied upon what he knew that he knew to stand up to the skeptics surrounding him. I believe we also receive help from the Lord as we exercise faith in what the Lord has given us in our lives. We have been baptized and have entered into a covenant relationship with our Heavenly Father. Many of you have made sacred covenants in the temple. As we keep moving forward with faith, we are promised by the Lord:<br><br><i>I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>I love the lesson from Oliver Cowdery's experience described in section6 of the Doctrine and Covenants. The Lord asked Oliver to think back on a time when his prayers had been answered and he had received a feeling of peace. The Lord then asked him, "What greater witness can you have than from God?"<sup>8</sup><br><br>I believe the Lord wants us to remember the times when we <i>have</i> felt the Spirit and then use our past experiences to strengthen us and enable us to defend our faith.<br><br>You have received the promise of help in times of need. You have at times felt the Spirit in your lives. And you have experienced the joyous fruits of living the gospel. When opposition comes or you are going through a trial in which it is hard to feel the Spirit, remember the times when you have received that witness and hold on to your faith with both hands and all of your strength.<br><br>In the most recent general conference, Elder RonaldA. Rasband said:<br><br><i>I encourage you ... to recall, especially in times of crisis, when you felt the Spirit and your testimony was strong; remember the spiritual foundations you have built.</i> ...<br><br><i>Never forget, question, or ignore personal, sacred spiritual experiences. The adversary's design is to distract us from spiritual witnesses, while the Lord's desire is to enlighten and engage us in His work.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2016/10/lest-thou-forget?lang=eng"><sup>9</sup></a><br><br>When you are confronted with questions, skepticism, and doubts coming from the outside world, take the wise advice of an apostle of the Lord, President DieterF. Uchtdorf: "First doubt your doubts before you doubt your faith."<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2013/10/come-join-with-us?lang=eng"><sup>10</sup></a> Each of you has surely received at some point in your life a witness from God similar to that of Oliver Cowdery. Don't be too quick to reject those experiences in favor of something you read on the Internet. Let the Holy Ghost be your filter for truth.<br><br>Elder NealA. Maxwell once observed, "Some insist upon studying the Church only through the eyes of its defectors--like interviewing Judas to understand Jesus."<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/neal-a-maxwell_hell-moved/"><sup>11</sup></a> I urge you to seek truth from pure sources that you know you can trust--the scriptures, the words of the living prophets, and the whisperings of the Holy Ghost. I urge you to learn from the strength and steadiness of a fourteen-year-old boy who trusted what he had seen and felt and never wavered in his faith.<br><h3><b><i>Lesson 3: Understand the Principle of Repentance</i></b></h3><br>Another of the great lessons we learn from Joseph Smith's life has to do with repentance. He was a very young prophet of only twenty-two years of age and was early in the process of translating the Book of Mormon when he gave into peer pressure and made a significant error in judgment. It resulted in the loss of the first 116 pages of the translation of the Book of Mormon. He was chastised severely by the Lord, who told him:<br><br><i>You should not have feared man more than God. ...</i><br><br><i>... Thou wast chosen to do the work of the Lord, but because of transgression, if thou art not aware thou wilt fall.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>Put yourself in the shoes of this young prophet. Can you imagine how he must have felt as this whole episode unfolded? Perhaps he understood that he had been entrusted with something of indescribable eternal importance and that he had let the Lord down! Can we not all relate to those feelings? We are all human, which means we are all going to sin and make mistakes.<br><br>Listen to what the Lord told Joseph in this same section just a few verses later:<br><br><i>But remember, God is merciful; therefore, repent of that which thou hast done which is contrary to the commandment which I gave you, and thou art still chosen, and art again called to the work.</i><sup>13</sup><br><br>What healing balm those words must have been to the Prophet Joseph. He knew that there was hope and that the Lord is loving and forgiving and will always allow us to start again.<br><br>The ability to repent of our sins is one of the most basic and yet glorious doctrines of the gospel! It is a gift extended to all of God's children, and it is possible because of the Atonement of the Savior Jesus Christ. His invitation is tender and personal and filled with love. He has said to all:<br><br><i>Will ye not now return unto me, and repent of your sins, and be converted, that I may heal you?</i><br><br><i>Yea, verily I say unto you, if ye will come unto me ye shall have eternal life. Behold, mine arm of mercy is extended towards you, and whosoever will come, him will I receive; and blessed are those who come unto me.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>It is easy to think of the principle of repentance as a negative thing, as something we need only for the really serious sins--those that require a visit to the bishop's office. Sincere repentance is certainly a necessary part of overcoming serious sin, but, in reality, repentance should be part of our daily thoughts and behavior. "It is a change of mind and heart that gives [us] a fresh view about God, about [ourselves], and about the world."<sup>15</sup> Daily course correction is what helps us progress, improve, and change, day by day and year by year. The Atonement of Jesus Christ is what makes it possible for us to both overcome serious mistakes and to be better people today in our habits, relationships, and thoughts than we were yesterday. It is a joyous blessing and gift that gives us hope. Without repentance, there is no hope--only despair.<br><br>As we look at Joseph Smith's experience with the lost 116 pages, we see that he learned from his mistakes. You will notice that from this point on he didn't badger or question the Lord when he didn't like an answer he had received in prayer. I am guessing that the way he felt when he thought he had lost his prophetic call was something he remembered for the rest of his life. He was asked to do some hard things and some unpopular things, but he never wavered. I think we would all love to be more like the Prophet Joseph and learn from our mistakes. Nevertheless, take heart in the Lord's promise that, despite our sins, "his hand is stretched out still"<sup>16</sup>--and it always will be.<br><br>I love the Prophet Joseph Smith. His life, example, and experiences provide a rich resource for our learning and understanding of gospel principles. I have mentioned only three today: striving to be the best we can be, holding on to our faith in the face of criticism, and making repentance a part of our daily lives. A close study of the life of this prophet of God will yield many more rich and important life lessons.<br><h2><b>Personal Witness of the Prophet Joseph Smith</b></h2><br>I would like to share my personal testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith and explain why it is essential that we each come to know for ourselves that he was the divinely called prophet of the Restoration.<br><br>When I was a young girl of about seven or eight years of age, I loved to read. One Sunday afternoon I was looking for a book to read and found a small volume on our bookshelves called <i>From Plowboy to Prophet</i> by WilliamA. Morton. I took the book down and began to read a simplified version of the life and experiences of Joseph Smith. I read in that simple little book about how a young man was prompted by a verse of scripture to seek answers to his questions and went into the woods to ask the Lord which church he should join. I read the account of how that unpretentious farm boy was visited by God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, in a display of glory and light brighter than the noonday sun.<br><br>Certainly I had heard the story before, but it was in reading the account that day that I remember first feeling a confirmation from the Holy Ghost that this was true. I felt the confirmation in my heart. I was thrilled to think that the Lord speaks to His children on earth and that we have prophets in our day. It was the beginning of my conviction and testimony of the restored Church of Jesus Christ being established in these latter days.<br><br>It was in the beginning a childlike faith, but it was enough. Later, as a seminary student, I read the Book of Mormon. I really didn't have to ask if it was true. As I read, I felt that now-familiar warmth and confirmation from the Spirit that this was everything Joseph Smith had claimed it to be and that it was a confirmation of his mission. If the Book of Mormon is true, then it is further proof that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God.<br><br>Later in my life I was called to be an early-morning seminary teacher, and that year the course of study was the Doctrine and Covenants and Church history. All of our children were in school during the day, and I found myself sitting at our dining room table each day with every book about Church history I could lay my hands on. I sat for hours every day immersed in reading everything I could about the life of Joseph Smith, the early accounts of Church history, and the revelations received. I couldn't get enough. I was riveted.<br><br>It is interesting that as controversial questions have arisen in more recent times about Joseph Smith and some aspects of Church history, I feel grateful for that time in my life. I read all of those things years ago as I studied the life of Joseph Smith and the history of the early days of the Church. I am already familiar with many of the slanderous reports made by the Prophet's detractors in his time, so when they begin to resurface as "new information," my response is, "Really? This old stuff again?" Accurate knowledge together with faith is the best defense against skepticism.<br><br>We are encouraged to include in our testimonies that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world and that Joseph Smith is the prophet of the Restoration. I recently found a statement by Elder BruceR. McConkie that explains why. He said, "The prophet Joseph Smith ... is one of the great dispensation heads, and a dispensation head is a revealer for his age and his period of the knowledge of Christ and of salvation."<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/bruce-r-mcconkie_joseph-smith-revealer-christ/"><sup>17</sup></a><br><br>Elder McConkie went on to say that there have always been testimony meetings, and if we had lived in the days of Adam or Enoch, we would have testified of their true callings and linked them to the Savior.<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/bruce-r-mcconkie_joseph-smith-revealer-christ/"><sup>18</sup></a><br><br>And so I testify to you that Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer and that Joseph Smith was called and foreordained before this world was to stand at the head of this dispensation as the legal administrator with the keys and authority for this period of time. He is the revealer of the knowledge of Jesus Christ and of salvation for our day. I testify that from Joseph's life we can learn many important gospel lessons to inspire and guide our lives. I testify that the Book of Mormon is a true record and that it stands as a second witness of the mission of Jesus Christ. I testify that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Lord's kingdom on the earth today. I know of these things through the power and testimony that has come through the Holy Ghost. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Bonnie L.
