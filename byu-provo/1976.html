<h1>p the Cross - Neal A. Maxwell - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I have been delighted, brothers and sisters, as you no doubt have been, with the quality of the music tonight. I always anticipate that portion of the program when I come. I appreciate the hospitality of your stake presidents--the able high priests who preside over the twelve stakes here--with whom we have just had a few brief, informal moments in a reception. I am grateful for these men and for the outstanding women who are ever at their sides. I appreciate, too, every chance I have to be with my colleagues, Dallin Oaks and Bob Thomas, and others who are here representing the faculty and administration. Most of all, my young brothers and sisters, I appreciate the privilege of being with you.<br><br>I need to alert you to two possible problems in the course of what I say tonight. First, I write very illegibly, and I have been trying to finish this speech in airports and elsewhere this weekend. My style of writing presently was once characterized by President Lee as unreformed Egyptian. More recently, I passed President Kimball a note on the stand at sacrament meeting to tell him that our school in Tonga had "burned" down. In his own sweet, courteous way, reluctant to embarrass me, and having studied my inscrutable inscribings as long as he could, he sent back a note and said, "Did you mean 'buried' or 'burned'?" Second, I have deliberately tried to leave myself open to the Spirit, in particular as I reach that point of closing my remarks tonight.<br><h2><b>The Role of Women in the Church</b></h2><br>I appreciate, more than I can say, this opportunity to be with you as you begin the Winter Semester. I am grateful that my wife, son, daughters, and son-in-law are here also. Since my wife and daughters are here, that creates a moment when, before proceeding to my text, I wish to observe that the role of women in the Church has never been more important than it is now, because never has the Church been so directly important and influential to so many as it is now. While the Church will always be priesthood-led and priesthood-centered, we must not make the mistake of drawing wrong conclusions from that reality. I hope the young women of the Church will do all they can to develop their God-given talents and to stretch themselves intellectually and spiritually during their youth and young adult years, for the learning process is scaffolding for the soul.<br><br>We desire our women to be unarguably superb individuals, wives, and mothers, and they can contribute so much to this outcome by making the most of their educational opportunities, both now and by having a posture of lifetime learning. A short time ago, during one of the few times at our own ward sacrament meeting, our bishop called attention to a brochure describing a local Church Education program which he then placed at the side of the pulpit. Significantly, after the benediction, the first person to get a brochure was Sister Camilla Kimball, the wife of the prophet, who has rightly been called "Lady of Constant Learning." She continues to be involved spiritually; she has been a Relief Society spiritual living teacher for more than twenty years--until recently she continued to be involved. Educationally she has taken classes of one kind or another every year since she has been married, except for the last two years when traveling has precluded this kind of participation. She was the first pace-setting child of that family of eighteen high-achieving children in her father's and mother's family.<br><br>I remember a BYU movie a few years ago in which there was a line something like this: "Some men never recover from the ignorance of their mothers." Conversely, one cannot fully appreciate the Prophet Joseph Smith without noting the remarkable qualities of his outstanding mother, Lucy Mack Smith. We give to our children what we are. The more a mother brings to a nest, the more nutritive the nest.<br><br>It is very important that we genuinely encourage the full development of women in the Church, so that they can carry out their unique roles effectively and articulately--in the nursery and neighborhood, and in the classroom as well as in cookery.<br><br>Brethren, marry a woman who is your better in some respects; and, sisters, do likewise, so that your eternal partnership is one of compensating competencies. This is certainly the case in my own marriage, so far as certain attributes are concerned. I am gladdened--not threatened--by my wife's superior qualities. I am grateful for her traits and qualities that excel my own in some critical dimensions of our partnership.<br><br>I hope that our young sisters will not only acquire the vital skills of homemaking, therefore, but also that they will not neglect their natural talents in literature or language and in science, just as I hope our young men will study the facts of fatherhood, as well as physics or fine arts, and put their hands to that plow without looking back. Education involves the preparing of the person, and that is usually what matters--more than the particular calisthenics that are used.<br><br>Remember, we take our knowledge, skills, and attributes with us not only into marriage--but also into eternity. Knowledge rises with us in the resurrection, and the limitations on our luggage then will not be limitations of volume but of kind.<br><br>Finally, I have never sung Eliza R. Snow's lyrics of 1845 in the anthem of appreciation "O My Father" without being touched by its reverence for womanhood, which is light years ahead of some current attempts to dignify womanhood. The inspired truths for those lyrics came through the Prophet Joseph Smith, but the inspired poetry was Eliza's, as President Joseph F. Smith once observed.<br><br>Sisters, if there are some prophetic sayings you do not fully understand, do what a magnificent Mary did--keep those sayings in your heart and ponder them. Meanwhile, push out your own borders, just as the borders of the kingdom are being pushed out. Let LDS women show the real way to womanhood, preening not for the praise of the world or pressing for passing political preeminence. Male or female, we must not fail to see the simple truths because we are forever "looking beyond the mark."<br><h2><b>The Challenges of Mortality</b></h2><br>The bulk of what I wish to say tonight focuses on the need, individually and collectively, to summon all our skills and our strengths to life and then to carry the challenging cross each of us has been called to shoulder.<br><br>The specific strategic statements of divine intent about mortality are rare and profound. We know that the work of God is to "bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). We also know that God places a premium on our having righteous experience, for "all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good" (D&amp;amp;C 122:7).<i>These are most fundamental perceptions about life!</i>Without a correct understanding of these realities by great men and women, there could not have been the faith, trust, and courage needed at Gethsemane and Golgotha, or a battered but prevailing Job, or a willing Prophet Joseph Smith who went to Carthage "like a lamb."<br><br>Correct conduct under stress is more likely when one has correct expectations about life.<br><br>To err by having naive expectations concerning the purposes of life is to err everlastingly. Life is neither a pleasure palace through whose narrow portals we pass briefly, laughingly, and heedlessly before extinction, nor is life a cruel predicament in an immense and sad wasteland. It is the middle (but briefest) estate of the three estates in man's carefully constructed continuum of experience.<br><br>One day we will understand fully how complete our commitment was in our first estate in accepting the very conditions of challenge in our second estate about which we sometimes complain in this school of stress. Our collective and personal premortal promises will then be laid clearly before us.<br><br>Further, when we are finally judged in terms of our performance in this second estate, we will see that God, indeed, is perfect in his justice and mercy. We will also see that when we fail here it will not have been because we were truly tempted above that which we were able to bear. There was always an escape hatch had we looked for it! We will also see that our lives have been fully and fairly measured. In retrospect, we will even see that our most trying years here will often have been our best years, producing large tree rings on our soul, Gethsemanes of growth! Mortality is moistened by much opportunity if our roots of resolve can but take it in.<br><br>Just as no two snowflakes are precisely alike in design, so the configuration of life's challenges differs also. Some of our experiences are not fully shareable with others. Thus, others, try as they may, cannot fully appreciate them. They must trust us, our generalizations and testimonies concerning these experiences. A few of our experiences should not even be shared. But it is useful to ponder the past examples of our partners on the pathway.<br><br>In the midst of some of these individualized challenges, however, we may cry out on our small scale as the Savior did on the cross, or as the Prophet did in Liberty Jail. Being in agony, we will pray more earnestly, for cries of agony are not the same as cries of despair.<br><br>Our individual experiences may not always be unique, but they are always authentic. God will even take into account our perceptions of, as well as our responses to, our trials. For those of us who do not, for instance, find claustrophobia a challenge, it is difficult to measure the terror that comes to those for whom it is such a challenge. Thus, a friend may seem to struggle unnecessarily long before finally prevailing with regard to a particular principle of the gospel. But for that individual, the struggle was real enough! We need, particularly, to understand with kindness those who are asked o go out to do battle again on a familiar field--on the very battleground where they have already suffered defeat several times. Yet some of our most difficult victories will occur on new terrain--like Joseph's in Egypt--when we do not have the equivalent of a "home court" advantage.<br><br>We must remember that, while the Lord reminded the Prophet Joseph Smith that he had not yet suffered as Job,<i>only the Lord can compare crosses!</i><br><h2><b>Immortal Moments in the Scriptures</b></h2><br>As I review some "case studies," I will leave it to you to make the relevant application to your own life, if there be such, from the examples to which I turn now. To begin with, there is always more drama about us than we can drink in. Mortal minds cannot fully measure the immortal moments we are about to consider. For instance, in terms of learning impact, there is simply no comparison between what you and I thought of when we last heard a rooster crow and what Peter thought that once when he heard the soul-piercing sound of a cock crowing--especially the third time! That sound, no doubt, sent a shudder of sorrow through Peter--but it was godly sorrow, the kind that causes a cleansing and sends us inward to scrub our soul. You and I have heard roosters crowing many times in our lives, but for him that moment was special.<br><br>When we see each other in the morning, our sleep has often not been the same, even though we usually each say the same<i>"</i>Good morning!" Uriah apparently slept very well when, as a loyal lieutenant of King David, he slept with the servants on the floor at King David's door. Uriah was loyal to both his men "in the open fields," to his king, and to his wife, Bathsheba. By contrast, one cannot help but wonder how well the conspiring and adulterous David slept that same night! The later lamentations of David indicate many sleepless nights following his sending the uncompromised Uriah to his death--in the "forefront of the hottest battle," where the "valiant men were" (see 2 Samuel 11:15–16). Uriah fell, but David plummeted from the privileged place portioned for him in the next world.<br><br>Thus, there are certain mortal moments and minutes that matter--certain hinge points in the history of each human. Some seconds are so decisive they shrink the soul, while other seconds are spent so as to stretch the soul.<br><br>Contemplate a tale of two kings: There was a brief moment when King Agrippa was genuinely stirred by Paul's preachment. Paul discerningly knew that Agrippa knew; he even asked Agrippa the ultimate question: "Believest thou?" But Agrippa would not own up to his intimations and spiritual stirrings, probably computing the cost were he to do more than smoothly say he "almost" believed (see Acts 26:27–28). In my opinion, Agrippa's comment was not just flippant feedback. He had received a measure of the witness of a special witness, and some part of that king knew that what he had been told was true.<br><br>By contrast, another king, Lamoni's father, heard Aaron's preachment and owned up to as much truth as he then understood. He was willing to acknowledge the spiritual stirrings within him. Trustingly, he said in reply to the interrogatory ''Believest thou that there is a God?" "And if now thou sayest there is a God, behold I will believe" (Alma 22:7). What great words from a great moment! Time in such settings is measured not by clock seconds, but by soul seconds! Those individuals who are free enough to acknowledge the first feelings of faith are true to themselves--and are surely those whom the truth makes free.<br><br>Contemplate two walks up, and then down, the slopes of two adjacent mountains--Mount Moriah and the Mount of Olives. Up one mountain came Judas "with a great multitude" to kiss and to betray the Master. One wonders what the walk<i>down</i>the mountain that night was like for Judas and which was more searing--his lips on Jesus' face, or Jesus' words to him, "Betrayest thou the Son of Man with a kiss?" (Luke 22:48). Few scenes of pathos rank with that of a guilty Judas trying to give back the thirty pieces of silver and seeing how those who had used him fiendishly were devoid of mercy and empathy for him. Judas' soul-slide was not a sudden thing, and his subsequent suicide ranks as perhaps the most self-contemptuous in history.<br><br>In contrast, early in the morning--centuries before--an obedient Abraham walked up and then down nearby Mount Moriah with his son, Isaac: "They went both of them together." Abraham had been told, "Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest." We do not know what, if anything, the father and son conversed about on the way up Moriah, but ponder what marvelous moments when father and son walked down that mountain!<br><br>Significantly, Abraham did not see the substitute ram on Mount Moriah--until<i>after</i>the moment that mattered--when he obediently "stretched forth his hand, and took the knife" (Genesis 22:2–13). Sometimes the cross must be taken up decisively. There is no time for an agonizing appraisal.<br><br>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego did not know if God would spare them from the fiery furnace. They simply said:<br><br><i>If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.</i><br><br><i>But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</i>[Daniel 3:17–18]<br><br>Note the words "but if not" --these are words of unconditional commitment.<br><br>Sometimes we must "take the heat" even if we are not certain the thermostat of trial will soon be turned down.<i>We must decide before anything else is really decided!</i><br><br>When we have that kind of courage, neither will we walk alone in our own "fiery furnace," for as is recorded in Daniel, there was a fourth form in that fiery furnace with the valiant threesome, and the form was "like the Son of God." Peter gave us wise counsel when he said to the disciples, which each of us aspires to be, the following words: "Think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you" (1 Peter 4:12). When we carry the cross we must expect to share, in some measure, in the sufferings of Christ. But he will be near us even in the "fiery furnace."<br><br>Sometimes the learning process is prolonged. It was only--to use a felicitous phrase describing Enoch's people, "in the process of time" (Moses 7:21 )--that the reconciliation of Esau and Jacob occurred. How one warms to the later meeting of those two matured men and their immense caravans in the desert--years after the earlier struggle over status, when "Esau hated Jacob." How magnanimous are the words then of a secure Esau in declining Jacob's proffered gift. The scriptures say, after Jacob made his offering: "And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself" (Genesis 33:9).<br><br>Much time also ensued between the walk of Joseph's brothers back from the pit into which they had thrown Joseph and their later walk back (with much-needed corn) from Egypt to Canaan, when all the brothers who had treated him so terribly were saved by a generous Joseph. If we wonder today why, when individuals in groups become unprotesting participants in a veering toward evil, no one seems to speak up; and if we are perplexed that when some speak up it is only in a weak Reuben-type dissent (which makes "I told you we shouldn't have done that" a likely utterance)‚--if we wonder why those things happen, it is because individuals, in this case Joseph's brothers, failed. It is always the same, brothers and sisters. Our failures are individual. You and I, therefore, have an obligation to grasp those opportunities for truth saying and for restraining evil. If we do not, we will tumble, as Joseph's brothers did, collectively. Weak individuals make great dominoes!<br><br>Perhaps a young Joseph, of whom his brothers could not even speak peaceably, might even have given them some small cause for jealousy. But a matured, magnanimous, and highly spiritual Joseph (significantly and modestly) did not at first even reveal his identity to his poverty-stricken brothers. The tree rings on Joseph's soul must have been large, indeed, including the year when he was in the pit and was then sold into a strange culture in the beginning of a great adventure. Joseph was victorious "on the road."<br><br>The same basic substance, for instance, chemically two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen, left Pilate's hands very dirty when he washed them (he thought) of the affair concerning Jesus of Nazareth. He would not listen to feedback. But notice how water was used cleansingly by Naaman, the Syrian military commander who listened to feedback (and from less statusful servants) and as a result was willing to be washed in the Jordan River and was healed of his leprosy.<br><br>Thus, the scenery, the sounds, the substance are often similar--but the consequences are immensely different, depending on how we use our mortal micromoments. As George MacDonald warned: "The moment which coincides with the work to be done, is the moment to be minded; the next [moment] is nowhere till God has made it."<br><br>There are some decisions we make when we have a reasonable understanding of the consequences that will flow from such decisions. Jesus knew and Joseph Smith knew about their impending martyrdom.<br><br>There are other times when we are swept along by events and must simply trust the Lord. For instance, Paul may not have known that his judicial appeal to Caesar would finally take him to Rome and to precious points in between. But the Lord wanted him to go to Rome, and Paul was swept along on wants of divine design and making.<br><h2><b>Development of Personal Strength</b></h2><br>There are still other times when we can see the consequences of our decisions, but we deliberately try to repress them because we do not want to face them. David's relationship with Bathsheba could have both started<i>and</i>stopped with his view from the terrace. But it did not, for David not only saw, but sent for Bathsheba.<br><br>What, then, are some of the skills and strengths other than those now noted which enable us to lift and then to carry the cross?<br><br><i>First,</i>we must realize that the weight of the cross is great enough without our carrying burdens that we could jettison through the process of repentance. Paul gave us wise counsel in this regard when he said, "Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us" (Hebrews 12:1). It is so much more difficult for us to carry the cross when our back is already bent with the burdens of bad behavior.<br><br><i>Second,</i>the cross is something we cannot shoulder and then stand still with. Of the Savior we read the following: "And he bearing his cross went forth" (John 19:17). The cross is easier to carry<i>if we keep moving.</i>Action and service, happily, require enough of our attention that the sagging of self-pity can be avoided.<br><br><i>Third,</i>we must realize, finally, that we can only contemplate the cross just so long; rhetoric will not raise it. It must soon either be taken up or turned away from!<br><br><i>Fourth,</i>no "natural" resource is more precious and to be used more wisely than time. These mortal moments matter more than we know. There are no idle hours; there are only idle people. In true righteousness there is serenity, but there is an array of reminders that the "sacred present" is packed with possibilities which are slipping by us, which are going away from us each moment.<br><br>I have chosen to speak on this topic tonight because of my immense, deep, and high regard for your generation of youth and young adults in the Church. More than you know, and no doubt more than the rest of us know, you have been fashioned for a time in which the Church will be asked to do things we have never done before or done so well. The time you have to prepare yourselves for what will come is shortening with each passing second and moment. I, for one, have such great confidence in you collectively that I find no difficulty at all in believing the utterances of the prophets in this dispensation who have told us (from the beginning of the dispensation) that some of the most choice and special spirits of our Father in heaven will have been reserved for the very last days. If one, therefore, takes that kind of pride in you and has that kind of perspective about you, perhaps he can be pardoned for speaking to you, as I have, about the challenge of lifting and carrying the cross.<br><br>Each of us comes to know his cross quite well. We know its configurations; we know its weight. We feel its rough edges. It would be so much easier for us to carry it if we could develop the faith which would permit us to cast our cares upon our Father in heaven, because he cares for us, as Peter reminds us. It would be so much easier to carry if we could do as Paul suggests and rid ourselves of the weights that we need not carry. We may think these are a part of carrying the cross when, in fact, they are a function of our own stupidity or our own sin. We can rid ourselves of these so that we may take up the cross and move swiftly and deliberately on to our journey.<br><h2><b>The Role of Youth in This Dispensation</b></h2><br>At the risk of some repetition for some here, as I close, I should like to suggest to you three different ways of feeling your place in the scheme of things, of sensing your place in this dispensation. Each of the examples I use comes out of an entirely different setting, but I share them with you because each contains an important reality of what lies ahead of you and, in fact, is now upon you, as a generation.<br><br>The first comes out of U.S. Marine history. On one of those rare occasions when the U.S. Marines had been driven back and were surrounded, the general commanding that particular unit, instead of sending off a despairing and discouraging communique to the commandant of the corps, sent this interesting message: "At last we have the enemy just where we want him. We are surrounded and we can fire in every direction!" I say to you, at last The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has the world just where we want it--we can serve in every direction! Not only these young men and women present who are now in the Language Training Mission, but each of us. There is always more to be done than we have time to do it in. Rejoice, for though we may seem to be encircled, in fact we are not.<br><br>For my second analogy I turn to the prophet Elisha and that episode when a young man (I expect about the age of the young men and women here tonight) awoke one morning and saw that Israel was surrounded by a hostile force. The mountains were compassed about with horses and chariots. In his honest anxiety, the young man went to the prophet and said: "Master, how shall we do?" And Elisha, the matured spiritual leader, said, hoping to comfort the young man: "They that be with us are more than they that be with them." But somehow it was not enough, and the prophet so sensed. The scriptures record that he prayed for the young man and asked that the Lord open his eyes that he, too, might see. The prayer was granted. The scriptures, in words like this, record: "And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire" (2 Kings 6:15–17). We, too, must have our eyes opened. We must have that perspective which permits us to see that, in fact, insofar as the kingdom of God is concerned, "they that be with us are more than they that be with them." There will be times when it will not be clear to us, but we will be supported by the equivalent of "horses and chariots of fire." Your task is to have your eyes opened.<br><br>Third and last, in Shakespeare's<i>Henry V</i>are those marvelous lines when the small force face a battle on the morrow. Their leader tried to give them a sense of their place in history by saying to them:<br><br><i>He that outlives this day, and comes safe home, Will stand a tip-toe when this day is nam'd . . .</i><br><i>And gentlemen in England now abed</i><br><i>Shall count themselves accurs'd they were not here,</i><br><i>And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks</i><br><i>That fought with us upon St. Crispin's day.</i><br>[<i>Henry V,</i>4.3.41–42, 64–67]<br><br>If we come safely home spiritually, you, in particular, as a generation of young adults, can stand a tip-toe when this part of this dispensation is named, and others will be envious of the special privileges and opportunities which were yours!<br><br>Now, these have been my feeble attempts to give you perspective. I have spoken frankly to you about the need to have realistic expectations about the purpose of life, so that when stress comes you will not be taken by surprise or by deepening despondency.<br><br>I witness to you that this is the work of our Father in heaven. There is none other! There are many marvelous men and women around this globe who are kept from the truth only because they know not where to find it, but nowhere is there a force of human beings so organized, so authorized, so trained to do what you have been trained to do. Therefore, much of the weight of glory rests upon you prospectively. Therefore, as your friend, as one who has high hopes for what you are clearly capacitated to do, I leave those hopes with you. I am one who sees you, collectively, measuring up to your great mortal moments, a few of which I have attempted to lay before you tonight.<br><br>May God bless you to that end. We are prophet-led, and the tempo of that prophet, if we needed any other indication, is so urgent, so selfless, that it is crystal clear that the majestic momentum of the Church in our time will thrust you to your places on the stage even before you feel ready. God grant, however, that you may be ready and that all of us may be ready, is my tender prayer, which I leave in the name of him whose church this is, Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Neal A.

<h1>now If Revelation Is from the Lord - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It's a great honor and a privilege to greet you here this morning in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. I look upon this University as being the Lord's university. I understand some don't, but I believe we should because it's due to him that this University is here. I don't believe it would be here if it weren't for the Lord, and I'm very sure that everything we do in this life, you and I, that is really worthwhile comes through the Lord.<br><br>We are Christians. We'd like the whole world to know that. Sometimes we're accused of not being Christians. Many times it's not because we don't act like Christians, but it's because people have preconceived ideas of what Christians are.<br><br>I have a message that I would like to deliver to you this morning that concerns a problem I face frequently as I have visitors in my office--good people who want to do something worthwhile in the kingdom of God. They are anxious about their own salvation and they want to serve the Lord. They have fasted and prayed. They have received revelation, and they want to know if the revelation they have received is from God. They remind me of a missionary one time who came to me and said he didn't think his call had come from the Lord. I said, "Well, do you have a piece of paper signed by the prophet of God?"<br><br>And he said, "Yes."<br><br>I asked him if he thought he could get a more direct call than to have the prophet sign the call. He said, "Yeah, I guess I could. The Lord could speak to me directly if he wanted to."<br><br>I said, "Yes, that's true, but if he did that, do you know what we would have to call<i>you</i>?"<br><br>He thought a moment and said, "A prophet."<br><br>I said, "That's right. Don't you think that would be a little ridiculous?"<br><br>He allowed that it would. He went on his mission. He had wanted to be reassured that his call came from the Lord. I think we all want to be assured that what we receive as we pray to the Lord<i>is</i>from the Lord, because everything we receive is not from the Lord--that's for sure.<br><h2><b>Appropriateness to Church Callings</b></h2><br>To illustrate this, I'd like to tell you of an experience I had just recently. I received a telephone call from a brother we'll call John. He wanted an audience, and so I asked him why. He said, "Because the Spirit has told me to come and talk to Elder Rector."<br><br>"Oh," I said, "what about?"<br><br>He said he couldn't tell me, but he wanted to bring someone to see me.<br><br>I said, "Have you talked to your priesthood leader?"<br><br>"No, the Spirit told me to talk to Elder Rector." With some misgivings, I agreed that he could come and see me.<br><br>He came in, and he brought his friend with him. We'll call his friend Bill. It seemed that Bill had driven up to John's filling station, and when he had gotten out of the car, John immediately saw Bill's spirit. He said it was a noble and great spirit, bright and shining like Abraham. (I'm not sure how he knew what Abraham's spirit looked like.) Immediately John began to tell Bill what a great and noble spirit he was, and that he had a great work to do in the kingdom of God. Then he asked Bill what he was doing in the Church. It turned out that Bill had been a convert some years ago, but he was having a bit of a problem with his testimony: he wasn't living the Word of Wisdom, he wasn't paying his tithing, and he wasn't doing very much of anything in the Church. Then John immediately called Bill to repentance and told him that he was supposed to be a great leader in the kingdom of God, even a bishop and a stake president, and I'm not sure what else he promised him. But it was very exciting to Bill, and he got all worked up about it. But since John couldn't go beyond what he had told Bill and he definitely felt he should, he had prayed about it and the Spirit had told him to come and see Elder Rector! Now he said, "Why did the Spirit tell me this about Bill?"<br><br>I said, "Well, I'm not really sure that the Spirit did tell you that. To begin with, are you his bishop?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"Are you his quorum president?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"Are you a priesthood leader at all with respect to Bill?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"Are you his home teacher?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"Are you his patriarch?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"Then I seriously question that you had any right to tell him the things that you told him."<br><br>This kind of situation develops many times because people want to do something good in the kingdom of God, but they don't recognize the fact that you must act within the bounds the Lord has established. The Lord makes it very plain in section 42 of the Doctrine and Covenants, where he says, "Again, I say unto you, that it shall not be given to any one to go forth and to preach my gospel, or to build up my church, except he be ordained by some one who has authority, and it is known to the church that he has authority and has been regularly ordained by the heads of the church" (D&amp;amp;C 42:11). You don't just decide that you're going to go out and do something great in the kingdom without being called and ordained and set apart to do it. If we'll follow this guideline, we will stay out of very serious trouble. This applies to everyone who is a member of the Church.<br><br>While serving as a mission president, I came home once to general conference. It's always very dangerous for a mission president to leave his mission--I don't recommend that. While I was away, four of my missionaries had decided that a sister was too good for her husband, and they had counseled her to divorce him and leave him. That's right. A missionary, you see, is called to preach the gospel by the Spirit, and he has great responsibility with respect to<i>nonmembers</i>. But when it comes to<i>membership</i>in the Church, we have branch presidents and bishops who are called, ordained, and set apart by the Lord to give this kind of direction and guidance. I would even be concerned about a bishop who would counsel a wife to leave her husband. I transferred those missionaries, got them as far from this situation as I could as quickly as I could. Then it took a month before I was able to get the husband and wife back together again! It worked out all right. They are still corresponding with me even now, so I think it's going to work out pretty well. But when we get out of our areas of assignment, we get into trouble. It makes no difference who you are.<br><br>In the early days of the Church, Hirum Page had a stone through which he was receiving "revelation," and he caused great unrest in the Church because many of the leading Brethren of the Church believed his revelation. He didn't realize that he hadn't been called to receive those revelations. In section 28 of the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord gave a revelation through the Prophet Joseph Smith, outlining the way in which we are to follow the priesthood leaders. He told Oliver Cowdery here:<br><br><i>And again, thou shalt take thy brother, Hirum Page, between him and thee alone, and tell him that those things which he hath written from that stone are not of me, and that Satan deceiveth him;</i><br><br><i>For behold, these things have not been appointed unto him, neither shall anything be appointed unto any of this church contrary to the church covenants.</i><br><br><i>For all things must be done in order, and by common consent in the church, by the prayer of faith.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 28:11–13]<br><br>Here we have a guide as to what we're supposed to do and how we're supposed to do it.<br><br>I don't think this is the only guide. There are other things that we have to keep in mind as we go forth to serve in the kingdom. But let me hasten to say I don't believe that my visitor John was malicious in what he was trying to do. I think he was deceived. When we got that understood, Bill was angry. He said, "Well, what about me?"<br><br>I said, "Well, all you have to do is repent and keep the commandments, and you'll be all right. I'm not going to say you won't be a bishop or a stake president, but we'll let the Lord decide that! We do not decide in areas where we do not have authority to act."<br><br>One of the guidelines would be this: Is it within the bounds and limitations of your calling and does it require a service consistent with your calling? Be sure that it does before you start to act. Once again, I know I could get in trouble here because we believe that we ought to act on our own accord. There's a revelation which says that "men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness; For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves" (D&amp;amp;C 58:27–28). But that does not mean you get outside of the bounds of your calling. There is plenty to do within the realm of your own assignment.<br><br>Many times we think our calling is so small and insignificant that obviously the bishop doesn't recognize our potential, or he wouldn't give us this little ignominious task to perform. I had missionaries who felt that way sometimes. I transferred a missionary one time from Jacksonville, Florida, where there were 750,000 people (which he felt was commensurate with his ability) to the little town of Bristol, Florida, where there were 4,227 people, as I recall. He wrote me a letter and said, "President, is this inspiration or desperation?" He didn't feel that this was revelation from the Lord.<br><br>I learned a verse that I think depicts the attitude we have to have if we're going to be effective and successful in carrying out the work the Lord has given us--no matter how small or insignificant the calling may seem:<br><br><i>"Where shall I serve today?" I said,</i><br><i>And my love flowed warm and free.</i><br><i>Then he pointed me out a little spot</i><br><i>And said, "There, tend that for me."</i><br><br><i>I said, "Oh no, not that,</i><br><i>Not that little place.</i><br><i>Why, no one would ever see--</i><br><i>No matter how well my work was done--</i><br><br><i>Not that little spot for me."</i><br><i>The words he spoke--they were not stern.</i><br><i>He answered me tenderly,</i><br><i>"Little one, search that heart of thine,</i><br><i>Art thou serving them or me?</i><br><i>Nazareth was just a little spot</i><br><i>And so was Galilee."</i><br><br>You see, there are no small spots in the kingdom of God. To be called as a home teacher and be made responsible for the spiritual and physical well-being of a family, which is the basic unit of exaltation--there's nothing more important than a family to the Lord--could that be a small calling, do you think? I tell you, it isn't. It is so important that we accept calls as they come to us and put our hearts in them, that we operate and act within the bounds the Lord has set.<br><h2><b>Consistency with Revealed Truth</b></h2><br>Second, it is also important to know if the answer we have received is consistent with the revealed word of God. That would mean we ought to know something about the scriptures, and we ought to be familiar with the handbooks of instruction which have been prepared to give us guidance and direction.<br><br>I came through Denver some years ago, and a stake president asked me if I would interview a man whom he had placed under some sanctions. It seems that this brother would attend fast and testimony meeting, and as soon as testimony time came he would arise and take the entire period, every Sunday. No one else could say a word. He consistently preached what he called his four basic "doctrines." (I call them ideas.) First, he said, divorce is not approved of God; therefore the Lord does not recognize divorce. Second, he said, meat should not be eaten--not at all, none! Third, he said, polygamy was not ordained of God. Fourth, he said it was an angel of the devil, not an angel of the Lord, who told Nephi to slay Laban. They could not deter him. He believed the gospel, yes, and he requested a temple recommend, but they couldn't issue the temple recommend because he had problems with his basic beliefs. They had forbidden him to speak in testimony meeting, but he did the same thing in priesthood meeting. As soon as a question came up, he immediately jumped up and took the whole time, preaching these doctrines. So they were having membership attendance problems at all the meetings where he was present.<br><br>Since he had had sanctions placed upon him, he felt his rights had been violated and he was appealing to the President of the Church. When I came through they asked me if would interview him. I did. It was a most interesting interview. He had much scripture to back up these particular points. I said, "Where did you get these ideas?"<br><br>He said, "The Holy Ghost gave them to me."<br><br>I said, "How did he give them to you?"<br><br>He said, "Well, he came to me, and I talked with him."<br><br>I said, "Did you see him?"<br><br>He said, "Yes."<br><br>I said, "What did he look like?"<br><br>He said, "He looked like lightning."<br><br>I said, "He looked like lightning? Was it sheet lightning, or snake lightning?" That made him a little angry. I tried to kid him a little bit because I couldn't believe he was really serious about this!<br><br>He said, "He looked like lightning."<br><br>I asked, "Was this in the daytime or nighttime?"<br><br>He said, "The nighttime."<br><br>I said, "Were there any thunderstorms in the area?" Once again, he didn't appreciate my implication. I could see he was serious about what he was talking about. He went through the scriptures to educate me that these were true doctrines and that the Holy Ghost had called him on a mission to preach these four things. I said, "Well, have you ever had any other experiences like this?"<br><br>He said, "Yes, when they dedicated the chapel here (the stake center), I saw the Father and the Son and my grandfather standing above the pulpit."<br><br>I said, "Well now, your grandfather was in some pretty high-class company, wasn't he?"<br><br>"Yes, he was, as a matter of fact."<br><br>Well, this man had good reasons for all of his beliefs. When he started to tell me about divorce I was impressed to ask him, "Have you ever been divorced?"<br><br>And he said yes, he had, and it was wrong. He knew it was wrong; therefore it was not ordained of the Lord.<br><br>"What about eating meat?" I said. "The revelation says that it should be sparingly."<br><br>He said, "That's right, but if you'd ever eaten any meat, and then you didn't eat any meat for five years, that would be sparingly. Then if you didn't eat it for another five years, that's even more sparingly. If you never ate it for the rest of your life, that would still be sparingly. So, if you've ever had a bit of meat, from then on you shouldn't eat meat at all."<br><br>When he came to polygamy, I said, "Well, we don't practice that, you know. It's not authorized at the moment, so you don't have to worry about that." But he was sure it never had been authorized.<br><br>His fourth point, the idea that an angel of the devil had told Nephi to slay Laban, came from the fact that the Lord had said, "Thou shalt not kill." There was nothing that could be done to deter this man. No way could we do it. So I told him, "You follow your priesthood leader." He wrote then to the President of the Church, who had me write a letter to this brother and tell him in writing essentially what I'd already told him in person. Subsequently he wound up excommunicated from the Church. The problem was that what he was teaching was not consistent with the word of God, even though he could find scriptures that seemed to substantiate it. It is very important that what we teach be consistent. We need to study the scriptures, know what the Lord has said, and know that no scripture is of any private interpretation. We should get and follow the revealed word of the living prophet of God. That is scripture to us.<br><h2><b>Personal Worthiness</b></h2><br>Number three: Is the receiver of the communication a fit receptacle? Is he in condition to receive such communication from God? That's very important. If you're going to get revelations, then you'd better be in condition to get them. There are some interesting scriptures on this. Section 50 of the Doctrine and Covenants, which of course deals largely with determining whether or not a revelation comes from the Lord, indicates, "No man is possessor of all things except he be purified and cleansed from all sin" (D&amp;amp;C 50:28).<br><br>Mormon told us the story of the great destruction that took place on this continent at the crucifixion of the Master. Mormon was a great preacher, but like other great preachers, he sometimes got led away from his subject, and he had to be brought back to it. He started out to tell us about the destruction on this continent; he said, "And now it came to pass that according to our record, and we know our record to be true, for behold, it was a just man who did keep the record." Then he threw in this little-off-the-cuff comment, just as kind of an aside thought-- "For he truly did many miracles in the name of Jesus; and there was not any man who could do a miracle in the name of Jesus save he were cleansed every whit from his iniquity" (3 Nephi 8:1). The qualification has to do with being cleansed every whit of our iniquity if we're going to receive revelation from the Lord. Hooray for repentance! I presume if there were no repentance there would be no revelation received. But we can repent, and if we need to repent we should get about it. It's very important that we follow this particular principle.<br><br>I was serving some time ago as an area supervisor of the German-speaking missions. My area also included Italy, which had just been recently opened for the preaching of the gospel, and many were coming into the Church. We find that where the gospel begins to roll forth, all kinds of spurious communications also begin to roll forth. We lost our mission president there, so I was sent there for three months to be the mission president. I had a chance to visit almost all the branches in Italy. Down in southern Italy, after I finished speaking on tithing because that seemed to be a problem over there, as it is everywhere, a man came forward and said that he was receiving revelation from the Lord. "Oh," I said, "what kind of revelation are you receiving?" He said he got it in a code, and he had found the key to the code on a piece of paper under a rock. He sat in his living room and these numbers came to him. He wrote them down; then he went to his key and translated and thought. In this way he received revelation from the Lord.<br><br>Well, he was speaking Italian, of course, and I couldn't understand Italian, so one of the elders took down all the revelations, translated them, and put them on a tape so I'd know what kinds of revelations he was receiving. It was very interesting. It sounded very much like the Pearl of Great Price, only it went much beyond the Pearl of Great Price. In the "revelations" he had received, three things came out that he particularly was going to do. He was going to lead the lost Ten Tribes out of the north country. Second, he was going to bring forth the sealed portion of the Book of Mormon. Third, he was going to be one of the two prophets to withstand the forces of Gog and Magog in Jerusalem in the last days. I said, "You are really going to be busy!"<br><br>"Well," he said, "if it's not of the Lord, where does it come from?"<br><br>"Well--may I interview you?"<br><br>He said, "Yes, I am willing."<br><br>I asked, "Are you morally clean?"<br><br>He said, "Yes."<br><br>I said, "I mean, have you ever had relations with a woman other than your wife since you joined this Church?"<br><br>He said, "Oh, yes."<br><br>"When was the last time?"<br><br>"Well, it was two months ago."<br><br>"Do you pay your tithing?"<br><br>"No." We didn't have to go much beyond that.<br><br>I said, "You may rest assured this is not of the Lord. The Lord does not operate from this kind of polluted stream."<br><br>It is important that we be in condition if we are going to get revelation from the Lord. You may rest assured that if you are not in condition you will not get it. However, if you are not worthy but you fast and pray and work at it, you'll get communication, because Old Scratch is great at giving it, and he loves to give it. He gives it all the time, but it's important that we know from whence it came. When we know that, it gives us some way to handle it.<br><h2><b>Edification and Rejoicing</b></h2><br>Number four: Does the communication edify and cause you to rejoice? Generally speaking, when it comes from the Lord you'll feel good about it. We'll say that it speaks peace to your heart. But if it's mixed up and confused, then you should seriously question that it came from the Lord. In other words, the Holy Ghost does not look like lightning. I told the brother who thought he did that Nephi had seen the Holy Ghost, and he recorded that the Holy Ghost was in the form of a man. But this man insisted that he looked like lightning. You should question the source of that revelation just because it wasn't clear and concise. It wasn't vivid to the understanding; it left a cloud and a haze. Section 50 of the Doctrine and Covenants seems to indicate exactly what's expected: "Wherefore, it shall come to pass, that if you behold a spirit manifested that you cannot understand, and you receive not that spirit, ye shall ask of the Father in the name of Jesus; and if he give not unto you that spirit, then you may know that it is not of God" (D&amp;amp;C 50:31). The Lord will interpret it to you.<br><br>Prayer is very important; in fact, it's absolutely vital. "If ye are purified and cleansed from all sin, ye shall ask whatsoever you will in the name of Jesus and it shall be done. But know this, it shall be given you what you shall ask" (D&amp;amp;C 50:29–30). The Lord will help you, even in your prayer, to find out if it is from him. He'll tell you what to ask, and if you ask, harmonizing your will with the will of the Lord (which, by the way, is the way we get our prayers answered anyway), if you ask the Lord for the things that are the Lord's will, I guarantee he'll answer every one of them in the affirmative. If you ask the Lord for something that is not his will, then it will be very difficult to bring it to pass.<br><h2><b>Peace or Confusion</b></h2><br>Number five: Does it cause your bosom to burn or speak peace unto your soul? Or are you left troubled by the communication? All too often we go to the Lord to see if we can get an answer for something we want to do. I've had young people come to me and say, "Look, Elder Rector, I know you said that we're supposed to get a witness from the Spirit, have a testimony about the girl that we marry, just as we have a testimony that the gospel is true." I believe that we<i>can</i>have that kind of a witness.<br><br>Two young returned missionaries came to me one time and said that they'd both prayed, and they'd both gotten the same answer--they were supposed to marry the same girl! I said, "I want to see the girl!" And so that beautiful little girl came into my office; it was very obvious to me how they got that answer. I asked her how she felt about the two elders.<br><br>She said, "I don't want anything to do with either one of them!"<br><br>You see, it's a two-way street. Both of you need to get that kind of communication, and it's very important that you both get it, that you are united on it, that it is clear, and that you know by the Spirit, by the peace, by the burning (if you want to call it that), the convincing influence that it is of the Lord. Then you go get married in the temple.<br><h2><b>Clarity or Stupor of Thought</b></h2><br>I've known young people who would fall on their knees and say, "Lord, help me. Show me what to do with my life." I don't believe the Lord answers those kinds of prayers. No, you have to work it out in your own mind. I think it's best if you take alternatives before the Lord. Perhaps you could say, "Now, father, I'm not sure what I should do. Perhaps I could talk over a couple of possible courses of action with thee. If I did this, probably this and this (list the possibiliites) would be the result. On the other hand, if I do this (something to the opposite), perhaps this and this would be the result! Now, I'm not sure which it is I should do, whether I should do the first and then this and then--." All of a sudden your second alternative just fades away and it's gone. Or, as the Lord says, you have a stupor of thought and you forget the thing that you have asked him. But all of a sudden the first thought becomes very bright and very clear to your understanding. I'd recommend you go in the direction of that which has become bright and clear as you've prepared yourself to receive such an answer from the Lord.<br><br>Of course, I guess there are no set ways to get your prayers answered. The Prophet Joseph couldn't get all of his prayers answered. I suppose that you won't get all of yours answered, either. But if you'll be in condition (and condition comes through obedience--it doesn't come any other way), and go to the Lord with prayer, with fasting, you'll get everything you need answered. Whatever will be for your good and benefit you shall receive, because the Lord loves his children. He loves all of his children. I think he loves them all equally. There's some question about that. I have a friend who seems to think the Lord loves only Latter-day Saints. Others think he loves Latter-day Saints more than he does Baptists and Methodists. I don't believe that. I think the Lord loves all his children. He says he's no respecter of persons. I think he loves Baptists and Methodists and Catholics. . . . I know he loves Catholics: we baptize thirty-five thousand of them every year! He must love them! In fact, he even loves Jehovah's Witnesses--it's hard, but he does it. He loves all his children, and he wants to bless them. He wants to give them revelation--yes, I mean that, revelation--and he will do it. He will give it to anyone who will prepare himself to receive it. You have to have revelation before you can join this Church, and you certainly have to have revelation before you can bear witness that it is the Lord's true church. He'll give that revelation to every one of us. He delights to do it.<br><br>Just by way of review, here is how to know if an idea is from God: One, is it within the bounds and limitations of your calling, and does it require a service consistent with your calling? Two, is it consistent with the revealed word of God? The scriptures<i>and</i>the directions of the living prophet of God today--those are the revealed words of God. Three, is the receiver of the communication a fit receptacle? Is he in condition to receive such a communication from the Lord? Four, does the communication edify and cause you to rejoice? Five, does it cause your bosom to burn or speak peace to your soul, or are you left troubled by the communication? Six, is the communication vivid to the understanding, or does it leave a cloud or a hazy impression?<br><br>Getting your prayers answered is hard work. As Longfellow said:<br><br><i>The heights by great men reached and kept,</i><br><i>Were not attained by sudden flight,</i><br><i>But they, while their companions slept,</i><br><i>Were toiling upward in the night.</i><br><br>As representatives of the Lord, and you from this University represent him wherever you go, it is important that you have witness as to your work and as to what the Lord would have you do on specific occasions. I promise you can get that kind of witness if you seek it and if you stay in condition to receive it.<br><br>I bear you my witness that I know that God, our Heavenly Father, lives, that he loves us, every one, that he hears and answers prayers, for he has heard and answered mine. I bear witness to you that Jesus is the Christ, that he lives, that he has paid the price for our sins, and that if we need to repent, we can do it. We can repent of anything, except murder, shedding innocent blood--the Lord doesn't allow that in this dispensation--but anything else you can repent of because he died for our sins. I bear witness that we have a living prophet of God on earth today who gives directions to the Church and who receives revelation from the Lord, for he acts under the direction of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, whose church this really is. I leave you this witness in all soberness and leave my love and my blessing and my most fond affections to you Latter-day Saints, upon whom so much depends. May the Lord bless you to get on speaking terms with him, and I wish you a most obedient new year, in Jesus' name. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Hartman Rector, Jr., was a member of the First Council of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 6 January 1976.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>of the Press in Our Bicentennial Year - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I appreciate this opportunity to address the student body at this great institution during the first month of this Bicentennial year.<br><br>I have given much prayerful consideration as to what I might say here, so as to not waste your time. I have decided to depart somewhat from the kind of talk that might be expected, to deal with something that is connected with both morals and religion, but is not necessarily a religious talk as some might interpret it. More than anything, it is a sort of contribution to the Bicentennial. The Church has asked each of us to make what contribution we could during the Bicentennial year, and perhaps this is mine.<br><br>Since this great nation has come two hundred years, I would like to discuss one of its institutions which has played a major role in bringing us this far and which must play a major role in the future and destiny of this country. That institution is the press, and the issue is the so-called freedom of the press. Because of time limitations, the treatment here, of course, will have to be broad brush. But there are certain things everyone needs to be aware of.<br><br>May I quote now from the First Amendment:<br><br><i>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.</i><br><br>In the First Amendment, we have guarantees covering both the freedom of religion and the freedom of the press.<br><br>Since the founding of this country, it is easy to see the tremendous role freedom of the press has played in the building of this republic. I happen to believe, however, that freedom of the press is probably in greater danger today than at almost any other time in the history of this country. And that brings me great concern for two reasons. First, because I believe, generally speaking, that freedom of the press is inseparably connected with freedom of religion. And when the one suffers, the other almost inevitably will suffer. Secondly, the Lord has said enough to demonstrate to us that the Constitution and its safeguards concerning liberty are inspired and should be upheld.<br><br>I should add that I approach this subject as a friend of the court. At least part of my academic and professional experience has been in journalism. I have been a weekly newspaper editor. I am a former member of the Utah State Press Association and of the New England Press Association and a former member of the professional journalism society Sigma Delta Chi. I have been involved intimately with the press in both Boston and New York City.<br><br>Under no stretch of the imagination do I want the press to fail. In fact, I believe that it continues to be one of the keys to the future success of our republic. It was Jefferson who said, "Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without government, I should not hesitate to prefer the latter."<br><h2><b>Current Criticisms of the Media</b></h2><br>I think the major threat to the press--and when I say<i>press</i>, I mean the printed and electronic media--comes from within. In the last few months, there have been an increasing number of responsible journalists who have indulged in soul-searching on behalf of their profession and have otherwise come to the conclusion that the press is enjoying a relatively bad press.<br><br>It appears that Watergate has brought this into clear focus. In fact, future historians may look back on the Watergate period as the time in the history of the United States when the press as an institution emerged as all-powerful but without enough internal moral restraints to keep it from becoming a matter of concern to almost everyone--and perhaps, to some extent, even conjure up fear in the minds of the citizens of the country. Who today would be willing to be the object of so-called investigative journalism? Some of it, true, has been good journalism and has made a healthy contribution. Some, however, would have been termed yellow journalism only a few years ago and, therefore, discredited by the profession.<br><br>The most disturbing part of these developments is that there is now in the Congress of the United States and in various states a rash of bills that, in effect, tend to strike at the freedom of the press. This seems to be a reflex action from a public who simply does not like what the media is doing with its power.<br><br>The media, on the other hand, have resisted all outside influences on the basis of the First Amendment. What the press has not been able to understand, however, is that freedom of the press is a prerogative given to the media by the people. And it is conceivable that the people can also take it away if they feel that it is not performing its function. Heaven help us if that day comes, because it would lead to the degeneration of many other freedoms.<br><br>Yet, it appears that the press must accept the reality that freedom of the press is a privilege more than a right, and if they themselves can't administer this great principle with morality and fairness, they will force others to do it for them and thereby cause the people to take back elements of the First Amendment.<br><br>Let us look at what some journalists have been saying in recent months. In his column dated May 8, 1974, Roscoe Drummond led off with these statements:<br><br><i>Politicians are in trouble with voters and they know it.</i><br><br><i>Union leaders are in trouble with public opinion and they know it.</i><br><br><i>Corporate executives are in trouble with consumers and they know it.</i><br><br><i>The media are in trouble with their viewers and readers and don't seem to know it.</i><br><br><i>They illegally publish leaks from grand jury proceedings, thereby, condemning a person before he is accused. They unethically publish leaks from prosecution assistants who want to try their case in the press before they take it to court. They demand a total constitutional shield for the privacy of their sources, even when the shield conflicts with the equal constitutional right of a fair trial. They assert the unlimited right to publish anything, true or false, critical of anybody, but often do not concede even a limited right of reply.</i><br><br>And then Drummond goes on to say:<br><br><i>There is a pervasive criticism and hostility toward the press which go beyond anything I have observed in many years in the profession. It embraces far more dissatisfaction and distrust than Adlai Stevenson's pained complaint about the unfairness of the one-party press in the 1952 campaign.</i><br><br>The Drummond column then goes on to discuss the whole area of the right of a citizen to reply to something that has been directed at him through the public media. He says:<br><br>The public deserves fuller access to the media, and the media, whatever their legal rights, have a moral duty to respect voluntarily the moral right of reply. If the media do not voluntarily concede this right more equitably in practice, then they will almost certainly bring down their own house.<br><br>On July 2, 1975, Drummond said the following in his column:<br><br><i>When so much of the press and the electronic media talk so earnestly, and I think validly, about the "people's right to know," why do they so often refuse to honor the people's right to know the source of major, controversial news? How can readers and listeners judge the credibility of such news when its sources are covered up?</i><br><br>He then went on to point out that one newspaper had decided to print nothing from a government official unless it was free to identify the source. However, the same newspaper stated that it was quite willing and eager to print statements critical, even hostile to the government with unattributed sources. In other words, readers would be allowed to know the source of news favorable to a government official, but not allowed to know the source of news unfavorable to a government official.<br><br>Drummond, in the final part of his column, did make this observation:<br><br><i>The press is beginning some self-examination and correction. Charles B. Seib is permitted to analyze the</i>Post's<i>shortcomings in the</i>[Washington] Post<i>--and he's pretty terrific. He exposed both the unfair handling of the bombing and the Wallace stories. [These were two stories that Drummond discussed in his column.] He is the reader's representative. Some other newspapers have Ombudsmen like him.</i><br><br><i>Mr. Seib finds the press too secretive, too self-righteous, too defensive.</i><br><br><i>We can't get along without a free press, but more readers feel, I suspect, that the press could accept some self reforms which would make it easier to get along with it.</i><br><br>Charles Seib in a<i>Washington Post</i>column discusses the National News Council, which is an organization set up by the news media to help police themselves. He states quite frankly, "As the Council approaches the end of the three-year trial period, its future hangs on whether it plays, or appears likely to play, a meaningful role in American journalism. Today the answer would have to be no." Seib goes on to show that the council has really not dealt with substantive issues, nor has it received the support of the media itself. Speaking of the council, he says, "Perhaps the whole idea is wrong. It may be that it isn't possible to monitor the national press in a country as big as this one and with as wide an array of news media. Ombudsmen on individual newspapers, or local or regional news councils, may be a better answer."<br><h2><b>The Power of the Press</b></h2><br>Seib, in a column appearing in December of this last year in the<i>Washington Post</i>, gives some insight as to where the power of the press is concentrated in the United States and what it takes to break a major story. He discusses the story about President Kennedy and the woman with so-called Mafia connections. The story surfaced on November 16 on page A6 of the<i>Washington Post</i>, but it took a month to be recognized as a full-blown news story. Without going into details, Seib tells why it took so long in the following terms:<br><br><i>That can be blamed in large part on the power of the Washington-New York news axis; meaning the</i>New York Times<i>, the</i>Washington Post<i>, the television networks, and the news magazines. A national news story, particularly one concerning official Washington, does not achieve full status until it gets recognized on this axis.</i><br><br><i>If the</i>Post<i>had hit the story hard on page 1 of November 16, it would have taken off at once. Or if the</i>Times<i>, or one of the networks, or</i>Time<i>or</i>Newsweek<i>had picked up on the lead the</i>Post<i>story provided, it would have been off to the races.</i><br><br><i>The Scripts-Howard story, hard-hitting and startling though it was, couldn't do the trick. It took the Safire column and the front-page</i>Times<i>story that followed. All-in-all, this doesn't add up to one of the proudest moments of American journalism. But then they all can't be Watergates. And disclosure is better than festering rumor.</i><br><br>Another insight comes from John Osborne, who was the<i>New Republic's</i>"Nixon watcher." He said the press performed a "necessary and proper function" in getting out the basic facts of Watergate. "But," he added, noting (no doubt) the journalistic competition which prevails in Washington, "I have to say at the same time that they are like dogs who have scented blood and are running the fox right down to the earth."<br><br>And columnist William H. Stringer, in assessing the post-Watergate period and the news media, makes this comment:<br><br><i>It will be a time for reinvoking confidence in American institutions, including the press and TV. Mr. Nixon is perhaps not the easiest person for whom to feel compassion. But the press will play its role best if it pauses occasionally to assess what impression it is leaving in the public mind. And if it realizes that its role is not only to ferret out and expose, but also to set a tone of strict fairness and to build up rather than tear down.</i><br><br>It is a healthy sign to see columnists such as Seib and Drummond and others begin to critically look at their profession.<br><br>This kind of self-analysis is also coming from other sources. In his novel<i>Come Neneveh, Come Tyre</i>, Allan Drury creates a situation where the news media almost unwittingly help bring the near destruction of the United States. This novel is all the more interesting when one realizes that Drury was once a<i>New York Times</i>correspondent and also that his novels have a way of identifying real people and real situations in the real world.<br><h2><b>Guidelines for Improving the Media</b></h2><br>In closing, may I quote from three sources. First, from the book by Thomas Griffiths titled<i>How True: A Skeptic's Guide to Believing the News</i>. Griffiths says, "A journalist must be more seized by journalism than by any subject it deals with."<br><br>The second quote comes from Harold Grumhaus, chairman and publisher of the<i>Chicago Tribune</i>:<br><br><i>Perhaps most importantly it is the responsibility of the free press to be fair--and I prefer the word fair to objective. We are all influenced by our background and our personal interests, and we all have our own opinions and our biases. While it is impossible for any of us to be completely objective, we can always try to be fair.</i><br><br><i>Finally the one tie that binds all of the responsibilities of the press together is integrity. The motives of the press must always be the highest. Freedom of the press does not allow the luxury of placing self-interest or personal desires above that which is right ... and if we are to furnish that check on government which no constitution has ever been able to provide, we must ourselves be beyond reproach. Without integrity the press has no self-respect--and without self-respect, we have no free press.</i><br><br><i>We are well aware that if the press favors freedom over responsibility, we betray the trust placed in us by the First Amendment, and, ultimately we betray ourselves.</i><br><br>Finally, this quote from Alan Valentine: "Freedom is born of self-discipline. No individual, no nation, can achieve or maintain liberty without self-control. The undisciplined man is slave to his own weaknesses." Let me now alter that statement just slightly for the sake of our discussion. A free press is born of self-discipline. No individual, no nation, can achieve or maintain freedom of the press without self-control. The undisciplined news media is a slave to its own weaknesses.<br><br>What do I see as the answer to this dilemma? To begin with, more self-analysis by the press itself, more of a recognition of its problems, and more of a realization as to what the media can do to improve itself.<br><br>Secondly, and this may sound strange, I would urge every student here who has an inclination to go into journalism to do so. With all of its faults, it is a great profession. You can make a great contribution provided you become technically sound in your profession and provided you bring the same morals that the Church teaches you to have into the profession with you. No matter what the pressures are, or no matter what the circumstances are, don't let anything or anyone alter your standards.<br><br>Third, support good journalism with letters to the media and also by what you read and by what you listen to and watch.<br><br>Some speak of serving their country in elected positions or through law or other professions. And certainly those who go in these directions can make a great contribution. But at this particular time, at the two hundredth anniversary of our country and as we look to the future, I can think of no greater contribution to the country, to the Constitution of the United States, and to the principles that we all uphold, than for young men and women with righteous principles and moral outlooks and behavior to enter this great profession.<br><br>May I end where I began. Indeed there is a connection between freedom of the press and freedom of religion. For the sake of everything we hold dear in this country, may we keep both of these institutions free, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Loren C.

<h1> and the Spirit of the Lord - Boyd K. Packer - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am particularly appreciative of the music we've just heard, and quote from section 25 of the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 25:12]<br><br>I very anxiously lay claim to those blessings from these righteous young men and women who have sung so beautifully this sacred hymn of Zion. My gratitude to them will, I'm sure, be more obvious when I move into the message that I have chosen to speak upon tonight.<br><br>I want to respond to a question that I face with some frequency. It has many variations, but the theme is this: Why do we not have more inspired and inspiring music in the Church? Or why do we have so few great paintings or sculptures depicting the Restoration? Why is it when we need a new painting for a bureau of information, or perhaps for a temple, frequently nonmember painters receive the commission? The same questions have an application to poetry, to drama, to dance, to creative writing, to all the fine arts.<br><br>Now, I'm sure there are those who will say, "Why does he presume to talk about that? He is uninformed. He is just out of his province." It may comfort them to know that I know that. My credentials to speak do not come from being a musician, for I'm not. I am not a composer, nor a conductor, and certainly I am not a vocalist. I cannot, for example, play the piano. I would be very unwilling to do so. However, should I be pressed to it, I could, without much difficulty, prove my point. I am not adequate as an artist, nor as a sculptor, a poet, or a writer.<br><br>But then I do not intend to train you in any of those fields. My credentials, if I have any (some of them should be obvious), relate to spiritual things.<br><br>I hope for sufficient inspiration to comment on how the Spirit of the Lord influences or is influenced by the art forms that I have mentioned. Since I have been interested in these matters, I have, over the years, listened very carefully when they have been discussed by the Brethren. I have studied expressions of my Brethren and of those who have led us in times past, in order to determine how those questions should be answered.<br><br>The reason we have not yet produced a greater heritage in art and literature and music and drama is not, I am very certain, because we have not had talented people. For over the years we have had not only good ones but great ones. Some have reached great heights in their chosen fields. But few have captured the spirit of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the restoration of it in music, in art, in literature. They have not, therefore, even though they were gifted, made a lasting contribution to the onrolling of the Church and kingdom of God in the dispensation of the fulness of times. They have therefore missed doing what they might have done, and they have missed being what they might have become. I am reminded of the statement "There are many who struggle and climb and finally reach the top of the ladder, only to find that it is leaning against the wrong wall."<br><br>If you are willing to listen, I would like to express some concerns I have had over these matters and describe to you some disappointments I have heard expressed among the leaders of the Church.<br><br>Because I intend to be quite direct in my comments, I am a bit concerned. For I know when we touch this subject we talk of people who are very gifted. And people who are very gifted, it would seem, tend to be temperamental.<br><br>We were discussing some time ago the music and musicians of the Church, when one of the Twelve pointed out that it may be difficult to get instruction across because some of our musicians, among others, have a tendency to be temperamental. "Yes," observed one of the senior members of our Quorum, "More temper than mental." That, I suppose, describes all of us at one time or another.<br><br>Before I continue, I want it clearly understood that we have in the Church tens of thousands of gifted people who not only have talent, but who are generous with it. Our gifted people are greatly needed in the Church.<br><br>The work of the Lord has been moved by the members in the wards and stakes and branches who have been blessed with special gifts and who use them unselfishly. Because of what they do, we are able to feel and learn very quickly through music, through art, through poetry some spiritual things that we would otherwise learn very slowly. All of us are indebted to them for their generous service. I am humbly grateful to those who render such service in the Church. But then it is only right that they should contribute.<br><br>You who have such talents might well ask, "Whence comes this gift?" And gift it is. You may have cultivated it and developed it, but it was given to you. Most of us do not have it. You were not more deserving than we, but you are a good deal more responsible. If you use your gift properly, opportunities for service are opened that will be beneficial eternally for you and for others.<br><br>Has it ever occurred to you that you may leave this life without it? If the gift is yours because of the shape of your vocal cords, or the strength of your lungs, or because of the coordination of your hands, or because your eye registers form and color, you may leave the gift behind. You may have to be content with what you have become, because you possessed it while you were here. It has not been revealed just how this would be. I rather suspect that those gifts which we use properly will stay with us beyond the veil. And I repeat, you who are gifted may not be more deserving, but you are much more responsible than the rest of us.<br><br>Elder Orson F. Whitney said:<br><br><i>We will yet have Miltons and Shakespeares of our own. God's ammunition is not exhausted. His highest spirits are held in reserve for the latter times. In God's name and by His help we will build up a literature whose tops will touch the heaven, though its foundation may now be low on the earth.</i>[Lecture delivered at YMMIA conference, 3 June 1888, in Brian H. Stuy, comp. and ed.,<i>Collected Discourses,</i>vol. 1 (Burbank, California: B.H.S. Publishing, 1987), p. 154]<br><br>Since that statement was made in 1888, those foundations have been raised up very slowly. The greatest poems are not yet written, nor the paintings finished. The greatest hymns and anthems of the Restoration are yet to be composed. The sublimest renditions of them are yet to be conducted. We move forward much slower than need be, and I would like to underline some things that stand in our way.<br><br>You will quickly notice that I refer frequently to music. There is a reason for that. We use it more often. But the point that I shall make about the musician applies to all the arts: painting, poetry, drama, dance, and others.<br><br>For some reason it takes a constant vigilance on the part of priesthood leaders--both general and local--to ensure that music presented in our worship and devotional services is music that is appropriate for worship and devotional services. I have heard presidents of the Church declare after a general conference, or after a temple dedication, words to this effect (and I am quoting verbatim from one such experience):<br><br><i>I suppose we did not give enough attention to the music. It seems that our musicians must take such liberties. Something spiritual was lost from our meetings because the music was not what it should have been. Next time we must remember to give them more careful instructions.</i><br><br>Why is it that the president of the Church, or the president of the stake, or the bishop of the ward must be so attentive in arranging music for worship services and conference meetings? Why should the anxiety persist that, if the musicians are left to do what they want to do, the result will not invite the Spirit of the Lord?<br><br>I have in the past made not altogether successful attempts to set a mood of devotion on a very sacred subject, having been invited to the pulpit immediately after a choir or choral number that was well performed but did nothing to inspire the spirit of devotion; or after a brass ensemble has rendered music that has nothing to do with spiritual inspiration.<br><br>The selections, which for other purposes might have been admirable, even impressive, failed in their inspiration simply because they were not appropriate. For some other gathering, some other time, some other place, yes--but they did not do what the hymns of the Restoration could have done. How sad when a gifted person has no real sense of propriety!<br><br>Let me illustrate this matter of propriety. Suppose you sponsor a pep rally in the stadium with the purpose of exciting the student body to a high point of enthusiasm. Suppose you invite someone to present a musical number with the expectation that the music would contribute to your purpose. Imagine him playing a sonata on an organ in subdued tones that lulls everyone into a contemplative and reflective mood. However well composed the music, or however well performed, it would not be appropriate for the occasion.<br><br>This example, of course, is obvious. It makes me wonder, therefore, why we must be constantly alert to have appropriate music in our sacrament meetings, conference sessions, and other worship services. Music and art and dance and literature can be very appropriate in one place and in one setting and for one purpose and be very wrong in another. That can be true of instruments as well.<br><br>We have, in our instruction to the musicians of the Church, this suggestion:<br><br><i>Organs and pianos are the standard musical instruments used in sacrament meetings. Other instruments, such as orchestral strings, may be used when appropriate, but the music presented must be in keeping with the reverence and spirituality of the meeting. Brass and percussion instruments generally are not appropriate.</i>[<i>General Handbook of Instructions,</i>1976, p. 23]<br><br>We are under resistance from some highly trained musicians who insist that they can get as much inspiration from brass instruments or a guitar solo as from a choir. I believe that an organ perhaps could be played at a pep rally in a way to incite great enthusiasm. And I think a brass section could play a hymn in such a way as to be reverent and fitting in a worship service. But if it should happen, it would have to be an exception. We cannot convey a sacred message in an art form that is not appropriate and have anything spiritual happen. But there is a constant attempt to do it.<br><br>Several years ago one of the organizations of the Church produced a filmstrip. The subject matter was very serious and the script was well written. The producer provided a story board. A story board is a series of loose, almost scribbled sketches, sometimes with a little color brushed across them, to roughly illustrate each frame of the filmstrip. Very little work is invested in a story board. It is merely to give an idea and is always subject to revision.<br><br>Some members of the committee were amused by the story board itself. It had a loose, comical air about it. They decided to photograph the illustrations on the story board and use them in the filmstrip. They thought they would be quite amusing and entertaining.<br><br>When the filmstrip was reviewed by four members of the Council of the Twelve, it was rejected. It had to be made over again. Why? Because the art form used simply was not appropriate to the message. You just don't teach sacred, serious subjects with careless, scribbled illustrations.<br><br>Now, again to music. There have been a number of efforts to take sacred gospel themes and tie them to modern music in the hope of attracting our young people to the message. Few events in all of human history surpass the spiritual majesty of the First Vision. We would be ill-advised to describe that event, the visit of Elohim and Jehovah, in company with rock music, even soft rock music, or to take equally sacred themes and set them to a modern beat. I do not know how that can be done and result in increased spirituality. I think it cannot be done.<br><br>When highly trained artists insist, as they occasionally do, that they receive spiritual experience in tying a sacred gospel theme to an inappropriate art form, I must conclude that they do not know, not really, the difference between when the Spirit of the Lord is present and when it is not.<br><br>Very frequently when our musicians, particularly the more highly trained among them, are left to do what they want to do, they perform in such a way as to call attention to themselves and their ability. They do this rather than give prayerful attention to what will inspire. I do not mean "inspire" as the music or art of the world can inspire. I mean<i>inspire!</i><br><br>They are not content to use the hymns and anthems of the Restoration, for such a presentation, they feel, will not demonstrate their full capacities. When pressed to do so, they may grudgingly put a hymn on the program. But it is obvious that their heart isn't in it, for the numbers they select themselves seem to say, "Now let us show you what we really can do."<br><br>We instruct stake presidents that "preference should be given to the singing of well-known hymns" at stake conferences (1976 Stake Conference Program Schedules).<br><br>I know there are those who think that our Church music is limited. Some with professional abilities evidently soon get very tired of it. They want to stray from it and reach out into the world. They present the argument that many of the hymns in our hymnbook were not written for the Church or by members of the Church. I know that already. And some of them are not really as compelling as they might be. Their messages are not as specific as we could have if we produced our own. But by association they have taken on a meaning that reminds members of the Church, whenever they hear them, of the restoration of the gospel, of the Lord, and of His ministry.<br><br>Sometimes, to ensure that music will be appropriate, one of the hymns or anthems of the Restoration is specifically requested. "Oh, but they sang that last conference," our conductors will say. Indeed we did, and we preached the same gospel last conference also. The preaching of it over and over again gives it a familiar and a warm feeling. We build it into our lives.<br><br>As speakers we are not trying to impress the world with how talented we are as preachers. We are simply trying to get across, by repetition, if that's the only way, the sacred message that has been entrusted to us.<br><br>Those of us who lead the Church are not constantly seeking new doctrine to introduce. We simply teach over and over again that which was in the beginning. It is with great difficulty that we try to pass on to the next generation, in some form of purity, that which was given to us. We will lose it if we are not wise.<br><br>The musician may say, "Do you really want us to take those few familiar hymns and present them over and over again with no introduction of anything new?" No, that is not what I would want, but it is close.<br><br>What I would desire would be to have the hymns of the Restoration<i>characteristic</i>of our worship services, with others added if they are appropriate. There are a great many things from elsewhere that are very appropriate. Many numbers can be used in our worship services with complete propriety.<br><br>Our hymns speak the truth as far as they go. They could speak more of it if we had more of them, specifically teaching the principles of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>If I had my way there would be many new hymns with lyrics near scriptural in their power, bonded to music that would inspire people to worship. Think how much we could be helped by another inspired anthem or hymn of the Restoration. Think how we could be helped by an inspired painting on a scriptural theme or depicting our heritage. How much we could be aided by a graceful and modest dance, by a persuasive narrative, or poem, or drama. We could have the Spirit of the Lord more frequently and in almost unlimited intensity if we would.<br><br>For the most part, we do without because the conductor wants to win the acclaim of the world. He does not play to the Lord, but to other musicians. The composer and the arranger want to please the world. The painter wants to be in style. And so our resources of art and music grow ever so gradually. And we find that there have marched through this grand parade of mortality men and women who were sublimely gifted, but who spent all, or most, in the world and for the world. And I repeat that they may well one day come to learn that "many men struggle to reach the top of the ladder, only to find that it is leaning against the wrong wall."<br><br>It is a mistake to assume that one can follow the ways of the world and then somehow, in a moment of intruded inspiration, compose a great anthem of the Restoration, or in a moment of singular inspiration paint the great painting. When it is done, it will be done by one who has yearned and tried and longed fervently to do it, not by one who has condescended to do it. It will take quite as much preparation and work as any masterpiece, and a different kind of inspiration.<br><br>There is a test you might apply if you are among the gifted. Ask yourself this question: When I am free to do what I really want to do, what will it be?<br><br>If you find that you are ashamed of our humble heritage in the arts, that ought to be something of a signal to you. Often artists are not free to create what they most desire because the market demands other things of them. But what about when you are free? Do you have a desire to produce what the Church needs? Or do you desire to convince the Church that it needs to change style so the world will feel comfortable with it? Although our artistic heritage as yet is relatively small, we are losing some of what we have--through neglect!<br><br>At the recent rededication of the St. George Temple each session was closed, as is traditional in a temple dedication, with the presentation of the "Hosanna Anthem." The audience, on the signal from the conductor, joins with the choir on that part of the anthem known widely through the Church as "The Spirit of God Like a Fire Is Burning." I sat through those sessions and carefully observed, with great sorrow, that fully 80 percent of those in the audience did not know the words.<br><br>We can lose our heritage. We have lost part of it. Let me cite an example in the field of poetry.<br><br>William Ernest Henley wrote "Invictus," a proud, almost defiant expression that concludes:<br><br><i>I am the master of my fate:</i><br><i>I am the captain of my soul.</i><br>[<i>Echoes,</i>1888, No. 4, In Memoriam R. T. Hamilton Bruce (" Invictus" ), stanza 4]<br><br>Some years ago an answer to "Invictus" was given. Let me quote it to you:<br><br><i>Art thou in truth?</i><br><i>Then what of Him who bought thee with His blood?</i><br><i>Who plunged into devouring seas</i><br><i>And snatched thee from the flood?</i><br><br><i>Who bore for all our fallen race</i><br><i>What none but him could bear--</i><br><i>The God who died that man might live</i><br><i>And endless glory share.</i><br><br><i>Of what avail thy vaunted strength</i><br><i>Apart from His vast might?</i><br><i>Pray that His light may pierce the gloom</i><br><i>That thou mayest see aright.</i><br><br><i>Men are as bubbles on the wave,</i><br><i>As leaves upon the tree,</i><br><i>Thou, captain of thy soul! Forsooth,</i><br><i>Who gave that place to thee?</i><br><br><i>Free will is thine--free agency,</i><br><i>To wield for right or wrong;</i><br><i>But thou must answer unto Him</i><br><i>To whom all souls belong.</i><br><br><i>Bend to the dust that "head unbowed,"</i><br><i>Small part of life's great whole,</i><br><i>And see in Him and Him alone,</i><br><i>The captain of thy soul.</i><br>["The Soul's Captain,"<i>Improvement Era,</i>May 1926, opposite inside front cover]<br><br>And who wrote that? Orson F. Whitney of the Council of the Twelve Apostles, a gifted and inspired poet whose work is virtually unknown in the Church. Let me quote another of his poems:<br><br><i>There's a mountain named Stern Justice,</i><br><i>Tall and towering, gloomy, grand,</i><br><i>Frowning o'er a vale called Mercy,</i><br><i>Loveliest in all the land.</i><br><br><i>Great and mighty is the mountain,</i><br><i>But its snowy crags are cold,</i><br><i>And in vain the sunlight lingers</i><br><i>On the summit proud and bold.</i><br><br><i>There is warmth within the valley,</i><br><i>And I love to wander there,</i><br><i>'Mid the fountains and the flowers,</i><br><i>Breathing fragrance on the air.</i><br><br><i>Much I love the solemn mountain,</i><br><i>It doth meet my somber mood,</i><br><i>When, amid the muttering thunders,</i><br><i>O'er my soul the storm-clouds brood.</i><br><br><i>But when tears, like rain, have fallen</i><br><i>From the fountain of my woe,</i><br><i>And my soul has lost its fierceness,</i><br><i>Straight unto the vale I go;</i><br><br><i>Where the landscape, gently smiling,</i><br><i>O'er my heart pours healing balm,</i><br><i>And, as oil on troubled waters,</i><br><i>Brings from out its storm a calm.</i><br><br><i>Yes, I love both vale and mountain,</i><br><i>Ne'er from either would I part;</i><br><i>Each unto my life is needful,</i><br><i>Both are dear unto my heart.</i><br><br><i>For the smiling vale doth soften</i><br><i>All the rugged steep makes sad,</i><br><i>And from icy rocks meander</i><br><i>Rills that make the valley glad.</i><br><br>[Orson F. Whitney, "The Mountain and the Vale,"<i>The Poetical Writings of Orson F. Whitney</i>(Salt Lake City: Juvenile Instructor Office, 1889), p. 183]<br><br>Both of these poems are new to most of you. Why would that be? I think it more than a pity that work such as this remains unknown to most students and faculty--even to some of the faculty in the field of literature. It is sad when members of the faculty here would discard them in favor of assigning their students to read degenerate compositions that issue from the minds of perverted and wicked men.<br><br>There is the temptation for college teachers, in the Church and outside of it, to exercise their authority to give assignments and thereby introduce their students to degradation under the argument that it is part of our culture. Teachers in the field of literature are particularly vulnerable.<br><br>I use the word<i>warning.</i>Such will not go unnoticed in the eternal scheme of things. Those who convey a degraded heritage to the next generation will reap disappointment by and by.<br><br>Teachers would do well to learn the difference between studying some things, as compared to studying<i>about</i>them. There is a great difference.<br><br>There is much to be said for a great effort to rediscover the humble and inspired contributions of gifted Saints of the past and thereby inspire the gifted in our day to produce works that will inspire those who come after us.<br><br>It is sad but true that, almost as a rule, our most gifted members are drawn to the world. They who are most capable to preserve our cultural heritage and to extend it, because of the enticements of the world, seek rather to replace it. That is so easy to do because for the most part they do not have that intent. They think that what they do is to improve it. Unfortun-ately many of them will live to learn that indeed, "Many men struggle to climb to reach the top of the ladder, only to find that it is leaning against the wrong wall."<br><br>I mentioned earlier that the greatest hymns and anthems have not been composed, nor have the greatest illustrations been set down, nor the poems written, nor the paintings finished. When they are produced, who will produce them? Will it be the most talented and the most highly trained among us? I rather think it will not. They will be produced by those who are the most inspired among us. Inspiration can come to those whose talents are barely adequate, and their contribution will be felt for generations; and the Church and kingdom of God will move forward just a little more easily because they have been here.<br><br>Some of our most gifted people struggle to produce a work of art, hoping that it will be described by the world as masterpiece! monumental! epic! when in truth the simple, compelling theme of "I Am a Child of God" has moved and will move more souls to salvation than would such a work were they to succeed.<br><br>Some years ago I was chairman of a committee of seminary men responsible to produce a filmstrip on Church history. One of the group, Trevor Christensen, remembered that down in Sanpete County was a large canvas roll of paintings. They had been painted by one of his progenitors, C. C. A. Christensen, who traveled through the settlements giving a lecture on Church history as each painting was unrolled and displayed by lamplight. The roll of paintings had been stored away for generations. We sent a truck for them, and I shall not forget the day we unrolled it.<br><br>Brother Christensen was not masterful in his painting, but our heritage was there. Some said it was not great art, but what it lacked in technique was more than compensated in feeling. His work has been shown more widely and published more broadly and received more attention than that of a thousand and one others who missed that point.<br><br>I do not think Brother Christensen was a great painter, some would say not even a good one. I think his paintings are masterful. Why? Because the simple, reverent feeling he had for his spiritual heritage is captured in them. I do not think it strange that the world would honor a man who could not paint very well.<br><br>The ideal, of course, is for one with a gift to train and develop it to the highest possibility, including a sense of spiritual propriety. No artist in the Church who desires unselfishly to extend our heritage need sacrifice his career or an avocation, nor need he neglect his gift as only a hobby. He can meet the world and "best" it, and not be the loser. In the end, what appears to be such sacrifice will have been but a test.<br><br>Abraham did not have to kill Isaac, you know. He had to be willing to. Once that was known, that he would sacrifice his only begotten, he was known to be godlike and the blessings poured out upon him.<br><br>A few years ago Sister Packer and I were in Washington, D.C., to represent the Church at an awards banquet held in the reception hall of the Department of State. The elegant and stately surroundings, with a priceless collection of antiques and memorabilia, were impressive. Here, for instance, hangs the painting of George Washington by Gilbert Stuart and other priceless works of art. Both the occasion and the setting were ideal to make reference to the spiritual heritage of our country. And what was the program? A large brass section from one of the service bands played at great length, and with deafening volume, music from<i>Jesus Christ, Superstar.</i><br><br>I sat next to a lovely, dignified woman, the wife of an officer of the government. When the crescendo weakened for a moment I was able to ask, by raising my voice a bit, if she was able to hear them all right. Her obvious amusement at the question soon changed to serious disappointment, as she asked in return, "What would Jesus think?"<br><br>That is well worth keeping in our minds if we have the talent to compose music or poetry, to illustrate or paint, or sculpt or act, or sing or play or conduct.<br><br>What do I think He would think? I think He would rejoice at the playing of militant martial music as men marched to defend a righteous cause. I think that He would think there are times when illustrations should be vigorous, with bold and exciting colors. I think He would chuckle with approval when at times of recreation the music is comical or melodramatic or exciting. Or at times when a carnival air is in order that decorations be bright and flashy, even garish.<br><br>I think at times of entertainment He would think it quite in order for poetry that would make one laugh or cry--perhaps both at once. I think that He would think it would be in righteous order on many occasions to perform with great dignity symphonies and operas and ballets. I think that He would think that soloists should develop an extensive repertoire, each number to be performed at a time and in a place that is appropriate.<br><br>I would think that He would think there is a place for artwork of every kind--from the scribbled cartoon to the masterpiece in the hand-carved, gold-leaf frame.<br><br>But I am sure He would be offended at immodesty and irreverence in music, in art, in poetry, in writing, in sculpture, in dance, or in drama. I know what He would think about music or art or literature or poetry that is purely secular being introduced into our worship services. And how do I know that? Because He has told His servants that. In what ways has He told them? He has told them by either withholding or, on occasions, withdrawing His Spirit when it is done.<br><br>I mentioned earlier that I have sometimes struggled without much success to teach sacred things when preceded by music that is secular or uninspired. Let me mention the other side of it.<br><br>I have been in places where I felt insecure and unprepared. I have yearned inwardly in great agony for some power to pave the way or loosen my tongue, that an opportunity would not be lost because of my weakness and inadequacy. On more than a few occasions my prayers have been answered by the power of inspired music. I have been lifted above myself and beyond myself when the Spirit of the Lord has poured in upon the meeting, drawn there by beautiful, appropriate music. I stand indebted to the gifted among us who have that unusual sense of spiritual propriety.<br><br>Go to, then, you who are gifted; cultivate your gift. Develop it in any of the arts and in every worthy example of them. If you have the ability and the desire, seek a career or employ your talent as an avocation or cultivate it as a hobby. But in all ways bless others with it. Set a standard of excellence. Employ it in the secular sense to every worthy advantage, but never use it profanely. Never express your gift unworthily. Increase our spiritual heritage in music, in art, in literature, in dance, in drama.<br><br>When we have done it, our activities will be a standard to the world. And our worship and devotion will remain as unique from the world as the Church is different from the world. Let the use of your gift be an expression of your devotion to Him who has given it to you. We who do not share in it will set a high standard of expectation: "For of him unto whom much is given much is required" (D&amp;amp;C 82:3).<br><br>Now, in conclusion, may I remind you what I said at the beginning. My credential to speak does not come from personal mastery of the arts. I repeat my confession. I am not gifted as a musician or as a poet, nor adequate as an artist, nor accomplished in the field of dance, or writing, or drama. I speak on this subject because I have a calling, one that not only permits, but even requires, that we stay close to Him and to His Spirit.<br><br>If we know nothing of the arts, we know something of the Spirit. We know that it can be drawn upon meagerly or almost to the consuming of an individual.<br><br>In 1832 the Prophet Joseph Smith received a revelation that now stands as section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants and was designated by the Prophet as "The Olive Leaf." I quote a few verses:<br><br><i>Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently and ye shall find me; ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</i><br><br><i>Whatsoever ye ask the Father in my name it shall be given unto you, that is expedient for you;</i><br><br><i>And if ye ask anything that is not expedient for you, it shall turn unto your condemnation.</i><br><br><i>Behold, that which you hear is as the voice of one crying in the wilderness--in the wilderness, because you cannot see him--my voice, because my voice is Spirit; my Spirit is truth; truth abideth and hath no end; and if it be in you it shall abound.</i><br><br><i>And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, sanctify yourselves that your minds become single to God, and the days will come that you shall see him; for he will unveil his face unto you, and it shall be in his own time, and in his own way, and according to his own will.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:63–68]<br><br>The Spirit of the Lord can be present on His terms only. God grant that we may learn, each of us, particularly those who are gifted, how to extend that invitation.<br><br>He lives. Of Him I bear witness. Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, the Only Begotten of the Father. Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet of God. We have on our shoulders in this generation the Church and kingdom of God to bear away. God grant that those among us who are the most gifted will devote themselves in order that our task may be easier, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Boyd K.

<h1>d Family Life - Rex D. Pinegar - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
This is a beautiful sight. As I return to BYU and have the privilege of greeting you, I am filled within my heart with many apprehensions. I'd feel much more at home if we were having a zone conference. As I look here in the front, I see that your leaders here at the Y have understood that, and so they've lined up several missionaries so that I'd feel at home. I do appreciate that!<br><h2><b>Importance of Goals</b></h2><br>I want to talk to you today about a family-related topic, and it's called goals. The family is the most important unit in time or in eternity. An individual can only be exalted through an effective, righteous family unit. This truth places upon each of us the responsibility to become contributors to the effectiveness of our family units. I believe that's one of the things President Kimball had in mind when he made the following statement to the Regional Representatives as they were meeting concerning missionary work in 1975. I've taken his statement and adapted it to our situation this morning. These are the words of President Kimball:<br><br><i>Now I want to say something about . . . productivity--particularly goals. . . . We do believe in setting goals. We live by goals. . . . Our total existence is goal oriented. . . . We must have goals to make progress, encouraged by keeping records. . . . Progress is easier when it is timed, checked and measured. . . . I believe in goals, but I believe that the individual must set his own. Goals should always be made to a point that will make us reach and strain. Success should not necessarily be gauged by always reaching the goal set, but by progress</i>and<i>attainment. Therefore, I think we should use the goal system to its proper conclusion.</i><br><br>To my way of thinking, that proper conclusion seems to be in obtaining an exalted eternal life. That conclusion can only be realized, then, in the eternal family unit. That being the case, each of us must set goals which would help us to be effective family members--husbands, wives, fathers, mothers, sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters. When daily goals are set with this eternal perspective in mind, an individual is more likely to enjoy living. Greater satisfaction will come from doing what might otherwise be considered as routine or mundane tasks. Such an approach to living requires one to look beneath the surface of everyday affairs and associations.<br><h2><b>Education and Business Goals</b></h2><br>Students have goals--you know, the goals of good grades, graduation, degrees, marriage. You may achieve all of those goals and then wonder why you're not happy or wonder why you haven't been satisfied with the accomplishment. What is missing that should have brought about the success that you were seeking? Well, these goals that have been mentioned, of course, may be worthwhile goals--and they are--but true satisfaction will only come when the accomplishment of those goals is related to the objective of immortality and eternal life.<br><br>I once had the opportunity of speaking with some young insurance executives--two young men who had been very successful in their work. One of them attended this institution, just as you are. Another attended another institution in this state. I was interested in their stories because they seemed so similar. They both went to college looking for a wife. (So I want you to know, President Oaks, that this isn't the only institution where young men come to find their eternal companions!) But they were looking for certain things in their wives. Each indicated that he wanted to find a wife who was virtuous, one who had a love in her heart for other people, one who had eternal goals as her foremost concern. Each wanted to find a wife who could have an interest in him. Then they explained what that interest meant. Each of them indicated separately that that interest had to be expressed in requiring of them, these young men, more than they could expect from themselves. One of them put it this way: "After we were married, my wife let me know that I hadn't reached the end of the road yet. I still had some improving to do, and then she proceeded to show me. I'm grateful that she had that kind of courage because then her true beauty came forth."<br><br>Sometimes when we're associating with each other on this campus or any other campus we may be tempted to look only at the surface of our relationship with others and their appearance. These young men have shown that you have to look beneath the surface. You have to look to what people are really made of in terms of testimony, in terms of desires and goals that will reach the eternal objectives of eternal life. They said they went to school to obtain three things: one, to find an eternal companion; two, to prepare themselves to care for their families; and, three, to prepare in such a way as to be able to have time to serve the Lord. Those are worthwhile goals. As I talked with them I discovered that their success in life had come at a price--the price of trying to keep in mind, always, their eternal objective.<br><br>Just this last year each of these young men qualified for one of the top honors of his company. One of them said he couldn't understand why he didn't gain the satisfaction he had anticipated from such an achievement. And then he was asked by one of his employers to consider why he had been able to make such great sales. He decided it was due to the fact that he had prepared himself. He knew where to go to find the people, he knew what procedures to use, and pretty soon selling someone insurance became a matter of routine. He couldn't quite understand why that shouldn't bring success, because on paper, he said, he looked great. But inwardly he didn't feel so great. Then his boss asked him another question: "Have you considered<i>why</i>you're selling the insurance? What is it you want your families to receive as a result of that sale?" He said that only then did he realize true achievement could only come through service. That brought him back to his eternal objective, to do the will of his Heavenly Father, to serve others. As soon as he realized that, he got things back in focus. Then he began to realize not only success but also a feeling of accomplishment and achievement in success.<br><h2><b>Missionary Goals</b></h2><br>I'd like to tell you about another experience with goals. These missionaries who are here will appreciate this because they've had to ride on bicycles or walk; at least, they've had the opportunity to be challenged physically to accomplish a goal, and they've been challenged spiritually as well. I title this story "The Watermelon Bust," and I think you'll see why it was a bust. I know the missionary who had this experience won't mind my telling it because it was a faith-promoting experience for him. It seems that two missionaries were riding along on their bikes one day on their way to contact some people and came across a man who had a truckload of watermelons. They got to thinking about that and stopped, went over, and looked at the watermelons. One of them said, "Hmm, I wonder what he'd take for that load of watermelons?" Finally he asked the man, "What'll you take for that load of watermelons?" And the man must have said something like "What'll you offer?"<br><br>The missionary looked at his limited resources, and the most valuable possession that he had was his source of transportation. So he said, "How about my bike?"<br><br>The man with the watermelons said, "Sold." So the missionary traded him his bike for the load of watermelons. His companion must have looked at him with wonderment in his eyes, asking, "Now what will we do?" they had the man take the truckload of watermelons over to their apartment. I don't know if you've ever seen the size of a missionary apartment, but trying to fit a truckload of watermelons in there along with everything else is not always easy. Well, that's what they did. They packed those watermelons up the steps, up to that little apartment, and nearly filled it. The man put the bicycle in his truck and drove away.<br><br>Now, the missionaries had some good objectives in this, I think. The idea was, as I understand it, "We'll sell these watermelons, and then we'll both be able to buy new bikes! Wouldn't that be great to have a new bike to go around on? Especially great." But I think you can see the result. They never sold very many watermelons--two or three out of a truckload. Can you imagine what they ate for the next month? Well, the watermelons didn't quite last a month. Some of them couldn't be eaten.<br><br>This is a story of goals. Sometimes we find that there are rather ridiculous things we get into that deter us, take us away from the determined objectives we had in mind, and sometimes fog our attention to the degree that we ask ourselves, "Now, why did I do that?" I'm sure those missionaries may have asked themselves that question many times. It just goes to point out the need to have always in mind that eternal objective and then to measure your goals or to line up your goals in terms of that objective. Then the way will be clear, and you will be less likely to do ridiculous things and to fall into the trap of the "Why did I do that?" question.<br><br>There's another lesson I learned about goals in terms of missionaries and their families. You could always tell when a missionary was getting the spirit of his mission because he'd begin to talk about his family, how important they were to him, what kinds of feelings came to him in terms of his relationship to his father and mother. It was amazing to many missionaries how much their parents learned in such a short time. "Why, I've only been in the mission field four months, and already my father's changed his whole opinion." Well, I think you know whose opinion was changing, whose perspective of life had been broadened and increased.<br><br>Some missionaries learn also that there's a difference between seeking a position and seeking service. I don't think that's unlike most of us in our everyday life. If we find ourselves seeking for position, we may miss the opportunity to serve. An example: As I sat in my mission office, interviewing some missionaries on their way home, I was very surprised at a young man's answer to my question "Tell me about your mission. Tell me how you feel. You're on your way home; you've been successful. Tell me about your mission."<br><br>His reply was, "I'm sorry, President. I'm sorry that I failed."<br><br>I could hardly believe it! I said, "What do you mean, failed?"<br><br>"Well," he said, "I had as my goal to become an assistant to you."<br><br>I didn't smile. I kind of hurt inside. I said, "What do you mean?"<br><br>He said, "Well, it's obvious that a man isn't successful unless he can become a mission president's assistant." Then we talked about what really brought success in the mission field. We talked about where he had really served, and that that was the measure of success, not the position he had held. During the next several months I came across four or five other young men with this same feeling--that they'd failed because they hadn't gained the position of assistant to the mission president. Their goal had been shortsighted.<br><br>Positions of responsibility come about as a natural byproduct of our service, of being able to see an objective clearly, and that objective is that which the Lord would have us do. When we are determined to do that, then our opportunities become many and our service becomes increased. Our satisfaction in our service becomes long-lasting, not just momentary.<br><br>I think of another missionary who came to us before we left on our mission. He said, "If you ever get an opportunity to talk to missionaries, you might tell them my story." Now, that was interesting--I wondered what his story was. He said he thought all missionaries ought to hear about it. This is what he said: I was a failure on my mission. I only participated in one baptism. I had been in the mission field two weeks, and we baptized a fellow that I hadn't even taught. During the remainder of my mission I had no baptisms. I worked hard, but I never got anyone to be baptized. I came home a failure, and had been one for seventeen years. Then in the early hours of the morning I received a telephone call. At the other end of the line was a woman's voice. Her words were startling to me. She said, "Is this Elder Bradford?"<br><br>"Which Bradford do you mean?"<br><br>"Is this the Bradford who was on a mission in Texas about seventeen or eighteen years ago?"<br><br>"Well, yes."<br><br>"You may not remember me," she said, "but you and your companion came to my door, and you bore your testimony of the truthfulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ. You said that there was a Savior, and at that moment there came into my heart an understanding of what you'd said. My testimony began right then, but I was too fearful to continue. I just wanted to call you and let you know that I have just been baptized. I thought you might be interested." That young man had been a success, not because that woman became baptized. She was but an evidence of the effectiveness of his teaching. How many others did not bother to call? How many others received his service and grew without ever knowing how to contact him or let him know of their success and their achievement in coming into the Lord's kingdom?<br><br>Your lives are like the life of that missionary. As you go about doing the things that our Heavenly Father would have you do, as you keep foremost in your attention achieving your purpose here in life--which is to be a true son or daughter of our Heavenly Father, to bring yourself before him worthily, to receive the greatest blessing that he can give, eternal life--you affect the lives of other people for the better. That's the importance of having goals to live by.<br><h2><b>Family Goals</b></h2><br>I think also of the experience of my wife and me and our family. We began just as you are. I recall coming here as a freshman. I was twenty-three years old as a freshman. I knew right away I had to get married in a hurry! I saw all these young people on the campus; I felt like an old man at twenty-three. Then I found a lovely young lady who had a testimony of the truth and who didn't care if I was old--she still agreed! Well, we were married while I was a freshman, and we had some goals that we set: some of them were voiced, some of them were kind of within our hearts and never really expressed openly to each other, but there was one goal that we set that I'm very proud of--the goal that we would be a family, that she would be home, and that she would care for the home and the children. You know, when you're living on $84 a month, sometimes that's not easy. But then we got a raise and I went up to $110 a month. We felt better, but then of course we had our first child, and he pretty well took the $20 a month that we earned. But that goal of being a family was very important to us and we held to it.<br><br>We also had a goal to graduate, and we did it. I say "we" because I'm very sure that my graduation was as much my wife's fault as it was mine! When we graduated and took our first job, we thought now's the time--we'll go out in the world and make some money. Then we'll really be able to live. We discovered when we got out in the world that money didn't go any farther there than it did on campus. In fact, sometimes I wondered if it went as far.<br><br>One day my wife asked me a staggering question that startled me a little bit. She said, "Now, Rex, what are you really going to be?"<br><br>I kind of laughed because I thought, "What do you mean, 'What am I really going to be?' I'm a teacher. I teach in the school right across the street. Surely you can see what I'm going to be!"<br><br>But she wasn't content with that kind of an answer. She said, "What do you really want to be? What are your goals, your objectives in life?" I realized that I had never shared them with her. It kind of hurt, and I realized that it had probably hurt her as well. So we talked about our family and then decided what we'd have to do with our lives in order to accomplish that. Our desire was to be of service to the Lord and be where he wanted us to be when he wanted us to be there. Well, in order to accomplish that we had to have an income, and so we set our goals in line with that thinking. It meant moving, and we did. It meant being in school for thirteen years--just thought I'd encourage those of you who have been here a day or two! My children thought that that's all daddy did--go to school. He went to school in the morning to teach, and he went to school at night to learn. Daddy was always going to school as far as they were concerned. But those goals were secondary to family, secondary to maintaining the family unit. We discovered something, my young friends. We discovered that the Lord has plans for you, too. As long as your plans are consistent with the eternal objectives, then the plans of the Lord can be manifest in your own lives. With that in mind, may I suggest some things that you may do to help you set goals properly.<br><h2><b>Guidelines for Setting Correct Goals</b></h2><br>First, would you prayerfully consider the selection of each goal? Brother Neal Maxwell put it this way. He said that we should prayerfully ponder the probable results of each goal we select. I like that idea of looking at the<i>result</i>of the goal, not just the goal itself. Joseph Smith taught us that the Great Jehovah has a grand design for this earth and for those who inhabit it. In fact,<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</i>tells us that all of the good gifts, the great accomplishments that men have received in the earth or have come up with in the earth, are the result of the blessing of the Lord--intelligence and light that have come from him (see<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</i>, pp. 250–51). If you would accomplish something great, confer, will you, with the Creator? Prayerfully seek the direction of the Lord in the selection of your goals.<br><br>Second, when you select a goal, will you let it be a useful one? A useful goal ought to be one that is practical and can either apply to your present needs or prepare you to meet future needs--or at least aid you in broadening your understanding. When you do that, the goal can provide you with an input of success from many different areas. You won't have to get success from only one avenue of endeavor to know that you've succeeded. There will be many sources of confidence that come to you as a result of goals that help you to grow in many directions. This will also be a way for you to improve the talents you already possess and perhaps discover a few more you might have.<br><br>Third, would you write down the goals you select? If you write them down, they're more likely to reach the action stage than to remain in the wishful thinking or just "resolved" stage. To show you how important having them written down is, would you refer to the statement by Stonewall Jackson? This statement is inscribed at the entrance to the Virginia Military Institute: "You may be whatever you resolve to be." Put that resolve in writing and then keep it somewhere where you can refer to it so that you can check your progress and keep yourself reminded you do have that goal. I'm reminded of some missionaries again in that regard: they had a "goal board" in their apartment. They liked to write down on the board what their goals for the week were, such as "Baptize the Jones family by Saturday." They had been working with the Jones family for a long time. It seemed that Brother and Sister Jones were giving them a ride back to their apartment on that particular day, and as they came to the apartment they asked the missionaries if they could use their telephone. They didn't know how brave they were to go into the missionaries' apartment! But the missionaries were even braver, because they let them come in! When they came in, Sister Jones (I guess we'd call her "sister" whether she's a member or not) came over by the phone. There was this "goal board," and she read, "Baptize the Jones family by Saturday." She looked at her husband, pointed it out to him, and then said, "You boys really mean business, don't you?" One elder replied, "You have to set your goals or you'll never achieve them." The Jones family was baptized on Saturday!<br><br>Fourth, goals receive a commitment from us when they are shared with someone else. If you want a goal to be effective in your life, share it with someone. The Lord does that. He requires that we share our goals with him and make commitments with him. Baptism is just one of those ways. Because the sharing of goals is an expression of faith, we're more likely to exercise faith in the accomplishment of that goal. So share your goal with someone and make a commitment to accomplish that goal.<br><br>Last of all, let's talk about motivation in the achievement of that goal. True motivation to achieve comes from a desire to serve the Lord. If you can see in each of the goals you select an opportunity to improve your ability to serve the Lord--which includes, of course, serving his children, and the first ones of his children that you must serve are your family members--then you'll receive a desire to achieve that cannot be obtained in any other way. That motivation will be lasting because it will bring a continuing feeling of satisfaction. When I say "service," I don't mean just "service at convenience" because that's not service at all. That's only a self-serving activity. Service requires sacrifice. Joseph Smith said it this way: "Unless you belong to a church that requires sacrifice of all that you possess, everything that you have and are, even at perhaps the cost of your life, unless you belong to such a church as that, that church could never build within you the faith that you need to obtain eternal life." Yes, service requires sacrifice and<i>then</i>motivation is assured.<br><br>Let us return to the statement of President Kimball about goals and goal setting. He said that each of us must set our own goals. Your goals may be particularly important to you and you alone, but when you share a goal with our Heavenly Father it becomes an eternal objective and will take you toward that great goal of eternal life.<br><br><i>Goals should always be made to a point that will make us reach and strain. Success should not necessarily be gauged by always reaching the goals set, but by progress</i>and<i>attainment. Therefore, I think we should use the goal system to its proper conclusion</i>. [President Spencer W. Kimball, Regional Representatives Seminar, April 1975]<br><br>It is my prayer that each of us will accept the goal that our Heavenly Father has set as our guiding and overall goal--immortality and eternal life with him. May each of us have the conviction in our hearts to set goals that are meaningful in light of that great objective. I can promise you that as you do the Spirit of the Lord will come into your life and there shall be an even greater satisfaction and joy come to you in this life as you prepare for the great joy of eternal life hereafter, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Rex D.

<h1> The Land of Promise - Barbara B. Smith - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, I too want to express my appreciation for that beautiful choral number and for the privilege of being with you this morning. It is a thrill to know that you are the children of the Lord who have been chosen to come forth in these last days to do his work, and I learned on my recent visit to your campus that you are well aware of the world's problems: the disease, the hunger, the poverty, the immorality, man's inhumanity to man. I saw that you are seeking solutions, thoughtfully considering the opinions of others, scientifically seeking the methods, and interacting in ways that may well prepare you to unite and boldly declare that you will follow Jesus Christ to a final victory. This is not to be a game that ends in a tie, nor is it to be one where there is a strategic plan for a last-second shot. It is to be a victory where evil and unrighteousness will be bound and the children of the Lord will be free to be safely gathered into his kingdom. To some, this may seem like an impossible dream at this point in time, but I assure you it is possible and it will happen. However, it can only come about through the efforts of honest men and women who are committed to dedicate their lives to its accomplishment.<br><h2><b>America's Struggle for Independence</b></h2><br>I feel sure that to some it may seem impossible that George Washington could have ever freed the colonies from the power that controlled them. I'm sure it must have seemed impossible that those colonies could ever unite after the battles of Lexington and Concord when that congress had studied and debated for nearly a full year. I'm sure it was a weary but happy John Adams who wrote to his wife, Abigail, after his tireless efforts in that congress:<br><br><i>Yesterday the greatest question was ever decided which ever was debated in America, and a greater</i>[question]<i>perhaps never was nor will be decided among men. A resolution was passed without one dissenting colony that these united colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent states.</i>[<i>The Book of Abigail and John</i>(Boston: Harvard University Press, 1975), p.139]<br><br>Notice the insight when he added:<br><br><i>You will think me transported with enthusiasm, but I am not. I am well aware of the toil, and blood, and treasure, that it will cost us to maintain this Declaration, and support and defend these states. Yet through all the gloom, I can see the rays of crashing glory. I can see that the end is more than worth all the means.</i>[<i>The Book of Abigail and John</i>(Boston: Harvard University Press, 1975), p. 142]<br><br>And those were not just idle words when those men pledged their lives and their liberty and their sacred honor. It was not a flamboyant or a glamorous gesture when they signed that document that declared to all the world that there were some compelling arguments necessary for them to break from the power that ruled their lives.<br><br>The move for independence came in an age of mental enlightenment, as recognized by Norman Cousins in his book<i>In God We Trust</i>. "The seeds of the free mind," he said, concerning that time, "seem to sprout at the same time. Ideas have a life of their own. They can be nourished and brought into active growth by a small number of sensitive, vital minds which somehow seem to respond to the needs of the total organism, however diffused the parts of that organism may be." And so it was with the ideas that brought men to pledge all that they had, in fact life itself, to the founding of this nation.<br><br>The precise phrases of the Declaration of Independence seemed to occur to many men at the same time. The framers of the Declaration of Independence had the thrill of recognizing that what they were thinking was being thought by other great minds. What Thomas Jefferson did was to bring the words, the need, and the moment together. We know from the revelations that the Lord raised up these good men to do this mighty work. It was no accident. The remarkable and joyful thing is that these young men and women who lived two hundred years ago accepted the challenge of their time so effectively. Laced throughout their writing is the evidence of their reliance upon a divine guidance. They appeal in the declaration itself to the world court on the grounds that what they did was in answer to that higher law of God which provides that all men are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights.<br><br>Our founding fathers had such faith in man. Listen again to the words of Norman Cousins:<br><br><i>The American Founding Fathers . . . believed deeply in the ability of a human being to learn enough in order to take part in self-government; in the capacity of people to make sense of their lives if given reasonable conditions within society itself; in the responsive power of men when exposed to great ideas; in people, to stand under the due process of law; in man, to make basic decisions concerning his religion or his politics or anything else.</i>[<i>In God We Trust</i>(New York: Harper Brothers Publishing, 1958), p. 8]<br><br>This is the faith that our Heavenly Father has in us. Inspired by the Lord, the Prophet Joseph Smith said, "I teach them correct principles and they govern themselves."<br><h2><b>America the Free</b></h2><br>In the mighty struggle before the world was, God stood firm for the resolution that men had to have their free agency so they could progress. Our Heavenly Father has continued through the ages to offer us knowledge and wisdom and also to allow evil as well as good to exist, so that men might have their options. A sense of destiny seemed to be with the Americans from their earliest encounter with this continent. Listen to John Winthrop's words in the 1600s. He said, "For we must consider that we shall be as a city upon a hill. The eyes of all people are upon us. So that if we shall deal falsely with God in this work we have undertaken and so cause him to withdraw his present help from us, we shall be made a story and a by-word through the world."<br><br>In Louis Untermeyer's foreword to<i>The Britannica Library of Great American Writing,</i>he supports this fact and yet he recognizes the great diversities of America as he describes it and its people:<br><br><i>This is a country of contradictions. Restlessness, a love of movement for its own sake, is distinctly an American trait, but so is the love of the land and the desire to get one's roots deep into it. Americans are avid for experiment. They will buy and try anything new. But they are also devoted to the status quo, to things as they are and to letting well enough alone. They are nostalgic about the last (and lost) frontier; they lament the passing of the past; yet they believe in the ever-expanding limitless future. They are isolationists, and they also see their country as the pivotal force of the world. They are a hybrid product of many kinds, creeds, and colors from every possible racial group, and yet they are a race apart, a polyglot people to whom the letters</i>U.S.<i>mean not only United States, but personally "us" .</i><br><br><i>The typical American cherishes his contradictions. He is both proud and complacent about the size, vigor, and variety of his country, a country intensely devoted to ancient doctrines and the Good Book. And yet he knows that within less than fifty years, this same country has produced two new Bibles,</i>The Book of Mormon<i>and</i>Science and Health.<i>He is likely to seem naïve, apt to regard his nation as the New Jerusalem and himself as one of the specially privileged elect, one who echoes the declaration of John Adams, "I always consider the settlement of America as the opening of a grand scheme and design in Providence for the illumination and emancipation of the slavish part of mankind all over the earth." Yet his very boastfulness stems from a sense of wonder; he shares a gigantic vision which in the midst of vast prairies and breath-taking plateaus rears sky-scraping cities of incredible industry and luxury.</i><br><br>Here we are, you and I--Americans of diverse backgrounds, trying to understand our destiny, celebrating the significant event of the founding of this country, and looking at two hundred years of contradictions and magnificent events side by side. Our view of history is tempered by revealed truth. This country came forth with divine planning and help to provide a climate in which the gospel could be fully restored. Men of all nations were brought together into the melting pot so that they might be prepared and ready to hear the word of God.<br><br>At this crossroads in time you stand, quite naturally ready to examine this country's history. Take care how you look. History is not an easy thing to understand. Therefore, read widely, think deeply, and judge wisely. We cannot alter the pages of history, but we need to understand what was done in the past, even if it was not all praiseworthy or of good report, so that we might avoid mistakes in the future. Errors should not blind us to the good that our nation has contributed to the progress of mankind. As a country we have contributed much in the field of government. No other constitution acknowledges that the source of power reposes in the people and that only that power which they delegate belongs to the state. The sober, thoughtful system of checks and balances has stood the severe test of traumatic challenges. This principle of checks and balances stands as a torch in the night. We need to keep that torch burning. The idea of democracy itself has to have new champions. Only about one-fourth of the nations in the world are functioning as democracies. The temptation to wield power is great, and most of the world is still struggling to be freed from the fetters of oppressive governments. No matter how benevolent the dictatorship, control of human life is a terrible price to pay.<br><br>A free country is an American dream. Keeping that dream alive in your minds and hearts is a continuing responsibility. Don't be discouraged by errors, foolishness, or selfishness. Don't be cynical when you observe that not everyone has found the opportunity that you know in this America. Liberty, freedom, democracy, and trust in God--these are, as John Adams said, our "rays of crashing glory," worthy of our ongoing support whatever the cost. They can be ours; we can be free if we will be free. The Lord has told us this in the scriptures. He has told us that this is a blessed land and it will be free only as long as the inhabitants serve the God of this land. Remember the words of 2 Nephi:<br><br><i>Wherefore, this land is consecrated unto him whom he shall bring. And if it so be that they shall serve him according to the commandments which he hath given, it shall be a land of liberty unto them; wherefore, they shall never be brought down into captivity; if so, it shall be because of iniquity; for if iniquity shall abound, cursed shall be the land for their sakes, but unto the righteous it shall be blessed forever.</i>[2 Nephi 1:7]<br><br>So what is it, my young friends, that you can do for America? Commit yourselves to serve the God of this land. Live according to the truths that he has revealed. Knowing what we know, none of us should do less.<br><br>There is so much that you can do to be of help to others and thereby live more fully. Have you walked the hospital corridors and seen the suffering men and women so wracked with pain that they can hardly shuffle one foot in front of the other? Who will find the medicines to cure these ailments? Have you seen the despondency in the eyes of those whose disease knows no stopping point? Who will find the cause? Have you watched with a lump in your throat while someone you loved courageously inched forward on an unsteady leg after extensive surgery and an amputation? The therapy is so long and so hard. Who will care enough to see that the hours of struggle and heartbreak are guided until new muscles are developed to take over the unaccustomed task? Who will prepare the children to receive all knowledge through more effective teaching? Have you wondered how to solve the difficult problems of land pollution? Somewhere there are answers, and someone will find them. Have you a symphony or a hymn in your soul? Are you getting the knowledge and the discipline so that the world may hear it someday? Who will discover the perfect diets and serve the meals that will allow people to perform up to their full potential? Have you seen the waste of human life in the slums of the world? Who is going to find a way to stop the deadly cycle that leads to such ruined, wasted life? How about the energy crisis or the overriding of existential philosophies? Who is going to make the contact with morality a reality? Are you?<br><br>Now is the time of your preparation. You will be better able to help your country if you come to your tomorrows having made the best use of this precious time. You will be of less value if you try to build your life upon expediency and false principles. We all have this responsibility. Shakespeare said it this way: "Be just and fear not. Let all the ends thou aimest at be thy countries, thy gods, and truth." As you explore that unknown country inside of yourself, look for the talents and dream the dreams that will make you aspire to great and noble things. Then what you leave behind will be a great country; a strong, stable family; a life of significance; a torch still burning bright as the founding fathers gave to you.<br><h2><b>Contemporary Challenges for Women</b></h2><br>In our day young women are encouraged to reach out and fill their potential in many ways. It is important in so doing that they think carefully about the years ahead. It is important to use wisely these years of preparation to fill their minds and hearts with dreams and with learning and with the eternal perspectives which the gospel provides. The Church cannot afford to waste any of its precious human resources. Neither can our nation. Both must use resources in ways that will be in keeping with true values and divine approbation.<br><br>Women should approach their options and their choices thoughtfully and carefully. When they choose to rear children and thereby build strong family units, they should realize that such a choice offers both challenge and fulfillment. It cannot be merely a spare-time option if we are to give our nation strong, stable families that are society's hope for existence. No society in the history of the world has ever survived the breakdown of the family. So it must be with thoughtful hearts that we hear and heed the prophet's present-day counsel to strengthen family units. The choices made in planning any career, occupation, vocation, or avocation should be those that will have the strongest influence for good upon family units. As a leader of nearly a million Latter-day Saint women in the Relief Society organization, I would use my full power to persuade every young woman to accept with joy the opportunities of her divinely given role as a woman. Be she a student, homemaker, wife, mother, teacher--whatever her chosen profession--she can exemplify womanhood at its best. She can stand for faith and high ideals that will be an inspiration to all around her and to the new and upcoming generation. She can be a guide to them and thereby help them to build that high type of character without which we can never have a strong nation.<br><h2><b>Dangers of Military Service for Women</b></h2><br>God has told us that men and women are not to be the same. We are of equal worth in his eyes, but we are not the same. So there are activities for which women are best suited and their are activities for which men are best suited. For example, I would not encourage any young Latter-day Saint woman, especially one just out of high school, to become a military enlistee. Lately into my hands have come brochures designed to persuade our young women to enlist in the military services. I know that many factors, including the extremists of the women's movement, have compelled the government not only to encourage but also to actively recruit young women into the military ranks. As I have looked at the thrust of their appeal, I see page after page enticing young women to enlist. The blandishments for enlistment come in very appealing packages. The emphasis is on personal opportunity, travel, challenge, training, and money.<br><br>The success of this strong recruitment effort for women is dramatically apparent in the statistics. The<i>Salt Lake Tribune</i>in October 1975 carried an article by Barry Rohan of the Knight newspaper staff. He said, "This fall nearly half of the freshman ROTC classes are women students. The office of the assistant secretary of defense reports great strides in increasing the number of women in uniform. The result of these efforts has been that the number of women serving in the military has increased from 55,000 in 1973 to 97,000 in 1975. The planned goal is 120,000 by 1977." This gives us some idea of the success of the recruitment program. A recent article in the<i>Deseret News</i>called it "the latest military invasion--women."<br><br>I feel that the regimentation of military life places a great strain upon most women who would enlist in military services. It is difficult for them to live under the pressures of putting their lives so completely into another's charge, resigning their actions so completely to another's discipline.<br><br>A recent letter from some concerned parents is typical of some others I have received. It illustrates some of the problems to which I refer. This letter reads:<br><br><i>Dear President Smith:</i><br><br><i>Some time ago we received a phone call from our daughter. She is in the army. She was crying over the phone. In fact, she was almost hysterical. She felt she had not one friend on earth. Those she thought were her friends had deserted her and were in fact persecuting her unmercifully--for one reason, because she is a Mormon. To say "we were in despair" is an understatement.</i><br><br>A second letter was enclosed with the letter from these parents, and let me read it to you in part:<br><br><i>I am your daughter's Relief Society visiting teacher. My companion and I were at first unable to locate her. When we did, we found a depressed and mixed-up young lady. I'm not connected with the military, and I soon had my eyes opened to the unfortunate circumstances in which young girls in the military may find themselves. How very difficult it would be to keep gospel standards in my mind when one was continually subject to the rowdy, cigarette-filled barracks, the regimentation of being dumped into a job for which one is neither suited nor trained.</i><br><br><i>Since that initial visit, and on following visits as she became aware of the Church here, a distinct change came over her. As far as her work would permit, she attended many ward functions, and all were aware of her friendly presence. One could almost measure the light that came back into her lovely eyes. She began to smile as she realized that people cared.</i><br><br><i>You're going to be welcoming home a very special daughter, and I shall miss her because she is my friend. I shall always be grateful to her for showing me the change that can come into one's life when he grasps firmly the iron rod.</i><br><br>I would hope that all Latter-day Saint young women would think long and hard about the regimentation of enlistment in military service, for our experience with young women in the military is very disappointing. A career military officer who is a good Latter-day Saint observed, "I have seen both sides of the story--clean, wholesome young ladies who have lived their religion and who have anxiously and effectively shared it with others. And then I have sadly witnessed some of these young ladies become engulfed in the filth and mire; unfortunately, the majority of the cases fall into the latter category."<br><br>Very little moral guidance is provided by the military. Each person sets his own set of values. The result is consistent with current trends in society. As Latter-day Saints, however, we are committed to live according to a God-given set of values. Moral integrity is not what<i>we</i>say is right. Moral cleanliness and integrity will<i>always</i>be that which God has revealed. Whether we live that way or not is up to us. The special conditions of regimentation, assigned living quarters, make it difficult to remove oneself from unwholesome environments and their consequent pressures and temptations. We must do our best to keep ourselves free from situations that might cause us to compromise our standards.<br><br>Now, as I've voiced my concern for a young woman choosing to become enlisted into the regular military ranks, I am at the same time in favor of military service organizations, such as the ones you have here on campus. One of my daughters found great growth as she participated in and was commandant of Angel Flight here at Brigham Young University. She learned personal discipline. She found pleasure in her associates. The Angel Flight Drill Team was particularly successful that year, and she took pride in their accomplishments. I raise my concerns about service in the military, particularly for young women, because I want them to make knowledgeable choices. At the same time I recognize the great good of the military. I have personal knowledge of the great good being accomplished throughout the world by Latter-day Saint military personnel. I have seen their good influence as I traveled through the Far East countries with the General Authorities for the area conferences. I saw many people who had accepted the gospel and its teachings because of the lives and the examples of good Latter-day Saint military men and women. I pay them high tribute. I know that we need such leaders who give their lives to protect our country from destruction and who will keep alive the ideals of morality, Christian living, and freedom upon which our democracy is founded. They are a strength to our country and to our Church throughout the world.<br><br>I know that a dedicated, strong, technically trained, well-directed military is vital to maintaining the good life, the free society, the American dream. Since its founding, however, this country's freedom has been won and maintained largely by a male military which was and is supported by wives, mothers, sisters, sweethearts especially dedicated to the principles of freedom, but, in my judgment, making their contribution to its cause in ways best suited to women. I hope that women will do in the future as they have done over and over again in the past--save families.<br><br>I remember with pride the women who have been willing to help when the need arose. In the revolutionary period most of the women maintained homes and families while their men were at war. Some of them, like Molly Pitcher, fired cannons when the need was upon them. Pioneer women built great, strong homes, but they too fired guns when they had to. In periods of national emergencies women have always been able to rise to the occasion. During World War II, for example, many thousands of women gave valued service in the military. But even in wartime the home front is at least as vital to victory as is the battlefront. Without it there can be no victories on any front--in wartime or peacetime. So whatever else we do as women, we need to remember that God has given us the home front to defend against all assault. There are many options open to women today, and Latter-day Saint women are caught up in the challenge of this change in society, but we cannot with conviction turn our backs on the divine counsel that women are the homemakers of the world. As we build a strong home front we provide a supporting line of defense in times of war and peace that is absolutely critical and irreplaceable. Even our national anthem reflects this thought, as in the last stanza we sing, "O thus be it ever, where free men shall stand, between their loved homes and the war's desolation."<br><br>America is the great ongoing dream of democracy. America deserves the commitment of our lives to maintain this dream. America's essential ingredients are morality and integrity if we are to preserve this land. America is a land of personal choices and responsibility. America is where you can fulfill your destiny.<br><h2><b>Your Future in America</b></h2><br>Nobody can tell you what the years ahead will hold for you. You can be sure there will be happy and tender moments. You can be sure there will be days of exciting achievements, and you can be certain there will be "down" days and problems you cannot anticipate. This is the nature of mortality. Your real job is to do whatever comes your way and refine your soul in the doing. You can map out a general path. You can commit to living truth as you see it. You can through your actions tell the world that you are not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Then, wherever you are, whatever you choose to do, you will be building his kingdom for your children and your children's children. What will this next two hundred years hold for our native land, this land of promise? What do you promise to this great land of promise? If you promise a life of moral purity and integrity, then you again give our nation the fundamental building blocks of greatness and liberty. Without these gifts you give only ashes, for you destroy this great, free land.<br><br>As I stand here today I remember Deborah, a mother, a poetess, a judge in Israel who rallied her wavering and oppressed countrymen to battle to accomplish the work needed to save the children of the Lord in her day. Deborah's greatness lay not in her physical strength but in her moral leadership, in the confidence she inspired that the Lord would aid those who fought for a righteous cause. May we have that same greatness. May we have the vision our founding fathers had of a free nation. It is worth all the sacrifice it took to create it, and it is worth all the sacrifice it will take to maintain it. Thomas Jefferson gave an eloquent reminder: "The people," he said, "are the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty."<br><br>It is my prayer that as American citizens each of us will search his soul and, as George Washington counseled, rededicate himself and "labor to keep alive . . . that little spark of celestial fire--conscience." With that conscience and with the Spirit of the Holy Ghost we, men and women, can accept the challenge of our time and contribute effectively to that which our nation needs the most. We can dream dreams for a future of growth, solutions for problems not yet solved, and hope for the future. We can build a foundation of moral virtue that gives strength and stability as our part in that final victory which will make it possible for the children of the Lord to be safely gathered into his kingdom. May this be our promise to this land of promise, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Barbara B.

<h1>ch and the American Bicentennial - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Students of this great Brigham Young University, how delighted I am to be with you here today . Today we especially salute our native Americans on this special commemoration of your Indian Week. We recognize the great contribution you've made to America's culture. We express our love and appreciation to you, and we are proud to call you "brother" and "sister" as we embrace and shake hands in the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>The subject I have selected to speak on today should be of interest to you as well as to all of us who have heritage in this great land of America. I was in the process of gathering some thoughts together for this talk and received a phone call from my daughter Gay. She gave me instructions not to speak on a Bicentennial theme. She said, "You're becoming trite. What will happen after the Fourth of July? No one will ever want you to speak again!" But today when she saw me wearing my Bicentennial tie, she said, "I guess I failed." Her idea was to have an entertaining talk--one that had a number of stories. But I had a great and strong impression on the subject that I'm to speak to you about today, and, Gay, I'm afraid I can't follow your counsel and advice.<br><br>Only two years ago I was given a major responsibility, and as these last two years have progressed I believe I'm beginning to understand the magnitude of this assignment. I want to be very specific with you today. I want to talk straightforwardly to you about my feelings concerning America. I want you to understand how I feel about the assignment I have been given, but I especially want to enlist your help in assisting me in its fulfillment.<br><h2><b>The Church's Expectations of BYU Students</b></h2><br>I realize the power of the great body I'm before today. It is the best-trained, the best-equipped generation the world has ever known. Adding to this the tremendous investment the Church is making in your education, I suddenly realize the power of<i>you</i>in the world in which you live.<br><br>I've had the privilege, as President Oaks knows all too well, of sitting on the budget committee for the last little while. I am rapidly becoming aware of the great pressures the Church has on its resources. The demand is always a hundredfold more than the supply. I suppose this condition will never change in a growing and expanding church. Even with all of the great pressures of buildings, travel, supplies, translation, education, programs, communication, and others, the Church in its priorities has agreed to invest its sacred tithing funds fifteen times greater in you than it does for the average member of the Church.<br><br>The sacrifice of these members of the Church to pay their tithes and offerings has become more meaningful to me in the last few weeks. I was assigned to divide a stake just a couple of weeks ago in a country south of here. In the process of issuing a call to a stake president, the man the Lord had selected to serve, I saw him almost break into tears when the call was extended to him. He explained that he knew the call was coming. He said with a sad heart, as he assumed this heavy burden, that he knew the sacrifice he and his family would have to make. Then he went on to explain that right now one day's salary in every month is required just to transport his children, his family, back and forth to church as they pay their fare on the bus. Now with this additional assignment, added bus fare would be needed to attend more meetings. Then he continued to say that he would gladly and willingly accept the call, for he was anxious to build the kingdom and to make whatever sacrifice the Lord would require of him. He knew his family would sustain him in this sacrifice. My eyes glanced down, then, at this point, to the tithing record that was before me, and I found his contributions marked "paid in full." Suddenly I realized that this great and devoted, humble servant was making enormous sacrifices through the payment of his tithes to help my children have an education at this great institution. Literally the widow's mite is being supplied you to give you an education at this school. The members of the Church have a right to expect high performance out of you. This institution must be the best in all the land; for the tithing funds, the Lord's funds, are sustaining and supporting it. Throughout the Church there is great love and high expectation for your performance as your education continues and as you go forward, leaving the institution to go out into the world and make your contribution.<br><h2><b>Challenges for America's Future</b></h2><br>In contrast to you great people I see before me today, I look around this great land of the free in which we are living and find some very definite signs of the decay that is beginning to occur. Corruption, crime, dishonesty, immorality, pollution, laziness, devotion only to special interests are signs which precede the fall. We see so much evidence of these signs before our eyes in the civilization in which we live. These have marked the downfall of mighty nations before ours. I realize the promise which has been given to us in this great land. I also remember the prophecies concerning our responsibilities to preserve that which God has blessed us with. The Lord has promised us--through testimonies of two or three--to sustain the truth on this land. Our responsibilities to this land have been testified to by a much larger number than that, but for the sake of the record I give you three special witnesses who have indicated our responsibilities to the land of America.<br><br>The first witness I would call for would be Brigham Young, who said: "Will the Constitution be destroyed? No: It will be held inviolate by this people" ; and, as Joseph Smith said, "The time will come when the destiny of this nation will hang upon a single thread. At that critical juncture, this people will step forth and save it from the threatened destruction. It will be so" (<i>Journal</i>of<i>Discourses,</i>7:15).<br><br>Now the second witness, John Taylor: "When the people have torn to shreds the Constitution of the United States the Elders of Israel will be found holding it up to the nations of the earth and proclaiming liberty and equal rights to all men, and extending the hand of fellowship to the oppressed of all nations. This is part of the program" (<i>Journal</i>of<i>Discourses,</i>21:8).<br><br>The third witness is from George Q. Cannon, former member of the First Presidency: "The day will come when the Constitution and free government under it will be sustained and preserved by this people" (<i>Gospel Truth,</i>vol. 2, comp. Jerreld L. Newquist [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1974]). Now, I declare to you today that if we are not in the beginning stages of the fulfillment of this prophecy, we are at least in the stages where we're preparing for its fulfillment.<br><h2><b>The Church's Bicentennial Message</b></h2><br>Now at this critical stage in our nation's history, suddenly we find ourselves with a great opportunity to reverse the trend and help chart the course of this country back toward righteousness. We have just concluded printing a document for the Church to be issued to all of the Church who are interested in it. It contains our message to our country during this Bicentennial year. The title of our message is "God's Hand in the Founding of America." As a part of this effort we have commissioned the painting of seven specific posters which are now being printed to become part of a poster series to tell our message to the nation. It is anticipated that this poster series will be used in every building that we have in the United States during the year of 1976, and those who visit our buildings who are not of our faith will have an opportunity of hearing our message through this series. I would like you to become partly familiar with this message. I would like you to know it so that you can have an opportunity of declaring it as we go forward in 1976. Could I tell you about and walk you through these documents, to see what they contain? First let me introduce you to this poster series.<br><br>The Bicentennial effort of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is communicated in three unique messages to America. The messages are these: first, that America's early history began more than two thousand years ago and is contained in an ancient and sacred record called the Book of Mormon; second, that the discovery of America and the establishment of the United States was a part of God's plan and was brought about by men who were inspired and guided by God; and finally, that America's future destiny is dependent on the righteousness and morality of her families.<br><br>Why is it so important to know and understand America's past? Because in that past are the important lessons and warnings for today: lessons about God and his interest in the affairs of men, warnings in the form of destructions that came to early American civilizations when they lost their reverence for family or morality and for God. Why are these messages particularly important during the Bicentennial year? Because the only true way to celebrate the Bicentennial is in the same spirit that prevailed two hundred years ago--a spirit of control over the earth and man's dependency on Jesus the Christ.<br><h2><b>Seven Scenes from America's History</b></h2><br>Now imagine being in a chapel with these seven posters before you. I take you to the first one. It's entitled "Ancient America." Then in a narrative we would explain what this poster means. Archaeologists have now confirmed the existence of a great pre-Aztec civilization on the American continent. The Book of Mormon is a record of this civilization, beginning some six hundred years before Christ when a man named Lehi left Jerusalem and came by boat to the Americas. The book was originally written by these ancient people on sheets of gold. Lehi's son Nephi was a great prophet who foresaw much of what would happen in the future of this new land. He foresaw a time after Christ's resurrection when the Son of God would appear here in America: "I saw the heavens open, and the Lamb of God descending out of heaven; and he came down and showed himself unto them" (1 Nephi 12:6). He foresaw an apostasy later on, both here and in the Old World when "they have taken away from the gospel of the Lamb many parts which are plain and most precious" (1 Nephi 13:26). Nephi also saw the destruction of this early American civilization and a later rediscovery of this land by an inspired explorer: "And I looked and beheld a man among the Gentiles, who was separated from the seed of my brethren by the many waters; and I beheld the Spirit of God, that it came down and wrought upon the man; and he went forth upon the many waters, even unto the seed of my brethren, who were in the promised land" (1 Nephi 12:12). Finally he foresaw the restoration here on this land of the fulness of the gospel. "These last records . . . shall make known the plain and precious things which have been taken away from them" (1 Nephi 12:40), he testifies. The Book of Mormon history concerning the children of Lehi extends back ten times farther than that which we celebrate in the Bicentennial, and twenty times farther concerning those who followed the brother of Jared, a record also contained in the Book of Mormon to this land of liberty. Our evidence is overwhelming of God's hand in the establishment of this nation and his dealings with mankind both when they were righteous and when they became wicked.<br><br>Now the second poster. We take you to one showing Christ in America. The greatest event recorded in the Book of Mormon was the visit of Jesus Christ to America shortly after his resurrection. The Book of Mormon thus becomes a second witness to the divinity of the Son of God. Mormons use both the Bible and the Book of Mormon, believing that they are both ancient and sacred writings, one from the Old World and one from the New World. The last part of the Book of Mormon recounts a great war that virtually destroyed ancient American civilization. In order to preserve their history, which had been recorded on plates of gold, they buried the record in the earth. The man who abridged and summarized these records just prior to the destruction of this people was named Mormon--hence the name "The Book of Mormon." It was Mormon's son Moroni who buried the plates. Before doing so, he made this prophecy to all who would read the book today:<br><br><i>And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.</i><br><br><i>And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.</i>[Moroni 10:4–5]<br><br>Now step with me to the third poster, "America Rediscovered." Centuries passed before America was rediscovered. The Lord inspired the thinking and guided the sailing of a man, Christopher Columbus, who on several occasions gave credit to the Almighty. In writing to the Spanish leaders, Columbus said, "Our Lord unlocked my mind, set me upon the sea, and gave me fire for the deed. Those who heard of my enterprise called it foolish, mocked me, and laughed. But who can doubt but that the Holy Ghost inspired me?" During the voyage, after weeks of sailing with no land in sight, mutiny raised its head. Finally Columbus promised the captains of the two other ships that they would turn back if land was not sighted in forty-eight hours. Then he went to his cabin and in his words "prayed mightily to the Lord." On October 12, the very next day, they sighted land. We believe a land of liberty and religious freedom was a necessary ingredient in the plan of God; thus, Columbus and others, particularly those seeking religious freedom, were led to the shores of America.<br><br>Now the fourth in the poster series, entitled<i>"</i>Men Raised Up." The success of the Declaration of Independence and the Revolutionary War came through men who were raised up by God for this very special purpose. One must merely read the Declaration of Independence to feel its inspiration. One must merely study history to know that to defeat the world's most powerful country by a group of fledgling colonies was a result of a force greater than man. Where else in the world do we find a group of men together in one place at one time who possessed greater capacity and wisdom than did the founding fathers--Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, and others? But it was not to their own abilities that they gave the credit. They acknowledged Almighty God and were certain of the impossibility of their success without his help. Benjamin Franklin, one of these, made an appeal for daily prayers in the Constitutional Convention. In that appeal he said, "And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without His aid? . . . and I also believe that without His concurring aid, we shall succeed in this political building no better than the building of Babel" (James Parton,<i>Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin</i>[Boston: J. R. Osgood Co., 1864], 2:574).<br><br>Now the fifth poster. "Inspired Documents" is its title. No constitution on earth has endured longer than ours. We seek and usually find the answers to today's hardest legal questions within this document of yesterday. The Constitution was and is a miracle. Both Washington and Madison refer to it as such. It was an inspired document, written under the divine guidance of the Lord. James Madison, commonly called the Father of the Constitution, recognized this inspiration and gave credit to "the guardianship and guidance of the Almighty Being whose power regulates the destiny of nations, whose blessings have been so conspicuously displayed to this rising republic" (First Inaugural Address, 4 March 1809).<br><br>We believe that the Constitution was brought about by God to insure a nation where liberty could abound, where his gospel could flourish. Joseph Smith said, "Hence we say, that the Constitution of the United States is a glorious standard; it is founded in the wisdom of God. It is a heavenly banner" (<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</i>p. 147). Again from Brigham Young, "The General Constitution . . . was dictated by the invisible operations of the Almighty" (<i>Journal of Discourses,</i>7:13). From our current living prophet, Spencer W. Kimball, "One of the reasons America is great today is because those men who formulated the Constitution had vision. They looked ahead to this day and all of us here are recipients of their wisdom and foresight" (Lecture at Dixie College, 25 April 1975). Among other things, the Constitution guarantees the religious freedom that allowed the Reformation to continue and flourish. The great reformers in this land began to throw off the rituals and dogmas that had been attached to Christianity during the Dark Ages and sought to return to the pure and simple truths of the New Testament.<br><br>Now the sixth poster, one very interesting to us, entitled "The Gospel Restored." Many of the great reformers stated that their efforts were to assert basic Christian teachings of the Bible, but they acknowledged that they possessed no authority to administer to the ordinances of the Church or to reestablish the original church of Jesus Christ. Luther said, "I simply say that Christianity has ceased to exist among those who should have preserved it . . ." (In Galat. [1535] Weins IX, P. I. 293, 24–27, p. 50;<i>Luther and His Times,</i>p. 509; John M. Todd,<i>Martin Luther, A Biographical Study</i>[Westminster: The Newman Press, 1964], p. 188). Roger Williams came to the conclusion that there is<i>"</i>no regularly constituted Church on earth, nor any person authorized to administer any Church ordinances" (<i>Picturesque America,</i>p. 502). We believe that both America's freedom and the continuing reformation that flourished here occurred in preparation for the restoration from heaven of the full gospel of Jesus Christ. That restoration took place in the 1820s through a man named Joseph Smith. We believe that God and his son Jesus Christ appeared to the Prophet, who described his vision in these words, "I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other--<i>This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!"</i>(Joseph Smith 2:17). An important part of the Restoration was the return of the priesthood or the power of God. This was restored to Joseph by Peter, James, and John, who appeared as heavenly messengers and ordained Joseph Smith by the laying on of hands.<br><br>Another part of this Restoration was the revealing and translating of the record of the Book of Mormon. Joseph described the visit of Moroni, who also returned as a messenger, with these words: "He said there was a book deposited, written upon gold plates, giving an account of the former inhabitants of this continent. . . . He also said that the fulness of the everlasting Gospel was contained in it, as delivered by the Savior to the ancient inhabitants" (Joseph Smith 2:34). We believe that between the Book of Mormon and other things revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith the full and complete gospel of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ has been restored to the earth.<br><br>Now let us go to the last poster, I guess the most important to us, because the title of this poster is "America's Future." Today we are fortunate to live in a choice and promised land. It will remain free and blessed as long as we, its people, remember the God who gave us life and gave us this free land. We must remember that the family is the basic unit of a strong society. We are all part of God's family, and as our Father he expects us to build strong family units. It is in our families that the basic morality and righteousness can be taught that will keep America free. Each member of every family plays an important role in America. Throughout this land for several thousand years of history the great fathers and mothers, the noble sons, the patriot sons, the choice daughters, have forged America into what we have today.<br><br>It is America's conscience that has preserved her. America is beautiful only when she is good, when her children are laughing in her streets and her love abounds in her families. Without this conscience civilization crumbles, as it has before on this continent. We are all part of America's future. Our job is to remember the lessons of the past, to patch up mistakes and the sins of everything that has gone before. The place to start is within our own families, and as we have counseled, "No success can compensate for failure in the home." That's where we want to leave these people who come and have an opportunity of hearing our message, the most important message that will be taught during our Bicentennial year.<br><h2><b>America's Greatness Based on Righteousness</b></h2><br>The source of America's greatness is not a new doctrine to us. The Book of Mormon has declared over and over again that the blessings of heaven are contingent upon the righteousness of its people. In fact, this teaching has been attested to in almost every age. Remember in 1831 when the famous French historian Alexis de Tocqueville said:<br><br><i>I sought for the greatness and genius of America in her commodious harbors and her ample rivers, and it was not there; in her fertile fields and boundless prairies, and it was not there; in her rich mines and her vast world of commerce, and it was not there. Not until I went to the churches of America and heard her pulpits aflame with righteousness did I understand her genius and power. America is great because she is good. If America ever ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.</i><br><br>In summary, I have attempted to again remind you of<i>your</i>responsibility to preserve the righteousness of the land of America. I have reviewed four thousand years of history, declaring this to be a land of promise, chosen of the Lord for his special purposes. Now we must deal with America's future. America must continue to remain strong and great and good. It is destined to be the major supplier of human and financial resources, to build the kingdom of God here in the whole world, and to prepare the world for the return of the Lord and Savior. The adversary knows all too well that a weak America will literally stop this building process and thwart the work of God.<br><br>I hope I have painted a picture clear enough for you to see today your role in this great eternal process. The Lord is making his major investment in<i>you,</i>of all people on earth. In my dealings with the Lord I have found him to be one who expects performance, from the very beginning in supplying Adam and Eve with the potential to fulfill their needs. Remember his first command to them was to multiply, replenish, have dominion over, and subdue (see Genesis 1:28). They were not placed in the Garden of Eden just to have a comfortable life or to enjoy the benefits of the labors that he'd provided for them, but to accomplish, to do. He is the supplier of resources and, in turn, expects performance out of us. Is it not reasonable, knowing the history as we do of his dealings with mankind, to think that he would expect a special performance out of you because of the high investments he is presently making in you in your education here at this institution? I think he expects that of you because of that investment.<br><br>John Adams understood the potential of a righteous government when he wrote:<br><br><i>Suppose a nation in some distant region should take the Bible as their only law book and every member should regulate his conduct by the precepts there exhibited. Every member would be obligated in conscience to temperance and frugality and industry, to justice and kindness and charity toward his fellowmen, and to piety, love, and reverence toward Almighty God. In this commonwealth no man would impair his health with gluttony, drunkenness or lust. No man would sacrifice his precious time to cards or trifling with other mean amusements. No man would steal or lie or in any way defraud his neighbor, but would live in peace and goodwill toward all men. No man would blaspheme his Maker or profane his worship, but a rational and manly, a sincere and unaffected devotion would reign in the hearts of all men. What a utopia, what a paradise this region would be.</i>[<i>Diary and Autobiography of John Adams</i>(Cambridge, Mass.: The Belknap Press, 1961), vol. 1,<i>Diary 1755–1770</i>]<br><br>As I stand before you today, I want to issue you a challenge. I want you who are the best trained, the best educated, who have been given these great advantages here in America to literally become the conscience of America and the molders of its destiny and future. With your knowledge, your training, your understanding of how God works in the hearts of his children here on earth, may you obligate yourselves to temperance, to frugality, and to industry. Let us all show justice, kindness, and charity toward our fellowmen. Let us demonstrate the love and reverence we should exhibit toward our Almighty God. Let us not trifle with the things that are holy to God.<br><br>Fifty-six men represented 2.5 million in 1776 to bring about a new nation which has literally blessed the whole world. That was one man to every forty-five thousand, at that time. Today I'm calling on twenty-five thousand to exert an influence over about 250 million people in this land. The odds are even better for you. The advantage is on your side, for you only have one for every ten thousand. This is the time for you to be bold enough to stand up for what you believe, to let the world know that God still blesses this great land of America--if we will live righteously, according to that which he has commanded.<br><br>Will God bless us that we may have the courage to fulfill our responsibility here. I know by personal experience during these last two years that the heavens are still open, that he still does direct his work here. That message should ring from the hilltops to this nation during its Bicentennial. May you have the courage with me to stand up and be counted with those who would preserve this land of the free through the righteousness of its people, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>L.

<br>
<br>
I'm tempted to tell you a story. My wife would say that I shouldn't, but oftentimes introductions include statements that are inaccurate. A speaker at a Rotary Club was introduced as a man from Oklahoma who had just made $10,000 on a cattle deal. When he responded to the introduction, he said there were some inaccuracies: "It wasn't Oklahoma, it was Texas. It wasn't cattle, it was oil. It wasn't $10,000, it was $40,000. It wasn't me, it was my brother, and he didn't win it, he lost it!"<br><br>I'm honored to be here this night and to look out at this vast audience. My wife, Ruby, and I enjoyed the few months we spent at BYU and, of course, in this beautiful valley. As we were driving down this evening there was a haze hovering just below the peak of Timpanogos. I don't recall that we had ever seen it quite as beautiful as it appeared this evening. We could see the traditional image of the Indian maiden more clearly than ever before. We commented as we were driving along, "What a beautiful valley, what a great people, what a haven in which to live."<br><br>I stand at this pulpit, my dear friends, in deep humility. As the eventide settles over this peaceful valley, I reflect on my responsibilities and my desire to communicate to you some encouragement in your own personal lives. And I bring to you not an argument or a doubt, but a heavensent conviction I have that this is the Church of Jesus Christ, restored to the earth in these latter days, that God lives, that he's real, that he has flesh and bones just as you have and as I have. Jesus<i>is</i>the Christ, the Son of the living God. The story told by the Prophet Joseph Smith when he came out of that little grove of trees we affectionately refer to as the "Sacred Grove" is true; he did see God the Father, and the Son, as he reported, and the Church is led by a prophet of God today.<br><h2><b>Great Moments of Life</b></h2><br>Some events happen in our lives that are so overwhelming, yet are linked so clearly to divine power and influence, that however we feel at the time they happen in our lives--and they do or will happen to you, as they have happened to me--we feel so inadequate and unprepared. We see the hand of the Lord in so many ways in this Church, not the least being the calling and spiritual development of ordinary people like you and me. Someone has likened each of our lives to a mighty river as it flows into the sea. It is the product of many streams--some large, some small--and even brooks, created by the melting snow high in the mountains. I thank God for the streams, clear and pure, that have influenced my life: for the goodly parents who taught me the goodness of life--honor and virtue--and who taught me to love the Lord; for the small towns where we made our own fun and adventure; for my widowed mother, who always taught correct principles; for the priesthood and the scouting program; for the chance to go away to college and for the blessing of finding a girl I knew should be my companion. I saw her first at a dance at the Old Mill in a canyon east of Salt Lake. I remember the dress she was wearing. I remember how much fun she was having with her date. I was sitting there with someone else. As I watched this girl dancing by, I asked my date, "Do you know her?"<br><br>She said, "Yes."<br><br>I recall saying, "Why don't you introduce me to her?" Now that isn't the way you win friends and influence people!<br><br>I remember how hard I worked to get a date with her. I would phone her. She would have a date, and I would say, "What time is he coming?"<br><br>"Eight o'clock."<br><br>"How about seeing me at six?" I was determined, because I had a deep impression that this was the girl I should marry. I wanted to marry the right person in the right place. I remind all of you who are here that the most important decision you will make in your life is who you marry and where you marry that person. Never forget it. Never deemphasize it.<br><br>I have moved my wife and our family all over America. She still is beautiful and understanding--sustaining me, provoking me when needed, but always by my side. We are blessed with a lovely daughter and two fine sons, choice and wonderful daughters-in-law and a son-in-law, and with eighteen grandchildren. They're all perfect, we think.<br><br>When I was younger than most of you, growing up in a little town in Idaho, I thought the great moment of my life would be that I would be a successful baseball player for the New York Yankees. We would be in the World Series; the games would be three and three. Now, the seventh game--the deciding game--the ninth inning, score tied. And guess who would get up to bat? The pitcher would put the ball in just where I would like it, and I would knock it out of Yankee Stadium. The ball would become lost in the parking lot. I would be the hero of the World Series. I thought that would be the great moment of my life. But I want you to know that that isn't so. Not that the World Series happened; however, I found the moment.<br><br>A few years ago I sat in a little white room in the Los Angeles Temple--a little, plain, simple room with no fancy adornments on the wall. My wife was there by my side. One son and his wife were there along with our daughter and her new husband. Our other son was kneeling at the altar holding the hand of the young lady he was about to marry. As I looked around the room, I thought, "David, you had your priorities out of order. Some athletic event or being the hero of some worldly event isn't the great moment of your life." I knew the great moment of my life was there, then, because all I had that was really important--remember, really important--was in that room. Some bishops and stake presidents somewhere had found all of my family worthy to be in that room. It is not the number of cars you own, or the number of white-faced cattle you might have in the hills, or the size of your bank account, but the eternal values that count. You remember the Lord said something about moth and rust getting through to our worldly possessions (see Matthew 6:20). I knew that the greatest moment in my life was having all of our family in that room in the Los Angeles Temple. Moments, reflection, blessings--these are the great moments of our lives.<br><h2><b>A Witness of the Truth</b></h2><br>A few days ago I had the opportunity of being in a radio broadcasting studio in Melbourne, Australia. We were there with President Kimball, as you know, holding area conferences. I was to be interviewed for thirty minutes. As it turned out, Mr. Norman Banks, the radio personality, kept me for an hour. As we conversed and answered phone calls on the air about the Church, I felt again the great blessings and truths of this gospel. I would say to you, "Never doubt that this is the Lord's work. There are times or situations you are in when you know that the Lord blesses you." I didn't know we were going to have a "live" broadcast. I thought I would be interviewed "on tape" and have an opportunity to make corrections if necessary. Then I was informed we were going on the air live, that it was a talk show.<br><br>I know that, if we desire, the Lord will magnify us and bless us. I was impressed as this radio program got underway with the clarity of my mind and the calmness that came over me. We all felt the hand of the Lord. I had an opportunity to reply to questions that came in over the telephone: "What is a prophet?" "How is he appointed?" "Are you really an apostle?" "How were you selected?" "What special training or schooling have you had to be called a prophet?" "Why are all of you in Australia?" "Are you concerned what ministers say about your doctrine? You must know that they use some very strong language about you." "Are you carrying on a dialogue with any other church, hoping to merge with them?" "What do you hope to accomplish in Australia?"<br><br>The lights kept flashing on the switchboard as the calls came in. Ninety percent of them were the most positive, wonderful expressions you could imagine. "I've just been baptized. My whole life has changed. Thank you, thank you for bringing the Church to Australia," a voice said. Another voice: "We're now holding family home evening. Our family is now back together. Thank you for the Church and the prophet coming to Australia." The radio commentator caught the enthusiasm and the spirit of most of these callers, and when a caller wanted to take issue with me, the commentator said, "You've made your point, and you need to develop some love in your heart!" He was on my side! As these episodes were unfolding, I would wonder at times, "Am I saying, am I doing, what I should be? I'm now a special witness of the Lord."<br><h2><b>A Call to Serve</b></h2><br>I want you to know that I have grown up in the Church just as you have. I've gone through the steps and the challenges that you have and that you are going through. I understand your concerns, but I also have a concept of your opportunities.<br><br>Fifty-nine days ago today President Kimball phoned me at my office and requested me to meet him in the Salt Lake Temple. It was about two o'clock. I walked to the Temple wondering what I had done wrong. Did he plan to change my assignments or my responsibilities? Perhaps I wasn't measuring up to my calling. As we met on the fourth floor in the Temple, he had his usual warm greeting, which was reassuring to me. President Tanner and President Romney and the eleven were meeting in another room. President Kimball invited me into an empty room there on the fourth floor where we were alone--alone in this beautiful room in the House of the Lord with the Lord's prophet. After some inquiry about my life President Kimball took me by both of my hands and, looking deeply but kindly into my eyes (and, it seemed, right into my soul), he said he was calling me to fill the vacancy in the Quorum of the Twelve. I was overcome. I could hardly say a word. Words are inadequate to describe my feelings even as I stand here with you. There comes a swelling within that is indescribable. You think, "Me? Why is he calling me? How can I? There are so many that are more worthy. Such great men have been so honored."<br><br>With the two of us all alone, communicating with our hearts and our souls, the Lord's prophet calling me, I knew I was in the presence of the Lord's anointed. Alfred Lord Tennyson wrote that there are times "too full for sound and foam" ("Crossing the Bar," 1889). I understand what he was writing about. The prophet invited me to meet the other Brethren. As we walked across the hall and into the room where they were waiting, they were all so warm and friendly. It helped my feet get back on the floor. President Kimball said, "Do you want to call Ruby?" As I stood there in sort of a daze looking at the telephone, President Kimball jokingly said, "Do you remember your phone number?" I was having such a difficult time dialing, Elder Boyd Packer inquired, "Do you remember Ruby's name?" And then my Brethren, with their great warmth and understanding, assured me that they had all had the same experience. As Ruby answered the phone, she detected some strangeness in my voice. I'm sure it was a little unsteady, weak, and shaky. She said, "Where are you?"<br><br>I said, "I'm in the Temple."<br><br>She said, "What are you doing in the Temple?" Then I told her what had happened, and she began to cry.<br><br>All of you young men, and the rest of you, what would we do without loving, understanding companions? Be grateful for the Lord's plan. We understand that Mother Eve is a joint heir with Father Adam to the blessings of exaltation. That blessing is for all of you who are so married in the House of the Lord and are valiant to the end.<br><br>President Kimball, joined by all the Brethren of the First Presidency and the Quorum, placed his hands on my head. He ordained me to this calling with words I will always remember: "an apostle is entitled to the revelations of the Lord in very deed"; "we promise our lives, all of our efforts, our thoughts"; "keys, powers of the apostleship." I was reminded, "You are the eighty-second so chosen in this dispensation." I have been called to join the finest group of men on earth. There is no group of men like them anywhere.<br><h2><b>The Lord's Prophet, President Kimball</b></h2><br>I had a feeling, as I wondered what to say to you here this night, that you might appreciate this personal treasure of mine. I thought I would share it with you as I testify of my knowledge that <a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/speakers/spencer-w-kimball/"><span style="color: #33cccc;">President Kimball</span></a>, our prophet, is the mouthpiece of God on earth. The Lord says that he is to be like unto Moses--a seer, a revelator, a translator, and a prophet, having all the gifts of God which he bestows upon the head of the Church (see D&amp;amp;C 107:91–92).<br><br>Your hearts would have been caused to burn as did ours as we watched him preside over nine separate area conferences during the last few days, each with three general sessions and separate priesthood and mothers-and-daughters meetings. I feel blessed to have seen and felt the love the Saints have for him and his love for the people all over the world--in Samoa, New Zealand, Fiji, Tonga, and Tahiti; in Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane. The Saints expressed their love in their welcome for him, and then again throughout the meetings in their songs and testimonies. They had spent weeks and weeks in preparation. Streets, fences, and buildings were decorated with ferns, orchids, hibiscus, and coconut fronds. They had fasted and prayed that the rains would cease. The rain fell before and during the meeting. One day the rain fell exactly at ten o'clock. We were all inside and the meeting had started. We don't think a drop ever fell on the prophet. They had fasted and prayed.<br><br>Several hundred students lined the road to our school in Tonga, standing at attention, immaculately uniformed. Boy scouts formed honor guards; several hundred of our teenagers hired buses to take them to the Melbourne airport to greet the prophet. They had paid a dollar each. The plane was going to be twenty minutes late, and they were fearful that the bus couldn't wait and they would have to go back to the city. But the plane arrived in a few moments, and tears flowed as they had a chance to see him and to touch his hand. One of our group saw an excited five-year-old boy and asked, "Did you shake his hand?"<br><br>This little boy said, "No, but I saw him. Boy, did I see him!" The little boy handed this member of our party a little envelope and said, "Will you give this to the prophet?" When it was opened, here was a little hand drawn picture of President Kimball. Scrawled at the bottom was "Love, from Luke."<br><br>Heads of state, government leaders, and government ministers were all gracious in receiving the prophet and his party. I'm sure that missionary activity as well as Church participation will surely increase sharply after this visit by the prophet. You could feel the spiritual impact of his being there and the reaction in the cities, the people, the press, and those who visited or interviewed him.<br><br>Probably the highlight of the entire trip was the conference session Sunday morning televised to all of Australia from the beautiful Sydney Opera House. The three Sydney stakes prepared the choir, and their own local speakers were just superb. We were so proud of what they did. You would have thought the Tabernacle Choir was there, they did such a marvelous work. Then, even though the President was tired, he was abundantly blessed as he spoke to this nationwide audience, explaining and testifying of the truthfulness of the gospel. The prophet was testifying and explaining that to be a prophet of the Lord one does not need to be everything to all men. He does not need to be youthful and athletic, an industrialist, a financier, nor an agriculturist. He does not need to be a musician, a poet, an entertainer, nor a banker, a physician, nor a college president, a military general, nor a scientist. He does not need to be a linguist, to speak French, Japanese, German, and Spanish. But he must understand the divine language and be able to receive messages from heaven. He need not be an orator, for God can make his own. The Lord can present his divine message through weak men made strong. What the world needs is a prophet-leader who gives example, clean, full of faith, godlike in his attitude, with an untarnished name--a beloved husband, a true father.<br><br>We were so thrilled as he explained this to people who would say, "What is a prophet? Why do you have one? We don't have them, so why do you have them?" He told them that a prophet needs to be more than a priest or a minister or an elder. His voice becomes the voice of God to reveal new programs, new truths, new solutions. He made no claim of infallibility. He must be bold enough to speak truth, even against popular clamor for lessening restrictions. He must be certain of his divine appointment, of his celestial ordination, and of his authority to call to service, to ordain, to pass keys which fit eternal locks.<br><br>My dear friends, have no fear of Spencer W. Kimball not being in tune to receive God's instructions. The witness is mine that he is one of God's great prophets. I know not what may lie ahead, but of one thing I am certain: I am committed in every way to serve the Master, to testify of him, and to follow the direction of President Kimball as his spokesman.<br><h2><b>Obedience to Revelation</b></h2><br>The Lord wants and needs all of you to be strong, to be believers, to be an example of goodness to all the world. Mediocrity and weaklings come cheap. The world is full of them. As you plan your future and as you have doubts about big decisions, read what the prophet says. We sing a song, but I don't think we sing it often enough--"Come, listen to a prophet's voice, and hear the word of God." Listen to what the prophet says. Read what he says. Read everything you can get your hands on that he says. He will never lead you astray, and you won't go astray if you follow that direction. Live so you can ask for the revelation that you are entitled to personally.<br><br>I was at a stake conference a few weeks ago in Augusta, Maine. I heard from a sixteen-year-old girl who had been called to be a class leader--sixteen years old. She said she made a list of seventeen names for counselors. She prayed for help. The next day she crossed off three of them. After praying and asking the Lord for more help, two days later she said there were only two names left on the list. This young lady had had her own experience and testimony of personal revelation that you are entitled to.<br><br>Listen to those who have gone down the road ahead of you. Don't be classed with those of whom we say, "In one ear and out the other." Don't do that. Listen to those that have had some experience and have been down that road. Alexander Solzhenitsyn wrote, "Is it possible to transmit the experience of those who have suffered to those who have yet to suffer?" (<i>Reader's Digest,</i>December 1975, p. 69). Is it possible? Can one part of humanity learn from the bitter experience of another?<br><br>I leave my blessings with you, praying humbly for you to live the standards of the Church. I know you hear it often, but how are you doing with it? The scholarly Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, "Souls are not saved in bundles. The Spirit sayeth to the man, 'How is it with thee? thee personally?'" ("Conduct of life: Worship"). How<i>are</i>things with you personally, you--human, child of God, an important person, a member of the Church, family, children, future, vision of eternity? How are you doing? Come, listen to a prophet's voice, and hear the words of God.<br><br>Sister Haight and I were going through London a few weeks ago. From one of the London papers I cut out a little story in which the headmaster of one of the renowned prep schools in England (where Winston Churchill had gone to school as a boy) was telling a story about Churchill. Before he died they invited him, then in his old age but an experienced, great man with all of the background that he had had, to stand before the student body of this prep school. This was all that he had to say: "Never forsake the things that you know to be true. Never, never, never, never." May that blessing be yours. The gospel is true. This is the hope of the world. This gospel is the salvation of the human race, I testify to you in all humility, thanking you for this opportunity, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>David B.

<h1>to Be Leaders - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear fellow students, I presume I can qualify as a student. It is always a pleasing and an inspiring experience to come to the BYU campus and meet you wonderful faculty members and students.<br><h2><b>The Story of Karl G. Maeser</b></h2><br>It is an interesting coincidence that I should be asked to speak at this devotional when the Karl G. Maeser Awards are being given to honored faculty members. Just a month ago I was in Dresden, East Germany, which is behind the Iron Curtain, on an assignment to hold conferences with the Saints in East Germany. When Sister Richards and I arrived in Dresden the Church leaders asked me what relation I was to the Franklin D. Richards who had baptized Karl G. Maeser. When I informed them that I was a grandson, it seemed to please them very much. Karl G. Maeser is certainly revered in East Germany as well as here. While we were there we visited Meissen, a small town not far from Dresden, which was the birthplace of Karl G. Maeser. Incidentally, there is a plaque possibly two feet by three feet on the home where he was born, reciting his birth and other matters relating to this life, including his conversion to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and his subsequent activities in Utah.<br><br>Karl G. Maeser's conversion to Mormonism is a most interesting story. It is said that he read a book about the Mormons which interested him very much, whereupon he and Edward Schoenfeldt decided to see what more they could learn about the religion. A letter of inquiry written by Brother Maeser eventually reached my grandfather, Franklin D. Richards, who was at that time president of the European Mission with headquarters in Liverpool, England. Grandfather appointed an Elder William Budge, who knew German, to visit Dresden and act as a private instructor to the family of Professor Maeser inasmuch as there was no religious liberty in Saxony at that time. Elder Budge carried out his instructions, and soon the word reached Liverpool that several persons in Dresden were ready for baptism and desired to be organized into a branch. Later, when President Richards and an Elder Kimball set out for the continent, one of their objects was to attend to these matters. Accordingly, on the fourteenth of October, 1855, eight persons were baptized in the River Elbe, one of whom was Karl G. Maeser. On the following Sunday at the Maeser home they were confirmed and organized into a branch. The<i>LDS Biographical Encyclopedia</i>(page 708) relates the incident as follows:<br><br><i>On the night of October the fourteenth, 1855, the three elders (Franklin D. Richards, William Budge, and William H. Kimball), Dr. Maeser, Edward Schoenfeldt, and some others, repaired to the banks of the historic Elbe, in which river Dr. Maeser was baptized by Apostle Richards. It was the first baptism in Saxony in this dispensation. After performing the baptism the party started back toward the home of Dr. Maeser. The only elder who could talk German was William Budge, and the conversation was carried on between Apostle Richards and Dr. Maeser with Elder Budge acting as interpreter. The colloquy had not proceeded far, however, when Apostle Richards told Elder Budge that it was not necessary for him to interpret any more, as he and Brother Maeser could "understand each other perfectly." Brother Schoenfeldt relates that it was a very dark night, and when he first realized that the two men were conversing together with perfect facility, yet neither understood the native tongue of the other, his feelings were indescribable, for he knew that it was a divine manifestation.</i><br><br><i>Dr. Maeser in later years testified that when he emerged from the water he prayed that his faith might be confirmed by some manifestation from heaven, and he felt confident that his prayer would be answered.</i><br><br><i>Dr. Maeser came to Utah, taught school for many years in Salt Lake City, and then fulfilled a mission to his native land. He later became head of the Brigham Young Academy at Provo, which later became the Brigham Young University. Subsequently he was made general superintendent of Church schools and up to the date of his death continued to wield a wonderful influence for good over the young people of Zion.</i><br><br><i>At a banquet given in honor of a venerable educator in 1892, Apostle Richards, referring to the baptismal incident, said, "Brother Maeser, how blessed it was that the gift of tongues and interpretation was given to us. It always caused me joy. Brother Maeser did not know English, and I did not know German; but I could speak with him, and he with me. The Spirit wrought with us and filled us with faith."</i><br><br>Dr. Karl G. Maeser was an outstanding leader, and this great University since the time of Karl G. Maeser produced many leaders within Church, governmental, and business areas. It is indeed a pleasure and inspiration for me to address you, leaders of the future.<br><h2><b>Organizational Leadership</b></h2><br>Our complex society of today is built upon organization--governmental, religious, and social. This organization constantly requires more and more leaders, and this Church places great emphasis on the development of leaders. Leadership is the directing force of a movement and it is always coupled with opportunities--opportunities to serve. The dictionary defines opportunity as "a fit time, a favorable juncture of circumstances, a good chance." There is an old saying, "Opportunity knocks but once," but I do not believe this to be true. Opportunities are knocking every day for those who are prepared and willing to pay the price. However, you must develop the capacity to recognize them. I can already hear many of you asking, "How can I develop leadership capabilities?" Let me suggest three ways: number one, develop faith, courage, and determination; number two, develop the capacity to think straight; and number three, develop your talents. Let me discuss these three suggestions with you.<br><h2><b>Faith, Courage, Determination</b></h2><br>First, develop faith, courage, and determination. I am advised that President Henry D. Moyle told the British missionaries in 1959, "And I say that we can go out into the mission field, we can go out into the world, we can go into our lives and accomplish anything we desire to accomplish. Whenever the Lord calls upon us to do anything, he makes us equal to the task. The Lord bless us and give us the faith, the determination, and the courage. I love these words." I also love those words.<br><br>Do you believe that you can accomplish anything you desire to accomplish in righteousness? I do. But how? President Moyle says that faith is a requirement. In his<i>Lectures on Faith</i>the Prophet Joseph Smith said,<i>"</i>We ask then, what are we to understand by a man's working by faith? We answer, we understand that when a man works by faith he works by mental exertion instead of physical force" (Sixth Lecture, No. 3). Orson Pratt in his treatise on true faith said, "This is not an abstract principle, separate and distinct from the mind, but it is a certain condition or state of the mind itself." Effective faith does require mental exertion. And we must therefore learn to think and to think straight.<br><br>A leader must lead and not ask others to do things he is unwilling to do himself. A successful leader always rises above mediocrity. A leader is a great servant. The Savior expressed the ideal of leadership when he said, "And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant" (Matthew 20:27). A leader has faith in people. He believes in them and draws out the best in them. Inasmuch as the development of faith requires study, we are counseled to "seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118).<br><br>Eternal progress involves continual study. Learning develops confidence and courage, and these banish fear. I encourage you to never cease to study, this being a really important part of developing leadership capabilities. One of President Heber J. Grant's well-known sayings is "That which we try to do, and persist in doing, becomes easy to do, not because its nature is changed, but because our power to do is developed" (Josiah Gilbert Holland [Timothy Titcomb, pseud.],<i>Gold-Foil: Hammered from Popular Proverbs</i>[New York: Charles Scribner, 1859], 291). Again, perseverance assists in building faith, courage, and determination.<br><br>In developing faith we must never overlook the fact that we are spirit children of God the Eternal Father and that, as we do our part, our Father in heaven will bless us with courage and determination and assist us in obtaining our objectives.<br><br>As a mission president I emphasized to the missionaries the necessity of developing faith, determination, and courage. How successful I was is illustrated in the case of Elder Smith. Sister Richards and I met Elder Smith six years after he was released from his mission, and he told us the following story. He was seeking employment in a stock brokerage firm in Salt Lake and, after being interviewed in Salt Lake, was sent to the company's headquarters in San Francisco. In San Francisco there were two persons interviewing him, a young man and an older man with a big cigar in his mouth. The older man, who seemed to be the one with the authority, told Elder Smith he understood that he had been on a mission for his church. Elder Smith said he had. The man then asked, "What kind of a missionary were you?"<br><br>Elder Smith answered, "The best missionary in the mission."<br><br>The man was so startled by this forthright answer he almost dropped his cigar. He said, "If you were the best missionary in the mission, you're hired right now." Elder Smith had learned to apply the principles of faith, courage, and determination in his life.<br><h2><b>Ability to Think Straight</b></h2><br>Now I would like to speak with reference to developing the capacity to think straight. IBM, one of the largest and most successful U.S. corporations, has adopted the motto "Think" and uses it throughout the whole organization. House organs and individual signs on desks and walls say "Think." IBM recognized that thinking straight is a key to leadership ingenuity.<br><br>I recall that when I was studying law our dean used to tell us he didn't care whether we remembered the principles of law he was teaching us, but he wanted us to learn to think straight. To do this we learned that it was necessary to get the facts before reaching conclusions. He also impressed upon us the necessity of analyzing the facts from all angles in order to make sound decisions. I suggest that you learn to enjoy making decisions and get in the habit of living with your decisions. Reconsideration of a decision should only occur when additional, pertinent information is later available.<br><br>One of our real problems is finding the time to think. Richard L. Evans, in one of his sermonettes, said:<br><br><i>Always there is less time left--a fact that we sometimes face with feelings of frustration because we are so busy--too busy, sometimes, to think enough about what we are busy about. Could it be that we have enslaved ourselves somewhat with many unessentials? Can we avoid letting unessentials enslave us? Can we resolve to seek somewhat to</i>simplify<i>and to make a new appraisal of what we really consider essential--with a little more living, a little less of mere mechanics, a little less time on the treadmill, a little less of meaningless motions?</i><br><br>I am convinced that by simplifying our day-to-day activities we can find time to meditate. As an administrator in government, as an executive in business, as a mission president, and as supervisor of Church activities, I have found it necessary and practical to set aside time to think or meditate. Think about your problem. What are the various aspects of it? What can you do to meet it or to solve it?<br><br>I suggest that if at all possible you plan your time so that you can have a regular time to meditate and think. How much time? Well, this depends on your specific situation. President David O. McKay put it this way: "Don't be too busy to meditate, and when the answer comes, have the courage to follow it."<br><br>As you meditate I suggest you keep an open mind. In keeping an open mind you will not restrict your thinking. Many times you might want the Lord to give you the answer to your problems, but you must remember that you have your free agency, and your responsibility is to make decisions. In the ninth section of the Doctrine and Covenants the word of the Lord was given through the Prophet Joseph Smith to Oliver Cowdery with reference to his problems of translating. The Lord told Oliver Cowdery to study it out in his own mind, reach a decision, and then ask the Lord if the decision was right. And if it was right, he would receive a burning of his bosom. But if it was not right he would have no such feeling but would receive a stupor of thought.<br><br>This section of the Doctrine and Covenants describes a pattern that all of us can follow. We must study our problems out in our own minds, reach a decision, and ask the Lord to approve or disapprove. Then if we follow the whisperings of the Spirit, we will do what is right. These suggestions as followed will help you in developing the capacity to think straight, and this will greatly increase your leadership capabilities.<br><h2><b>Development of Talents</b></h2><br>Now I should like to refer to the third step, the development of your talents. Do you know what your talents are and how far they have been developed? During his earthly ministry the Savior gave the parable of the entrusted talents, dealing with the requirement that we develop the talents we are endowed with. The talent was an ancient weight and money unit. The dictionary defines talent as "the abilities, powers, and gifts bestowed upon a man, natural endowments thought of as a divine trust, a natural capacity, or gift." In the parable of the entrusted talents the Savior told of a man who was about to leave on a long trip. He therefore called his servants together and gave them his goods. To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one. To each he gave according to his ability. While the master was away, the one that received the five talents put them to use and made five more talents. The one that received two talents put them to use and made two more. But the one that received one talent hid it in the ground. After a period the master returned and asked for an accounting. Unto the servants that had doubled their talents, the Savior said, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: Enter thou into the joy of thy lord." The Savior called the servant who had hidden his talent and had not multiplied it a "slothful servant" and said he would take the one talent from him and give it to the servant who had ten talents (see Matthew 25:14–28). From the man endowed with many talents, more is expected than from the man with lesser talents; yet all were expected to multiply such talents as they were given. However, although relatively little was expected of the man given one talent, he failed to use this talent. Good use of the talent on the part of the man given one talent was just as important and necessary as on the part of the men given two and five talents.<br><br>In this dispensation the Lord has been equally direct in his charge to us. He has told us that he has given us many things "for the benefit of the church of the living God, that every man may improve upon his talent, that every man may gain other talents, yea, even an hundred fold" (D&amp;amp;C 82:18). He also admonished us that of him to whom much is given much is required:<br><br><i>But with some I am not well pleased, for they will not open their mouths, but they hide the talent which I have given unto them, because of the fear of men. Wo unto such, for mine anger is kindled against them.</i><br><br><i>And it shall come to pass, if they are not more faithful unto me, it shall be taken away, even that which they have. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Thou shalt not idle away thy time, neither shalt thou bury thy talent that it may not be known.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 60:2–3, 13]<br><br>The Savior evidenced little regard for the slothful servant. He expects us all to work. These scriptures clearly emphasize our obligations to use and develop the gifts and talents we have been blessed with--shall we say, to develop the spark of divinity that is within us? We all have talents to a more or less degree. Often we find greater happiness in doing the things we have a special talent for. If it is not practical to use these gifts as a vocation, perhaps they will bring joy as an avocation. First we should recognize our talents and make up our minds to pay the price necessary to develop them.<br><br>Many times we fail to recognize our talents. A teacher had finished giving a lesson on the subject of talents. She had explained that the scriptures tell us everyone is blessed with special gifts or talents. This teacher played the piano beautifully, and a member of the class came to her and said, "Your gift is so obvious. I just can't think of any particular talent that I have."<br><br>The teacher answered, "When you speak of my talent as being obvious, you're no doubt thinking of my ability to play the piano. This is not my<i>greatest</i>talent. My faith is my greatest talent or gift."<br><br>The member paused for a few moments and then said, "I have great faith too. I have never thought of it as a talent, but it really is, isn't it?"<br><br>Each of us should be encouraged about how to best develop our gifts and our talents. The price to be paid in developing talents certainly includes persistence. I cannot emphasize too greatly the necessity of persistence. The world is filled with talented people who gave up, especially when the going was rough. We should appreciate that talents are developed by use, and they will not grow and multiply unless they are used. Some recognize their talents; but, we are told, they do not use them because of the fear of men. Fear destroys faith and deprives us of many blessings. This is certainly brought out in the revelation when the Lord said, "Ye endeavored to believe that ye should receive the blessing which was offered unto you; but behold, verily I say unto you there were fears in your hearts, and verily this is the reason that ye did not receive" (D&amp;amp;C 67:3). We must therefore overcome fear. The Lord has told us that if we are prepared we shall not fear.<br><br>One of the important and distinguishing features of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is that its affairs are administered by the lay members of the Church rather than by a paid clergy. I have been told by some of my nonmember friends that the thing that has impressed them most about the Church is that it gives every person a chance to serve and to develop leadership capabilities, regardless of his age. How true this is.<br><br>As we develop our talents, we should develop the spirit of sharing or giving--not only with those who are closest to us, but also with all of God's children. Remember the words of King Benjamin, "When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God" (Mosiah 2:17). The Lord wants us to enjoy our talents. But he also expects us to use them for the enjoyment and benefit of others and to build the kingdom of God. Talents may be developed in many church activities, such as teaching, speaking, missionary work, music, drama, dancing, athletics of all kinds, scout work, genealogical and temple work, welfare programs, compassionate service, and many other fields that might be mentioned--all contributing to the development of leadership capabilities.<br><br>Sometimes we may think that we have too many opportunities to serve and develop our talents and feel too much of a sacrifice is required. Let me suggest, however, that we do not consider it as a sacrifice but as a great blessing. Each activity that we participate in provides experience whereby we may improve our talents, thus contributing to our goal of effective leadership. As we develop the spirit of giving and sharing, we find great peace, happiness, joy, and contentment as well as growth and development. May I therefore encourage you to accept every opportunity presented to you to serve with enthusiasm, not as a burden but as a great blessing. I know this, that as you develop your talents and persist, your leadership abilities will be magnified and your talents will increase, yea, even an hundred fold. As you are given positions of leadership in the Church, business, professional, and civic areas, remember to seek first the kingdom of God. As our Heavenly Father has promised, then all else will be added unto you.<br><br>In summary, I feel that all of you are interested in developing your leadership capabilities and in assuming positions of leadership. As you increase your faith, courage, and determination, develop your talents and capacity to think straight, your leadership is bound to be more effective and meaningful. Effective leadership opens the door to more effective ways of doing things. Again, this invariably means greater success, and greater success means more joy and happiness and growth and development. Despite the fact that we are living in a troublesome period, we are living in the dispensation of the fulness of times--a most wonderful period in the history of the world--yes, in a new era of growth and development. Opportunities today for young and old exceed those of any other age. We should be grateful to live at this particular time when the Spirit of the Lord is being poured out upon the people of the earth so abundantly.<br><br>I bear you my testimony that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ, that the gospel of Jesus Christ in its fulness has not only been restored in this latter day through the Prophet Joseph Smith but that the power to act in the name of God has also been restored, and that there is a prophet of God with us today, our beloved President Spencer W. Kimball. May the Lord bless and sustain him and may the choice blessings of our Father in heaven be with you, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Franklin D.

<h1>re Getting Better: Missionary Work and Cultural Barriers - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My beloved brethren and sisters, my dear friends, it is a great privilege and a frightening experience to be here. You scare me just a little. You expect something, and I feel a great sense of inadequacy to give you that which you hope for. But I give you testimony, and I hope I speak out of faith and trust that the Lord will help me.<br><br>I have been assigned a subject. I always have difficulty when I am assigned a subject. In fact, I always have difficulty. The subject assigned me comes out of a symposium held on this campus with people from many parts of the world concerning the expanding Church and the problems it must meet as it moves against various cultures across the world. My assigned subject is "The Expanding Church among the Nations and Cultures of Man." I have simplified that to read: "Things Are Getting Better."<br><br>We, of course, all recognize the mandate laid upon the Church by the Lord himself. It is a mandate we cannot dodge and one from which we cannot shrink. That mandate is to teach the gospel to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. This was the final charge given by the Lord following his resurrection and before his ascension. It was repeated with the opening of this dispensation.<br><h2><b>Missionary Efforts Early in This Dispensation</b></h2><br>Following the organization of the first Council of the Twelve in this dispensation, Oliver Cowdery, then a counselor in the First Presidency, delivered a charge to those men who had been selected for this sacred office. I should like to give you some of the words he spoke on that occasion:<br><br><i>You are called to preach the gospel of the Son of God to the nations of the earth. It is the will of your Heavenly Father that you proclaim his gospel to the ends of the earth and the islands of the sea.</i><br><br><i>Be zealous to save souls. The soul of one man is as precious as the soul of another. You are to bear this message to those who consider themselves wise, and such may persecute you. They may seek your life. The adversary has always sought the life of the servants of God; you are, therefore, to be prepared at all times to make a sacrifice of your lives, should God require them in the advancement and building up of his cause....</i><br><br><i>The time is near when you will be in the midst of congregations who will gnash their teeth upon you. The gospel must roll forth, and it will until it fills the whole earth....</i><br><br><i>You have a work to do that no other men can do. You must proclaim the gospel in its simplicity and purity; and we commend you to God and the word of his grace.</i>[<i>Documentary History of the Church</i>, 2:196–98]<br><br>Subsequent to that charge, the Lord delivered the revelation known as section 112 of the Doctrine and Covenants, which was a revelation to the first Council of the Twelve. In it are found these words:<br><br><i>Contend thou, therefore, morning by morning; and day after day let thy warning voice go forth; and when the night cometh let not the inhabitants of the earth slumber, because of thy speech....</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, whithersoever they shall send you, go ye, and I will be with you; and in whatsoever place ye shall proclaim my name an effectual door shall be opened unto you, that they may receive my word.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 112:5, 19]<br><br>In accordance with that charge, missionaries were sent into the surrounding areas, into Canada, and in 1837 across the sea to England.<br><br>It was in the Kirtland Temple during troubled days for the Church that the Prophet Joseph Smith approached Heber C. Kimball and said, "Brother Heber, the Spirit of the Lord has whispered to me, 'Let my servant Heber go to England and proclaim my Gospel, and open the door of salvation to that nation.'"<br><br>I am not surprised that some sense of fear came over him. He said to himself, "O, Lord, I am a man of stammering tongue and altogether unfit for such a work. How can I go to preach in that land which is so famed throughout Christendom of learning, knowledge, and piety, the nursery of religion, and to a people whose intelligence is proverbial?" (<i>Life of Heber C. Kimball</i>, p. 104).<br><br>But he and his associates went. While the language was essentially the same as their own, many of the customs they met were different. They paid little attention to these. Their message was the gospel of salvation, and they spoke of little else. History bears remarkable testimony to the success of their labors.<br><br>In the years that followed, the work was taken to the isles of the sea, where other unique and different cultures were encountered. It was so in the lands of Europe, with new languages to be learned and new customs to be confronted. After the Saints moved west, even though they were faced with the tremendous tasks of subduing the wilderness and building a commonwealth, they never slackened their efforts to carry the gospel to the nations of the earth. For many of those years there were two great processions moving across the plains: one in the direction of these mountain valleys, bringing converts from the lands of Europe to settle here; and another of missionaries eastward bound to go into the lands of Europe to bear witness to the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>In the general conference held in 1852, men were called from the congregation to go not only to Europe, but also to China, Siam, India, and the islands of the Pacific. It is interesting to note that in those early pioneering days we had more missionary activity in India than we have today. I marvel at the boldness--rather, I should characterize it as the faith--of the leaders and the membership of this Church in that pioneering era to stretch the relatively small membership and the thin resources of this people so far in carrying the message of the gospel to distant lands.<br><br>One cannot read Parley P. Pratt's account of his travels to the islands of the Pacific and then down to Valparaiso on the west coast of South America in Chile without recognizing with gratitude the courage and the faith of those of early days, who took with seriousness the charge to carry the gospel to the nations of the world. You and I, my brethren and sisters, who sit here in comfort this night are the beneficiaries of their faithful service; for our forebears, those of many of us, heard the gospel in those lands and emigrated to these valleys.<br><br>The long journeys across the seas were made under extremely adverse circumstances, many of them in sailing vessels. When those missionaries stepped ashore, there was neither friend nor companion to meet them. They had no briefing concerning the conditions they were to meet, no knowledge of the languages of the people among whom they were to labor. Many of them sickened as their bodies struggled to adapt to the food and other strange circumstances of living. But again they were possessed with a sense of mission driven by a charge to take the gospel of salvation to the peoples of the earth. I should like to suggest to you that this great effort has been one of the remarkable miracles of our time.<br><br>It has been my privilege to visit and in most instances to work in nearly all of the places where our missionaries have served. My own mission was to the British Isles. I have had the responsibility for two or three years for the work in Europe, for three years for the work in South America, and for nine years for the work in the Far East. In accumulated time I have lived for more than three years in Asia. I have recently returned from visiting in Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, and Singapore. In a few days we shall go again to Japan, thence to Taiwan, the Philippines, and Hong Kong. I am at least superficially acquainted with some of the problems encountered by our missionaries incident to our carrying out the program of the Church where there are marked differences between our culture and the cultures of the people of those lands. But I feel these differences are of minor importance in comparison with the great burden of our responsibility to teach the gospel of the Master and that alone.<br><h2><b>Shrinking Cultural Barriers in Modern Missionary Work</b></h2><br>I should also like to suggest that in comparison to the problems encountered and dealt with by those early men of great faith, ours are of relatively small significance. Hence the title I have given this talk: "Things Are Getting Better." There are many reasons for this. We ought to be doing better than we are doing. In the first place, we live in a rapidly shrinking world. Weeks and even months were once required to travel across the Pacific; today we board a luxurious 747 aircraft in San Francisco at nine o'clock in the evening, and nine or ten hours later we pass through immigration and customs formalities in Tokyo, having enjoyed a good meal en route. We cannot dismiss lightly the importance of the vast traffic constantly crossing the trade routes of the world and the sublimating effects of such intercourse among nations insofar as cultural differences are concerned.<br><br>Secondly, as the educational level rises throughout the world, there is a concomitant factor of greater understanding of the ways and customs of other people. There is so much of information now available to anyone who wants to visit a foreign land that he need not go in ignorance of what he will find there. International newscasting of the great news services of the world has brought Peking into our living room. We are made almost instantly aware of happenings in New Delhi in almost as great detail as events reported from New York.<br><br>The third factor is increasing knowledge of languages among the peoples of the earth. One of the great opportunities given our missionaries is that of teaching English in foreign lands, especially in the lands of Asia, where people hunger for a knowledge of this language. A giant step forward in facilitating the teaching of the gospel in other lands is the establishment and enlargement of the Language Training Mission. The great facility which is being constructed here will be, when completed, without equal anywhere in the world. This facility should make for an improvement of an already outstanding program which makes it possible for our missionaries to arrive in the field ready to go to work immediately, able to converse in the languages of the people and with some acquaintance of their cultures. President Kimball told us the other day of sitting next to the American ambassador in Finland. The ambassador, speaking of the Finnish language, said, "There are only two groups of people who can learn this difficult language--babies and Mormon missionaries."<br><br>Another factor which substantially diminishes the culture shock the missionaries might experience is the men we have presiding over the missions of the world. This is a great corps of selected, able, faithful leaders, who almost without exception have served in their younger years as missionaries in the places in which they now preside. They are not novices; they are men of broad experience and tremendous understanding of the land, the people, the cultural elements, and the languages. They stand as fathers to the young men and women who serve under them.<br><br>Finally, I might mention the tremendous erosion of strong cultural patterns in many parts of the earth. Insofar as I am concerned, the people in the lands of Asia to me look little different from and act just as people do everywhere else. They dress much the same; they have the same interests; they have the same capabilities. People are essentially the same everywhere, all over the earth. Husbands love wives, and wives love husbands. Parents love children. An appreciation for beauty in whatever form it may take is found among people everywhere. They also have a concern with suffering, the ever-present conscience, the sense of right and wrong, and the universal recognition of a higher power to whom men may appeal for help, who sits in judgment upon us, and to whom, someday, each of us must make an accounting.<br><br>Years ago I was asked whether we use a different set of lessons in the Orient from those used in the so-called Christian countries. I responded that we use the same lessons because we teach the same kind of people, whose hearts are touched by the same eternal truths. I stated further that the people of Asia are the children of God as certainly as are the people of America. Because we all come of the same parentage, we all respond in the same way to the same truths. The fact that a man's skin may be of a slightly different shade, the fact that his eyes may have a slightly different set, and the fact that he may wear a different type of clothing do not in any sense make of him a different kind of individual. Men the world over respond in the same way. They seek warmth when they are cold, they all know the same kinds of pain, they experience sadness, and they know joy. Everywhere they look to a superior power.<br><br>I remember talking to a missionary in Korea who said, "When I came here it was winter, and I had a terrible time. I felt no love for the land and could feel no love for the people. One day I was walking down the street through a storm, and I saw a woman trying to seek a little shelter next to a building. She was thin, emaciated, and hungry, and she held in her arms an emaciated and hungry baby. I heard that child cry, and I knew that these were my people."<br><h2><b>Missionary Success Aided by the Spirit of the Lord</b></h2><br>The Spirit of the Lord will overcome the effect of any differences in culture or other situations between a missionary and those he teaches. The Lord himself made the process clear when he asked:<br><br><i>Wherefore, I the Lord ask you this question--unto what were ye ordained?</i><br><br><i>To preach my gospel by the Spirit, even the Comforter which was sent forth to teach the truth....</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, he that preacheth</i>[by the Spirit]<i>and he that receiveth</i>[by the Spirit],<i>understand one another, and both are edified and rejoice together.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 50:13–14, 22]<br><br>I am satisfied, my brethren and sisters, that the Spirit of the Lord is the means of communication available to us in crossing any bridge between us and those of the world. We have all seen it in certain missionaries; occasionally, some of us have felt it ourselves in a modest measure. On such occasions all superficial differences between us and those we teach seem to fall like scales from our eyes. A warmth of kinship and understanding emerges which is marvelous to behold. We understand one another; we are edified; we rejoice together.<br><br>Truly we are engaged in a marvelous work and a wonder. We now have some 134 missions in the Church and 23,000 missionaries in the field--and that number is constantly growing. From very small and feeble and weak beginnings we have gone over the lands of North, Central, and South America; all the lands this side of the Iron Curtain in Europe; the islands of the Pacific; and for the most part among the non-Communist nations of Asia. The results have been marvelous to behold. Regardless of the nation in which they are found, our people speak with the same voice and bear testimony of the same eternal truths with the same fervency of spirit. The cost has been terrible in terms of sacrifice, devotion, and labor, but the results are a miracle to witness.<br><br>It was my privilege and opportunity to open the missionary work in the Philippines. At 6:30 on a May morning in 1961 we met in the American military cemetery because we had no other place to meet. We sang hymns together and asked the blessings of the Lord upon that which we were about to begin. We had found one native Filipino member of the Church. He gave us his testimony of this work on that occasion. He was the only member of record then. But when we were there last August, fourteen years later, a great area conference was held. In the vast Arenetta coliseum, beneath that great roof, there were assembled some eighteen thousand members of the Church. It<i>is</i>a miracle, and it is found in many lands, with many people.<br><br>Now even greater challenges lie ahead for the future. One cannot think of the 700 millions of mainland China, the 500 or 600 millions of the subcontinent of India, the vast populations of Russia and the Middle East without wondering how it can ever be accomplished. It will be accomplished, for the Lord has given us a mandate. If we will put forth our efforts, he will open the way. The task seems formidable, but who, fifty years ago or even twenty-five years ago, would have dared to think that in 1976 we would have eleven missions and twenty-nine stakes in the islands and lands of the South Pacific; eighteen missions and twenty-two stakes in South America; in Mexico and Central America nine missions and twenty-one stakes; in the lands of Asia fifteen missions and seven stakes? The God of heaven has brought to pass this miracle, and what we have seen is but a foretaste of greater things to come.<br><br>The work will be accomplished by humble men and women, most of them young, largely inexperienced, limited in their academic learning, who will go because they are called by the spirit of revelation. They will respond, believing in the word of the Lord, who said:<br><br><i>And any man that shall go and preach this gospel of the kingdom, and fail not to continue faithful in all things, shall not be weary in mind, neither darkened, neither in body, limb, nor joint; and a hair of his head shall not fall to the ground unnoticed. And they shall not go hungry, neither athirst.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:80]<br><br>They will go, relying on the promise of the Lord, who further said:<br><br><i>And whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up....</i><br><br><i>Let him trust in me and he shall not be confounded.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:88, 116]<br><br>With the charge divinely given, with blessings divinely promised, we shall go forward, my brethren and sisters, and the Lord will open the way before us. The small stone cut out of the mountain without hands will continue to roll forth until it has filled the whole earth. I give you my witness of the truth of these things. I bear you my solemn testimony that God our Eternal Father lives and that Jesus Christ stands at the head of this Church, directing this work. It is his work that we do; with his blessings we shall not fail. Notwithstanding obstacles that will be raised in our way, God help us to be true to the great and sacred trust which has been reposed in us, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Gordon B.

<h1>tion: a Sign of Maturity - Marvin J. Ashton - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
President Oaks, students, faculty members, leaders of this great administration, and special guests, I appreciate very much the opportunity of being with you today and having this association. I would like to emphasize the word<i>appreciate</i>because I hope to draw your attention to that vital subject as we go forward.<br><br>As I look at these missionaries visiting with us today from the Language Training Mission and at the thousands of returned missionaries in this devotional, together with others who are prospective missionaries, I am reminded of an experience I had the other evening that Sister Ashton instigated. She was tending our four-year-old grandson, and it came time for him to retire. Sister Ashton escorted him into my study and said, "Michael, would you like your grandfather to help you with your prayers before you go to bed?"<br><br>I think he said, "Yeah." So he came over and knelt at my knees. All of a sudden I realized that this was an experience I had not had for a long time. As he knelt I said, "Would you like to say your prayers by yourself or have me help you?"<br><br>He said, "You help me."<br><br>We proceeded, and I said, "Heavenly Father."<br><br>"Heavenly Father."<br><br>"Bless Mommy."<br><br>"Bless Mommy."<br><br>"Bless Daddy."<br><br>"Bless Daddy."<br><br>"Help me to be a good boy."<br><br>"Help me to be a good boy."<br><br>"Help me to grow up to be a missionary." No answer.<br><br>"Help me to grow up to be a missionary."<br><br>No answer.<br><br>"Help me to grow up to be a missionary."<br><br>He raised his head, opened his eyes, looked at me, and said. "Okay, I will." He had wanted to think that one over, as I hope all of us will before we accept.<br><h2><b>Feeling Gratitude and Appreciation</b></h2><br>Appreciation for people and events that come into our lives is most important because it is God's way of helping us to grow. May I say to all of you missionaries, returned missionaries, students, and others within the sound of my voice, that the ultimate in maturity is being able to feel and express appreciation, being fully aware of value and importance, and showing gratitude for it. During the past six months I have had the opportunity of visiting approximately 10 percent of all of the full-time missionaries we have out in the world--missionaries in Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, England, Holland, northern California, and Hawaii. I think we have associated with approximately twenty-four hundred.<br><br>While conducting personal interviews and participating in testimony meetings and visiting with missionaries and taking part in proselyting and leadership responsibility discussions, I have learned much.<br><br>I would like to say with full emphasis and conviction that the most mature missionaries I have met presently serving or having returned are those who have learned to keep the commandments and who also have become able to feel and express appreciation.<br><br>How does God feel about appreciation? From the Doctrine and Covenants I share this: "And in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his commandments" (D&amp;amp;C 59:21).<br><br>This morning, as indicated, I would like to speak to the first part of that scripture. Would you like to have God's wrath raised against you? Would you like to have God mad at you? It can come and it will happen if we fail to show appreciation and gratitude. Why does the lack of appreciation offend God and kindle his wrath? Not because he needs to see and hear our appreciation and gratitude, but because he knows an absence of appreciation on the part of anyone causes personal stagnation. Our growth and our progress are delayed when we fail to feel and express appreciation. May we think for a few moments about occasions and situations where we actually say, "Thank thee, God, for people and events that have come into our lives that have made it possible for us to develop and grow and mature, for all people, for all conditions, and for all circumstances when we are allowed to appreciate human beings and situations for what they can do and will mean to us."<br><h2><b>Showing Tolerance</b></h2><br>Let me share a recent experience. As I have indicated, we have done a lot of traveling the last six months. As we travel we take a lot of airplane rides under all conditions, where we have an opportunity of mingling and meeting with people and sharing events that are new. Horizons open up for us to grow and develop if we will use them properly. I am thankful for this experience that I will share with you this morning. It gave me an opportunity to practice and to learn tolerance and appreciation.<br><br>Returning from an assignment in the Los Angeles area recently, I boarded a plane and took the only remaining seat on the aisle, front row, in the nonsmoking section. I sat down, fastened my belt, and the plane was soon taxiing out for takeoff. After we had reached a certain altitude, the sign went off and we were allowed to unfasten seat belts. The general overhead no-smoking sign was removed. Still being seated in the no-smoking section, I noticed when the signal went off that the woman seated next to me opened her purse, took out a cigarette, lit it, and was in the process of smoking. I looked up at her and looked at the sign overhead which said, "No-smoking Section." Immediately the thought came to me, "Perhaps I could bump her in the ribs and say, 'Can't you read? Can't you see where you are?'" Then, on second thought, it came to me that perhaps she thought I needed a little bit of it too, so I allowed her to finish that one and hoped that would be the end. But as soon as that was out, she lit another one. While I was trying to read and appear to be not too disturbed, I was boiling just a little bit because my rights and privileges were being abused by someone next to me. It went on and on until we arrived in Salt Lake City. I think because I was so annoyed I kept track of how often she smoked. She had eight cigarettes between Los Angeles and Salt Lake. We had no conversation of any significance except, "Isn't it nice on the plane?" Once in a while it was a little bumpy, and we exchanged that thought. I hadn't used the opportunity to be much of a missionary; I spent my time being annoyed and thinking how much right I had to tell her to stop smoking. Finally, as we were making an approach to land in Salt Lake, she leaned over to me and said, "I hope we have a soft landing."<br><br>And so I said, "Any particular reason why you would like us to have a soft landing?"<br><br>She said, "Yes, under the seat I have some china items that I am bringing to Salt Lake City for my daughter's trousseau." She said, "My daughter is being married tomorrow." (This was on a Sunday.)<br><br>I said, "Where is your daughter being married?"<br><br>She said, "In the Mormon Tabernacle."<br><br>I said, "Oh, are you going to the Mormon Tabernacle to see your daughter married?"<br><br>She said, "No, I can't go to the Mormon Tabernacle because I am not a member of the Mormon Church."<br><br>I said, "Oh, how long has your daughter been a member of the Church?"<br><br>She said, "About two years. She was attending the University of Utah and became acquainted with the Church and was baptized about two years ago."<br><br>I said, "Who is your daughter marrying?"<br><br>"A returned Mormon minister."<br><br>(For you missionaries listening in, this is not what they tell you on page 17 about how to give the lessons or how to approach people, but this was my way of doing it on this occasion.)<br><br>About this time we had landed, the plane had come to a stop, the gates had been opened, and the runway was prepared for our departure. As we made our way down, being the first ones on the front row, I followed her down the steps. We opened the door and went into the departure gate. Two good-looking young people, a handsome young man and a beautiful young woman, ran up. The girl greeted her mother with open arms and hugged her. Then she looked past her mother, saw me, and said, "Oh, Mother, I would like you to meet Elder Ashton, one of the apostles of our Church." About then the thought crossed my mind, "Why, I had the right to bump her in the ribs and say, 'Can't you see? Can't you read? Can't you understand you're violating my rights?'" I would like to just indicate this morning that I appreciate the fact that for once I was tolerant and able to learn and understand from a person who sat next to me--someone whom I could possibly have abused verbally because I had the right to.<br><br>As we walked out of the terminal together, just the four of us--the mother, the daughter, the prospective son-in-law, and I--I said to this young couple, "Congratulations on being married in the Mormon Tabernacle." The girl smiled, "Who told you that?"<br><br>I said, "Your mom."<br><br>She said, "Mom, you misunderstood. I'm being married in the temple."<br><br>Her mother said, "What's the difference?" For the next three or four minutes I heard a daughter tell her mother the difference between a tabernacle marriage and a temple marriage. How proud I was of her, the way she was able to explain to her mother where she was being married, not on the tabernacle grounds, but in the temple for time and all eternity. I walked out very pleased for that experience of having an opportunity to learn and possibly teach tolerance and to appreciate people more fully.<br><h2><b>Appreciation in the Mission Field</b></h2><br>As we visit with the missionaries, we ask them to stand up and tell us where they are from, bear their testimonies, and tell us about their companions and their parents. This is a great experience in learning about them and about what their thought processes are and what their senses of values are.<br><br>May I share for our edification this morning some of the comments to which I have paid particular note as they relate to what I would like to impress you with this morning. I recall a missionary standing up and saying, "I have been in the mission field nine months, and I have had five companions." With a quivering chin and a choked-up voice, he said, "Never once in nine months have I had a companion who told me he loved me or appreciated what I was doing for him. I hope and pray that someday, somehow, I'll have a companion who will tell me that he loves me and appreciates me."<br><br>No matter where we come from, my fellow students, no matter what family conditions are, we should learn and be appreciative of those circumstances which can build and lift us.<br><br>I recall one missionary who stood up and said, with a great deal of pride, "I'm Elder So-and-so from Bloomington, Idaho, population one hundred." He said it with so much sincerity and pride that some of the more boastful ones from Texas quieted down and didn't say so much after that.<br><br>I'm thinking of another missionary, who said, "Two weeks before I was going to see my bishop and tell him I was ready to go in the mission field, I had some doubts. I had some questions about the future and even about the Church. I walked into the living room and interrupted my father, who was watching TV, and said, 'Dad, I'm not so sure about Joseph Smith. I'm not so sure I know this Church is true. I'm not so sure I want to go out and represent it. I have a lot of questions and I have a lot of misgivings.' When I said that to my father, he walked over and turned the television off, took the cigarette he had in his hand and smashed it in the ashtray, took the can of beer he had in his other hand and put it down on the table, and said, 'Son, I want you to know that I don't do very much about it, but I know that the church of Jesus Christ is true and that Joseph Smith is a prophet. I want you to hear me say it, because I know that better than anything in the world.'" This young man stood up and said, "I want my father to know, even though he probably can't hear me, that I appreciate him. He has some habits that he's not proud of. He has some habits that I'm not proud of. But he's my father and has a testimony and I love him." That kind of appreciation, that kind of maturity, will not only help a missionary to grow and develop to become more purposeful in life, but will also be a great anchor in life's paths.<br><br>The most common question I have asked me as I visit with missionaries (this can apply to students as well), the most frequent question that comes up in the mission field when meeting with the missionaries is, "Elder Ashton, what can I do to get my mother or father or brother or sister more active in the Church? What can I do? I realize now what they are missing and what they need. What can I do to get them active in the Church? What can I do to get them to become members of the Church?" In every case and every situation I have taken the opportunity to say, "The best way to get your family members active in the Church or to become members is to let them know that you appreciate them for what they do and what they stand for and tell them how much you love them."<br><br>You need to express appreciation on a continuing basis, to love family members and neighbors into the Church. You will never get your parents to come into the Church by threatening, embarrassing, or demanding. They will come to the Church only through your expressing appreciation for what they have done, who they are, and your great respect and admiration for them. I hope that we can realize and remember the importance of appreciation.<br><br>May I say that our Savior has indicated in all that he has done the importance of gratitude and thanks and appreciation. May I just share a few short quotations with you.<br><br><i>He took the cup and gave thanks.</i><br><br><i>He took the seven loaves and gave thanks.</i><br><br><i>Give thanks always for all things, he taught.</i><br><br><i>Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things.</i><br><br><i>And ye must give thanks unto God</i><br><br><i>In the spirit for whatsoever blessings ye are blessed with.</i><br><br>From the Doctrine and Covenants: "Verily I say unto you my friends, fear not, let your hearts be comforted; yea, rejoice evermore, and in everything give thanks" (D&amp;amp;C 98:1).<br><h2><b>Appreciation within the Family</b></h2><br>What a great day it will be in our lives when we can appreciate the blessing of appreciation and what it means to us. I would like to indicate to you today that appreciation of companion, appreciation of sweetheart, appreciation of husband and wife is so important. Appreciation is a most important ingredient in a happy marriage.<br><br>To those of you who are courting, those who have plans, I would say to you today without any reservation that if you are keeping company with someone who fails to feel and express appreciation you should avoid forming partnership with him or her. It takes real appreciation to make a happy marriage. I can see some of you who are sitting rather close to each other, squeezing each other's hands and saying, "I appreciate you, don't I?" Then you would go on to something else. But it is just a little deeper, much more significant than that.<br><br>Many a family and marriage are broken because of a lack of appreciation. The most mature students, the most mature and successful people who participate in marriage, are those who understand appreciation. Any wonder that God has said we have two main things to do if we would avoid his wrath--to keep the commandments and to confess his hand in all things? What a strength it is to have a companion who appreciates, feels, and expresses appreciation. I can't overemphasize the fact today that one of the greatest virtues any person can have individually and on an eternal basis is the virtue of appreciation. How many times have you heard people say, "My marriage was terminated primarily because my husband didn't appreciate anything I ever did for him. No matter what I did, there was no appreciation!" Or the same is said about a wife who never knew what it was to show appreciation.<br><h2><b>Appreciation for Gifts from Our Heavenly Father</b></h2><br>I am happy to indicate to you as members of this great student body that appreciation for what's done for us is a great virtue--one that we need to understand and practice if we would get the most out of life. I am grateful today for the love and the gifts of our Heavenly Father. When we stop to ponder what he has given us, what he has shared, the more I think of it, the more I realize how unable I am to comprehend his great gifts.<br><br>God's love for us was so great that it was possible for him to endure and look upon the sufferings of his Only Begotten Son. We should be eternally grateful that God gave to us his Son, our Savior and Redeemer. Without his love, his sacrifice, and without him we could never be glorified in his eternal presence. The greatest gift of all and the one for which you and I should be most appreciative is the gift of his Son to us, for purposes and realizations that we little comprehend today but should better understand with each passing hour.<br><br>How do we show appreciation for God's great gifts? How do we show appreciation for the gifts of parents, companions, roommates, those that we are with constantly? How do we do it? By our lives, by our works, and by our words, and through a willingness to confess his hand in this and in all other great gifts.<br><br>We are told that God is a jealous God--jealous lest we should ignore and fail to show appreciation for his greatest gift of all. Certainly we should all tremble to know that for us Jesus Christ was crucified and suffered. Perhaps one who suffered even more than he did, one who from his heavenly portals witnessed the abuse and the pain that was brought to the Son and restrained himself and allowed it to happen and take place so that we might live with him, is our Eternal Heavenly Father.<br><br>May I conclude by saying, "When thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God" (Alma 37:37). This is a choice, all-inclusive quotation from Alma.<br><br>From Psalms we read, "O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever" (Psalms 106:1).<br><br>Brothers and sisters, I am pleased today to share these few thoughts with you in regard to this great virtue, this great attribute. I would say, not only to missionaries, but also to others who are here today, "You will be successful in your efforts in proportion to how quickly you can learn above and beyond the lessons and the discussions a full and complete appreciation for what you have and for those who labor with you and those who love you."<br><br>To all of us--students, faculty, administration--I say that those who have the opportunity of looking down from the celestial pew perhaps would say to us today, "Please, please learn and practice appreciation--in some quarters a forgotten virtue and something that kindles the wrath of God when you fail to practice it and live it." I humbly leave these thoughts with you, along with my love. Again I express my appreciation for what you teach and what you share and what we learn from each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Marvin J.

<h1>s Fate and Ultimate Destiny - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
This year being our nation's Bicentennial anniversary and the Fourth of July being but two months away, I have thought it might be appropriate to give some consideration to our country's fate and her ultimate destiny.<br><h2><b>Celebration of the Fourth of July</b></h2><br>Although I was born and lived for fifteen years in a foreign land, my parents, who were United States citizens, and their fellow colonists always remembered and observed the Fourth of July. The celebration regularly included a flag and bunting parade and an oration commemorating the signing of the Declaration of Independence.<br><br>My concept of, and my feelings about, what was going on in and around Independence Hall at the time the Declaration was being signed, were in my youth and still are influenced by the words and the spirit of the poem "Independence Bell." I memorized it in my youth, and I hope its lines will transmit to you something of my feelings as I read them to you now.<br><br><i>There was tumult in the city,</i><br><i>In the quaint Old Quaker town,</i><br><i>And the streets were rife with people</i><br><i>Pacing restless up and down.--</i><br><i>People gathering at corners,</i><br><i>Where they whispered each to each,</i><br><i>And the sweat stood on their temples</i><br><i>With the earnestness of speech.</i><br><br><i>As the bleak Atlantic currents</i><br><i>Lash the wild Newfoundland shore,</i><br><i>So they beat against the State House,</i><br><i>So they surged against the door;</i><br><i>And the mingling of their voices</i><br><i>Made a harmony profound,</i><br><i>Till the quiet street of Chestnut</i><br><i>Was all turbulent with sound.</i><br><br><i>"Will they do it?" "Dare they do it?"</i><br><i>"Who is speaking?" "What's the news?"</i><br><i>"What of Adams?" "What of Sherman?"</i><br><i>"Oh, God grant they won't refuse!"</i><br><i>"Make some way, there!" "Let me nearer!"</i><br><i>"I am stifling!" "Stifle, then!</i><br><i>When a nation's life's at hazard,</i><br><i>We've no time to think of men!"</i><br><br><i>So they beat against the portal,</i><br><i>Man and woman, maid and child;</i><br><i>And the July sun in heaven</i><br><i>On the scene looked down and smiled:</i><br><i>The same sun that saw the Spartan</i><br><i>Shed his patriot blood in vain,</i><br><i>Now beheld the soul of freedom,</i><br><i>All unconquered, rise again.</i><br><br><i>See! See! The dense crowd quivers</i><br><i>Through all its lengthy line,</i><br><i>As the boy beside the portal</i><br><i>Looks forth to give the sign!</i><br><i>With his little hands uplifted,</i><br><i>Breezes dallying with his hair,</i><br><i>Hark! with deep, clear intonation,</i><br><i>Breaks his young voice on the air.</i><br><br><i>Hushed the people's swelling murmur,</i><br><i>List the boy's exultant cry!</i><br><i>"Ring!" he shouts, "Ring! Grandpa,</i><br><i>Ring! oh, ring for Liberty!"</i><br><i>Quickly at the given signal</i><br><i>The bell-man lifts his hand,</i><br><i>Forth he sends the good news, making</i><br><i>Iron music through the land.</i><br><br><i>How they shouted! What rejoicing!</i><br><i>How the old bell shook the air,</i><br><i>Till the clang of freedom ruffled</i><br><i>The calmly gliding Delaware!</i><br><i>How the bonfires and the torches</i><br><i>Lighted up the night's repose,</i><br><i>And from the flames, like fabled Phoenix,</i><br><i>Our glorious Liberty arose!</i><br><br><i>That old State House bell is silent,</i><br><i>Hushed is now its clamorous tongue;</i><br><i>But the spirit it awakened</i><br><i>Still is living--ever young;</i><br><i>And when we greet the smiling sunlight</i><br><i>On the Fourth of each July,</i><br><i>We will ne'er forget the bell-man</i><br><i>Who, betwixt the earth and sky,</i><br><i>Rung out, loudly, "INDEPENDENCE";</i><br><i>Which, please God,</i>shall never die!<br><br>[Anonymous, in Robert Haven Shauffler,<i>Independence Day</i>(New York: Dodd, Mead and Company, 1924), pp. 112–14]<br><br>I hope each of you, and I, have like feelings about this great land of America, about the Declaration of Independence, and about the Constitution of the United States.<br><h2><b>Sacred History of America</b></h2><br>In God's economy, America is now and has always been a choice and favored land. God has decreed for her a final, great, and glorious destiny. Here Zion is to be established and the New Jerusalem is to be built. From here the law of God shall go forth to all nations.<br><br>America received her first consecration as a favored land when the Lord planted here the Garden of Eden as a habitation for Adam and Eve.<br><br>A thousand years later Enoch's Zion flourished here.<br><br>And then some six hundred years thereafter this land was deluged by the Flood and left uninhabited, so far as human beings were concerned, until the Lord led to this land from the tower of Babel a colony of people, the Jaredites, declaring as he led them that he was bringing them to a "land of promise, . . . choice above all other lands," and "that whoso should possess this land . . . from that time henceforth and forever, should serve him, the true and only God, or they should be swept off when the fulness of his wrath should come upon them" (Ether 2:7–8).<br><br>Here in this land these people, the Jaredites, built a nation of which the Lord said, "There shall be none greater . . . upon . . . the face of the earth" (Ether 1:43). They dwelt here for some two thousand years. Finally, however, they ripened in iniquity and were, pursuant to God's decree, swept off the land in a fratricidal war.<br><br>Six hundred years B.C., as time was running out for the Jaredites, the Lord brought to this land Lehi and his colony. Before they arrived here the Lord said to them, as he had said to the Jaredites, "Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper, and shall be led to a land of promise; yea, even a land which I have prepared for you; yea, a land which is choice above all other lands" (1 Nephi 2:20). Simultaneously he warned them that if they did not serve him, they would not prosper in the land but would be cut off from his presence.<br><br>The Book of Mormon record testifies to the fact that, when they obeyed the laws of God, they prospered, and that when they did not obey them, they were cut off from the presence of God. Finally the Nephite branch of those people, having ripened in iniquity, was destroyed by the Lamanites, who, under the curse of "their unbelief and idolatry," were scattered and became the people discovered by Columbus when he was led here in 1492 (see Mormon 5:15).<br><br>You, of course, know that the facts I have just recited are not to be found in profane history books. Nowhere in all secular history is mention made of America before Columbus. Why? Because this land has been from the beginning reserved by the Lord for those whom he himself would lead here. This we learn from the ancient prophet Lehi.<br><br><i>I . . . prophesy according to the workings of the Spirit which is in me, that there shall none come into this land save they shall be brought by the hand of the Lord.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, this land is consecrated unto him whom he shall bring. And if it so be that they shall serve him according to the commandments which he hath given, it shall be a land of liberty unto them; wherefore, they shall never be brought down into captivity; if so, it shall be because of iniquity; for if iniquity shall abound cursed shall be the land for their sakes, but unto the righteous it shall be blessed forever.</i><br><br><i>And behold, it is wisdom that this land should be kept as yet from the knowledge of other nations; for . . . many nations would overrun the land. . . .</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, I, Lehi, have obtained a promise, that inasmuch as</i>those whom the Lord God shall bring out of the land of Jerusalem<i>shall keep his commandments, they shall prosper upon the face of this land; and they shall be kept from all other nations, that they may possess this land unto themselves. And if it so be that they shall keep his commandments they shall be blessed upon the face of this land, and there shall be none to molest them, nor to take away the land of their inheritance; and they shall dwell safely forever.</i>[2 Nephi 1:6–9; emphasis added]<br><br>This promise Lehi received for his own descendants and for the Mulekites who also came from Jerusalem. (Mulek was the son of Zedekiah--Mosiah 25:2; Helaman 6:10; 9:21.) He followed it, however, with this solemn warning and prophecy:<br><br><i>Behold, I say, if the day shall come that they</i>[the people who came out from Jerusalem who were the Nephites and the ones who came at the time of the Mulekites]<i>will reject the Holy One of Israel, the true Messiah, their Redeemer and their God, behold, the judgments of him that is just shall rest upon them.</i><br><br><i>Yea, he will bring other nations unto them, and he will give unto them power, and he will take away from them</i>[the descendants of the people who came from Jerusalem]<i>the lands of their possessions</i>[that is, the new nations will take away from them],<i>and he will cause them to be scattered and smitten.</i>[2 Nephi 1:10–11]<br><br>This remarkable prophecy not only explains why America was to be discovered only by those whom God should lead here; it also foreshadows the forfeiting by Lehi's descendants of their inheritance and the coming of other nations.<br><br>History records that these "other nations" were introduced to this land by Columbus, of whose coming ancient American seers prophesied. As early as 590 B.C., before Lehi made the foregoing prophecy, his son Nephi was given to see in vision Columbus being led by the "Spirit of God" to this promised land. Nephi thus described his vision:<br><br><i>And I beheld the Spirit of God</i>[before he had ever reached the promised land],<i>that it came down and wrought upon the man; and he went forth upon the many waters, even unto the seed of my brethren, who were in the promised land.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that I beheld the Spirit of God, that it wrought upon other Gentiles; and they went forth out of captivity, upon the many waters.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that I beheld many multitudes of the Gentiles upon the land of promise</i>[among them the Puritans in New England, the Quakers in Pennsylvania, the Catholics in Maryland, the Huguenots in Virginia and the Carolinas, and the Lutherans in Georgia];<i>and I beheld the wrath of God, that it was upon the seed of my brethren; and they were scattered before the Gentiles and were smitten.</i>[1 Nephi 13:12–14]<br><br>Everyone acquainted with colonial and U.S. history knows how the American Indians were scattered and smitten by the Gentiles who came here following Columbus.<br><br>Nephi then saw and thus described our colonial history.<br><br><i>And I beheld the Spirit of the Lord, that it was upon the Gentiles, and they did prosper and obtain the land for their inheritance</i>[that is, the inheritance of the seed of his brethren who had been scattered]. . . .<br><br><i>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles who had gone forth out of captivity did humble themselves before the Lord; and the power of the Lord was with them</i>[the thirteen original colonies].<br><br><i>And I beheld that their mother Gentiles were gathered together upon the waters, and upon the land also, to battle against them</i>[in the American Revolutionary War].<br><br><i>And I beheld that the power of God was with them, and also that the wrath of God was upon all those that were gathered together against them to battle.</i><br><i>And I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles that had gone out of captivity were delivered by the power of God out of the hands of all other nations.</i>[1 Nephi 13:15–19]<br><br>We know why the colonies were able to win freedom in the Revolutionary War.<br><br>Columbus, of course, knew nothing about this record of Nephi's vision. Nevertheless, he corroborates it. He put on record his convictions that he was divinely led to America. Elder Nephi L. Morris supports this conclusion with quotes from Washington Irving's<i>The Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus:</i><br><br><i>"In the latter part of his life, Columbus, when impressed with the sublime events brought about by his agency . . . looked back upon his career with a solemn and superstitious feeling, he attributed his early and irresistible inclination for the sea, and his passion for geographical studies,</i>to an impulse from the deity preparing him for the high decrees he was chosen to accomplish<i>"</i>(See Irving, p. 18, vol. 1).<br><br><i>"When</i>[Columbus]<i>had formed his theory, it became fixed in his mind with singular firmness, and influenced his entire character and conduct. He never spoke in doubt or hesitation, but with as</i>[such]<i>certainty</i>as if his eyes had beheld the promised land<i>. No trial or disappointment could divert him from the steady pursuit of his object. A deep religious sentiment mingled with his meditations, and gave him at times a tinge of superstition, but it was of a sublime and lofty kind;</i>he looked upon himself as standing in the hand of heaven, chosen from among men for the accomplishment of his high purpose. . . ."<br><br><i>In the royal presence of Isabella, Irving</i>[his biographer]<i>says "He unfolded his plans with eloquence and zeal for he felt himself, as he afterwards declared,</i>kindled as with a fire from on high, and considered himself the agent chosen of heaven to accomplish the grand design<i>. . . ."</i><br><br><i>His son Fernando, in the biography of his father quotes him as saying on one occasion:</i>"God gave me the faith and afterwards the courage so that I was quite willing to undertake the journey."<br><br><i>And the will of Columbus reads thus:</i><br><br><i>"In the name of the most holy trinity, who inspired me with the idea and afterwards made it perfectly clear to me that I could navigate and go to the Indies from Spain, by traversing the ocean westward."</i>[Nephi Lowell Morris, "Columbus and the Book of Mormon," an address delivered over KSL Radio, Sunday, 1 July 1928, and printed in the<i>Deseret News,</i>Saturday, 7 July 1928, section 3, p. VI]<br><h2><b>America Reserved for the Righteous</b></h2><br>We who live in America today are here because the Lord led Columbus to this land. We dwell here under the same divine decree, however, as did the ancient civilizations, who, being likewise led here, prospered when they obeyed the laws of the God of the land but who finally ripened in iniquity and, pursuant to the Lord's decree, were swept off the land. And be it known that we are as well informed of the decree as were those former inhabitants. The manner in which a knowledge of this decree came to us is as follows:<br><br>Moroni, an American prophet-historian who, about 421 A.D., closed the sacred Book of Mormon record now available to us, spent his youth and middle life in the final struggle between his people, the Nephites, and the Lamanites. As the sole surviving Nephite, he spent the rest of his life abridging the two-thousand-year record of the Jaredites. He was therefore familiar with all the lurid details of their demise. With these heartrending scenes and his own experiences upon his mind, he was given in vision a view of us who now dwell here. Knowing that his record would come to us, he wrote as he looked at us in vision:<br><br><i>Behold, I speak unto you as if ye were present, and yet ye are not. But behold, Jesus Christ hath shown you unto me, and I know your doing.</i>[Mormon 8:35]<br><br><i>And this</i>[the record that he wrote]<i>cometh unto you . . .</i>that ye may know the decrees of God--that ye may repent, and not continue in your iniquities until the fulness come, that ye may not bring down the fulness of the wrath of God upon you as the inhabitants of the land have hitherto done.<br><br><i>Behold, this is a choice land, and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall be free from bondage, and from captivity, and from all other nations under heaven, if they will but serve the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ.</i>[Ether 2:11–12; emphasis added]<br><br>Although the foregoing references to America's past are brief and sketchy, they clearly show that she is now and has been from the beginning a favored and choice land in which the Lord has taken a personal and peculiar interest. They make it crystal clear that if destruction or subjugation shall come to us, it will not be by a foreign foe but because we, the inhabitants of the land, shall have reached a "fulness of iniquity" (see J. Reuben Clark, Jr.,<i>Stand Fast by Our Constitution</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1973], p. 183).<br><br>But not only has the Almighty reserved America for a righteous people and decreed that her inhabitants shall serve him or be swept off the land; he has also, as indicated at the outset of these remarks, decreed for her a great and marvelous final destiny--namely, that out of her is to go forth to all the world his law.<br><br>Isaiah so declared centuries ago when he prophesied:<br><br><i>It shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.</i><br><br><i>And many people shall go and say, . . . let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths:</i>for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. [Isaiah 2:2–3; emphasis added]<br><br><i>Zion,</i>as used in this scripture, means America. In fact, America is Zion. At times the term is used to include both the North and South American continents. In some references the word<i>Zion</i>is used to designate the area in and about Jackson County, Missouri, where the New Jerusalem will be built, which city is itself sometimes called Zion. From Zion the law of God shall eventually go forth into all the world.<br><br><i>It is this fact and this purpose, the building of Zion on this hemisphere, . . . which seem to be the dominant elements in all of God's dealings with them who possess this land. . . .</i><br><br><i>Thus America's ultimate God-given destiny, planned by the Creator</i>[and by him through Isaiah declared],<i>is that out of her shall go forth the law.</i>[Clark,<i>Stand Fast,</i>pp. 174–75]<br><br>This destiny no power of men or devils can thwart.<br><br>Let us now consider for a moment what the Lord has done since he led Columbus to America to move her toward her divine destiny. Reference has already been made to the early settlers, to the growth of the original colonies, to the Declaration of Independence, and to the success of the colonists in the Revolutionary War through which their declared independence was won. Later on, between 1820 and 1844, the Lord revealed a new and complete dispensation of his gospel that contains the laws of the God of this land, who is Jesus Christ. This was, of course, made imperative by the divine decree that those who dwell here must obey such laws or be swept off the land. His laws have always been given to the inhabitants of America. He gave them to the antediluvians through his prophets from Adam to Noah. He gave them to the Jaredites through the prophets from the brother of Jared to Ether. To the Nephites in a personal visitation and through his prophets from Lehi to Moroni, he revealed his laws. To this generation he has given them anew through his prophet Joseph Smith, Jr.<br><h2><b>Free Agency Needed for Obedience to God's Laws</b></h2><br>The giving of these laws, however, would have been abortive without a civil government that would guarantee men the untrammeled exercise of their God-given free agency. Without such a civil government men could not be bound by the laws of God even though they were revealed. As a matter of fact, free agency underlies all of God's laws. It is God's law of liberty. It is the basis of existence.<br><br>God wants men to do good, but he never forces them and does not want them to be forced. He placed in and left with them the power of election. When they do good, he honors them because they could have done evil. When they are coerced, they are entitled to no such honor. God allows men to make their own choices, and he has reserved to himself the judgment as to the correctness of their choices.<br><br>Free agency has always had rough going, however. Over it the War in Heaven was fought. In the earth it has been abridged by almost all governments, civil and ecclesiastical. Apostate churchmen, kings, and other rulers have from the beginning arrogated judgment unto themselves. They have, contrary to God's law of liberty, preempted man's right, with or without his consent, to determine what would be best for them to do and by every means within their power have undertaken to force men to do their bidding.<br><br><i>We have learned by sad experience that it is the nature and disposition of almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, they will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:39]<br><br>On July 3, 1776, no government on earth guaranteed God's law of liberty; but on July 4, 1776, in the Declaration of Independence, that law was declared anew in the earth.<br><br><i>Everywhere in America, says John Adams, the people received the Declaration of Independence "as though it was a decree promulgated from heaven." And well they might, for it was a strange and wonderful thing. "Freedom hath been hunted round the globe," wrote Tom Paine. "Asia and Africa have long expelled her. Europe regards her like a stranger, and England hath given her warning to depart. O! receive the fugitive and prepare in time an asylum for mankind."</i>[Hugh Nibley,<i>The World and the Prophets</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1954), pp. 170–71]<br><br>The colonial patriots did receive the fugitive. They fought and won the war of the revolution to obtain freedom. They, under the inspiration of heaven and the interposition of the Almighty, established the Constitution of the United States to secure freedom, God's law of liberty, not only for all Americans but also for all men.<br><br>In this manner did God move America into position to fulfill her destiny. That it was<i>he</i>who did it, he himself affirms. In 1833 he told his people, who had been scattered by their enemies, to<br><br><i>continue to importune for redress, and redemption, . . .</i><br><br><i>According to the laws and constitution of the people, which I have suffered to be established, and should be maintained</i>for the rights and protection of all flesh [not just for America], according to just and holy principles;<br><br><i>That every man may act in doctrine and principle pertaining to futurity, according to the moral agency which I have given unto him, that every man may be accountable for his own sins in the day of judgment.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, it is not right that any man should be in bondage one to another.</i><br><br><i>And for this purpose have I established the Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 101:76–80; emphasis added]<br><br>In this declaration the Lord reveals three things: (1) that the Constitution of the United States was established by him; (2) that the purpose of it was to protect men in the exercise of their God-given moral agency; and (3) that every man should eventually, under its just and holy principles, enjoy such protection.<br><br>Did time permit, we could with profit consider the Constitutional provisions that guarantee this freedom, which, pursuant to her declared destiny, is to go forth from America to maintain the "rights and protection of all flesh." I refer you who are interested in this divinely established guarantee to the late President J. Reuben Clark, Jr.'s, great speech--" America--A Chosen Land of the Lord," which you can find in the book<i>Stand Fast by Our Constitution</i>(pp. 173–98).<br><br>I think I have now said enough to sustain my thesis that America has from the beginning been, and now is, in God's economy, a choice and favored land, and that he has decreed for her a great destiny. I shall therefore conclude with a statement of these basic facts.<br><br>The blessings of our constitutional freedoms were secured for us by the bounty of the Almighty through the patriotism and sacrifices of the founding fathers. They were preserved for us through the suffering and trials of the Civil War. For them we owe a deep debt of gratitude to God and our forebears.<br><br>By the grace of God we occupy this land, the blessings of which are unequaled in any other land. It is difficult for us of this generation to fully appreciate these blessings because they were not won by the shedding of our own blood, sweat, and tears, but by that of others.<br><br>There are some things, however, that we must no longer fail to appreciate. If we do so, we shall do it at our peril. Chief among these things is man's free agency, which was provided for in the Constitution as it was originally adopted and interpreted. America's destiny requires that the constitutional safeguards of this freedom be appreciated and maintained. It is imperative that they be maintained and observed here in America in order that they may go out from here undiluted to the protection of all flesh. Whether this generation of Americans will live up to its opportunity to obey and preserve them, particularly God's law of liberty--including the gospel of Jesus Christ, who is the God of this land--remains to be seen. If it does not, the wicked among us will be destroyed, as were the wicked preceding the appearance of the risen Lord to the Nephites. God will spare the righteous and raise up another generation in this land, for out of Zion the law of God will go forth.<br><br>There are those among us who feel, and perhaps with good cause, that these constitutional freedoms are being, both wittingly and unwittingly, eroded. If this be so, let it be known that with the loss of each constitutional freedom we are surrendering our inheritance in this favored land.<br><br>What can we do about it? Let me give you a suggestion in the words of the immortal Lincoln. As I read the word<i>laws</i>and I quote him, think of the laws of the gospel and those constitutional laws calculated to preserve our free agency--<i>God's law of liberty</i>. Here is the quotation:<br><br><i>Let every American, every lover of liberty, every well-wisher to his posterity, swear by the blood of the Revolution never to violate in the least particular the laws of the country</i>[and let Latter-day Saints include in that the laws of the gospel of Jesus Christ]<i>, and never to tolerate their violation by others. As the patriots of '76 did to the support of the Declaration of Independence, so to the support of the Constitution and the laws</i>[of God]<i>, let every American pledge his life, his property and his sacred honour; let every man remember that to violate the law is to trample upon the blood of his fathers and to tear the charter of his own and his children's liberty. Let reverence for the laws be breathed by every American mother to the lisping babe that prattles on her lap. Let it be taught in schools, in seminaries, and in colleges. Let it be written in primers, spelling books, and almanacs. Let it be preached from the pulpits, proclaimed in legislative halls, and enforced in courts of justice. In short, let it become the political religion of the nation.</i>[John Wesley Hill,<i>Abraham Lincoln--Man of God,</i>4th ed. (New York: Putnam, 1930), p. 73]<br><br>Now, my beloved brothers and sisters, young and old, let us--who know and believe so much more than others about the fate and ultimate destiny of America--lead the way by precept and example to the realization of that great destiny, I humbly pray. And I leave with you my blessing, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Marion G.

<h1>rnal Happiness - Gene R. Cook - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My brothers and sisters, it is a real privilege to be here at BYU and have this choice opportunity to share with you for a few moments some of my feelings. I appreciate Sister Gardner singing something so appropriate and with such a theme as "Trust in the Lord." I suppose if there was one message I had for you today, that would be a good one--to trust, in all things, in the Lord.<br><br>I am thankful, President Oaks, that you have attempted to make this a special occasion for me by indicating that my alma mater was Arizona State University. I can see that you have moved this ASU banner from the side over there to a special position right here in front of the podium. That is quite an honor. I don't know how you moved those, but that is doing something.<br><h2><b>Eternal Objectives</b></h2><br>I have been thinking this last week or so, brothers and sisters, about the objectives of the Lord as they pertain to this earth. I would like to share with you some of those objectives, at least in my mind, and also some that the devil has. Perhaps I could also share some ideas that I have in terms of happiness in life as it relates to these objectives.<br><br>I think of that great statement in Moses where the Lord said that his purpose, his glory, was "to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). I think of President Lee saying on one occasion, "If there is anything in your life that does not conform to that objective, perhaps you're out of order." I think of that great statement in the Book of Mormon that Lehi left for all of us, indicating that "men are that they might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25). I really believe with all of my heart that the Lord wants us to be happy: to have not only happiness in this life, but also, more important than that, to have eternal life, that gift that is the greatest of all gifts God can bestow upon men. I think also, as I think about some of the objectives that are controlling things on earth and about that great power that exists with the devil, about the definition the Lord gave us concerning his objectives. Listen to what he said in 2 Nephi. If you have your scriptures with you (and I hope many of you do), turn with me for one moment to 2 Nephi, chapter two. Let me read two verses:<br><br><i>And because he</i>[Satan]<i>had fallen from heaven, and had become miserable forever, he sought also the misery of all mankind. ...</i><br><br><i>... for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.</i>[2 Nephi 2:18, 27]<br><br>Now, I have watched a lot of individuals in life in my few years, and I have seen some who really were miserable. I have seen some individuals who really were happy, from whom the joy of the gospel seemed to emanate and go to other men. I have wondered in my life what makes the difference.<br><h2><b>Worldly Notions of Happiness</b></h2><br>I am going to suggest to you some ideas which are set forth throughout the land as being ways of obtaining happiness, the seeds of which were sown by the devil himself. Listen to a few of these sources of supposed happiness. I think of the one that the devil so cleverly chose, indicating that a man can really be happy only if he's making a lot of money. The Lord certainly has nothing against money (he has so indicated in the scriptures), but he has indicated that there is a proper purpose for the usage of money. I would suggest to you that, as you go about obtaining your education and later on beginning to look for an occupation, you will find the obtaining of riches, if done in the proper way and with the proper motive, can assist in helping man to be happy. But money is not the true source of happiness. I think of some statements I heard one time from a young couple who said, rather humorously, "Brother Cook, we don't have enough money for this new baby. In fact, now that he is ready to arrive tomorrow, we don't have enough money to buy a crib for him."<br><br>I said, "What are you going to do?"<br><br>He said, "Well, I guess we'll put him in the box the color TV came in." They were telling on themselves, weren't they? I think of another young couple who one time said, I guess in a kidding way, that the reason some husbands are so henpecked is that they won't give their wives enough chicken feed. I think there's some truth in that, indicating, perhaps, improper usage of money. But the devil attempts to convince you that if you really want to be happy you must have a lot of money.<br><br>Another reputed source of happiness that the devil has attempted to sow in the minds of men is the belief that, if you want to be happy, you should seek for power, position, prestige. Supposedly, the only men who are really happy are those who have control, in a degree, over the lives of other men, which is surely a directive of the devil himself coming right from the preexistence--that desire to unrighteously control other men. The Lord has made some pretty powerful statements concerning those kinds of individuals who use authority unrighteously. I think of problems that now exist in our government and other governments because of that seed, sown cleverly by the devil to cause men to seek happiness, as it were, by having power and authority over others or by attempting to place themselves above other men in thinking, "I am greater than he," or, "Because of this position I merit this and this, and you don't because you don't have this type of position." I tell you that those things do not come of the Lord.<br><br>I think of one other great area that the devil seems to use quite effectively: he sows the seeds of physical indulgence. He tells us that we ought to do what we want to do. We ought to satisfy the needs of the flesh. He says, in the worldly terminology, "Let it all hang out. Do what you want to do. Do your own thing. It really doesn't matter. What really counts is that, if you just feel like doing it, do it." Once again, I suggest that some are fools in believing that happiness comes that way. I would suggest that these great lessons were taught by the Savior himself. We don't have the time here this morning to review those temptations that were placed before him, but you ought to do that again. Read Matthew 4:1–11 and see how the devil cleverly placed these three temptations I have just described before the Master. Also, if I were you, I would look carefully to see how the Lord answered Satan as he was tempted.<br><h2><b>Unhappiness Caused by Iniquity</b></h2><br>Again, if you have your scriptures, look for one moment with me in 3 Nephi, chapter six. Listen to what is said here, as the word of the Lord, about the cause of the problems of the people of Nephi, the reason for their lack of happiness, their not being a very happy people:<br><br><i>Now the cause of this iniquity of the people was this--Satan had great power, unto the stirring up of the people to do all manner of iniquity, and to the puffing them up with pride, tempting them to seek for power, and authority, and riches, and the vain things of the world.</i>[3 Nephi 6:15]<br><br>I suggest to you that that is not the pattern the Lord has given us for being happy.<br><h2><b>Guidelines for Eternal Happiness</b></h2><br>Let me tell you a few things I've learned about being happy. What you want to do, my young friends, is to find ways of discouraging discouragement. Find ways of discouraging the devil so that you might truly be happy. I would suggest that one of the cardinal principles when we begin to ask, "How do we become happy?" is to realize that happiness in the Lord's way is not something found in the short run. There is happiness in the earth, and the Lord tells us that, unless body and spirit are "inseparably connected," we cannot "receive a fullness of joy" (D&amp;amp;C 93:33–34). He indicates further: "Wherefore, fear not even unto death; for in this world your joy is not full, but in me your joy is full. ... And seek the face of the Lord always, that in patience ye may possess your souls, and ye shall have eternal life" (D&amp;amp;C 101:36, 38).<br><br>Let me tell you a story of something that happened in my life in the last few months which illustrates, to a degree, the difficulty men sometimes have in looking for short-run pleasures versus long-run joys. (Sometimes long-run means only a few hours in contrast to the moment.)<br><br>This last Thanksgiving there was quite a snowstorm here in Utah. I don't know how much snow fell in Provo, but there was a lot where I live in Bountiful. I as an individual don't especially enjoy the snow--particularly when it's in my driveway. That doesn't impress me at all. That morning I looked out the window and saw about a foot of snow in our driveway. I gathered up two of my boys, Troy and Travis, who were seven and five, and convinced these boys how happy they were going to be to help their dad shovel all that snow. As you know, that takes some doing, but you can make work fun because that does happen to be one of the real sources of joy: employment, a good job, doing something of worth. I took them outside with me and we shoveled the entire walk.<br><br>After we finished we were cold, and I was ready to go in. But I saw a teaching moment, and so I said to these two boys, "I wonder if we shouldn't go shovel Phil's walk." (Phil is our neighbor next door.)<br><br>I was pleased as one boy said, "That sounds good, Dad." The other boy said, "I'm cold."<br><br>I looked again for that moment to teach and said, "I wonder how Phil would feel as he awakened this morning if he opened his door and saw his entire walk all finished." Then the other boy caught the spirit of it and said, "Well, I think, Dad, that he would really be happy, wouldn't he?"<br><br>I took that as the moment to say, "Well, what do you think, Troy, that Heavenly Father would have us do?"<br><br>He said, "Well, I think we had better shovel the walk." We went over and we shoveled the entire walk. By that time we were tired, and the youngest boy said, "Let's ring the doorbell now and tell Phil what we've done." He was going for some short-run pleasure, wasn't he? Again there was a great teaching moment as I was able to say, "No, Travis, I think it would be best if we didn't tell him and left it a surprise. Heavenly Father likes us to do things anonymously." I had to tell him what that meant--that we do things without anyone's knowing that we're doing them. The next thing I knew my other boy had caught the spirit of it and said, "Well, what about the Jackmans' walk?" Before we finished that morning we had done three other walks. There was great joy later in the day as we had some phone calls come to the house. These boys saw the joy that comes to the heart of one who was attempting to do good anonymously and thereafter was found out.<br><br>I suggest to you again that real pleasure--real joy, I guess, is the best word--comes many times in the long run in terms of time on the earth, sometimes in the long run in terms of the eternities. I don't know of any source of happiness that is any greater than this one--faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, a standard that will not change, the real rock of our salvation that we can center our entire faith in. I bear my witness to you, my brothers and sisters, that Jesus Christ is that standard. If we put our faith and our trust in him, we will have joy both in this life and in the life to come.<br><br>I think sometimes of others who look for happiness elsewhere. I think of the full-time missionaries. I remember an elder who said to me one time, when I was touring a mission down in South America, "Brother Cook, when is this happiest two years of my life going to be over?" Having been there only about three weeks, he was suffering a little bit from looking through those short lenses instead of the long lenses of eternity to see real happiness. The other, more distant source of happiness comes from tribulation, doesn't it? From having to really stick it out, to do things when you don't feel like doing them, to get up in the morning when you'd rather stay in bed, to discipline yourself to learn--which is what many of you are doing now. It hurts, doesn't it? But I suggest that is one source of being truly happy in the long run: learning, growing, becoming involved, developing your talents and even your character.<br><br>I have been challenged this last couple of months, since my wife and I have known we were going to Montevideo, Uruguay, to preside over the mission there. I speak Spanish, but it has been only missionary Spanish. I have been doing my best to come up with some real live Spanish, and I say that respectfully because it is a lot easier than what my family is going through. I have had to discipline myself to learn three or four thousand additional vocabulary words so that I can comfortably converse with heads of nations, cabinet members, and others in their native tongue. It has taken discipline. It has been hard, but I bear my testimony that there is great satisfaction that comes from knowing you're winning, improving, and becoming better.<br><br>I mentioned tribulation earlier. I've found that is a great source of happiness. I don't have time to talk to you very much about it today except to say it is a source of happiness if taken in the right spirit. When you have a moment, read in Alma 62:41. It is a time in history in the Book of Mormon when there had been great wars occurring. This passage shows how some individuals took tribulation. It caused them to harden their hearts before the Lord. Other individuals, facing exactly the same kinds of problems, softened their hearts before the Lord and were truly happy. They had the same problems, but they took them in a different spirit.<br><br>I would suggest one other great source of happiness of the many I know of--your family. I am pleased to know that the First Presidency--Presidents McKay, Brown, and Tanner--quoted the Lord in a piece of written material that went out to the Church a few years ago. They said this, and because they said it I feel free to quote them: "That there is great joy and rejoicing in your posterity, giving one of the great purposes of life--joy and rejoicing in your children" (Policy letter, 14 April 1969). I don't know of anything that has brought me more joy than being married and having a lovely wife who holds the same objectives I do and having children who are striving to learn the truth. A family brings to a man great joy.<br><br>I think of one of my boys when I was first called as a General Authority. He was a very young boy, seven, and stood up to bear his testimony in sacrament meeting. I was gone for a stake conference, but he stood up to bear his testimony about what had happened to the Cook family in those last few weeks. He had forgotten a little bit what a General Authority is; he couldn't even remember the word. All he could say as he bore his testimony was, "My dad has been called to be a ... , to be a ... , to be one of those men who knows about Jesus." He couldn't remember the term, but he knew the feeling.<br><br>In closing, let me read to you these words from President McKay. I have carried them in my scriptures for some time because they truly impressed me. President McKay said:<br><br><i>That man is truly great who is most Christlike. What you sincerely think in your heart of Jesus Christ will determine what you are and will largely determine what your acts will be. By choosing Jesus Christ as our ideal, we create within ourselves a desire to be like him and to have fellowship with him. If you think about him long enough, you'll begin to act like him. And if you act like him long enough, you will truly become like him.</i><br><br>I bear my testimony, my brothers and sisters, once again that the design of this life, our very existence here on this earth, is calculated by the Lord to make us happy if we will but follow the way he has prescribed. I thrilled to see and listen to both President Kimball and President Lee when they were set in position as Presidents of the Church. They were both asked, "What counsel do you have for the Latter-day Saints?" I think some people felt they were going to hear some great new statement. But they heard the word of the Lord through a living prophet saying nothing more than this: "I would counsel the Latter-day Saints to keep the commandments."<br><br>I bear my testimony that by keeping the commandments, by truly following that straight and narrow path that has been marked out by the Lord, we will be happy here and in the life to come. May you always make your choices with the long run in view. May you seek after happiness by following the Lord. I bear my testimony, last of all, that this is the true church of Jesus Christ, that it is the only true church on the face of the whole land, that there is a man today by the name of Spencer W. Kimball who is a prophet of God. I bear that witness of a surety that goes beyond words, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Gene R. Cook was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 11 May 1976.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>aint If I Live Right - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My brothers and sisters, it is an honor to be here this evening and to participate in this special kind of fireside meeting. It is an awesome thing to be standing here looking at this vast audience and recognize that you are here to be edified and lifted up in spirit. I pray that the Lord will help me say and discuss some things with you that will be beneficial. I hope that what I say has some pertinence to the missionaries and to all of the rest of you.<br><br>It has been mentioned that my call came just a short time ago. I am one of the newest of the General Authorities, and I can assure you that I am making my share of mistakes. I am still missing meetings that I ought to be attending, and I am finding it difficult and a little painful at times fitting into my new position.<br><br>This new position that I play on the Lord's team reminds me of a selection I read a short time ago that I would like to share with you. It comes from<i>Sports Illustrated</i>(5 April 1971). Before going into college baseball coaching, Dick Schultz, the head coach at the University of Iowa, was a minor league baseball catcher. He once had a manager, so the report goes, who was given to eccentric lineup changes: that is, before each game he would change the lineup, not paying much attention to the positions the players were accustomed to. Schultz tells of a very interesting thing that happened one night. (Perhaps you have heard this.) The manager decided to put a rookie third baseman at first base. Picture this, if you will, in your own mind. This was a position he had never played before. The inevitable happened. The left-handed batter drilled a grounder to the terrified first baseman, who grabbed the ball. Instead of stepping on the base for the out, he reflexively began to throw, quite as if he were playing third base. But halfway through the throwing motion he realized where he was and fell into a series of contortions in an effort to keep from throwing the ball away. The runner was so startled by all of this that he stopped on the baseline. The first baseman finally fired the ball back to home plate, where catcher Schultz made a very startled grab. "I didn't want the ball," he said, "so I threw it back to him." Although the runner had stopped, the first baseman still did not think to step on first. Instead, he did what any good third baseman would do. He cut him off and started a run-down play. The runner, by now as confused as anyone, fell into the act as the first baseman and Schultz began throwing the ball back and forth. Finally the runner made his break back to his last base, which happened to be home plate. Schultz grabbed the ball, made the tag, and the umpire bellowed, "You're out." Well, Schultz had only one question. He turned to the umpire and inquired rather innocently, "What would you have done if he'd been safe?"<br><br>We sometimes get into peculiar situations when we play a new position. I can assure you, however, that it is a great and tremendous privilege to be associated so intimately with the Brethren. I constantly, daily, pray for the Spirit of the Lord to bless me that I might measure up to his expectations.<br><h2><b>Becoming Perfect</b></h2><br>A short time after Elder Marvin Ashton was called to serve as a member of the Council of the Twelve, someone asked him, "Are you an apostle like Peter, James, and John of old?" I don't know who the person was. I don't know why he asked the question. I don't know what he expected to hear. He may have been baiting Elder Ashton, or he may have been motivated by pure motive--I don't know. But whatever the circumstance, the answer that he gave was very profound. Elder Ashton's response was "I am if I live properly." These words, "I am if I live properly," have a dual meaning. In one sense Elder Ashton was testifying of his divine calling; he might well have said, "Yes, I<i>am</i>an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ. Like Peter, James, and John, I have received a commission as a special witness, and, like the apostles of old, my assignment is to preach the gospel to the world."<br><br>The second meaning which I read into Elder Ashton's answer relates to the becoming process which is found in the gospel of Jesus Christ. In this sense Elder Ashton could have said, "Yes, I have received an apostolic commission. However, I must live properly so that I might draw claim upon the apostolic powers promised to me. If I live and serve correctly, I<i>can be</i>a modern Peter, James, or John."<br><br>This evening in the time allotted to me, I should like to use Elder Ashton's words as my theme and discuss with you the process of becoming, a topic that I think is most appropriate for this group, and I pray that what I say will burn into your minds at least six words--"I am if I live properly." I also hope that this brief discussion will encourage you to accelerate your growth toward perfection.<br><br>Suppose someone were to approach you and ask, "Are you really a Latter-day Saint?" How would you answer? Would you be able to say with clear conscience, "Yes, I do belong to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Yes, I do live as a Latter-day Saint is expected to live." Or would you lower your eyes a bit and say, "I am a member of the Church; however, I am not measuring up to the expectations of a Saint." Before you do some self-introspection, let's read the words of King Benjamin and study the definition of a saint that he provided:<br><br><i>For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.</i>[Mosiah 3:19]<br><br>Please note that King Benjamin used the words "and becometh a saint." He also mentioned putting off the natural man and becoming as a child and yielding to the enticings of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>The other day a friend of mine visited my office and requested some help with a referral. He explained that he had obtained the name of the referral while attending a conference in the East. The person had recognized that my friend was special and that he was different from all of the other people. This particular person had wondered why he was so clean and so happy, why he radiated such goodness. My friend, I feel, is a saint. His saintliness must have been showing because it prompted the person to want to know more about his faith and way of life.<br><h2><b>Evaluating Your Saintliness</b></h2><br>I invite you to seriously assess your own degree of saintliness. If your own assessment isn't too complimentary, I challenge you to renew your efforts to become a saint. Suppose someone were to approach one of you young men and ask, "Are you really a bearer of the Melchizedek Priesthood? Are you really an elder, a seventy, or even a high priest?" Could you say with full confidence that the office is yours and that the attendant power is a part of your life? Or would you be forced to admit that you were a priesthood bearer more in title than in fact? Would you be able to bear witness of the fact that the priesthood power had come to you through authorized channels and that that power had been made a part of your life?<br><br>I remember an instance which occurred a few years ago in Missouri. My wife and I were attending a seminar for mission presidents which was presided over by President Hugh B. Brown. When the conference closed, we drove to the airport to catch our return flights home. As we approached the boarding gate, a long crowd of people were lined up at the entrance way waiting for the signal to board the plane. President Brown and his escort stepped to the end of the line. However, almost as if someone had given an audible command, the crowd moved aside and invited President Brown to walk forward beyond the gate. My wife and I followed. As I walked behind, a man touched my shoulder and inquired, "Who is that man?"<br><br>I replied, "There goes an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ."<br><br>The man looked at me and then at President Brown and said, "I knew that he was someone special. I<i>knew</i>that he was someone special"<br><br>If there are any here who ponder whether the priesthood is operative in their lives, I suggest a review of section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Let me read:<i>That the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness.</i><br><br><i>That they may be conferred upon us, it is true; but when we undertake to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men, in any degree of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens withdraw themselves; the Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and when it is withdrawn, Amen to the priesthood or the authority of that man.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121: 36–37]<br><br>To me it is very clear that priesthood power is realized when one's life is governed by righteousness. God expects those who share in his holy power to cling to righteousness, to measure up, and to be noble representatives of his cause.<br><br>One more supposition. Suppose someone were to ask you, "Are you really a missionary, an ordained minister of the gospel?" Your reply to such a question once again would be determined by how you're living. Would that all of us could say with perfect confidence and boldness, "I am what I'm supposed to be because I live properly and because I am striving to become."<br><h2><b>Knowing Spiritual Truths</b></h2><br>May I invite you to consider the importance of three things related to this theme. Those three things are knowing and doing and being. It's my belief that a certain body of knowledge, a certain set of actions, and a certain way of living must be mastered if we are to obtain the most in life. You'll remember that a short time before his crucifixion the Savior said, "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent" (John 17:3). The Savior also taught, "They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service. And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me" (John 16:2). Christ's prediction was fulfilled. He and his beloved associates<i>were</i>killed. Why? Because men did not know the true and living God and were unable or unwilling to acknowledge the Son. Insufficient knowledge, insufficient truth, insufficient faith have caused many to err and lose choice blessings. Many in today's world are fettered by ignorance. Many of us, I fear, suffer because our knowledge is lacking.<br><br>May I explain that certain body of knowledge which I feel is so essential in our process of becoming. One, we must know that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ. We must know that God the Father is the father of our spirits, that we are made in his image. We must know that this life is a probationary period, a time of testing, a time to prove that we are obedient to our Father's commands. We must know that God has provided a plan of salvation, a way whereby men may again live in the presence of God. We must know that man's potential destiny is to become like the Father. You have heard words by Lorenzo Snow so many times: "As man now is, our God once was. As now God is, so man may be."<br><br>You'll recall the Savior's instructions to the Nephites: "Therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am" (3 Nephi 27:27). He also taught, "Therefore I would that ye should be perfect even as I, or your Father who is in heaven is perfect" (3 Nephi 12:48). Without this kind of knowledge we don't set our sights high enough, we don't strive hard enough, and we don't become what man can become.<br><br>In addition to the knowledge I have mentioned, I think it is important for us to appreciate that we are co-creators with God. This thought was beautifully expressed by a writer who said:<br><br><i>Man is the only creature that can consciously help to create itself. The fulfillment of the possibilities of its species may be the primary function of a seedling tree, but the tree is unaware of that fact, and it cannot deliberately cooperate. Man, alone, consciously assists in the fulfillment of his nature . . . . We are not simply creatures; we are self-creators. As Wordsworth put it, "So build we up the being that we are." Other creatures nature could largely finish; the human creature must finish himself.</i>[Harry Emerson Fosdick,<i>On Being a Real Person,</i>p. 2]<br><br>Thus the process of becoming begins with knowledge--knowledge of the God who gave us life, knowledge of life's purpose, and knowledge of our unlimited potential. All of this should give us great incentive for striving and becoming. You missionaries will be going into the world for the purpose of teaching and sharing this knowledge with mankind. Hopefully, you will be able to spark an interest in the bosoms of men and cause them to repent and to live the gospel and to become as our Father would like all men to become.<br><h2><b>Doing the Lord's Will</b></h2><br>A key in the doing phase of becoming is found in the scriptures. In the book of Moses we read of Adam's baptism. Many of you are acquainted with that, I am sure. This is taught:<br><br><i>And thus he was baptized, and the Spirit of God descended upon him, and thus he was born of the Spirit, and became quickened in the inner man.</i><br><br><i>And he heard a voice out of heaven, saying: Thou art baptized with fire, and with the Holy Ghost. This is the record of the Father, and the Son from henceforth and forever;</i><br><br><i>And thou art after the order of him who was without beginning of days or end of years, from all eternity to all eternity.</i><br><br><i>Behold thou art one in me, a son of God; and thus, may all become my sons.</i>[Moses 6:65–68]<br><br>We also read in the book of Mosiah something that is very close to what has already been read. You will recall that King Benjamin's final address to his people had a great effect. The record tells us that, when it was finished, when the discourse was completed,<br><br><i>they all cried with one voice, saying: Yea, we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.</i>[Mosiah 5:2]<br><br>The record goes on to say that the people were willing to enter into a covenant with God to do his will and to be obedient to his commandments. After making this covenant, King Benjamin said:<br><br><i>Ye have spoken the words that I desired; and the covenant which ye have made is a righteous covenant.</i><br><br><i>And now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters.</i>[Mosiah 5:6–7]<br><br>I read these scriptures to remind us all that our becoming depends upon our doing. That doing must include full compliance with the basic principles and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Yes, we must have faith, we must repent, we must be baptized and make a covenant with God, and we must put ourselves in a position where we can receive the Holy Ghost and keep him as a constant companion.<br><br>I think one of the greatest tributes I have ever heard given a man was that he carried on a lifetime courtship with the Holy Ghost, that member of the Godhead that has power to sanctify and purify and quicken all of us. I hope that all of us will push forward and do what's possible to make the gospel live in our lives, that we might become quickened and recognize the kind of sanctification that will make us eligible for God's presence one day.<br><br>It is important that we understand--as we aspire to certain things, as we seek to become--that we don't reach our goal in one reach. It's the reaching, it's the striving that makes all the difference. I heard Elder Ashton say on one occasion that saints are simply sinners who kept trying. He might have said that they were simply the strivers in the kingdom.<br><br>Richard L. Evans wrote:<br><br><i>Ofttimes our young people see someone playing a great role in life, and they think they would like to play a great role also--without any awareness of what has gone into the making of an able man. We see his performance and are thrilled with his mastery of himself and with the things with which he works, but we often forget the years of self-denial, of creative effort, and determination that have preceded achievement--years in which mediocrity or mediocre complacency has been given up to engage in an upward struggle.</i>[<i>This Day and Always,</i>p. 111]<br><br>He also said to youth, "If you want to make a noble and useful man, you must begin by making a noble and useful boy. If you want to make a virtuous and lovely woman, you must begin by making a virtuous and lovely girl."<br><h2><b>Being What You Want to Be</b></h2><br>Thus, in the becoming process, knowledge is essential, and certain actions are essential also. But along with the knowing and the doing there has to be a being or a living phase. I love what President McKay said so many times. As he spoke to young audiences especially, he would say, "Whate'er thou art, act well thy part." As you go into Church offices in Salt Lake City down on the first level, you should stop and look at a stone placed by the staircase. It describes how these words became so important in the life of President McKay. A writer has said, "A man is what he is because of what he has been. We have to live the part we want to play. A man must begin to be what he would like to be if that's what he wants to be." That's good advice for all of us.<br><br>I heard a man say, upon learning that his neighbor had been called as a General Authority, "That doesn't surprise me. He has always lived and acted like a General Authority." What a tribute and what truth!<br><br>I love the words of David as he gave a charge to his son, Solomon:<br><br><i>I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and show thyself a man;</i><br><br><i>And keep the charge of the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, . . . that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself.</i>[1 Kings 2:2–3]<br><br>The teaching is to be a man, play the part, assume the role, be the kind of person you want to be. If you do, then you will likely become what you want to become.<br><br>As I read the scriptures, I find that the Lord had little respect for a group of people, the hypocrites. He was rather harsh on this group of people who professed one thing and lived another. With all of our living and doing and becoming, it is essential that we avoid the role of the hypocrite.<br><br>I have a feeling that it would be a type of hell if we were to stand before the judgment bar of God with the knowledge that we had disappointed our Father in heaven, or with the knowledge that we had fallen short of our foreordination. How awful it would be to know that we hadn't become what we should have become in this life. We are told and warned by many prophets to avoid the hardness of heart and the blindness of mind that damns human progress. In Alma we read:<br><br><i>And thus they have been called to this holy calling on account of their faith, while others would reject the Spirit of God on account of the hardness of their hearts and blindness of their minds, while, if it had not been for this they might have had as great privilege as their brethren.</i>[Alma 13:4]<br><br>So my challenge, my plea to all of you, is to do, is to know, and is to be the kind of person that you should be. Act the role of the Latter-day Saint, be that noble bearer of the priesthood, and do all that's necessary in order to measure up to your Father in heaven's expectations. Then and only then will you be permitted to share in his blessings, to receive the inheritance that he's promised, and to enjoy that joy that will come only in his presence. "Would God," as the ancient prophet said, "that all the Lord's people were prophets, and that the Lord would put his spirit upon them" (Numbers 11:29). Would to God that all of you were prophets, not only the missionary, not only the student, not only the parent, but all of us. What a mighty work could be wrought by God through us.<br><br>May I conclude with a personal experience to help illustrate this becoming process that I've been talking about. Again I emphasize the words "I am if I live properly." Some of you may have heard this experience before, but it bears repeating.<br><br>While serving as a mission president, I had the routine procedure of interviewing missionaries as they came into the mission home. I suspect most mission presidents do this.<br><br>On one occasion a young man from the East came into my office. He sat down, and I began to talk to him. We had known each other for only a few minutes. In the course of our conversation he started to weep. He bowed his head, and the tears flowed from his eyes. I had never seen tears shed so abundantly. The water just dripped on my carpet. I was tempted to measure the spot that he stained, but I didn't think that would be decent. I let him cry. After he had cried himself out, I asked, "What's the trouble?" While he was crying a lot of fears had gone through my heart and through my mind. I thought, "Oh, no, he's transgressed. This is a belated confession. I may have to send him home."<br><br>Well, he anticipated this. He sensed what I was feeling and turned to me and said, "Oh, no, President, it isn't what you're thinking. I haven't murdered or fornicated or done anything like that."<br><br>"Well, what is it?"<br><br>He said, "It's all the little things that I've done during years of growing up. It's all the foolish, little things that come together now as one. They make me feel as though I am unworthy to serve."<br><br>I put my arm around him, assured him that he wasn't the only person in the room who was imperfect, and indicated to him that there were many missionaries serving who had had to overcome problems just as he did. With this assurance I turned to the gospel. I read him some scriptures. The one which particularly influenced him is found in section 84 of the Doctrine and Covenants: "For I will forgive you of your sins with this commandment--that you remain steadfast in your minds in solemnity and the spirit of prayer, in bearing testimony to all the world of those things which are communicated unto you" (D&amp;amp;C 84:61). I said, "Elder, I promise you that, if you will serve properly, if you will live properly, you can go home as clean and sanctified as you would like to go."<br><br>He said, "President, I want that more than anything else. Tell me how I'm supposed to serve."<br><br>I enjoyed telling him exactly what had to be done, starting with the getting up in the morning, holding study class, and I went on and on and on.<br><br>When I was through outlining all the requisities, he turned to me, shot out his hand, and said, "I pledge that I will." And he did. The only complaint I ever received from his mission companions in the next two years was "He's working me to death. I can't stay up with him."<br><br>He concluded his mission; he left his mark on Texas. He reported to the mission home to say his final testimony. As he bore his testimony, he wept a little and then said, "You don't know this, but my father is a patriarch. My father is one of the greatest men that ever lived. He is also one of the most demonstrative people you'll ever find--he kisses everybody. It isn't unusual in my family for my father to come up to me or to someone else, to put his arms around us, and to kiss us and tell us that he loves us. Before my mission I didn't enjoy his embraces nor his kisses. Whenever my father came near and tried to pull me toward him, I wanted to shrink away. I know why--I wasn't worthy of his presence." Then his eyes clouded and he said, "I can't wait until I get home tonight. For the first time in my life I feel worthy of my father's love." What a lesson in that! What a wonderful day it will be to all of us when--if we live properly, if we become what we should become--we can report back to our Father and he feels inclined to embrace us and say to us, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant." What greater treasure, what greater reward could we have than that?<br><br>God bless you all. May you resolve here and now that you will speed up your striving, your becoming process, that you will learn all that's required, do all that you're taught, become quickened through the Holy Spirit, take to yourself the image of God, and become the kind of son or daughter that your Father in heaven expects. That you will do this, so that through you the kingdom of God will grow and flourish upon the earth, is my humble prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Carlos E.

<h1>World Leader - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I'm very grateful indeed, my brothers and sisters, for the privilege of being here. I am thrilled with this great audience, thrilled with the glorious music that you have sung, and deeply impressed with the reading of the scriptures and excerpts from the Declaration ofIndependence and the Constitution of the United States.<br><br>These scriptures are the voice of God to America, they are the voice of God to you and to me here tonight, and they announce that this land is indeed the choicest land in the world, making no exceptions, but those who live in this land and inherit it must serve the God of the land. If we refuse to do this, we must expect to be swept off as the previous civilizations have been.<br><br>The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States were inspired documents, just as were the scriptures that youhave heard.<br><h2><b>Destiny of the United States of America</b></h2><br>As I speak to you here tonight, I would like for you to have in mind that there was only one reason why the United States came into being--only one reason. It is a different reason from anything that we know in any other nation. There is a United States only because God planned to restore the gospel in the last days and he had to have a free country in which to do it, with freedom of worship, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and freedom of assembly.<br><br>He declared that he would make this the greatest nation in the world, and this he has done. Ours is, indeed, the greatest nation on earth, and it was made so by the Almighty himself. It was made so to fulfill the divine destiny given to us by the Lord. That is why the Book of Mormon prophets declared that this land is choice above all other lands in the earth.<br><br>It is the destiny of America which makes her the greatest nation on earth. No other nation was ever conceived and set up as was ours. No other nation has been given a destiny such as ours.<br><br>What is that destiny? You will be surprised when I say this, but it is nevertheless true. Thedestiny of the United States of America is to play an important part in helping to prepare for the second coming of Christ. It is that important. That is the reason the United States was set up.<br><br>The preparation for the second coming of Christ depended largely on the restoration of the gospel. There could not be a restoration of the gospel without freedom. God provided this country as the base of his operations in these, the last days, a place where there would be freedom, where he could restore his gospel. Therefore, the United States was given and is yet to be given a great mission in respect to thesecond coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>God has made the United States the base ofoperations for his work in these modern times, just as he used Palestine as his center of operations in ancient times. We should always keep this clearly in mind. As Palestine was the center of the Lord's operations in ancient times, just so in the same manner is the United States the center of his operations in these days.<br><br>For centuries he preserved this land from colonization by unwanted groups. Then he setup this nation by his own power and for hisown purpose. That purpose was to provide the free conditions under which he could restore his gospel in the last days. Here he gaveus an inspired Constitution so that his church could move forward with full guarantee of freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom of assembly, and freedom of press--all of which were essential to his work.<br><br>Dictatorship is the opposite of free agency. Free agency is part and parcel of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Hence, free agency was required here in America so that God's work could move forward; and so it must, for the day of the Lord draweth nigh and the ultimate destiny of the United States is rapidly emerging.<br><br>Here in the USA the Lord's latter-day Zion has been established already. Here in the USA his latter-day New Jerusalem will yet be established. Here in the USA the Lord will preside during the Millennium. From here will go forththe law and the word of the Lord to all the nations of the earth.<br><br>The restored gospel is already going from this land to all other free nations. It does so under the protection of the United States, and we who travel do so on American passports. Eventually America will be the center of thefinal gathering of God's people as the Millennium approaches, and our flag will fly right on into that blessed time.<br><h2><b>Prophecies About America</b></h2><br>Brigham Young said:<br><br><i>When the day comes in which the Kingdom of God will bear rule, the flag of the United States will proudly flutter unsullied on the flag staff of liberty and equal rights, without a spot to sully its fair surface; the glorious flag our fathers have bequeathed to us will then be unfurled to the breeze by those who have power to hoist it aloft and defend its sanctity.</i>[<i>Discourses of Brigham Young,</i>p. 360]<br><br>So America will not fall. It will have to go through a cleansing, however, so that wickedness may be abolished. But the nation as such will not fall.<br><br>Said President Harold B. Lee:<br><br><i>The Constitution will stand even if it must be saved by the elders of this Church. This nation, founded on the principles laid down by men whom God raised up, will never fail. I have faith in America, and you and I must have faith in America if we understand the teachings of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.</i>[<i>Deseret News,</i>27 October 1973]<br><br>Then President Joseph F. Smith, one of the great, inspired prophets of latter-days, said thisabout the United States:<br><br><i>This great American nation the Almighty raised up by the power of his omnipotent hand, that it might be possible in the latter days for the kingdom of God to be established in the earth. . . . His hand has been over this nation, and it is his purpose and design to enlarge it--make it glorious above all others, and to give it dominion, and power over the earth, to the end that those who are kept in bondage and serfdom may be brought to the enjoyment of the fullest freedom and liberty of conscience possible for intelligent men to exercise in the earth.</i>[<i>Gospel Doctrine,</i>p. 409]<br><br>Speaking of the church and the kingdom of God established here in the United States by the Almighty, President John Taylor said this:<br><br><i>It has been asked whether this kingdom will fail. I tell you in the name of Israel's God it will notfail. I tell you in the name of Israel's God it will roll forth and that the things spoken of by the holy prophets in relation to it will receive their fulfillment.</i>[<i>Gospel Kingdom,</i>p. 137]<br><br>Let us have this clearly in mind: Since the United States was created by act of God to provide a suitable place in which the gospel could be restored and then be sent abroad to the nations of the earth, the Almighty will preserve our country for that purpose. But he will not preserve it in wickedness. Evil must be swept away, and he gives us ample warning to repent. He told the brother of Jared that this land had been "preserved for a righteous people" and declared that "whoso should possess this land of promise, from that time henceforth and forever, should serve him, the true and only God, or they should be swept off" (Ether 2:7, 8).<br><br>Then he said, "This cometh unto you, O ye Gentiles [that means us who live here today], that ye may know the decrees of God--that ye may repent, and not continue in your iniquities until the fulness come, that ye may not bring down the fulness of the wrath of God upon you as the inhabitants of the land have hitherto done" (Ether 2:11).<br><br>So out of his love for America, and out of his desire to have the United States fulfill his divine destiny, God asks us to repent and keep his commandments and thus save our heritage here. Others may sin and go down to destruction, but we who hold his priesthood, we to whom he has committed the stewardship of hislatter-day work, we must never fail. We must never bow down to sin.<br><br>We are the vessels of the Lord, and the vessels of the Lord must be kept pure. We must always realize that freedom, which we call free agency, is a gift of God. Gifts of God come only through obedience. Do you remember how we sing, "Sacrifice brings forth the blessings of heaven"?<br><br>The roots of this nation are deeply imbedded in divine religious principle because our destiny is religious, our destiny is divine. Therefore, that principle must be preserved asthe only means of preserving our nation. Without the gospel America cannot and will not stand. And yet, its destiny is to stand. The gospel is our bulwark; it is our mighty bastion against the devil.<br><h2><b>Attempts to Destroy the United States</b></h2><br>But the devil has declared war against the Saints, (see D&amp;amp;C 76:29), and he has declared war against the United States of America and would destroy it if he could. The scripture says that he will attempt to encompass us round about and seek to destroy us. He would weaken our allegiance to God by luring us intosin, and he would weaken our great nationas a means of destroying the work of God because this nation is essential to the promulgation of the gospel on a worldwide basis.<br><br>Since the devil has declared war against us as a church, and also against this nation which protects the Church, let us see what he has done:<br><br>Organized crime now costs America $37 billion a year. Alcoholism costs America $10 billion a year. Crimes against property and business cost $22 billion a year. Other miscellaneous crimes cost an additional $9 billion a year. Law enforcement alone costs $20 billion ayear. So our annual crime bill in America is now $98 billion a year.<br><br>Crime is increasing in this country twice asfast among juveniles under eighteen years ofage as among people over eighteen. From 1960 to 1974 drug arrests of persons under eighteen years of age increased 4,673 percent and 774 percent for those over eighteen. Violentcrime in America is increasing sixteen times faster than the population growth. Seventy-six percent of all employees in America reportedly steal from their employers. Seventy percent of all inventory losses are due to employee thefts. Considering our judicial system, you will be appalled to learn there is only one conviction for every fifty serious crimes committed.<br><br>Here on the Wasatch Front, shoplifting alone costs $20 million a year. It is incredible, isn't it? Also on the Wasatch Front, forty-eight thousand major crimes were committed last year, an 18 percent increase over the year prior. Do you see how the devil is weakening America by weakening her national character?<br><br>Dishonesty destroys character. The Lord has no place for dishonesty in his kingdom. Dishonest persons who pose as religious people are hypocrites, and no one has received the condemnation of the Lord in quite the degree in which he heaps it upon the hypocrites of his day. If we are to preserve America, we must restore good character and wipe out dishonesty in all its forms. Dishonesty is weakness, crime is weakness, immorality is weakness, butAmerica must be strong.<br><h2><b>Health Problems from Ignoring the Word of Wisdom</b></h2><br>There are other ways also in which the devilis weakening America. They relate to our physical health. Cancer is the number-twocause of death in America, but cigarettes are the number-one cause of lung cancer. Doctor Brian MacMahon of Harvard University School of Public Health has said that completely banning cigarettes would be the most effective way of reducing the death rate from that disease. A recent report from theU.S. Department of Health, Education, andWelfare, published by Dr. Theodore Cooper,brands both tobacco and alcohol as major causes, not only of cancer, but also of heart disease and respiratory troubles.<br><br>A recent edition of<i>Reader's Digest</i>reports that there has been a dramatic increase in deaths from cancer and heart trouble among women who are now smokers. Worse than that, it reports that smoking women are bringing into the world more and more babies with severe birth defects and that because of smoking the infant death rate has now shown a marked increase.<br><br>A British report which I picked up a few days ago in one of the British newspapers confirms the American problem, saying that in Britain there has been a recent increase of 50 percent in the number of babies of smoking mothers being born unusually small or dying soon after birth. It is likewise so in Sweden, where reports show that stillbirths and deaths of children under one year old are now 60 percent higher among smokers than among non-smokers.<br><br>Three death-dealing substances are transmitted to unborn babies by smoking mothers: one, carbon monoxide instead of oxygen; two, nicotine, which greatly increases the speed of the heartbeat of the unborn child and causes itto have high blood pressure; three, cancer-causing agents which enter the bloodstream ofthe unborn child each time the pregnant mother smokes a cigarette. Ninety percent of the pollution caused by smoking remains in the lungs.<br><br>Here is one statistic on beauty: The figures now show that smoking women have more wrinkles than nonsmoking women who are twenty years older.<br><br>Now let us see what alcohol is doing to us.The University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle has recently concluded studies showing that babies born to female alcoholics have a high incidence of birth defects. Some of these infants have small heads; others, stunted bodies; still others, abnormal faces; and a frightening number suffer from low mentalities. Babies born to alcoholic mothers have a mortality rate five times higher than the national average. Of those who do survive almost half are severe mental cases. The<i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>reported recently that a woman with a drinking problem has a 30 to 50 percent chance of giving birth to an abnormal child. The<i>U.S. News and World Report</i>recently indicated that drinking by mothers (this astonished me) is now the third leading cause of mental deficiency among babies. Isn't that frightening?<br><br>Four in every ten motor vehicle deaths are alcohol related. Alcohol is also reported in 64 percent of the murders in the United States, 41 percent of all assaults, 34 percent of all forcible rapes, and 29 percent of all other sex crimes. Alcohol is blamed for at least 41 percent of divorces and broken homes.<br><br>Then there is coffee, the great American drink. A study conducted by the University of Illinois among eight hundred pregnant women in Utah and Idaho showed that heavy coffee drinking in the first three months of pregnancy can severely harm or even kill an unborn child. Six cups of coffee a day consumed by a pregnant mother during the first three months of pregnancy could bring serious and possibly fatal results to the child. But the study also showed that thirteen out of every fourteen women who drank more than seven cups of coffee a day had pregnancies which ended in miscarriage or stillbirth.<br><br>Then there is another plague in America that brings both physical and character degeneracy. I speak of the widespread lowering of moral standards. Sex promiscuity has become so great in America that health officials say venereal disease has now reached epidemic proportions. Venereal disease kills a thousand Americans every month. Fifteen hundred youngsters between fifteen and twenty catch VD every day, and thirteen hundred adults catch VD every day. Most of these cases are not treated medically, and of these cases one in fifteen develops heart trouble, one in twenty-five is crippled, one in fifty goes insane, one in two hundred goes blind. Tie this in with the curse of abortions, and then let us ask what we're doing to the character and physical health of our country.<br><h2><b>America's Need for Faith and Righteous Living</b></h2><br>Then there is the weakness that comes from the encroachment of atheism in our schools. Masquerading under the cloak of anthropology with great emphasis upon evolution, atheism is weakening the religious faith of the nation, and thus it also becomes an ally of the adversary. Isit any wonder that Lincoln, almost prophetically, looked into our future and foretold the perils that would confront us? Speaking to the young men's lyceum of Springfield, Illinois, on the subject of the perpetuity of American institutions, Lincoln said this:<br><br><i>America need not fear danger from without. All the armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa combined with a Bonaparte as a commander could not by force take a drink from the Ohio River or make a track on the Blue Ridge Mountains in a trial of a thousand years. If danger ever threatens the United States, it will come from within. As a nation of free men we must live through all time or die by suicide.</i>[Emil Ludwig,<i>Lincoln,</i>p. 65]<br><br>With prophetic vision Lincoln then spoke of the dangers inherent in mob violence and disregard for law and order, which he said could destroy our country. Then he said this:<br><br><i>How shall we fortify against it? The answer is simple. Let every American, every lover of liberty, every well wisher of his posterity swear by the blood of the revolution never to violate in the least particular the laws of the country and never to tolerate their violation by others. As the patriots of '76 did to support the Declaration of Independence, so to support the Constitution and laws let every American pledge his life, his property, and his sacred honor.</i>[Emil Ludwig,<i>Lincoln,</i>p. 65]<br><br>Lincoln was prophetic. We dare not ignore his warnings.<br><br>Neither may we ignore Daniel Webster in what he said as he addressed the New York Historical Society in 1852. Said he:<br><br><i>If we and our posterity shall be true to the Christian religion, if we and they shall live always in the fear of God and shall respect his commandments, if we and they shall maintain just moral sentiments and such conscientious convictions of liberty as shall control the heart and life, we may have the highest hopes of the future of our country, and we may be sure of one thing--our country will go on prospering. But if we and our posterity reject religious instruction and authority, violate the rules of eternal justice, trifle with the injunctions of morality, and wrecklessly destroy the political Constitution which holds us together, no one can tell how sudden a catastrophe may overwhelm us that shall bury all our memory in profound obscurity.</i><br><br>Is it not a striking coincidence that our national leaders as well as our scriptures both speak of the same thing, that we must obey the God of the land or be swept off? If we fail and take freedom down into the destruction with us the free world will also fall, for we are the greatest protection freedom has among all the nations.<br><h2><b>The United States to Promote World Freedom</b></h2><br>Do you realize that only one-fifth of the world population lives in free countries? Four-fifths of all the people on the earth are held down by dictatorships of one kind or another. All the free nations look to us as the true bastion of liberty. They expect American leadership in the preservation of their own freedom, and they will be severely disappointed if they do not receive it. In the 5 July 1976 issue of the<i>U.S. News and World Report,</i>which is their Bicentennial issue, there is a section on this very subject. The headline says, "World statesmen look to United States leadership in the times ahead." Then they quote James Callaghan, prime minister of Great Britain, who says that America must take the leadership. The president of France, likewise. Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada says, "I do not see any substitute for American leadership." Likewise, Prime Minister Miki of Japan; Helmut Schmidt, the chancellor of West Germany; and Kurt Waldheim, the secretary general of the United Nations. They all look to the United States for leadership in preserving freedom. The only way we can preserve that freedom is to live righteously and serve the God of the land. He calls upon us to repent and do that very thing.<br><br>In this same issue of the<i>U.S. News and World Report</i>Mike Mansfield, the Senate majority leader, is quoted along the same line. He says that great will be America's future. Then he says, "In my judgment the final years of this century are crucial. In their unfolding the United States will be the major factor in shaping life on this planet. What this nation does or does not do will have great relevance to political economy and cultural trends in all parts of the globe."<br><br>Then Mrs. Clare Boothe Luce is quoted in this magazine. You know that she was a former congresswoman, an ambassador for the United States, and is one of the most important of all the leaders in the publication field. She recognizes that there has been a great decline in the power of family and education, particularly in preserving morals and righteousness in America. She says, "Under the impact of science, religion has lost its social authority. Under the impact of technology, family life has disintegrated. The three institutions on which our society up to now has depended to teach observance of law and of traditional moral codes are religion, the family, and education." She calls for renewed emphasis on all three. Then what must we do? As American citizens, we must reestablish true loyalty to our country and to the divine principles that made it great. As members of the Church, we must rededicate ourselves to the principles of the gospel and the great cause for which the Lord in the first place created the United States.<br><br>I have in my hand here the oath that the new citizens of the United States take. Quite a number of these immigrants became citizens ofthe United States today. Special ceremonies were held for them since this was the Fourth of July, but of course thousands of them take this oath continually. The oath says this:<br><br><i>I hereby declare on oath that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty of whom or of which I heretofore have been a subject or citizen, that I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies.</i><br><br>As I read this over each time, I wonder why we expect more of immigrants coming into America than we expect of ourselves? If we are going to require them to take an oath of allegiance to the United States that they will sustain the Constitution and that they will defend it against all enemies of every description why do we not take that same oath to ourselves? We must resist all forms of evil, even as we expect them to, inasmuch as Lincoln said what I certainly believe: that no outside power by force could take over our land. If decay comes, it willcome from within. It is sin and crime, corruption, and allegiance to such things as Communism which will eat out our very vitalsand weaken us to the point where, if weallow it to continue, this nation could fall.<br><br>Thomas Jefferson in his second inaugural address asked Americans to seek after the Lord as a means of safeguarding our country. He knew that God had given America its birth andhe, like Washington and others of that day, knew that the perpetuity rested upon its righteousness and its obedience to the God of the land. Therefore, in his inaugural address he said:<br><br>[We]<i>shall need the favor of that Being in whose hands we are, who led our fathers as Israel of old from their native land and planted them in a country flowing with all the necessaries and comforts of life, who has covered our national infancy with providence and our riper years with his wisdom and power and to whose goodness I ask you to join in supplication with me that he will enlighten the minds of your servants, guide their councils, and prosper their measures that whatsoever they do shallresult in good and shall secure to you the peace, friendship, and approbation of all nations.</i><br><br>So now we must take upon ourselves our spiritual armor and with the shield of good character fight valiantly against the powers of evil that threaten us. We must fight the good fight. We must finish our course. We must keep the faith. We must never shrink from this great responsibility. The enemy is all about us. If we can only sense the dangers that confront us, without hesitation we will pledge to this great purpose our lives, our property, and our sacred honor. "So conquer we must, when our cause it is just, and this be our motto: 'In God is our trust!'" When we win this conflict, we may then justly sing: "Blest with victory and peace, may the heaven-rescued land praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation!"<br><br>I close with this humble and simple prayer:<br><br><i>Our fathers' God to thee,</i><i>Author of liberty,</i><i>To thee we sing.</i><i>Long may our land be bright</i><i>With freedom's holy light.</i><i>Protect us by thy might,</i><i>Great God, our King!</i><br><br>In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Mark E. Petersen was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at BYU on 4 July 1976.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1> about Thoughts - Dean L. Larsen - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It's a privilege, brothers and sisters, to join with you this morning for this devotional assembly. I'm really not a stranger to the BYU campus. I've been enrolled here as a graduate student. We have two daughters who have been students here at BYU and one daughter-in-law and one son-in-law who will be graduating at the conclusion of this Summer Term.<br><br>I have no real difficulty in identifying with any of the colleges and universities in the northern part of the state. I began my college education at the University of Utah with a basketball scholarship there. I later transferred to Utah State University, where I was graduated. I've also taught at the institute adjacent to the Weber State College campus. So I have no problem in dividing my loyalties among these schools, all of which are excellent institutions.<br><h2><b>The Power of Thoughts</b></h2><br>I would like to share with you this morning some thoughts about thoughts. While serving as a mission president, I was interested in the frequency with which missionaries in our personal interviews would ask me this question: "President, how do I control my thoughts?" In that intensive environment, where a keen level of spirituality was so essential to the success of the missionaries, it didn't take long for these young men and young women to realize that a high level of spiritual power was necessary for them in order to succeed and that thoughts were very instrumental in the acquisition of that power and influence.<br><br>I've been intrigued for many years about thoughts and the compelling power of thoughts. In the children's classic<i>The Secret Garden</i>by Frances Hodges Burnette, Mrs. Burnette gives us these observations in children's language:<br><br><i>One of the new things people began to find out in the last century was that thoughts, just mere thoughts, were as powerful as electric batteries, as good for one as sunlight is, or as bad for one as poison is. To let a sad thought or a bad thought get into your mind is as dangerous as letting a scarlet fever germ get into your body. If you let it stay there after it has got in, you may never get over it so long as you live.</i><br><br>Thoughts have a great deal to do with how we live, whether we're enthusiastic or depressed, whether we enjoy success or experience a degree of failure, whether we enjoy spirituality or suffer from a lack of it, and in many respects, I believe, whether we are obedient or disobedient to the laws of God. Some modern behaviorists have indicated that the human thought process is very much like the operation of a computer where the conscious and subconscious mind is concerned. The input which we take into that process has much to do with the output in terms of attitude, mood, and behavior. The Lord has recognized the great power of thoughts, and he warned those whom he addressed in his Sermon on the Mount against the influence of evil or negative thoughts. Proverbs tells us that as a man "thinketh in his heart, so is he" (Proverbs 23:7). To paraphrase that slightly, I think it would be very accurate to say that, as a man persists in his thinking, so he will become. There is that kind of power in thoughts.<br><br>The Lord has even indicated that we will be judged in some measure on the basis of our thoughts. In the Doctrine and Covenants, section 88, he describes the ushering in of the millennial period and the summoning forth for judgment of all those who have inhabited the earth during its millennia of existence. He describes those who lived upon the earth in the first thousand years who are called forth by the sounding of a trump. He also says, "And then shall the second angel sound his trump, and reveal the secret acts of men, and the thoughts and intents of their hearts, and the mighty works of God in the second thousand years" (D&amp;amp;C 88:109). "As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he."<br><h2><b>The Thought Process</b></h2><br>How do we control this awesome power? How do we use it not only to prevent and defend ourselves from the possible detrimental and evil influence of bad thoughts, but also to utilize this great power to achieve the fulfillment of life's purpose for us here as the Lord would have us do? I remember vividly a description which Elder Marion D. Hanks gave at one time of one's thought processes. Elder Hanks pointed out that we have two compartments in our thinking apparatus. He referred to the one as a foyer or antechamber, and he indicated that none of us really has complete power over the impulses, the fleeting thoughts, that come into that antechamber area. We are prompted by things that we may see or hear or smell, those impulses that come constantly into a mind that is ever active. Then Elder Hanks pointed out that, as unwelcome visitors in our home where we live, we have the power to usher out almost instantaneously those negative thoughts which come into that antechamber. It's very essential that we develop the capacity to do this. Elder Hanks also pointed out that, when we have made that kind of sorting out of the thought impulses that come to us, we invite into the living room of our thoughts and to our hearts, as it were, those thoughts that will do us good and prompt us to do the things that are right. That illustration has been helpful to me in developing some discipline and capacity to control thoughts and to avoid the negative, as well as to invite that which is constructive and positive and good. It requires great discipline to take the greatest advantage of the thought process.<br><br>I learned in the mission field, as many of you who have served missions will know, that an interesting phenomenon occurs with missionaries who are assigned to an area where immediate success may not be attached to their work. Occasionally missionaries would call me or write to me and say, "President, we have worked this area out. There is no one here we can baptize." I had to agree with what they said because, when they came to that conclusion, they indeed could<i>not</i>find anyone. Generally I made an immediate transfer of those missionaries from that area. It was always interesting and curious to note that those who replaced them, if their thoughts were right and if the data being fed into their computers were correct, would often go out and find great success where the others had failed.<br><br>I've learned that our moods, our attitudes toward daily living and toward each other, are in large measure regulated by our thoughts. I believe, to a large degree, I can control whether or not I am happy today or unhappy, whether I'm enthusiastic about my possibilities or depressed and negative. I've discovered, as perhaps you have, that if I allow myself to slip into a pattern of negative, depressed thinking--although my circumstances have not changed--I can make myself very unhappy and make my prospects seem extremely dim. I can reverse that almost as easily by replacing those thoughts with others that are constructive.<br><br>Let me relate another sentence or two from Mrs. Burnette's observations in this same children's classic I referred to above. She tells about a boy, Colin, who is one of the interesting characters in this story:<br><br><i>So long as Colin shut himself up in his room and thought only of his fears and weaknesses and his detestation of people who looked at him and reflected hourly on humps and early death, he was a hysterical, half-crazy little hypochondriac who knew nothing of the sunshine and the spring and also did not know that he could get well and stand upon his feet if he tried to do it. When new, beautiful thoughts began to push out the old, hideous ones, life began to come back and his blood ran healthfully through his veins and strength poured into him like a flood. His scientific experiment was quite practical and simple. There was nothing weird about it at all. Much more surprising things can happen to anyone who, when a disagreeable or discouraged thought comes into his mind, just has the sense to remember in time and push it out by putting in an agreeable, determinedly courageous one. Two things cannot be in one place. Where you tend a rose, my lad, a thistle cannot grow.</i><br><h2><b>Negative Versus Constructive Thinking</b></h2><br>I've heard counsel given with regard to devices that might be used to protect us temporarily from the effects of bad thoughts or evil thoughts. I've heard the suggestion that we might sing a song, a phrase from a Latter-day Saint hymn, or recite some poetry or some verses of scripture. But this, in reality, is a defensive stance. One cannot always be on defense against evil thoughts. One must assume the offense. The best way I've learned to achieve this is to practice sustained, constructive thinking. That's an exercise, brothers and sisters, that requires as much training and as much conditioning as the physical endurance required to run a long-distance race. I commend to you this morning the "exercise" of sustained constructive thinking.<br><br>As a mission president I traveled great distances over the state of Texas. (You can drive a long way in the state of Texas!) I used to spend many hours traveling alone, going from one missionary meeting or one set of interviews to another in the automobile that was provided for us. There was a lot of time to think, and many thoughts come in a situation of that kind. I discovered that it was a very helpful thing for me (and later very useful) if I used that time to practice organizing talks that I could give, forming associations of scriptural ideas and principles that would be helpful to me in expressing these relationships to others. Some of the best talks you'll never hear, I gave to myself as I drove from one place to another in southern Texas. I recommend that process to you. In order to sustain constructive thinking, it's necessary for us to have something worthwhile to think about, to have in reserve, as it were, some items, some problems, some challenges, to which we can turn our minds, to think our way through to a solution. I've discovered in my own life that that's the best way to obtain inspiration and whatever degree of revelation we are entitled to.<br><br>I think of the account Enos gives in the Book of Mormon. Enos, on a day when he apparently was free and had set out for a purpose somewhat different from the result that was achieved, was alone hunting for beasts. But his thoughts began to run upon the things that he had heard his father say with regard to eternal life: "Behold, I went to hunt beasts in the forests; and the words which I had often heard my father speak concerning eternal life, and the joy of the saints, sunk deep into my heart" (Enos 3). They went into the living room of his thoughts where the greatest effect can be found. Then Enos had some marvelous experiences as he focused his thoughts upon the acquisition of a blessing from God. One who has not shared that experience with Enos, who has not reached out to the extent of his own thinking ability and then found the union that's possible with the pure intelligence which will respond to that kind of effort, has missed a great experience. I testify to you that the Lord responds to that kind of thinking. Anyone who will reach out with the thought of his heart and all the intent of his heart for that kind of acquisition will not go wanting.<br><br>Not long ago I had a young lady come to my office who was engaged and soon to be married. As we talked about a number of things, she said, "How can I be sure, now, having gone through this experience of my life where I've had some tentative attachments to a number of young men and where I've been exploring and considering many possibilities and have made a lasting choice of an eternal companion, that I can focus all my loyalties with him, that I can be true, not only in deed but also in my thoughts and the intents of my heart?" I talked with her about the great need for discipline, for disciplining one's thoughts, for never considering any other possibilities. One must control his thoughts if he's to achieve that.<br><h2><b>Scriptural Lessons about Thoughts</b></h2><br>One of the greatest lessons taught in all of the literature available to us with regard to the power of thought is the story of King David in the Old Testament. As a young man, David demonstrated a courage and a strength and a power that likely has not been equaled in all of the great characters of the scriptures. He fought with wild beasts and overcame them, defeated the giant Goliath virtually with his hands, and then served through many years as the leader of Israel and demonstrated in the process tremendous control, tremendous discipline. The greatest enemy he had, perhaps, through most of these years--at least the greatest threat to his existence--was the man Saul. Yet on several occasions when David could have removed this threat by taking the life of Saul, who was in his hands, he withheld and controlled those impulses. That demonstrated tremendous power and control. Then later in his life, as a mature man with all the strength that kind of life had brought him, David was unwise. It was not because David was weak that he fell. He was unwise. I suspect that David had reached the point where he felt he was strong enough to indulge the entertainment of some enticing possibilities. On the day he stood on his rooftop and observed the wife of one of his officers, instead of taking himself by the nape of the neck, so to speak, and saying, "David, get out of here!" David remained. David thought about the possibilities, and those thoughts overcame David and eventually controlled him. One of the saddest entries in all of our scripture, I think, is that which the Lord gave the Prophet Joseph Smith in section 132 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Speaking of David's situation today, he said, "For he hath fallen from his exaltation, and received his portion" (D&amp;amp;C 132:39). And then, with reference to David's wives and families, the Lord said, "For I gave them unto another, saith the Lord" (D&amp;amp;C 132:39). David, King David, one of the great and powerful men of the Old Testament times, could have been today among the gods if he had controlled his thoughts.<br><br>There is compelling power in thoughts. There is compelling strength in thoughts that will bring to us the things that are good. The Savior, as he spoke to some of his followers in Jerusalem, made this observation: "For out of the abundance of the heart [I suspect he had reference here to the living room of our mind to which Elder Hanks made reference] the mouth speaketh. A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things" (Matthew 12:34–35). He also said, "For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies" (Matthew 15:19). It's no wonder then that the Savior would warn that one who entertained these things in his mind, in his thoughts, was guilty of something approaching the very act and would indeed, if he sustained those kinds of thoughts, become guilty of the act.<br><br>In his final challenge and admonition to us, Moroni indicated the power and the promise of pondering things in our hearts. He said, "Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember . . ." (Moroni 10:3). Then he went on and made reference to the things that had transpired and said, "Even down unto the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts" (Moroni 10:3). That is an exercise. That's a labor, brothers and sisters. That's some of the most engaging and difficult work that you can do--pondering these things in your hearts. Moroni then made the promise with regard to the blessing of testimony through the power and the influence of the Holy Ghost.<br><h2><b>The Blessings of Constructive Thinking</b></h2><br>I would like to bear testimony to you today, brothers and sisters, that there is great power in thoughts and that, if we will exercise control and develop the discipline which is needed to sustain positive, constructive thinking, there will be great blessings come into our lives.<br><br>One of the young missionaries who came into our mission shortly before we left, in one of the last testimony meetings that Sister Larsen and I attended with our missionaries, bore a testimony which was simple, yet profound. The more I contemplate it, the more profound it becomes to me. He said, "I've learned already, having been in the mission field only several weeks, that the gospel is just as true for those who reject it as it is for those who accept it." I'm sure this young man had in mind that in the great body of eternal principles which comprise the gospel of Jesus Christ there are forces at work which inevitably react in one way or another upon our lives--depending, in great measure, upon how we think about them. He meant, I'm sure, that in whatever we think, in whatever we say, in whatever we do, we evoke from those eternal principles some response for good or ill which inevitably reflects itself in the very nature of our own souls.<br><br>We testify to one another regularly that the gospel of Jesus Christ is true, and it<i>is</i>true. It is truly the gospel of Jesus Christ, as opposed to any other life systems or life plans that may have been advanced by other men. It is truly his gospel. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is truly the church of Jesus Christ, as opposed to other organizations that may have been contrived by men. The gospel is true in that it will yield to us from those principles, according to the way we think and act and feel, those things which have been promised to us. In that sense, my brothers and sisters, the gospel of Jesus Christ is also true--irrevocably, unyieldingly, everlastingly true.<br><br>May we be blessed with the power to control our thoughts that the most productive benefits can come to us as a result. May we be blessed with a desire to guide our thoughts into those channels where loyalties to things that are good and true will be sustained, where evil can be avoided, and where the promises of the Lord which he has made to all of us who are faithful will one day be ours. That we may enjoy his presence in the eternities to come and be recipients of all the power and the glory that he's promised to those of us who are faithful, I pray. I invoke the Lord's blessings upon all of you, in your endeavors here, to improve your capacities and your talents and to regulate your thoughts, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Dean L.

<h1> Talent Exceeds Spirituality - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
On the way over here I thought of a fellow up in Idaho who moved into a ward. He had a wooden leg from the knee down. No one ever found out how he got this wooden leg or what happened to his own leg. The Saints talked about it a lot, but never to him. Finally, after about three weeks, two or three of the sisters were talking together, and one of them said, "My curiosity just won't let me rest. I've got to ask him how he got his wooden leg. I'm just going to go over and ask him."<br><br>So when he came through the door in the foyer, she walked up and said, "Do you mind if I ask you a question?"<br><br>And he said, "No, if you promise to ask only one."<br><br>She said, "Very well, then. How did you lose your leg?"<br><br>And he said, "It was chewed off." Life is full of surprising answers.<br><br>Some time back, a fellow who collected chime clocks happened to pick up one to go along with the rest of his collection. He had many chime clocks that were distributed throughout his house. Each night after he got a new clock he would put it in the bedroom, and then he would listen to the chimes going off during the night. After he and his wife had settled down and the clock began to chime, he remembered counting up to ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen. He shook his wife and said, "Wake up, Ma, it's later than I've ever known it to be."<br><br>I think I would like to talk to you about a subject that is relative to "it's later than I've ever known it to be."<br><br>I attended a conference with Elder Bruce McConkie up in Grace, Idaho, in 1967, where I had the privilege of speaking. As I finished speaking, he stood up and took the remainder of the time. He said something like this--and I'm not exactly sure of the words, but the thought is the same--"No other talent exceeds spirituality." So I'd like to talk to you and use that as my theme this evening: No other talent exceeds spirituality.<br><h2><b>Daily Thoughts about Spirituality</b></h2><br>Now, if that is true, how then do we gain spirituality? Tonight we heard this lovely soloist and the accompanist. It takes talent to produce the kind of music that they rendered. We hear great orators, we view tremendous paintings, and we see great drama productions--all demanding great talent. And yet, no other talent exceeds spirituality. How do you gain spirituality?<br><br>During the past almost nine years since I heard that statement, there has hardly been a day go by that I haven't thought of the talent of spirituality. There are several subjects I believe I think of every single day. One is purity of heart. Another one came in the form of a question from President Romney, who said to me at a conference one time: "Brother Featherstone, do you think the brethren of the priesthood will ever come to understand that they were born to serve their fellowmen?" And the other thought I think of daily is that no other talent exceeds spirituality. I believe that hardly a day goes by that I don't think of these three statements.<br><h2><b>Service with Humility</b></h2><br>I have several suggestions for gaining spirituality. I'd like to start first with service. I believe if you really want to be spiritual, you must first make a commitment and a decision to serve the Lord's children. If you cannot make that commitment, I don't believe you will be able to gain the level of spirituality that is necessary in this life to achieve all that we want to achieve. I attended a conference over in Hawaii, and after the conference several young people came up to shake hands. One young man came up to me and asked, "Bishop Featherstone, would you tell me how I can gain humility?" Well, you know, we take an entire life studying about humility. How do you gain humility?<br><br>I said, "Well, I have some ideas on it. But it would take longer than we've got here. But maybe in a sentence or two, I could say this: When you think you've got it, you've lost it." Then I said, "Think of the most humble person on the face of the earth. Who is that?"<br><br>He said, "I suppose it's President Kimball."<br><br>And I said, "I think you're right. What do you think he does more than any other person on the face of the earth?"<br><br>He thought for a minute, then said, "I don't know."<br><br>Then I said, "I believe it's service. I believe President Kimball is totally committed to service. If you want to be humble, you serve with every particle of your being."<br><br>I believe humility and spirituality go hand in hand, and I believe service has to be part of it. While I served in Boise, Idaho, on the high council, I was called to be a home teacher to a man by the name of Archie; so we went to see Archie. He was a member of the Church, but I doubt he had been in the Church since he was baptized. His wife wasn't a member of the Church. My son Scott, who had not been a home teacher before, went with me to his home. I remember knocking on the door. The man came to the door with a can of beer in one hand and a cigarette in the other, and he said, "Yes? Can I help you?"<br><br>I said, "We're your new home teachers. My name is Vaughn Featherstone, and this is my son, Scott."<br><br>And he said, "Yes?"<br><br>And I said, "We realize it is inopportune to come at this time without an appointment, but we just wanted to visit long enough to make an appointment, and we'll try not to overstay our welcome. We'll be courteous and considerate of your time. But have you got a few minutes?"<br><br>And he said, "Come in."<br><br>And so we went inside, but he didn't invite us to sit down. So we stood there for about five or ten minutes, and I said, "We'd like to visit you at least once a month and see how everything is going. Then, if you need anything, we'll give you our phone number so you can call us." So I left that instruction for him, and I said, "What would be a good night to come?"<br><br>He said, "Normally, Thursdays I'm home. I don't have union meetings or other things on Thursday, so I'd normally be home if you want to come."<br><br>I said, "We'll plan on coming the first Thursday of each month."<br><br>He said, "Very good, then."<br><br>So we shook hands and we left. When we got outside, I said to Scott, "I hope you got a chance to look around the house while you were in there to see if he had any hobbies or anything from which we might gain a common ground of interest."<br><br>Scott said, "Dad, I didn't even dare look."<br><br>I said, "All right, we'll be back on the first Thursday, and when we go in I'll give a little discussion and you be looking around the house."<br><br>So, on the first Thursday of the month, we prepared, we had a prayer, and then we drove down and parked in front of his home. We knocked on the door. Just before we had come to the door, I said, "Now, Scott, you look around, and if you see something which might be a hobby, give me a signal with your eyes and I'll know that you've seen something. I'll look in that direction to see what his hobby is." So we got inside and sat down, and the television was behind me. He had me sit with my back to the television and he sat facing it. He could look over my shoulder at the television. He didn't turn it down very much--just one- nineteenth of a turn, and so the sound was still pretty loud. Finally his wife got up and walked over and turned it down. I could see that he was just a little annoyed. I gave a little discussion that I didn't think would be offensive, then I looked over at Scott to see if he could give me a signal that he had seen some indication of a hobby. He just shrugged his shoulders. So I got the signal that Scott could not get a clue as to whether he had a hobby or not.<br><br>I said, "Well, fine, Archie, we'll be back to see you and your wife again on the first Thursday--unless you need me, and then give me a call. I'll tell the bishop everything is all right at your home."<br><br>We got up to leave, and when we got to the door, right by the door was a big picture of a sheriff's posse. As we walked out I said, "Archie, are you a member of that sheriff's posse?"<br><br>And he said, "No, I'm not a member of that posse. If you'll look closely, you'll see that that's the Ada County Junior Sheriff's Posse. They're all teenagers."<br><br>And I looked closely.<br><br>"In fact," he said, "this little gal here, Sandy Thompson, is in your seminary class."<br><br>I said, "She certainly is."<br><br>And we looked at the picture and talked for a minute. I said, "How did you know that I taught seminary?"<br><br>He said, "I was down to the arena where we do our training with the horses and they do their routines. I happened to mention to a friend that we had a new home teacher from the Mormon church named Featherstone. That's kind of a funny name." Then Archie told us that Sandy Thompson happened to hear it and said, "Did you say Featherstone, Vaughn Featherstone?"<br><br>Archie said, "Yes."<br><br>"And he's your home teacher now?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Well, I think you'll like him. He's my seminary teacher. He teaches early morning seminary, and we like him."<br><br>And so I guess that helped the next time to give us a little better footing as we got into Archie's home. Anyway, we'd broken the ice with him. He started to talk about the junior sheriff's posse. He got more and more excited, and after about ten minutes of telling us all about the sheriff's posse, I said, "Archie, we'd love to come watch you do your routines sometime. Where do you do your training?" And he told me. I said, "I'd like to talk to you more about it, but we shouldn't overstay our welcome tonight."<br><br>He said, "Hold on, before you leave I want to tell you something. Do you know what we're going to do? We're going to buy black lighting. Can you imagine what it would be like to have all these horseback riders in the posse in iridescent shirts and hats, with the horses' hooves and bridles painted with iridescent paint? Then we will turn off all the lights in the stadium and turn on the black lighting. You won't even see the horses except their hooves. And you won't even see anything of the riders except their shirts or blouses, or a hat. It would really be impressive. It would be the finest thing done in western Idaho!"<br><br>You know, I got a little excited just listening to him. I said, "You know, that's a great idea. Have you got your black lighting?"<br><br>And his chin dropped an inch. He said, "Not yet, but we're going to get it."<br><br>I said, "How much have you saved for it? How much money have you earned?"<br><br>He said, after his chin dropped a little bit more, "Well, actually, we haven't earned anything yet, but we're going to earn it."<br><br>I said, "How are you going to raise the money?"<br><br>And his chin dropped again. I was really hitting him in the right places. He said, "Actually, we don't know. We don't know how to raise the money."<br><br>I said, "How much do you have to raise?"<br><br>He said, "Twelve hundred dollars is what it will cost."<br><br>"You don't know how to raise the money but you have to raise twelve hundred dollars? You want black lighting for next year, and you don't know what to do?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>I said, "How would you like me to volunteer to be the Ada County Junior Sheriff's Posse finance chairman?"<br><br>And he said, "Oh, you don't want to do that, do you?"<br><br>I lied and said, "Yes."<br><br>He said, "All right. You decide how you want us to help you."<br><br>I said, "I'll go home and work out a program and come back. You have all of your committee there, and we'll expose them to a plan to raise the money."<br><br>So I went home and sat up late that night. I figured out a way to raise the money. Next Wednesday I called him up and said, "Archie, we've got a plan. Can you have all the committee down there on Thursday night? If they like the plan, we'll raise the money this way."<br><br>So Thursday night came, and Scott and I went down. Here were about fifteen people milling around--and I guess we were the only two Mormons except Archie in the entire group. There was a card table with coffee cups, two big urns of coffee, and two glasses of milk. I tell you, Scott and I got there quick in case one of the coffee drinkers might change his mind and decide the milk looked good.<br><br>Anyway, we milled around and talked for a minute. Then Archie said, "I have my home teacher from the Mormon church. He's volunteered to be our finance chairman to raise the money for our black lighting. He's got a program here to present to us." Archie turned the time over to me, and I had the plan on large paper cards. I went through my presentation. Then I said, "Well, what do you think?"<br><br>He said, "That's great! That's the way we ought to raise the money. But we made a mistake. You know, I told you it was twelve hundred dollars?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"It isn't twelve hundred dollars. It's actually eighteen hundred dollars. I called Idaho Power, and they said it would cost us about eighteen hundred dollars for the lighting materials we want."<br><br>I said, "Well, that doesn't make any difference. It only changes one figure, and we can do that. It won't create any more work. You see, we were going to go to four of the large corporations and ask each one of them for $300, and four times $300 is $1,200. So we'll just change that $300 to $450. But I do have one request that I'll need if we are going to raise the money this way. I'd like Archie to go with me to these four large corporations to help raise the money in case someone asks technical questions that I can't answer."<br><br>He said, "I'd be glad to go."<br><br>So, having been employed by Albertson's, I thought, "They're a large corporation with their national headquarters in Boise." At that time Bob Bolinder, a member of the Church on the high council in the neighboring stake, was the executive vice-president. I made an appointment with him, and then I called Archie. I put on the best suit I had that morning, and we got ready to go meet with Bob Bolinder at eight o'clock.<br><br>At eight o'clock Archie came in, and he had on his painting uniform--he was a painter.<br><br>I said, "Archie, let's go."<br><br>So we went in, and Bob was very kind. We sat down in his office and went through our presentation. I could see the mental wheels turning. The company normally wouldn't give to this kind of a charity. I could see him trying to figure out how to turn us down.<br><br>I said, "Bob, before you make a decision, I just want you to know I home teach this man."<br><br>Bob said, "You'll get your money." So we got $450 there.<br><br>Then we went to Boise Cascade and made an appointment with Robert Hansburger, at that time the chief executive officer for Boise Cascade. His office was on the very top floor of the Idaho Bank Building. The office provided a view over the whole north part of the community. We went up, and again I dressed in the best clothing I had, and Archie came in his painting uniform. We went up to the plush executive offices, and in a minute we were welcomed in. We sat down in front of a large black desk; the room was furnished in huge overstuffed black leather chairs and matching furniture. Robert Hansburger said, "You gentlemen want to make a presentation to me?"<br><br>I said, "That's right."<br><br>So I went through this presentation, and when we finished, he said, "I want you to know that's an excellent presentation. Go down to our personnel department and ask them for the money. If they won't give it to you, I'll write out a personal check for $450."<br><br>Well, that provided a lot of confidence as we went downstairs to the personnel department. I knew the personnel director. I said, "Mike, we've been asked by Mr. Hansburger to make this presentation to you." When we finished, I said, "Mike, before you make up your mind whether you can give us the money or not, I want you to know Mr. Hansburger said if you wouldn't give us the money he would write us out a personal check."<br><br>He said, "You can have your $450."<br><br>Then we went to Morrison Knudsen, and they were very kind. We talked to Mr. Perkins, the president of the company. He gave us $450.<br><br>Then we went to the Jack Simplot Company. Jack was tremendous. I can't tell you what kind of language he used, but he was great. So Jack Simplot gave us the money, and we had eighteen hundred dollars.<br><br>A while later the Ada County Junior Sheriff's Posse had a fall banquet at the conclusion of their season. Since I was a member of the committee, I was invited to the banquet. After they finished the dinner, one of the girls, who was chairman of the evening's affair, stood up and said, "We'd like to make a special award tonight." She reached down and grabbed a beautifully wrapped package from underneath the table. She said, "Archie, would you come up here?"<br><br>So Archie stood up and went to the podium and stood there by her. She handed him a gift and said, "Would you please unwrap it?"<br><br>So he unwrapped it, and there was this beautiful plaque: "To our good friend Archie, chairman of the Ada County Junior Sheriff's Posse." I saw this hard, crusty Archie begin to weep. Tears streamed down his cheeks. I got a little emotional as I sat there.<br><br>Pretty soon someone at the dinner said, "Speech! Speech!"<br><br>Well, Archie couldn't have spoken if his life had depended on it. He just came and sat down by me.<br><br>So then the emcee said, "Now we've got another award we want to give." She reached down under the pulpit again for a smaller package. She said, "Vaughn Featherstone, would you come up here?" I went over and unwrapped a little shield with a horse's head projecting from it. The shield was inscribed with a thanks for my being chairman of the finance committee. I started to weep. I'd never been given an award for home teaching before.<br><br>Then probably the same person called out, "Speech! Speech!" Well, I usually can say something, but that night I was so filled with emotion I couldn't say anything. I just sat down by Archie.<br><br>I gained a spiritual experience from serving Archie Turner. I had an experience that I'll never forget in my life. It's as though it happened yesterday. I know how close I felt we had to be as we went to each of those organizations. I prayed, and I prayed fervently that everything would go right. And it seemed to go all right. So I know if you're going to have increased spirituality you must give of yourself through service.<br><h2><b>Service in the Leper Colony</b></h2><br>Some time back I also had the privilege of touring the Hawaiian Mission. We asked a particular person to make an itinerary for us. As I looked at the itinerary, I said, "Well, you don't have us scheduled to go to Kaulapapa, the leper colony on Molokai."<br><br>The person said, "Well, Bishop Featherstone, there are only thirteen members in the leper colony, and we haven't had a General Authority there for about seven years. Really, we don't have time. The only way you can get down is to walk down a steep three-hour trail--or we can charter a plane."<br><br>I said, "I believe if the Savior came to tour this mission, the first place he would go would be to the leper colony. You get us into the leper colony."<br><br>He said, "I'll do my best."<br><br>I said, "No, not your best. Just do it. We want to go."<br><br>So he made the arrangements, and on Friday morning the mission president, President Ruth Funk and her husband, and I met out at the airport. The mission had chartered a little plane. I remember climbing aboard the airplane, and, as I recall, there were no seats in it. We sat on duffel bags in the back. I think they wired the door closed. Of course, there was no concern on our part; we were on the Lord's errand. The plane lifted off, and we flew across the ocean to the island of Molokai. We came around the Kaulapapa peninsula. We landed on a little dirt landing field where the weeds had grown high. As we taxied in, all thirteen lepers who were members of the Church were standing there waiting to meet us. I guess it was one of the most humbling experiences I've ever had in my life. We climbed off the plane and went over to them. Most wore large glasses so you couldn't see their faces. Some had the appearance that they had been mutilated where the skin had sloughed away due to the disease. They held their hands back under their arms so we couldn't see them, and they wore heavy coats.<br><br>As we walked up to them, we didn't know whether or not the disease was arrested. That really wasn't important to us. I remember reaching out to shake hands; they acted as if they didn't want to shake hands. Maybe they were afraid for us to touch them. But we insisted. Each one of us, Sister Funk and her husband, myself, and the mission president, cupped their little mutilated hands in our hands, walked down the line, and shook hands with each one of them.<br><br>We got to the very end man, and his name was Jack Sing. He's the branch president. He had come to pick us up in his 1951 Cadillac. He had bought it new, it had five thousand miles on it, and it was absolutely immaculate, inside and outside. I guess the only place they drive it is out to the airport once every seven years or so. We climbed in, and he took us to the chapel. On the way I said, "Jack, how long have you been branch president?"<br><br>He said, "Well, I've been in the colony fifty-two years. My wife came after I'd been here thirty years. She's been here twenty-two years."<br><br>I asked, "What proportion of that time have you served as branch president?"<br><br>He thought and he thought, and then said, "I don't remember."<br><br>I said, "Think. It's really important to me."<br><br>And again he thought. Finally he said, "I just can't remember."<br><br>I doubt there are many bishops or branch presidents who wouldn't remember how long they'd been serving.<br><br>Anyway, we got to the chapel and climbed out of the car. Here was this little LDS church for the leper colony, a quaint little peaked chapel, very simple. On the grounds it looked as if they'd taken scissors and clipped the edge of the lawn around the cobblestones and the little sidewalk. It looked as if they'd taken the dirt and crumbled it in their hands. Every single flower bed was sweet and fresh. It looked as if they'd even picked the dead leaves off each of the tropical plants. Then we went inside. There was a clean, immaculate chapel with a large row of pews down one side with a pulpit at the front, then a large wide aisle down the middle, and then another row of pews with a pulpit at the back on the other side. The lepers would sit on one side and conduct their services, and those who were not leprous would sit on the other side and conduct services. It was very interesting.<br><br>As we entered, I thought about lepers in the Savior's time. I suppose even now in some parts of the world, if one has leprosy, he has to cry out, "Unclean! Unclean!" Inside my heart something started welling forth, and I thought, "What a travesty of life! Why isn't it that the peddler of pornography, the adulterer, and the fornicator have to cry out, 'Unclean! Unclean!' instead of some of the sweetest and purest Saints I have ever met in my life?"<br><br>We drove back out to the airport and boarded the plane. As we lifted off the landing strip, I believe all thirteen members were there to see us off. It had been a great spiritual experience. But again, I believe it was simple in service, and, I believe, if we want to be spiritual, we'd better learn to serve.<br><h2><b>Charity</b></h2><br>I think another thing we've got to have if we're going to have spirituality is charity. You remember that "charity covereth a multitude of sins." Over at the Sweden area conference, Elder Howard W. Hunter told a story that impressed me greatly. He said that up in British Columbia the police department had collected many bikes over a period of time. Every six months they had an auction and auctioned off all these bikes. At one of these auctions, the auctioneer started auctioning off the bikes. Have you ever noticed how something all of a sudden starts making a pattern in your mind? Well, the auctioneer noticed that every time they'd bring a bike out and he would say, "Who will start the bidding?" a little boy on the front row would say, "I bid one dollar, sir." And then the bidding would go up beyond that. He noticed that the little boy would be the first one to bid. He'd bid one dollar. He noticed the little boy's eyes would particularly sparkle and all the hope would well up within him when a racer bike would be brought out. He said the bikes were purchased, one by one, and each time the little boy would bid, and each time the bikes were sold for much more. Finally, the auctioneer looked over at the last racer bike being brought forth. An assistant helped him display the racer bike in front of the group, and then the auctioneer said, "This is the last racer bike we have. How much am I bid?" This little boy's hopes were waning, but he cried out, "I bid one dollar, sir." Then the bidding went to two and three and five and seven-fifty and finally eight-fifty. And the auctioneer said, "Going once, going twice, going, and gone for nine dollars to this little boy over on the front row!" Then he reached in his pocket and he pulled out eight dollars and laid them on the counter. The little boy came up and put his one dollar in nickels and dimes and pennies alongside it, picked up his racer bike, and started out the door. And then he laid the bike down and ran back to the auctioneer and threw his arms around the auctioneer's neck and cried.<br><br>My question: There must have been at least a hundred at the auction, probably two or three hundred. Why was it that only one person could see the plight and the need of a little fellow? It really didn't make any difference if one of them didn't get a bike, but it was very vital that this little boy have a bike. He'd earned all he could, and he was there to buy a bike. Only one person had the charity, the pure love of the Savior, and saw the need. Now, my question: What would you have done had you been there? Would you have been aware of the little boy's needs? Are we sometimes so concerned about our own needs that we forget just how vital charity is?<br><br>I brought along a letter that I'm almost embarrassed to share with you, but I think it is essential to make a point. In the Saturday afternoon session of every stake conference that I go to, I talk about families and the relationship between husbands and wives and their children: the need for a father, particularly, to understand the needs of his sons and daughters in the home. When that session of a particular conference was over, a father came up to me and said, "I'm going to write to you and tell you something that I'm not very proud of." So he wrote this letter:<br><br><i>Dear Bishop Featherstone:</i><br><br><i>You probably don't recall the brief conversation we had on the stand at the stake center last Saturday night. I told you I had a seventeen-year-old son to whom I hadn't spoken a kind word in nine years. I was going home to tell him how much I love him. He has caused his mother and me many hours of heartbreak, especially in the last two years. He and I haven't had a father-son relationship in over half his life. Isn't that a frightening thought? The little unhappiness he has caused us is nothing compared to the lonely hours he must have spent because of me all those years--the many nights he went to bed feeling so unloved and unwanted by me, his father. I used to react so violently to the slightest misstep. I had reached the point where he could do nothing right even when he tried. I have even uttered the words, "I detest you." Can you imagine? When he got home Saturday night I sat him on the couch and told him how sorry I was, that I loved him dearly, because he is my son and not for the kind of person he may be, that someday he will discover the value of the precious gift of the priesthood, and I will ordain him an elder with love and pride. Wherever he may go, whatever he may do, though his actions cost me what little I have in worldly goods, all I will be able to say to him now is, "I love you, my precious son." For nine years I have never said one kind thing to my son.</i><br><br>There is more in the letter, but I think that makes the point. I believe, finally, in a moment, this father discovered what charity is.<br><h2><b>Understanding</b></h2><br>I believe you have to have understanding. Understanding is critical if you're going to have spirituality.<br><br>I picked up something I'd like to share with you that I think is very outstanding. Marv Abrams, who works in the grocery business in Boise, had a large frame with a message inside hanging on his office wall. I stood in his office and read it and asked, "Can I get a copy of that?" He sent it to me, and this is what is in it. It's called "A Legacy." (I guess President Dallin Oaks might be familiar with it.)<br><br>In the pocket of a ragged old coat belonging to one of the insane patients of the Chicago poorhouse, a will was found after the man's death. According to Barbara Boyd of the<i>Washington Law Reporter,</i>the man had been a lawyer. Written in a firm hand on a few scraps of paper, the will was so unusual that it was sent to another attorney, who was so impressed with its contents that he read it before the Chicago Bar Association. (That's why I mentioned that President Oaks might be familiar with it.) A resolution was passed ordering the will probated, and it is now on the records of Cook County, Illinois.<br><br><i>My Last Will and Testament</i><br><br><i>I, Charles Lownsberry, being of sound and disposing mind and memory, do hereby make and publish this, my last will and testament, in order as justly may be to distribute any interest in the world among succeeding men that part of my interest which is known in law and recognized in the sheepbound volumes. As my property being inconsiderable and of none account, I make no disposition of in my will. My right to live, being but a life estate, is not at my disposal. But these things excepted, all else in the world I now proceed to devise and bequeath.</i><br><br><i>Item: I give to good fathers and mothers in trust for their children all good little words of praise and encouragement and all quaint pet names and endearments, and I charge said parents to use them justly but generously as the deeds of their children shall require.</i><br><br><i>Item: I leave to children, inclusively, but only for the term of their childhood, all and every the flowers, the fields, and the blossoms and the woods, with the right to play among them freely according to the customs of children, warning them at the same time against thistles and thorns. And I devise to children the banks of the brooks, and the golden sands beneath the waters thereof, and the odors of the willows that dip therein, and the white clouds that float high over the giant trees. And I leave the children the long, long days to be merry in a thousand ways and the night and the train of the Milky Way to wonder at--but subject, nevertheless, to the right hereinafter given to lovers.</i><br><br><i>Item: I devise to boys jointly all the useful idle fields and commons where ball may be played, all pleasant waters where one may swim, all snow-clad hills where one may coast, and all streams and ponds where one may fish or where, when grim winter comes, one may escape--to hold the same for the period of their boyhood--and all meadows with the clover blossoms and butterflies thereof, the woods with their appurtenances, the squirrels and the birds and echoes and strange noises and all distant places which may be visited together with the adventure there found. And I give to said boys each his own place at the fireside at night with all pictures that may be seen in the burning wood and to enjoy without let or hindrance or without any encumbrance or care.</i><br><br><i>Item: To lovers I devise their imaginary world with whatever they may need as the stars of the sky, the red roses by the wall, the bloom of the hawthorn, the sweet strains of music, and all else they may desire to figure to each other the lastingness and beauty of their love.</i><br><br><i>Item: To young men jointly I devise and bequeath all the boisterous, inspiring sports of rivalry, and I give to them the disdain of weakness and undaunted confidence in their own strength. Though they are rude, I leave to them the power to make lasting friendships and possessing companions, and to them exclusively, I give all merry songs and grave choruses to sing with lusty voices.</i><br><br><i>Item: And to those who are no longer children or youths or lovers I leave memory and bequeath to them the volumes of the poems of Burns and Shakespeare and of other poets, if there be others, to the end that they may live the old days over again freely and fully without tittle or diminution.</i><br><br><i>Item: To our loved ones with snowy crowns, I bequeath the happiness of old age, the love and gratitude of their children until they fall asleep.</i><br><br>Finally, someone said about this man, "After all, was he so poor and insane? If that was the world in which he lived, was he not richer than are some who go about freely and who have money in the bank? At any rate, to each of us he bequeathed something. Let us not fail to get our legacy."<br><br>Yes, I think understanding is very critical, and as you can see from this article, this man had great understanding.<br><br>I once had an experience in Denver when I heard a great man, John Sloan, a vice-president of the Boy Scouts of America, tell about Bobby and his birthday. Bobby lived in a community much like the television show<i>The Waltons.</i>It was a backwoods kind of place where things weren't going too well for the entire community.<br><br>Little Bobby came down from his bedroom early on his birthday and burst into the kitchen. His mother had to immediately tell him, "Bobby, we haven't bought you a birthday gift this year. It's not that we don't have the money for it. We've been saving money, but we put the money away. We're going to give it to you now. We want you to learn a lesson. Instead of us buying something we think you'd like, we've saved the money, and we're going to let you take it and buy something you would like." So with this she reached up on the shelf and pulled down a pint bottle with money in it. She poured the contents out on the table, and then she let Bobby count it. He quickly pulled aside the dollar, the quarters, and dimes. He had a total of four dollars and eighty cents. As he scooped this up and put it into his pocket, she said, "Now remember, Bobby, you can buy something that will seem glamorous and it will just fade as a bubble in an instant and be gone, or you can buy something that will have lasting value to you. It's your decision to make, but make it wisely." With this instruction, Bobby burst through the open front door and down the sidewalk. Then he ran down the road about two and a half blocks as fast as his legs would carry him. He came to a large two-story house, and the sign was still out on the front lawn: "Purebred puppies for sale." He walked up to the door and knocked on it. In a moment a handsome, middle-aged woman came to the door. She looked around and couldn't see anyone. Then she looked down, and there was Bobby. She said, "Yes, young man, can I help you?"<br><br>He said, "You have purebred puppies for sale?"<br><br>She said, "We do."<br><br>"I'd like to see them, please."<br><br>The woman looked at him, and she looked at his meager clothing and thought, "Well, he surely can't afford one of<i>my</i>puppies." She was about to turn him away, but Bobby stared at her with a steel-gray glare. So she let him in. He sat down in the hallway, and she went downstairs and brought one of the puppies up. She laid it on the floor in front of Bobby. You know how puppies are at that age. He jumped up into Bobby's lap and was kissing and bouncing all around.<br><br>Bobby was trying to hold him still, and he said, "How much is this puppy?"<br><br>The woman said, "They are twenty-five dollars apiece."<br><br>He said, "That's a lot more than $4.80, isn't it?"<br><br>"Yes, it's quite a lot more, Bobby."<br><br>"Do you have any other puppies for sale?"<br><br>"Well, yes, we have one other puppy, but he is not for sale. We promised the veterinarian that we'd have him put away."<br><br>Bobby said, "Can I please see him?"<br><br>"No, Bobby, he's not for sale. We promised the vet we'd have him put away."<br><br>Then Bobby stared at her with his steel-gray glare a second time and said, "I want to see the other puppy."<br><br>The woman buckled under the pressure, went downstairs, and got the second puppy. She put the first one back and brought the second one up. When she brought it up and laid it in front of Bobby, he saw it had two crippled front legs. Bobby picked the puppy up, held it close to him, and said, "Please sell me this puppy. I want this puppy more than I've ever wanted a puppy in my life. I want this one more than any other puppy in the whole world. Please sell him to me."<br><br>But the woman said, "I'm very sorry, Bobby. He's not for sale."<br><br>Bobby said, "If you sell him to me, I promise to give him more understanding than anyone in the whole world could."<br><br>Then he put the puppy down on the floor and stood up and lifted up his pant legs and showed her the metal braces on his crippled legs. If we're going to be spiritual, we need to have understanding. Bobby had understanding.<br><h2><b>Repentance</b></h2><br>Repentance is also vital. I think if we're going to be spiritual, or pure in heart, or if we're going to have humility, we need to repent. Repentance ought to be part of our lives every single day. Major things ought to be taken care of, of course, but also other minor things. Repentance ought to be just part of us and part of our being.<br><br>I recently had a sweet couple come to my office. They'd driven sixteen hours all the way from a distant city. As they came to my office, they wanted a half-hour appointment; then they were going to turn around and drive the sixteen hours home without doing one other bit of business. So I said to my secretary, "Work them in. Whatever it takes, you work them in." So she pushed back the schedule and worked this couple in.<br><br>The man came in first and said, "You came to our stake conference, and you talked about repentance. After you left, on Monday night, my wife and I were sitting together in our family home evening. All of our children are raised, and my wife said, 'I think you're thinking what I am.' And I said, 'I think I am. We need to go see Bishop Featherstone, dont we? She said, 'Yes, that's what I've been thinking. We'd better go see him.'" So they drove all those hours to see me.<br><br>Well, let me stop right here and say that they didn't need to do that. They have local ecclesiastical leaders, a bishop and a stake president who can handle transgression confessions. I suppose they wanted to see me because I had been the one who had triggered some thoughts about repentance in their minds.<br><br>The man came in and said, "Bishop, forty-three years ago, the week before my wife and I got married, we had sexual relations--once. We went to get our temple recommends from the bishop. He wasn't there, and he had just left them lying on the credenza. His wife handed them to us. There was no question, nothing; he had already signed them. We went to the stake president and, seeing the bishop's signature, he didn't bother to question us. He just signed them and handed them to us. We went to the temple unworthily. While we were on our honeymoon we decided we would make that up to the Lord. We both felt so bad about it. We came back from our honeymoon, and we always paid more than a 10-percent tithing. We paid more than our share of building fund and budget and welfare and have through all these years. We've accepted every assignment that has come to us in the Church. But for forty-three years we've carried a transgression burden on our hearts. We've prayed about it and worried about it. We feel we've been forgiven, but we realize now that every major transgression must be confessed. We've known it all along, I guess. We just haven't had enough courage before, and so now we want to confess. Now I want my wife to come in because she needs to tell you the same thing. She has the right to confess." So his wife came in and confessed the same thing.<br><br>Well, we, as General Authorities, are common judges to a degree. We interview bishops and stake presidents, and we interview missionaries before they go out in the mission field to determine worthiness. I guess I was thinking that we would normally send this couple back to their bishop or to the stake president, but I couldn't bear the thought of having this lovely couple have to carry that burden one more step in this life. So I said, "I think I'll call President Kimball and see how he'd respond. If he feels all right, I can close this for you." So I called President Kimball on the phone and said, "President, I've got this lovely couple in my office. They've driven sixteen hours to get here. They have a half-hour appointment, and they're leaving and going back home. Do I have the right in this case, as a common judge, to close this matter for them?"<br><br>He said, "Are they in your office?"<br><br>I said, "Yes."<br><br>"Have them come up."<br><br>I said, "All right." I hung up the phone, turned to this couple, and said, "President Kimball would like to see you." Their faces went white. I took them out in the lobby. We took the elevator up to the twenty-fifth floor and back into Arthur Haycock's office. When President Kimball heard our voices, he got up and came over to the door. I introduced him to this couple.<br><br>I said, "Now, President, I'll just turn them over to you and I'll see you later."<br><br>I started leaving, and he said, "Bishop, I'd like you to come in, too."<br><br>"Yes, sir."<br><br>So I went in and we sat down beside his desk. Now here is this man with stacks and stacks of work, I guess, that only the prophet can do: sealing cancellation approvals, cases concerning those who have committed other kinds of transgressions, etc., work he himself must do to make a determination as to the disposition of the case. But you would have thought that he didn't have one other care in the world except this couple. He said to this couple, "You don't have to tell me the problem because Bishop Featherstone explained it on the phone. But I have a couple of questions to ask. Have you suffered equal to the transgression? It was a major transgression. Have you suffered equal to the transgression?"<br><br>The man started to cry, and he said, "President, we've suffered many times more than the transgression."<br><br>President Kimball said, "Have you prayed for forgiveness?"<br><br>Together, tears streamed down their cheeks, and they said, "We haven't offered a prayer since we've been married that we haven't asked for forgiveness."<br><br>Then he asked them some other questions in the tenderest, sweetest way, and then he said, "Do you mind if I come over and kneel and have a prayer with you?" He came out from behind his desk and knelt down with us.<br><br>I should stop here and tell you this: Do you know that General Authorities and bishops and stake presidents have the right to forgive on behalf of the Church, but only one man on the face of the earth has the right to forgive on behalf of the Lord?<br><br>President Kimball said, "I use that right very carefully and sparingly and only when I have absolute certainty and absolute knowledge as to what I should do." Anyway, he knelt down, and we all knelt around him. Then he said these words, and I'll never forget the feeling I had. I wish I could in some way give you the spiritual experience I had in that instant.<br><br>He said, "Heavenly Father, we love thee." I've said that to the Lord, but I have never felt the same influence. I felt he really was saying it in a way I'd never heard it expressed before. The tears came to my eyes and streamed down my cheeks. During the rest of the prayer he pleaded on behalf of this couple.<br><br>In section 45 of the Doctrine and Covenants the scripture teaches about the Savior, his being our advocate with the Father. I know now even more clearly than I ever have before what an advocate is. President Kimball pleaded on behalf of this couple. Finally, as he finished his prayer and we stood up, he walked over and he put his arm through my arm and pulled me close and asked me a question. Do you know, I don't even remember the question. I didn't answer it. I just remember turning to him, and I said, "President Kimball, I love you." I was deeply touched. It was about all I could say. I couldn't have said anything else. Then he let go of my arm and walked over to this man. The man put his arms around President Kimball and laid his head down on President Kimball's shoulder and sobbed. President Kimball embraced him for a moment and then went to the woman. The woman reached out, took hold of President Kimball's hands, and then tenderly reached up and kissed him on the cheek.<br><br>Then President Kimball said this to the man, "I want you to forgive yourself, and I want you to forgive your wife. I don't ever want you to mention it again. It's closed."<br><br>Then he said to the wife, "I want you to forgive yourself, and I want you to forgive your husband. I don't want you to ever mention this again. It's closed."<br><br>As we left President Kimball's office, I was filled with a compassionate spirit as though the Savior had been there in President Kimball's place. The woman was overcome. We literally had to hold her up. We got out in the hallway and she said, "Please, can you take me somewhere where I can sit down?" We took her and sat her down on one of the large couches up in that area and she regained her strength. In 3 Nephi we read that the Saints were overcome. What a precious experience, and what a purging, uplifting experience repentance is. I believe we have to have repentance to be spiritual.<br><h2><b>Sacrifice</b></h2><br>I believe it's going to take some kind of sacrifice on your part if you really want to have spirituality. In the mid-1830s this great man, Joseph the Prophet, sent two missionaries back to Massachusetts. When they arrived there, they started preaching, and they came across a man by the name of Orson Spencer. Orson was converted and believed. His fiancée believed, and so they went to her parents to tell them that they were going to be baptized in the Church before they got married. (By the way, she came from one of the fine families in Massachusetts.) As their petite, delicate little daughter and her fiancé explained what was going to take place, the father said to her, "If you choose to marry Orson, and if you join this Church, you are no longer welcome in our home, we never want to see you again, we disown you, and we disinherit you." That was about the summary of the total conversation.<br><br>Orson and his fiancée left together. The young couple went outside, and she said, "Well, Orson, I know only one thing. I know I want to marry you, and so we'll do whatever you say." So they joined the Church, they were married, and they had five children back in Massachusetts.<br><br>She was a frail little soul, and I guess having five children fairly close together was just too much for her. She became somewhat ill. They decided they would go westward where the Saints were. So they made their trek westward to Nauvoo, where the Saints had gathered. As they got to Nauvoo, the frontier life was just too much for little Kathryn Spencer. She became progressively worse. Finally, Brigham Young announced they were going farther westward.<br><br>As they prepared to go, Orson feared for his wife's life. He wrote back to her parents and said, "Please let Kathryn come home and nurse her back to health. She's been sick. I despair for her life. I don't believe she'll make it across the plains, and we're going to leave soon. Please let me know." He also said this, "I'll do anything you ask." Then he sent the letter off.<br><br>Weeks passed and a month more, and still no word. It was time to move westward. They prepared the covered wagons, and they took this frail little soul, put her on a stretcher, and lifted her up into Orson's wagon. Then they rolled westward. As you recall, during those bitter cold winter months the plains would freeze as hard as granite at night, and the wagons could easily roll across the plains in the morning. Then the midmorning sun would come out and thaw the earth, turning it into a giant sea of mud. The wheels would sink in up to their axles, and they would make only a few yards every hour.<br><br>Finally, eighteen days out, they made an encirclement for the night. Orson was outside doing a few chores just before retiring. Orrin Porter Rockwell rode into the camp with mail and distributed it around the camp. He came to Orson and handed him a letter from his wife's parents. He quickly read, "Yes, we would love to have our daughter home. We'd love to see her again, but only on the condition that she'll leave you and leave her newfound church. Then we'll nurse her back to health. We'd love to see her again, but only on those conditions. If not, we never want to see her again, we disown her, we disinherit her, and she's not welcome in our home."<br><br>Orson felt terrible. He climbed up into the wagon, and he told his wife what he had done--that he'd written to her parents. She had not known until this very moment. He said, "I told them I would do anything, and this is their answer."<br><br>He handed her the letter, and she read it. Then she put it down and said, "Orson, would you hand me the Bible?"<br><br>He reached over and handed her the Bible, and she opened it up to a particular scripture and said, "Now would you read that to me, Orson?"<br><br>In the little covered wagon, as the evening shadows were fleeting across the sky, he read to her, "Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God" (Ruth 1:16).<br><br>"No, Orson, I won't leave you." He sat by her at the head of the bed, and they had a very tender moment. They talked, and then her eyes closed. He touched her pallid face, but her eyes never again opened in this life. The next morning they had a brief graveside service by a shallow grave. The only music was the lowing of the cattle. Then Orson Spencer climbed up on the covered wagon and prepared to roll westward. His oldest daughter climbed up on the seat next to him. Who was the oldest daughter? Aurelia Spencer Rogers, the founder of the Primary. I'll love Aurelia Spencer Rogers as long as I live because she's influenced my life, my children's lives, and my children's children's lives. I'll love her for the great contribution she made to our family. But even more than Aurelia Spencer Rogers, I'll love this Kathryn, who sacrificed and raised up an Aurelia Spencer Rogers. We must have sacrifice to be spiritual.<br><h2><b>Practicality</b></h2><br>We lived in Garden Grove, California, for a period of time, and I remember there was a sister in our ward I heard about. She was somewhat considering joining the Jehovah's Witnesses, so the bishop asked if I would go visit with the family to see if I couldn't give them a spiritual experience and tie them back to the foundation of the gospel. I went over to visit them, and I learned this story on my very first visit.<br><br>They had lost a little baby, and it had happened in the neighbor's swimming pool. The little baby, under two, had crawled out through the backyard and somehow had made its way through an open gate into the pool area and had fallen into the pool. The mother in just a moment missed her child. She ran into her backyard, and, of course, the first place you always go when you have children that age is to the most treacherous area--either to the street or to the pool. She ran immediately to the pool and saw her baby lying on the bottom. She couldn't swim. She plunged in, and her husband explained to me, "She would not come up. She didn't know how to get to the bottom of the pool to get her baby, and she would not come up without the baby."<br><br>Someone inside the neighbor's home heard the splashing and went outside. Two people had to pull her out of the pool physically or she would have drowned trying to get her baby off of the bottom of the pool. Someone else dove in and retrieved the baby, but the baby was drowned.<br><br>Now, I believe, as I've thought about this, that there is a practicality to having spirituality. Why didn't someone many, many years back teach a little girl how to swim? We never know what might take place later. The mother would have given anything to have known how to swim--in fact, she almost gave her life. If only someone had taught her how to swim.<br><br>I don't know all the obstacles you'll have in your life, but be practical as you gain spirituality. Don't be afraid to get out into the business world and learn all that you can. Be practical.<br><br>Of course, you also have to have faith if you're going to have the kind of spiritual experience we're talking about. Dr. Gustov Eckstein, one of the world's most renowned ornithologists, for twenty-five years had made an intense study of birds. He had hybrids and had crossbred birds that no other human being had ever produced. He had also kept meticulous records on the birds. For twenty-five years, each day, as per habit, he would walk into his laboratory and down the two or three steps over to the stereo. He would turn the classical music on very loud, the birds would begin to sing, and he would hum along. Then he would do his work during the eight-hour day. At 5:30 or so he'd walk over, turn the stereo off, walk out of his laboratory, and that was his day.<br><br>One day, after twenty-five years, he hired a new custodian. The custodian watched Dr. Eckstein leave. He thought the laboratory needed to be aired out, so he lifted all the windows, and during the night the birds all flew out through the windows. The next morning when Dr. Eckstein came, he walked into his laboratory and there wasn't one single bird there. He saw the open windows and felt devastated and heartsick. Out of habit he walked over to the stereo and turned the music up very loud--classical music. He went and sat down on the steps, put his head down in his hands, and wept.<br><br>"Twenty-five years, my lifetime's work. Must I start over again?" All of these thoughts were going through his mind as tears streamed down his cheeks.<br><br>All of a sudden he heard a fluttering of wings. Dr. Eckstein looked up. The birds were flying back through the windows! The music had gone out through the open windows and through the trees and down the street, and the birds were coming back. Dr. Eckstein said, "Every bird came back."<br><br>I have faith that, if you'll live the kind of life you ought to live, if you have faith and keep the classical music of the gospel of Jesus Christ playing in the ears of those who once were exposed to the gospel, the music will go out through the open windows and down through the streets and the trees, and one day every single one of your parents or brothers or sisters who may be inactive (or someday your children who may be inactive) will come back. You should have hope and have faith and believe that.<br><h2><b>Scripture Study</b></h2><br>In conclusion, you need to study the scriptures. (Of course, there are a hundred other subjects I could have mentioned regarding how to gain spirituality, but these are a few for your consideration.) I believe you need to love the scriptures and study them. One of my very favorite books, just for sheer pleasure reading, is the Pearl of Great Price. I just love to sit down and read it. I feel as if I'm carried away in the spirit with Enoch. I can stand and see Enoch weep and see the heavens weep. I can hear him cry to the Lord,<br><br><i>How is it that thou canst weep, seeing thou art holy, and from all eternity to all eternity?</i><br><br><i>And were it possible that man could number the particles of the earth, yea, millions of earths like this, it would not be a beginning to the number of thy creations.</i>[Moses 7:29–30]<br><br>Then it goes on to tell in those scriptures how the Lord answers Enoch, "Behold these thy brethren," and Enoch then beholds that all of the myriad of beings who would ever live upon the earth "are the workmanship of mine own hands, and ... in the day I created them ... gave I unto man his agency" (Moses 7:32). Then he talked about their wickedness and their misery. Enoch saw the wickedness and misery of men. I can see this just as clearly as if I were there: "Enoch ... stretched forth his arms, and his heart swelled wide as eternity; and his bowels yearned; and all eternity shook" (Moses 7:41). You know, I wouldn't know that any more than if I had been there.<br><br>I believe, as you study the scriptures, you'll come to really know, not<i>of</i>the Savior, but really know<i>him.</i>And you will know our Heavenly Father. Now, God bless you. If we can achieve anything in this life, let us achieve spirituality. There is no greater talent in the world than spirituality, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Vaughn J.

<h1>in 1776 and 1976: Changing Values - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Education Week was first institutedatBYU during the administration of Franklin S. Harris in 1922, some 55 years ago. Its inaugura­tion and administration was first entrusted to Lowry Nelson, whose administrative ability made it a success from the beginning. Today there are 86 Education Weeks held throughout the country, having 83,173 enrollments. In addition, there are 28 Education Days held in other communities, having 8,304 enrollments. If to that be added our Home Study programs; our educational centers at Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, Ogden, Idaho Falls, and Rexburg and our foreign programs at Salzburg, Austria; Paris, France; Madrid, Spain; Jerusalem; and Mexico City, all of which are conducted under the leadership of Dean Stanley A. Peterson and are together classified as Continuing Education, BYU is now serving 300,000 students. This is inaddition to its Provo student body of 25,000 full-time students, who alone constitute the largest body on a single campus of any private school in the country. For 21 years we have been the largest Church-related university in the country, and for 11 years the largest private institution of higher learning of any kind.<br><br>In an address given by Hon. CharlesMalik in 1970, a distinguished educator and states­man in strife-torn Lebanon and former President of the United Nations General Assembly, he expressed the hope that some day<br><br><i>A great university will arise somewhere--I hope in America--to which Christ will return in His full glory and power, a university which will, in the promotion of scientific, intellectual and artistic excellence, surpass by far even the best secular universities of the present, but which will at the same time enable Christ to bless it and act and feel perfectly at home in it.<sup>1</sup></i><br><br>We believe that university has already arisen, that we are that institution, and we pray that we may have the humility, faith, and Christian performance to justify the hopes of Dr. Malik and our belief. If you want to learn more about this divine institution of learning, which belongs to all members of the Church, you may find out about it in the one-volume history entitled <i>Brigham Young University--A School of Destiny,</i> which is being sold, below cost, in the corridors of this building and in the BYU Bookstore. Every family of the Church should have one.<br><br>In speaking to you today I pray for an earnest interest in your prayers that there may be a burning in your bosom so that you may recognize that the Holy Ghost is bearing witness that what I say is true. As material for my address I have drawn heavily upon Elder Mark E. Petersen's <i>The Great Prologue</i>, and an as yet unpublished book by W. Glenn Harmon, a distinguished alumnus and former president of the Berkeley Stake, entitled <i>The World Discovers America</i>. I am grateful to both of them for their major contributions to our living generation. I don't, however, want you to blame them for all that I say for part of it will come from my own research which may not be as authoritative as their manuscripts.<br><br>In celebrating the 200th anniversary of the founding of our country, certain divine facts stand out above all others--that God rules in the affairs of man and nations; that righteousness produces great nations and sin destroys them; that virtue exalteth a nation, while sin is a reproach to any people; that in guiding the destiny of nations the Lord has given to man his free agency--the right to choose between good and evil; that for most of the history of the world, through ignorance or plain wickedness, man chose to follow the downward path so that sin prevailed over righteousness; that when the Savior appeared He was rejected by His own, but gave His life on the cross so that by righteous living we may all be saved; that following His crucifixion and the martyrdom of most of His apostles there occurred, because of corruption and wickedness, centuries of apostasy and hundreds of years of bloody ­warfare, much of which was in the name of an apostate Christianity; that instead Christianity was taken over by emperors who merged church and state, assumed control of Christianity and corrupted and paginated it; that later historical events of great historic importance over a number of centuries took place leading to the founding of our country and the reestablishment on this continent of the Kingdom of God (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints), which is the most important event that has occurred in the two centuries of our existence as a nation, and indeed since the crucifixion of the Savior. As members of the kingdom and Church, we, therefore, know more about the origin of our country and have more to be thankful for than any other people.<br><br>In the short time at my disposal today I propose to relate some of the events which history records took place preparatory to and necessary for the formation of our country and the restoration of the gospel, and whether this nation will continue to survive as a nation or, like 22 other civilizations, will be swept off the land because of the iniquity of its people.<br><h2><b>Nephi's Visions and Fulfillment</b></h2><br>The great Mormon Prophet Nephi, in a vision, foresaw the restoration of the gospel sixhundred years before the Savior's birth. Theevents leading up to it were shown him inconsiderable detail.<br><br>1. Nephi wrote that he had been shown nations and kingdoms by an angel who described them as "the nations and kingdoms of the Gentiles" (1 Nephi 13:3). These have been interpreted for us as being the nations and kingdoms during and after the life of the Savior, other than those of the Jews.<br><br>2. Next he was shown the extent to which the Gentiles had fallen away from the truth of the original gospel due to the influence of a "great and abominable church" which had been founded among them. Said Nephi: "And Isaw the devil that he was the founder of it" (1Nephi 13:6). This we consider to be the days of the great apostasy. It was during these dark ages that the Roman emperors first seized ­control of the church, even dictating points of doctrine, that upon the deterioration of that empire the church (by 1300) to a very great extent controlled who should govern whom in secular matters by placing its weight behind this or that aspirant for political power. Regional and local kings, princes, and dukes were "consecrated" by the church, and woe to the one who was unable to get such a church blessing! Thus the "divine right" of kings and emperors was fostered, even as at one time it had been fostered in pagan Egypt and Rome. As the various kings and princes grew stronger, and as nationalism asserted itself more and more, there were inevitable conflicts between various rulers.<br><br>Further, the reformation which followed did not end the controversy over the various schisms of apostate Christianity. Wars raged throughout Europe, including the Thirty-Year War, which broke out in 1618 and did not end until 1648.<br><br>Between 1477 and 1564, Martin Luther in Germany, Zwingli in Switzerland, and John Calvin in France and Switzerland brought about the Reformation on the Continent; in 1533 papal authority in England was ended, and in 1535 the Church of England came into being with Henry VIII as its head. The administration of the English kings was, however, just as dictatorial as had been the emperors ofRome.<br><br>3. Nephi next relates that he "looked and beheld many waters; and they divided the Gentiles from the seed of my brethren" (1Nephi 13:10). This we understand was the Atlantic Ocean which separated Europe and the Gentiles from America, where the seed of Nephi were located.<br><br>4. Continuing, Nephi recorded, "I looked and beheld a man among the Gentiles, who was separated from the seed of my brethren by the many waters; and I beheld the Spirit of God, that it came down and wrought upon the man; and he went forth upon the many waters, even unto the seed of my brethren, who were in the promised land" (1Nephi 13:12). From the record written by Nephi and the interpretation of our Church leaders, we conclude that the "man among the Gentiles" upon whom the Spirit of God came down and wrought was Christopher Columbus.<br><br>Jacob Wasserman, the German biographer, makes it quite clear in his biography of Columbus that the discoverer felt himself an inspired man, sent from heaven to undertake the voyage which he called his "enterprise." Columbus himself wrote of his voyage:<br><br><i>The Lord was well disposed to my desire, and hebestowed upon me courage and understanding; knowledge of seafaring . . . of geometry and astronomy likewise. . . . I have seen and truly I have studied all books . . . and other arts which our Lord unlocked my mind, sent me upon the sea, and gave me fire for the deed. Those who heard of my enterprise called it foolish, mocked me and laughed. Butwho can doubt that but the Holy Ghost inspiredme?<sup>2</sup></i><br><br>Columbus wrote to King Ferdinando of Spain, who had authorized his voyage, "I come to your Majesty as the Emissary of the Holy Trinity."<sup>3</sup> In his last will and testament Columbus sealed his mission by his testimony:<br><br><i>In the name of the most holy Trinity who inspired me with the idea and afterwards made it perfectly clear to me that I could navigate and go to the Indies from Spain by traversing the ocean ­westward.</i><br><br>5. Although Columbus is no longer regarded as the first explorer to find the Western Hemisphere, there being indications that there were pre-Columbian voyages to America by Arabians, Japanese, Welshmen, Irishmen, and Frenchmen, none of these earlier discoverers led to permanent colonization in America. The reason for this was explained to Lehi by the Lord in these words:<br><br><i>There shall none come into this land save they shall be brought by the hand of the Lord. . . . Behold, it is wisdom that this land should be kept as yet from theknowledge of other nations; for behold, many nations would overrun the land, that there would be no place for an inheritance.</i> [2 Nephi l:6, 8]<br><br>6. The people who would colonize America were described by Nephi as being "white, and exceedingly fair and beautiful, like unto my people before they were slain" (1Nephi 13:15). In so describing them, Nephi was undoubtedly referring to his own people before the eventual destruction of the Nephites at the Hill Cumorah 420 years after Christ.<br><br>In fulfillment of that part of the vision itissignificant to note that early colonizers ofNorth America were the "fairer skinned ­people," whom Nephi saw in his vision. The majority of the early colonizers came from England to Virginia in 1607, the Pilgrim fathers in 1620, William Penn to Pennsylvania in 1621, the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630, and ­others all along the coast. From 1628 to 1641 alone more than 20,000 immigrants came from England. Another "exceedingly fair" people were the Dutch, at least 85,000 of whom settled in the New Netherlands.<br><br><i>From September 30, 1819, when the official count ofimmigrants to the United States began, until December 31, 1855, a total of 4,212,624 persons offoreign birth arrived in this country. Of that number:</i><br><br><i> 1,747,930 were Irish.</i><br><br><i> 1,206,087 were German.</i><br><br><i> 207,492 were English (Many thousands had come earlier.)</i><br><br><i> 188,725 were French.<sup>4</sup></i><br><br>7. Nephi further relates that<br><br><i>"I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles who had gone forth out of captivity did humble themselves before the Lord; and the power of the Lord was with them." </i>[1 Nephi 13:16]<br><br><i>There are two important points to be made here: (1)that the colonists did humble themselves before God, and (2) that the power of God was with them.<sup>5</sup></i><br><br>Having "gone forth out of captivity" refers to the emergence of the people of that day as free men--they were free from the despotic rule of kings and emperors. Their humility and reliance on God was implicit in their reason for coming to America, of which the best example is the Mayflower fathers.<br><br><i>All they desired was to worship the Lord according to the dictates of their own consciences, and not be compelled to accept state-dominated churches.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>When they arrived in America under the leadership of William Bradford, they wrote the famous Mayflower Compact, which was a further expression of their humility before God. Unfortunately, however, they originally committed themselves to communal ownership of all property, in which the slothful obtained the same benefits as the diligent. As has always occurred in experiments of this kind from the beginning of the world to now, this did not work. They so lost their initiative that they nearly died of starvation. As Governor Bradford wrote in his diary, they had thought they were "wiser than God," who gave every man his freedom. And so they turned away from communal ownership and gave each family a parcel of land. And when the harvest was gathered, instead of famine they had plenty.<br><br>There were, of course, other types of people who emigrated to America, designated by Elder Petersen as the exploiters.<br><br><i>They were the conquerors of the Lamanites of Meso-America and South America, those simple people who had been taught to await their promised "White God. " They were also the gold seekers, the plunderers, and the pirates who plagued America in those early times.</i><br><br><i>They were the trappers and fur traders who thrived on the destruction of fur-bearing wild life in the north and who often went out of their way to discourage the establishment of permanent settlements, which would tend to disperse the animals whose skins were like gold to them.</i><br><br><i> And they were likewise the early exploiters of the Grand Banks off Newfoundland where fish ran in fantastic numbers.<sup>7</sup></i><br><br>The motivation of these two different types of colonists is illustrated by the story told by Roger Babson, a noted statistician in our century. It was his experience one day to travel practically all day over a great plantation of a noted land baron in South America. As they sat on the portico of his home that evening, the baron asked Roger Babson, "How is it that South America, with all of its great resources, in many respects more abundant than North America, has never been able to make the progress of North America?"<br><br>Nonplussed for the moment, Babson hesitated to reply. Finally, the land baron supplied his own answer: "I think it's because North America was discovered and settled by the Pilgrim fathers who came in search of their God, whereas the Spaniards came to South America in search of gold."<br><h2><b>Religious Bigotry and Separation of Church and State</b></h2><br>On coming to America the colonists did not immediately abandon the idea of separation of church and state. Devout as they were, the Pilgrim fathers were narrow and bigoted with respect to competing religions. For his advocacy of religious freedom, Williams, in 1636, was banished from the Pilgrim colony. Ann Hutchinson likewise was ordered out of the colony for her "advanced" teachings. She laid the foundation of Quakerism. One of her ­converts, Mary Dyer, carried the torch of Quakerism back to the colony. She was convicted by the Puritan court for daring to assert her right to worship as she pleased and was hung on June 1, 1660.<br><br>Some seventeen years later, William Penn "framed the first charter in America separating church and state, at the Quaker colony of West Jersey in 1677."<sup>8</sup> This was necessary for the restoration of the gospel and occurred 109 years before the adoption of the Declaration ofIndependence.<br><h2><b>Declaration of Independence and War</b></h2><br>As for the power of God being with the colonies, their deep religious convictions and zealous desire for freedom<br><br><i>formed the foundation on which they subsequently based their demands for self-determination and independence from the Mother Country. As the scriptures say; ". . . where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." (2 Corinthians 3:17)<sup>9</sup></i><br><br>One of the great documents of all history, the Declaration of Independence, begins by reciting the separate and equal status to which the colonies are entitled by "Nature's God" andconcludes with a reliance on "Divine Providence." This Declaration of 200 years ago is so fundamental to our bicentennial celebration that I will read important extracts from it.<br><br><i>The Declaration of Independence was adopted by the Continental Congress, in Philadelphia, on July 4, 1776, and was signed by John Hancock as president and by Charles Thomson as secretary. It was published first on July 6 in the </i>Pennsylvania Evening Post<i>. A copy of the Declaration, engrossed on parchment, was signed by members of Congress on and after August 2, 1776.</i><br><br><i>* * * * *</i><br><br><i> When, in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. . . .</i><br><br><i> The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, allhaving in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. . . .</i><br><br><i>He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good. . . .</i><br><br><i> He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people. . . .</i><br><br><i> He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.</i><br><br><i> He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of the salaries.</i><br><br><i>He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.</i><br><br><i> He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies, without the Consent of our ­legislatures.</i><br><br><i> He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power</i>.<br><br>The Declaration then recited that the King had quartered large bodies of armed troops among us; protected them by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these States; cut off their trade with all parts of the world; imposed taxes on them without their consent; deprived them in many cases of the benefits of trial by jury; transported them beyond seas to be tried for pretended offenses; taken away their charters, abolished their most valuable laws, and altered fundamentally the forms of their government; suspended their own legislatures and declared themselves invested with power to legislate for the people in all cases whatsoever. Continuing, the Declaration stated:<br><br><i>He has abdicated Government here by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.</i><br><br><i> He has plundered our seas, ravished our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our ­people.</i><br><br><i> He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.</i><br><br><i> He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands... .</i><br><br><i> In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms. Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. .</i> <i>. .</i><br><br><i> WE, THEREFORE, the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be, Free and Independent States: that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is and ought to be totally dissolved: and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.</i><br><h2><b>Revolutionary War</b></h2><br>Not only did Nephi note that these gentile settlers humbled themselves before God and that divine power accompanied them but he saw that by this divine power they "were delivered . . . out of the hands of all other nations" (see 1Nephi 13:17–19).<br><br>He thus foresaw the winning of the Revolutionary War.<br><br>Only revelation could be credited for such foresight. The colonists themselves were no military match for Great Britain, which had the greatest war machine of the time. They had three million people against Britain's eleven million. They were scattered along the seacoast, their towns were small, and they had no standing army or navy.<br><br>A large number were loyal to the crown; others feared they would be defeated and have to endure reprisals and so refused to help the patriots. In the words of John Adams, "A third took up arms, a third is either openly or secretly loyal to the British, and a third just don't give a ______."<br><br>A year before the conflict broke out, Britain had a standing army of 55,000. At the height of the war this increased to 100,000, plus 20,000 German mercenaries.<br><br><i>The British and the Germans were professional soldiers, whereas the Americans were raw militiamen when Washington took over, a miscellany of trappers, farmers, and tradesmen.</i><br><br><i> Britain was the undoubted mistress of the seas. ... The colonies had no navy at all, for they had depended upon the British fleet to protect them, inasmuch as they were British subjects.</i><br><br><i>Neither did the colonists have any arms or munitions factories. All their guns and powder had come from England, but now they had to import such things from other countries.<sup>10</sup></i><br><br>In this situation and without the help of Divine Providence, it seemed inevitable that they might have to surrender.<br><br><i>Writing to Congress from Valley Forge in December 1777, Washington declared that unless Congress acted at once to supply both men and provisions, his army must inevitably starve, dissolve, or disperse.</i><br><br><i> On December 17 of that year he described the pitiful condition of his men, but said that he himself would share in every hardship and seek no advantage for himself; he would join with his men in ­partaking "of every inconvenience."</i><br><br><i> Two days before Christmas he wrote from Valley Forge that there were 2,898 men "now in Camp unfit for duty, because they are barefoot and otherwise naked." And this was in the dead of winter.<sup>11</sup></i><br><br>They did, however, look to heaven for assistance and<br><br><i>they were not disappointed. [For] had not Nephi said: "I beheld that the power of God was with them, and that the wrath of God was upon all those that were gathered together against them to battle"? And had not he also said that he beheld that the colonists were delivered from their enemies by the power of God?</i><br><br><i> The Lord now moved quickly into the conflict. And with . . . supreme effectiveness!<sup>12</sup></i><br><br><i> . . . France, seeing an opportunity to even up old accounts with her traditional enemy, came in on the side of the Americans. Her navy and several armies of foot soldiers were quickly pledged by a treaty of alliance on February 5, 1778.<sup>13</sup></i><br><br><i>. . . After the treaty of alliance, Washington wrote to his troops a reminder of the part heaven was playing in this war:</i><br><br><i> It having pleased the Almighty Ruler of the Universe propitiously to defend the cause of the United American States . . . by raising up a powerful Friend among the Princes of the Earth to establish our liberty and Independence upon lasting foundations, it becomes us to set apart a day for gratefully acknowledging the divine Goodness, and celebrating the important Event which we owe to his benign interposition.<sup>14</sup></i><br><br>DeRochambeau came to Washington and wrote the American general:<br><br><i>Sir,</i><br><br><i> Being ordered by the King, my master, to come and [place] myself under your command, I arrive with the deepest feelings of submission, of zeal, and of veneration for your person, and for the distinguished talents which you display in supporting anever memorable war.</i><br><br><i> We are now, Sir, under your command.</i><br><br><i> The King charged me personally to assure your Excellency, that he would give all possible assistance to his allies, and that this advanced guard [the first French contingent of 3,000 foot soldiers to arrive] would be supported by his whole power; and the strongest proof, which I can give you of it, is, that the whole detachment was ready to embark atBrest on the first of April, if there had been a ­sufficient number of transports.</i><br><br><i> It is hardly necessary for me to tell your Excellency, that I bring sufficient funds to pay in cash for whatever is needed by the King's army, and that we shall maintain as strict discipline as if we were under the walls of Paris.<sup>15</sup></i><br><br>The first fleet of 3,000 were followed<br><br><i>shortly afterward by another 5,000 men. Lafayette, the brilliant young French general and later a close friend of General Washington, became a most valuable aide to the Americans. This was evident later at the battle of Yorktown, when on October 19, 1781, a force of 16,000 French and American troops under Washington and Lafayette conquered Cornwallis with his 7,000, just two days before a British fleet was to come to his rescue. French warships had blocked Cornwallis so that he could not escape by sea. They previously had driven all British ships out of the entire Chesapeake Bay area</i>.<br><br><i>When the war was half over, Spain and Holland came in, determined to punish their longtime enemy Great Britain. The war became virtually a world conflict at this point. The Dutch navy attacked British shipping in the North Sea, while French andSpanish warships attacked the British in the Mediterranean and even in the far-off waters of South Africa and India.<sup>16</sup></i><br><br><i> . . . The French and Spanish navies combined gave the Americans support of 120 first-class fighting ships, sufficient to challenge the vaunted British mastery of the seas.<sup>17</sup></i><br><br>After years of warfare the British surrendered. Realizing that this was only through the interposition of heaven, the commander-in-chief said in his farewell orders to the army, dated atRocky Hill, near Princeton,<br><br><i> November 2, 1783:</i><br><br><i>A contemplation of the complete attainment, at a period earlier than could be expected, of the objects for which we contended against so formidable a power, cannot but inspire us with astonishment and gratitude. The disadvantageous circumstances on our part under which the war was undertaken can never be forgotten. </i>The singular interposition of Providence<i> in our feeble condition were such as could scarcely escape the attention of the most unobserving; while the unparalleled perseverance ofthe armies of the United States through almost every possible suffering and discouragement for the space of eight years </i>was little short of a standing miracle. [Emphasis added]<sup>18</sup><br><br><i>. . . On the eighth anniversary of Paul Revere's ride, April 18, 1783, Washington proclaimed hostilities at an end and sent his men home to their families and farms "without a farthing in their pockets," but with faith that their new government eventually would pay them for their military service. The final articles of peace were signed September 3, 1783, andon the following November 23, the last of the British soldiers sailed out of New York harbor.<sup>19</sup></i><br><br>In resigning he advised Congress that his "arduous task" was superseded by a confidence in the rectitude of our cause and "by the support of the Supreme Power of the Union and the patronage of Heaven."<sup>20</sup><br><br>In his first inaugural address he said:<br><br><i>No people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the invisible hand, </i>which conducts the affairs of men<i>, more than the people of the United States. </i>Every step, by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation, seems to have been distinguished by some token of providential agency.<i> </i>[Emphasis added]<sup>21</sup><br><h2><b>No Kings among American Gentiles</b></h2><br>One of the important statements of Nephi in interpreting his vision was that "this shall be a land of liberty unto the Gentiles, and there shall be no kings upon the land, who shall raise up unto the Gentiles." (2 Nephi 10:10)<br><br>"There were kings among both the Nephites and the Lamanites"<sup>22</sup> but the vision stated there should be no kings among the ­Gentiles. This prophetic utterance has been fulfilled, despite man-made efforts to the contrary. Napoleon attempted to establish a monarchy in Mexico but failed. There was even an attempt at the end of the Revolutionary War, by certain army officers, to establish a monarchy in the United States, with George Washington as the king. Colonel Lewis Nicola was selected by them to present the proposal to the commander-in-chief. Nicola's proposal was revolting to him. He was deeply incensed that his officers would make such a proposal. In sharp words, he replied to Colonel Nicola:<br><br><i>Sir,</i><br><br><i> With a mixture of great surprise and astonishment, I have read with attention the sentiments you have submitted to my perusal. Be assured, Sir, no occurrence in the course of the war has given me more painful sensations than your information of there being such ideas existing in the army as you have expressed, and I must view them with abhorrence and reprehend with severity. For the present the communication of them will rest on my own bosom, unless some further agitation of the matter shall make a disclosure necessary.</i><br><br><i> I am much at a loss to conceive what part of my conduct could have given encouragement to an address, which to me seems big with the greatest mischiefs that can befall my Country. If I am not deceived in the knowledge of myself, you could not have found a person to whom your schemes are more disagreeable. Let me conjure you, then, if you have any regard for your Country, concern for yourself or posterity, or respect for me, to banish these thoughts from your mind and never communicate, as from yourself or any one else, a sentiment of the like nature.</i><br><br><i>I am, sir, George Washington.<sup>23</sup></i><br><br>Washington then went on to establish the precedent that no President should serve more than two terms, refusing the suggestion of Jefferson that he run for a third term. This circumspect precedent was followed by all until Franklin D. Roosevelt, who, contrary to the advice of Washington and with overweening ambition, was in his fourth term at the time ofhis death. Realizing that this departure fromthe advice given and precedent set by Washington was a serious mistake, we enacted, with the support of most members of Roosevelt's own party, a Constitutional amendment limiting the tenure of any president to two terms (22nd Amendment).<br><h2><b>Blessed with Prosperity</b></h2><br>One of the promises made to the colonists, as revealed in Nephi's vision, was prosperity. Said he: "And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld they did prosper in the land (1 Nephi 13:20)." This prophecy has been amazingly filled. While the United States has only six ­percent of the world's population, the gross national product of the United States is about 40 percent of the entire world. It exceeds that of all the western European nations combined, and is three times greater than that of the Far East. The wage levels, educational levels, and general standards of living and far above ­anywhere else in the world. In 1972 the U.S. Census Bureau defined poverty as having an income of less than $4,275 for a family of four. In most countries of the world, such an income would seem fabulous to the common man--not to mention the starving thousands in some underprivileged lands who have little or no income. The average family income in 1974 exceeded $10,000.<br><br>No matter how America is hated abroad, the fact is that this nation has been the most generous of all in fighting starvation and economic collapse in poor nations and in shipping immediate emergency relief to areas struck by earthquakes, hurricanes, and other natural disasters. Shortly after Christmas of 1974, Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz said that of all the free foods sent by world powers to the starving nations in recent years, 84 percent of it came from the United States.<sup>24</sup><br><h2><b>Groundwork for Forming a Union--The United States of America</b></h2><br>Elder Petersen tells us that "giving America its independence from foreign powers is one thing, but setting it up as a free nation" was fraught with many difficulties. "Chaos would have followed the end of the Revolutionary War had not divine influence again been over this land." But again, the words of the Savior foretold these difficulties were to be overcome. In 3 Nephi 21:4, the Savior stated, "It is wisdom in the Father that they [the Gentiles] should be established in this land and set up as a free people by the power of the Father."<br><br>The leading men of the times felt that the colonies must be united--that there must be a central government. As Franklin had said at the beginning of the War, they must hang together or most certainly they would all hang separately. Indeed, twenty years before the Revolution, Franklin began to promote the idea of a federal union. The differences between the colonies were so great, however, that few heeded Franklin's plea. Washington had the same views as Franklin. While these two men were the main architects of national unity, in a large measure, it was Washington who brought it about. He was the only man in whom all thirteen colonies had complete trust. Not long after he relinquished his command in the army in 1783, he sent a dramatic appeal to all governors that the people of the various states should "forget the local prejudices and policies, make those mutual concessions which are requisite to the general prosperity, and sacrifice some of their individual advantages in the interests of all."<br><br>Still no response came, but when disputes between states arose, Washington was called upon to settle them. His efforts finally seemed to bear fruit, and the Convention of the thirteen colonies was called to meet in Annapolis in September 1786 to consider federal union--but only five states sent representatives. This group then decided upon a convention of all states to be held in Philadelphia in 1787.<sup>25</sup><br><h2><b>The Miracle at Philadelphia</b></h2><br>It was at this Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia that a miracle was performed--the enactment of the Constitution of the United States of America. In a revelation given to the Prophet Joseph in 1833, the Lord revealed that he had "established the Constitution of this land by the hand of wise men whom he raised up for this purpose, and redeemed the land by the shedding of blood." (D&amp;amp;C 101:80)<br><br>Who were these wise men that the Lord raised up for this purpose?<br><h2><b>Makers of the Constitution</b></h2><br>They included:<br><br><i>George Washington, the experienced soldier, the ­levelheaded leader whom all trusted because of his dedication without selfish motives; the honest, clear-sighted inspirer of men; a firm believer in a strong federal union.</i><br><br><i>And Benjamin Franklin, the best diplomat of his day, in America or in Europe; highly skilled in dealing with other men; with a great concept of a federal union for the colonies.<sup>26</sup></i><br><br>Franklin was seventy years old when the war broke out. He was the tenth son of seventeen children born to his father. Since he was his "tithe" son, the father wanted him to enter the ministry. When he decided against the ministry he was apprenticed to his brother, James, a printer. Here Benjamin learned the printing trade and subsequently became a newspaper publisher.<br><br><i>He was an avid reader and a profound student all his life. By the time he was twenty-three, he had his own newspaper, the </i>Pennsylvania Gazette<i>, which eventually became the </i>Saturday Evening Post. . . .<br><br><i> He founded the University of Pennsylvania and was a leading factor in establishing the first hospital in Philadelphia. As a self-taught man he spoke French, Italian, Spanish, German, and Latin.</i><br><br><i>He set up the first mail-delivery system in Philadelphia and was prominent in extending such service elsewhere in the United States and Canada, including Quebec and Montreal.</i><br><br><i> He organized Philadelphia's first fire department and reformed the police department.</i><br><br><i> He promoted the first daylight savings time in America.</i><br><br><i> His inventions were numerous. . . . William Pitt, great British statesman, told the House of Lords that Franklin should be rated with Isaac Newton as a scientist, so highly was he regarded in Europe.</i><br><br><i> Franklin was the only man to sign all four ofthefollowing documents: the Declaration of Independence, the Treaty of Alliance with France, the Treaty of Peace with England, and the Constitution of the United States. The Europeans themselves said that he was the ablest American diplomat ever sent abroad.<sup>27</sup></i><br><br>Another member was "John Adams [second President of the United States, a] great parliamentarian, diplomat, experienced minister to European nations, teacher, farmer, lawyer; a patriot through and through, a believer in an American Union."<br><br>Another member was:<br><br><i>Thomas Jefferson, </i>[our third President]<i> a giant in every sense; skilled in statesmanship; highly educated; fluent writer and trained lawyer, with a clear view of the meaning of freedom; a notable advocate of a federal union for the colonies.<sup>28</sup></i><br><br><i> . . . Although preeminently a statesman, Jefferson had many other sides. He was a skilled lawyer and writer, a naturalist, a farmer, an ­architect, a musician, a linguist, a philosopher, a botanist, and a paleontologist. It is said that some ofhis chief interests were fossils, mathematics, andgrammar. He read Latin, French, Greek, and Spanish. He compiled Indian vocabularies, studied fauna and flora, and had a hobby of collecting old coins.</i><br><br><i>As a connoisseur of art, he had one of the finest collections of sculpture and paintings in America. He was a graduate of William and Mary College, anoutstanding jurist, and a Virginian, one of ten ­children.<sup>29</sup></i><br><br>When Jefferson died July 4, 1826--on the same day that John Adams also died--he had left an epitaph to be inscribed upon his tomb: "Author of the Declaration of Independence, ofthe Statute for Religious Liberty in Virginia, and Founder of the University of Virginia." Heconsidered these of more importance than being President.<br><br>Another member was:<br><br><i>James Madison </i>[who became our]<i> fourth president. ... By some he was called the "father of the Constitution" for his valiant labors in its behalf.</i><br><br><i>He served well with Washington and was Jefferson'ssecretary of state, after a long period inCongress....</i><br><br><i>He was a scholar of great attainment. He knew both Hebrew and Greek. Although he was one of the youngest men in the Continental Congress, he was one of the most skilled. He led the debates on the Bill of Rights. He was one of the great men of that day who sought to abolish slavery. To use his words, he pleaded for "the extinguishment of slavery in the United States."<sup>30</sup></i><br><br><i>James Monroe was the fifth president. He had been a soldier in Washington's continental army, having joined when eighteen years old. He became acaptain and was appointed an aide to General Lafayette. Washington spoke of him as a brave, active, and sensible officer.</i><br><br><i> He was a pupil and protege of Jefferson in the law. . . .</i><br><br><i> He was the author of the Monroe Doctrine, America's most famous foreign policy statement. Hewas an Episcopalian and a lawyer. He was U.S. minister to both France and England, was secretary of state and secretary of war, and served successfully in Congress. He too was a Virginian.<sup>31</sup></i><br><br><i>John Quincy Adams, the sixth in this series of Revolutionary War patriots to hold the office of president, was in fact but a youth during the open warfare. However, having been born and reared in the home of his father, the great John Adams, he was effectively indoctrinated and trained in all of the fundamentals for which the Americans had fought.</i><br><br><i> . . . </i>[He]<i> came to power March 4, 1825. </i>[While]<i> he lacked the advice of such men as Washington, Franklin, and Hamilton, all of whom were now dead, he had been trained well by his father in all of the philosophies of free government. . . .</i><br><br><i> He had studied in Paris, at The Hague, in Amsterdam, and at Harvard. He was a lawyer and university professor. He had served as</i> <i>minister to Prussia, Great Britain, and the Netherlands. He had served also as secretary of state and as a member of the U.S. Senate. . . .</i><br><br><i> </i>[He] <i>was a man of impeccable character and was regarded as one of the most effective congressmen of his time. He was so persuasive in his public speaking that he was dubbed "Old Man Eloquence."<sup>32</sup></i><br><br>Other members of the Constitutional Convention were:<br><br><i> Robert Morris, close friend of Washington and his host while the general did his business in Philadelphia. . . .</i><br><br><i> Gouverneur Morris, lawyer and graduate of Columbia College, forerunner to Columbia University.</i><br><br><i> John Blair and George Wythe, prominent judges, Wythe being also on the faculty of William and Mary College Department of Law.</i><br><br><i> James Wilson, lawyer, graduate of three Scottish universities.</i><br><br><i> James McClury of Virgina, physician, educated at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, and a surgeon during the war. . . .</i><br><br><i> George Mason, who in May 1776 had drafted the Virginia Declaration of Rights, upon which Jefferson drew heavily in his draft of the Declaration of Independence in July of the same year.</i><br><br><i> John Rutledge of South Carolina, governor of the state during the war and a member of both first and second Continental Congresses.</i><br><br><i> Robert Yates, justice of the Supreme Court.</i><br><br><i>Highly gifted Alexander Hamilton, lawyer, aide to General Washington during the war, member of the Continental Congress; representative from New York </i>[and probably the most outspoken leader for a strong federal government]<i>.</i><br><br><i> Alexander Martin, governor of North Carolina.</i><br><br><i> Hugh Williamson, physician and scientist.</i><br><br><i> Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, educated in England at both Westminster and Oxford universi­ties, a brigadier general in the Continental army.</i><br><br><i> David Brearley, chief justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court.</i><br><br><i> John Marshall, young Richmond lawyer, later chief justice of the Supreme Court, one of the ­brilliant minds of that day. . . .</i><br><br><i> Then there were other such worthies as John Hancock, John Wentworth, Jr., and Samuel Adams, not to mention many more.<sup>33</sup></i><br><br><i> It is noteworthy that six of them not only ­sustained the war for independence and helped establish the Constitution, but they also became presidents of the United States as well--the first six--in succession.<sup>34</sup></i><br><br>Although today many in our country have a distrust of lawyers, caused undoubtedly by the young, inexperienced, pseudo lawyers serving President Nixon, it should be here noted that many, if not the majority, of the framers of the Constitution were lawyers and their training thus equipped them under the inspiration of God to draft the Constitution of our country and made possible the formation of our Republic.<br><br>President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., in an address to the Los Angeles County Bar Association of February 24, 1944, spoke of the indispensable place of lawyers in our society:<br><br><i>Upon the bench and the bar of the country rests the great responsibility of seeing that our liberties and free institutions are preserved. Legislators may be incompetent, executives may be dishonest, but if thebench and the bar be honest and filled with integrity, then under the Constitution, the people are secure, and free institutions will still live with us. But security and liberty both take flight where the</i> [bar and/or] <i>the judiciary</i> [are] <i>corrupt. . . .</i><br><br><i> It was an extremely difficult situation which confronted the delegates [to the Convention]: men of strong ideas and personalities, all of differing backgrounds and interests--trying to blend and to weldthemselves into a workable, cohesive whole. Progress was slow. Benjamin Franklin, after several frustrating weeks, finally rose to his feet.</i><br><br><i>The small progress we have made, after four or five weeks close attendance and continual reasonings with each other--our different sentiments on almost every question. . . . ­producing almost as many noes as ayes, is methinks a melancholy proof of the imperfection of human understanding. We indeed seem to feel our own want of political wisdom, since we have been running about in search of it. We have gone back to ancient history for models of government, and examined the different forms of those republics which having been formed with the seeds of their own dissolution, now no longer exist. And we have viewed modern states all round Europe, butfind none of their constitutions suitable to our ­circumstances.</i><br><br><i> In this situation of this Assembly, groping as it were in the dark to find political truth, and scarce able to distinguish it when presented to us, how has it happened, Sir, that we have not hitherto once thought of humbly applying to the Father of lights to illuminate our understanding?</i><sup>35</sup><br><br><i>Franklin then proceeded to remind the convention that at the beginning of the war with England the Continental Congress had had prayers for divine protection--and in the very same room. He ­continued:</i><br><br><i> Our prayers, Sir, were heard, and they were generously answered. All of us who were engaged in the struggle must have observed frequent instances of Superintending providence in our favor. To that kind of providence we owe this happy opportunity of consulting in peace on the means of establishing our future felicity. And have we now forgotten that powerful friend?</i><br><br><i> . . . I have lived, Sir, a long time, and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth--</i>that God governs the affairs of men . . . <i>If a sparrow cannot fall to the ground unseen by him, is it probable an empire could arise without his aid? I firmly believe this, and I also believe that without hisconcurring aid we shall succeed in this political building no better than the builders of Babel. We shall be divided by our little partial local interests; our projects will be confounded and we ourselves shall become a reproach and bye word down to future ages. And what is worse, mankind may hereafter from this unfortunate instance despair of establishing governments of human ­wisdom and leave it to chance, war and conquest.</i><br><br><i> I therefore beg leave to move that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance of heaven and its blessings on our deliberations, be held in this Assembly every morning before we proceed to business, and that one or more of the clergy of this city be requested to <sub>­</sub>officiate in that service.</i> [Emphasis added]<sup>36</sup><br><br><i> Franklin's motion was promptly seconded by Roger Sherman--but it did not carry; in fact, it was not even voted upon."</i><sup>37</sup><i> According to Madison, Hamilton "and several others" were fearful that the calling in of a clergyman at so late a stage might lead the public to suspect there was dissension; and Williamson of North Carolina flatly said everyone knew the real reason for not engaging a chaplain was that the convention had no funds.</i><sup>38</sup><i> And so, says the historian Samuel Elliott Morison</i><br><br><i> Franklin's motion was lost, not because the ­delegates disbelieved in prayer, but because they had no money to pay a chaplain. The states which had elected them provided neither salary nor expense account.</i><sup>39</sup><br><br><i> Neither Washington, who presided at theConvention, nor Franklin was a member of any church, but both were believers in God....</i><br><br><i> But despite their belief in God and prayer, one ofthe most striking things about this incident is that all of the delegates, including Franklin and Washington, were so impregnated with the notion, common even today, that it was necessary to have a professional clergyman,</i> hired for the very purpose, <i>­perform this function--that the idea did not occur to any of them that such was totally unnecessary--that one of their own number could have invoked the aid of God! Therefore, ordination to the great work which they were doing had not thus far removed the veil from their eyes.</i><br><br><i> Notwithstanding Franklin's motion failed, his suggestion had been salutary, calling an assembly of doubting minds to a realization that destiny herself sat as a guest and witness in this room.</i> [Emphasis added]<sup>40</sup><br><br>Ultimately the Convention completed its work, a form of constitution was agreed upon; but only after much bitter opposition was it finally ratified by the colonies; and in due course Washington was elected the first president. In the words of President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., it was a "government with three distinct, separate branches [executive, legislative, and judicial] each mutually independent of the other, with no power of delegation or appropriation of rights or power by any one to or from any other." This plan, which was new in the affairs of men, was designed to have each branch act as checks and balances on the others. It was later declared by the great leader John Gladstone, who, although a British statesman, was sympathetic to the colonies, as "the greatest document ever struck off by the hands of man." What was unknown by Gladstone was that the "hands of men" were being guided by the overriding wisdom of a divine Providence.<br><br>The Constitutional Convention, at which the Constitution was drafted, lasted from May until September. Establishing a consensus among thirteen colonies of different interests and prejudices was not an easy matter. One of the great differences, which was only natural, was that the large states did not want to have the smaller states have the same power as they. On the other hand, the smaller states did not want to be dominated by the larger states. Theresult was a compromise, proposed by Benjamin Franklin, that there be a senate in which each state would be represented by two senators. This would give equal power to both the small and large states, and was a concession to the smaller states. There should then be a house of representatives, in which the representation from each state was to be based on population. This was a concession to the larger states. Any legislation had to be passed by both houses which gave protection to both the small and large states. Even then it had to be signed by the president to become law. If vetoed by the president, it became law only when passed by atwo-thirds vote of both houses.<br><br>This proposal, known as the "Great Compromise," saved the Constitutional Convention from failing. There were other compromises which also permitted the Constitutional Fathers to continue their ­providential work. J. Reuben Clark, Jr., stated:<br><br><i> Significantly, the Constitution contained inArticle VI a provision not to be found elsewhere in the government of any nation of the world--indeed, contrary to the actual practices of the rest of the world:</i><br><br><i> . . . no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification of any Office or public Trust under the United States.</i><sup>41</sup><br><br>"But Jefferson, a deist, was not satisfied. Hewas . . . absent from the Convention as an envoy to France. He liked the Constitution and became one of its strongest supporters."<sup>42</sup> In a letter to Madison, he said, "The Constitution ... is the wisest ever yet presented to men."<sup>43</sup> But he was unhappy because it contained no Bill of Rights. In a letter to Washington from Paris, he listed this as one of the two things he disliked; the other was the perpetual reelect­abil­ity of the President.<sup>44</sup> One of Washington's first acts as president was to work for and to sign into law when passed by Congress, the first ten amendments which comprise our Bill of Rights. J. Reuben Clark, Jr., continued:<br><br><i> The very first of the rights, spelled out inthe very first amendment of the ten, related to the separation of church and state; and, together with the clause which was Article VI already mentioned, this revolutionary new principle of complete separation of church and state was accomplished.</i><br><br><i>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;</i> or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or of the right of the people peaceably to assemble,<i> and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.</i> [Emphasis added]<br><br><i> Responsibility for the principle of separation of church and state belongs to Jefferson; he it was who had been author in l785 of the language in the laws of Virginia effecting such a separation. For his pains he had incurred the enmity of the clergy of his state, who labeled him an infidel. But of all his accomplishments, this was among those which he cherished most--for he had seen in Europe the negative effect upon freedom of a union between church and state.</i><br><br><i> The principle of religious freedom already had been recognized by Rhode Island and Maryland; but it was the Virginia principle which was taken over and firmly imbedded in the new federal Constitution.</i><br><br><i> With regard to the entire First Amendment </i>[Charles] <i>McCabe . . . </i>[columnist in the San Francisco Chronicle,] <i>has stated:</i><br><br><i>That one sentence is, it can be argued, the most revolutionary bit of law ever enacted. Nothing like it had ever been heard of before</i>. Its enforcement, which is not complete to this day<i>, has caused much storm and tumult in our land</i>, but it has been the cement that has kept us together as a free people.<i> </i>[Emphasis added]<sup>45</sup><br><br>Of the Constitution in general and this First Amendment in particular, President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., said:<br><br><i>. . . I firmly and earnestly believe that the Constitution is an inspired document designed by our Maker to set up a government which would make sure and secure the rights set forth in the Bill of Rights, and particularly the right of freedom of conscience and worship.<sup>46</sup></i><br><h2><b>Guiding Hand of Providence</b></h2><br>Although many members of the Constitutional Convention neither belonged to any church or professed to be of religious persuasion, it is apparent that the leaders believed in a divine providence and openly sought and acknowledged the guiding hand of the Lord in all that they did.<br><br>George Washington, in his inaugural address, stated:<br><br><i>. . . we ought to be no less persuaded that the propitious smiles of Heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which Heaven itself has ordained. . .<sup>47</sup></i><br><br>John Adams, our second President, in his ­inaugural address, prayed:<br><br>. . . <i>may that Being who is supreme over all, thePatron of Order, the Fountain of Justice, the Protector in all ages of the world, of virtuous liberty, continue His blessing upon this nation and its Government and give it all possible success and duration consistent with the ends of His providence.<sup>48</sup></i><br><br>Thomas Jefferson, in taking the powers of the Presidency, said to his countrymen:<br><br><i>I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we are, who led our fathers, as Israel of old, from their native land and planted them in a country flowing with all the necessaries and comforts of life; who has covered our infancy with His providence and our riper years with His wisdom and power, and to whose goodness I ask you to join in supplication with me that He will enlighten the mind of your servants, guide their councils and prosper their measures, that whatsoever they do shall result in your good, and shall secure to you the peace, friendship and approbation of all nations.<sup>49</sup></i><br><br>James Madison:<br><br><i>Madison also recognized the hand of God in the creation of the new nation. Said he, on being inaugurated March 4, 1809: "In these [the virtues of my fellow citizens] my confidence will under every difficulty be best placed, next to that which we have all been encouraged to feel in the guardianship and guidance of the Almighty Being whose power regulates the destiny of </i>nations whose blessings have been so conspicuously dispensed <i>to this rising republic. . . . "<sup>50</sup></i><br><br>James Monroe:<br><br><i>Like his predecessors, [Monroe] recognized the hand of God in the creation of America, and prayed at his first inauguration that "the Almighty . . . willbe graciously pleased to continue to us </i>this protection which He has already conspicuously displayed in our favor<i>.<sup>51</sup></i><br><br>In his inaugural address John Quincy Adams echoed the same providential belief:<br><br><i>I shall look for whatever success may attend my public service, and knowing that "except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain," with fervent supplications for His favor, to His over-ruling providence, I commit with humble but fearless confidence, my own fate and the future ­destinies of my country.<sup>52</sup></i><br><h2><b>Confirmation of Divinity of Constitution by Church Leaders</b></h2><br>Not only was the Constitution adopted by"wise men" whom the Lord had "raised up" for that purpose, but it was accepted by the leaders of our Church as having been a heavenly inspired document.<br><br><i> The Prophet Joseph Smith said that "the Constitution of the United States is a glorious ­standard; </i>it is founded in the wisdom of God. Itis a heavenly banner. . . ." <i><sup>53</sup></i><br><br><i> </i>Brigham Young also recognized that the signers of the Declaration of Independence andthe Constitution were inspired by heaven, although he did not think their documents were perfect. He further thought that in the intervening 100 years from the time of the Declaration of Independence that those who built the superstructure had built far short of their privileges. Said he:<br><br><i>The signers of the Declaration of Independence and the framers of the Constitution were inspired from on high to do that work. But was that which was given to them perfect, not admitting of any addition whatever? No; for if men know anything, they must know that the Almighty has never yet found a man in mortality that was capable, at the first intimation, at the first impulse, to receive anything in a state of entire perfection. They laid the foundation, and it was for after generations to rear the superstructure upon it. It is a progressive--a gradual work.</i><br><br><i> The general Constitution of our country is good, and a wholesome government could be framed upon it, for it was dictated by the invisible operations of the Almighty; he moved upon Columbus to launch forth upon the trackless deep to discover the American Continent; he moved upon the signers ofthe Declaration of Independence; and he moved upon Washington to fight and conquer, in the sameway as he moved upon ancient and modern Prophets, each being inspired to accomplish the particular work he was called to perform in the times, seasons, and dispensations of the Almighty. God's purposes, in raising up these men and inspiring them with daring sufficient to surmount every opposing power, was to prepare the way for the formation of a true republican government. They laid its foundation; but when others came to build upon it, they reared a superstructure far short of their privileges, if they had walked uprightly as they should have done.<sup>54</sup></i><br><br>Some nine years after the death of Brigham Young, and<br><br><i>During a time of great stress for the Latter-day Saints, when persecution was high, President John Taylor [Brigham Young's successor] said "that as a people we . . . stand by and sustain the Constitution in every Particular. . . ."</i><br><br><i> He said that while others may trample upon the rights and privileges granted by that great document, and treat it as a light thing, it is for us to rally round the flag of the Union, to be loyal and patriotic, and maintain intact the Constitution; and thus we shall be found doing what Joseph Smith said should come to pass--that when the nation should trample under foot the Constitution, the Elders of Israel in this Church would be found ready to uphold and sustain it in the interest of themselves and the people of this great nation, and would stand by its principles when all others forsook it.<sup>55</sup></i><br><h2><b>Baptism in St. George Temple</b></h2><br>The righteous conduct of the Constitutional Fathers, their acknowledgment of providential help and willingness to follow the promptings of the Spirit, is attested by their appearing to President Wilford Woodruff in the St. George Temple, <i>demanding</i> he should attend to the ordinances of the Lord in their behalf. The ­precise statement of President Woodruff is:<br><br>. . . <i>I am going to bear my testimony to this assembly, if I never do it again in my life, that those men who laid the foundation of this American ­government and signed the Declaration of Independence were the best spirits the God of heaven could find on the face of the earth. . . .</i><br><br><i> Every one of those men that signed the Declaration of Independence, with General </i>[George] <i>Washington, called upon me, as an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, in the Temple at St. George, two consecutive nights, and demanded at my hands that I should go forth and attend to the ordinances of the House of God for them. . . .</i><br><br><i>Brother McAllister baptized me for all those men, and then I told those brethren that it was their duty to go into the Temple and labor until they had got endowments for all of them. They did it.<sup>56</sup></i><br><h2><b>Restoration of the Gospel</b></h2><br>With the adoption of the Constitution and the formation of a government which not only permitted freedom of religion, but actually affirmatively prohibited interference with an individual's freedom of expression or religious beliefs, the time had arrived for the restoration of the gospel. Ben Franklin died in 1790, just two years after the adoption of the Constitution, and Washington died in 1799, eleven years thereafter. Of him at the time of his death Thomas Jefferson wrote:<br><br><i>Never did nature and fortune combine more perfectly to make a man great, and to place him in . . . an everlasting remembrance.<sup>57</sup></i><br><br>Their deaths removed the two who were often claimed as being most influential in forming the Constitution, although Madison probably had more to do with drafting it.<br><br>Six years later, to the very month of Washington's death, Joseph Smith was born. At his youthful age of fourteen, the Father and Son appeared to him in vision in the Sacred Grove. The gospel of Jesus Christ, which the peoples had themselves removed from the earth by their own apostasy some centuries before, was again restored. It was now lawful, even by human standards, for the "stone" to be cut out of the mountain without hands, for the "God of Heaven (Himself) to set up a Kingdom," which "shall stand forever."<br><br>The First Vision was in 1820. Both Thomas Jefferson and John Adams died on Independence Day, July 4, 1826; thus Franklin and the first three presidents had departed before the Church was organized. In 1830, 146 years ago, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which is the "kingdom of God," was organized, never to be taken again from the earth, and which was to roll forth and fill the whole earth. James Monroe died July 4, 1831, one year thereafter, and James Madison, known as the Father of the Constitution, died in 1836. Thus, by six years after the organization of the Church, our first five presidents, all great instruments in perfecting the Constitution, had died.<br><br>Today we have 23,000 young missionaries taking that gospel to many parts of the world. With the construction of the Language Training Mission at Brigham Young University, which will now train 18,000 missionaries in foreign languages in one year, and for which enlargement plans have already been made, many of us here may see the time when as many as 50,000 or more missionaries will be in the field at one time.<br><br>Although this is the greatest event in history since the earthly advent of the Savior, time will not permit me to expand on it here--nor is it necessary with this audience, because all of you know its eternal significance. However, all members of the Church and others interested should read <i>The Great Prologue</i> by Elder Mark E. Petersen and, when published, <i>The World Discovers America</i> by W. Glenn Harmon to be inspired by the glorious events that will take place, as well as saddened by the scourge of the wicked that will follow their own iniquity.<br><h2><b>The Conditional Promise to America--How Will It Be Fulfilled?</b></h2><br>I now turn from the vision of Nephi to a promise of the Lord, also made in the day of the Nephites, as to what may happen to the peoples of this country, both in ancient America and after the restoration of the gospel. The events told to Nephi were in a vision as to what would actually happen. The other is a promise of what would happen to ancient America and what will happen to us if we do not live in accordance with the commandments of the Lord.<br><br>1. The Prophet Lehi, the father of Nephi, told his people that<br><br><i>. . . this land is consecrated unto him whom he shall bring. And if it so be that they shall serve him according to the commandments which he hath given, it shall be a land of liberty unto them; wherefore, they shall never be brought down into captivity; if so, it shall be because of iniquity; for if iniquity shall abound cursed shall be the land for their sakes, but unto the righteous it shall be blessed forever. . . .</i><br><br><i> But behold, when the time cometh that they shall dwindle in unbelief, after they have received so great blessings from the hand of the Lord--having a knowledge of the creation of the earth, and all men, knowing the great and marvelous works of the Lord from the creation of the world; having power given them to do all things by faith; having all the commandments from the beginning, and having been brought by his infinite goodness into this precious land of promise--behold, I say, if the day shall come that they will reject the Holy One of Israel, the true Messiah, their Redeemer and their God, behold, the judgments of him that is just shall rest upon them.</i><br><br><i> Yea, he will bring other nations unto them, and he will give unto them power, and he will take away from them the lands of their possessions, and he will cause them to be scattered and smitten.</i><br><br><i> Yea, as one generation passeth to another there shall be bloodsheds, and great visitations among them; wherefore, my sons, I would that ye would remember; yea, I would that ye would hearken unto my words.<sup>58</sup></i><br><br>2. The prophet Jacob taught the same ­doctrine:<br><br><i>Behold, this is a choice land, and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall be free from bondage, and from captivity, and from all other nations under heaven, if they will but serve the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ . . . .<sup>59</sup></i><br><br>Thus the people of Lehi, like the peoples of Israel, of Judah, and Jared, were promised that if they would follow the commandments of the Lord they would be free people, but if they failed to keep these commandments they would lose their liberty and either be scattered or fall as a nation. Because they failed to keep the commandments, they failed to survive as nations. The Lamanites were scattered and are the Indians of South and North America today.<br><br>This promise and hope extended not only to the ancient civilizations of America but to present and future civilizations on this continent. Whether, therefore, the Constitution and our government will be preserved will depend upon the conduct of ourselves and succeeding generations.<br><br>It therefore behooves us to examine the performance of our country as a nation and the lives and morals of our people. In examining these trends, let us start with the divergence in political views between our country today and those of our Founding Fathers, and then note the lives and morals of our people.<br><br>I start with the political views because President John Taylor informed us that the Elders of Israel should<br><br><i>. . . understand that they have something to do with the world politically as well as religiously, that it is as much their duty to study correct political principles as well as religious.<sup>60</sup></i><br><br><i> Besides the preaching of the gospel, we have another mission, namely, the perpetuation of the free agency of man and the maintenance of liberty, freedom, and the rights of man.<sup>61</sup></i><br><br>I lay stress on this because there are some who try to differentiate between advice given by our leaders on religious matters and advice which they allege pertains to political matters, claiming that we do not need to follow the Prophet when he advises us on political ­matters. Of course we don't; neither are we required to follow him on spiritual matters; neither are we required to keep the Ten Commandments, for the Lord himself has given us our free agency. But if we are faithful members of the Church, and if we want the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity, we are under the same moral obligation to follow his advice on political as on religious matters.<br><br>The Constitution of our country set up a republic, founded on the cornerstone of individual liberty and personal responsibility. It was dedicated to the proposition that as individuals we are to provide for our own welfare and not be dominated by or dependent on ­government. The Constitutional Fathers ­themselves had a dislike for government ­interference with our lives and government domination.<br><br>Their dislike of government domination was expressed by none other than George Washington, the Father of our Country, in these words:<br><br><i>Government is not reason, it is not eloquence--it isa force. Like fire, it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master.</i><br><br>Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence and founder of the Democratic party, advised us not only that the government governs best which governs least, but warned against the dangerous ­situation which haunts us today. He said:<br><br><i>I place economy among the first and most important virtues, and public debt as the greatest of dangers tobe feared. . . . To preserve our independence, we must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt. ... We must make our choice between economy and liberty, or profusion and servitude. . . . If we run into such debts . . . we must be taxed in our meat and drink, in our necessities and our comforts, in our labors and our amusements. . . . If we can prevent the government from </i>wasting the labors of the people, under the pretense of caring for them, they will be happy. [Emphasis added]<br><br>But within fifty years after the founding of our country certain people began to preach the socialistic concept that instead of the government's being a protector of our liberties, it should become a provider of our economic wants. Robert Owen, of Scotland, for instance, in the days of Joseph Smith, tried to convince Americans that their best interests lay in collective equality rather than individual liberty. In 1824 he bought 30,000 acres of land in Indiana and established his utopian colony of "New Harmony." In his opening address to the pioneer members of the settlement, Owen said:<br><br><i>I am come to this country to introduce an entire new state of society; to change it from an ignorant, selfish system to an enlightened social system which shall gradually unite all interests into one, and remove all causes for contest between individuals.<sup>62</sup></i><br><br>However, after three years of hard struggle, the experiment, which had taken most of Owen's money, failed. His ideas of collective ownership and the absolute equality of compensation, irrespective of effort or productivity, had proved to be unsound.<br><br>Since that time, over 200 other experiments in municipal socialism in this country have also failed.<br><br>From the beginning, the presidents of our Church have opposed this trend to a socialistic or welfare state, in whatever form it presented itself. Joseph Smith categorically declared he did not believe in "socialism";<sup>63</sup> President Brigham Young denounced socialism or the welfare state by saying, "It is a poor, unwise and very imbecile people who cannot take careof themselves";<sup>64</sup> President John Taylor described it as a "species of robbery";<sup>65</sup> President Heber J. Grant characterized it by saying, "The Spirit that would have us get something for nothing is from the lower regions";<sup>66</sup> and President David O. McKay warned, "It is not the government's duty to support you."<sup>67</sup> The views of the Church leaders were undoubtedly predicated on the fact that socialism or the welfare state deprives man of his free agency and the rewards of his own efforts. George Bernard Shaw made this frank disclosure of the socialists' reliance on the ruthless power of the state (views which you will immediately recognize as analogous to those of Lucifer rather than those of Christ) in the following words:<br><br><i>I also made it quite clear that under Socialism you would not be allowed to be poor. You would be forcibly fed, clothed, lodged, taught and employed whether you liked it or not. If it were discovered that you had not character and industry enough to be worth all this trouble, </i>you might possibly be executed in a kindly manner:<i> but whilst you were permitted to live you would have to live well.<sup>68</sup></i><br><br>Until the advent of the New Deal in 1932, the political philosophy of freedom from gov­ernment and individual responsibility as dis­tinguished from a welfare state was uniformly followed by all presidents, regardless of party. The one great exception was the enactment of the graduated income tax law in 1913, which is the most significant legislation of this century. It came into being only by virtue of a constitu­tional amendment, the Supreme Court having held that such a concept was unconstitutional. And even then a review of the debates in Congress shows that the proponents of the income tax law were laboring under the honest delusion that in peace time thetaxwouldnot exceed 2 percent, but in times of war itmight "soar" to 5 percent. Instead it has now pyra­mided to extremes beyond the wildest dreams ever proposed by Karl Marx in his Communist Manifesto, having pyramided until the tax cut of a few years ago to 91 percent on the higher brackets. It still stands ataround 70 percent.<br><br>With the ease afforded by the income tax amendment to raise large sums of money from the citizens, theretofore impossible, Congress fell prey to the temptation to adopt many new programs requiring the expenditure of almost untold billions of dollars, founded, in large part, on the philosophy that it is the duty of government to provide for its citizens, rather than have them provide for themselves.<br><br>The result is that by departing from the advice of Jefferson, who was undoubtedly expressing the views of our Constitutional Fathers, today we have an admitted indebtedness of $494.3 billion dollars. It was only five billion dollars when Franklin Delano Roosevelt came into power. If we take into consideration goods already delivered and services already rendered, neither of which are paid for, the total present and accrued liabilities of the United States amount to over $1 trillion, which is more than $5,000 for every man, woman, and child.<sup>69</sup><br><br>In 1973 our total government expenditures, federal, state, and local, exceeded 40 percent of the total income of all people in our country.<sup>70</sup><br><br>In 1974 an average of 64,656,000 persons received some type of unemployment compensation each month in the United States. This represented about 30 percent of the entire population.<sup>71</sup> It has gone up since then. At present (1976) there are 25 million people on full relief.<sup>72</sup> This means that about 8.4 percent of the population of the United States are on full relief. Public assistance expenditures totaled $21.4 billion in 1973.<sup>73</sup> This is completely contrary to the advice of Jefferson that if we can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people, under the pretense of caring for them, they will be happy. We now know that since it has become a national policy to care for them they are not happy. Happily for us as a people, our Church has consistently opposed these government handouts. In setting up the Church Welfare Program, President Grant said:<br><br><i>Our primary purpose was to set up, in so far as it might be possible, a system under which the curse of idleness would be done away with, the evils of a dole abolished, and independence, industry, thrift and self-respect be once more established amongst our people. The aim of the Church is to help the people to help themselves. Work is to be re-enthroned as theruling principle of the lives of our Church ­membership.<sup>74</sup></i><br><br>On August 6 this year, at Amsterdam, Holland, President Kimball reiterated the consistent view of our Church leaders that people in need should rely on their families and the Church for support, rather than any government ­welfare program.<br><br>Lest you be unaware of the extent of the present social revolution and the change in our content of government, let me introduce some authorities as to just how socialistic we have become.<br><br>I call as my chief witness, Norman Thomas, for many years Socialist candidate for president of the United States. After seeing one by one the principles of his party adopted by ­others, he retired as the perennial Socialist ­candidate for president, intimating that it was no longer necessary for the Socialist party to ­continue.<br><br>I call as my second witness Mr. Earl Browder, former leader of the Communist party in America, who, in a pamphlet published in 1950, stated that socialism was further advanced in the United States than in socialist Britain,<sup>75</sup> that although we did not have governmental ownership, real control by government was much greater in the United States than in Britain.<br><br>Since the time of this statement (26 years ago) we have gone much, much farther down the road of the welfare state. President Lyndon Johnson, in a speech to senior citizens 12 years ago, boldly stated:<br><br><i>We are going to try to take all the money we think isunnecessarily being spent and take it from the "haves" and give it to the "have nots" that need it so much.<sup>76</sup></i><br><br>This is the code under which the state will take from you your property and determine how it will be spent and to whom it will be given--a theory of government which was expressly rejected by our Constitutional Fathers in favor of the concept of freedom and individual responsibility.<br><br>This departure from the philosophy of our Constitutional Fathers was foreseen by at least one of our Constitutional Fathers and by a great French soldier-statesman. As Benjamin Franklin was emerging from the Convention which brought forth our Constitution, some women tugged at his coat and asked him what had been proposed for the American people. He replied, "A Republic, if you can keep it."<br><br>Later on, the wise Franklin said that he thought the government they had given to the people would "likely . . . be well-administered for a course of years, but that it can only end in despotism, as other forms have done before it, when the people shall become so corrupted as to need despotic government."<br><br>The great French soldier-statesman deToqueville, after visiting America about 140years ago and studying what was then called our "Noble Experiment in Government," wrote that if the time ever came when the ­people were permitted to vote themselves monies out of the public treasury, self-government by responsible men would become an ­impossibility.<sup>77</sup><br><br>That time, I regret to say, faces us today, for our Supreme Court, by reversing over 150 of its prior decisions, now permits us, contrary to many earlier decisions and the intent of our Constitutional Fathers, to appropriate money out of the public treasury for almost anything we want. As a result we now have a document prepared for the House of Representatives, consisting of 1080 pages, which lists the thousands of federal assistance programs now in operation. This is startling evidence that we are today becoming a welfare state and largely turning our backs on the Republic of our fathers which was founded upon personal liberty and individual responsibility and effort.<br><br>Of course we still preserve the outward forms prescribed by our Constitutional Fathers, except we substitute the name <i>Democracy</i> for <i>Republic--</i>though they are two different kinds of government. In a democracy the majority may do anything they want, such as the Pilgrim Fathers did in executing those with different religious beliefs; in a republic even the majority is restricted by constitutional limitations. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the Supreme Court has ignored many but, thank God, not all the restrictions--especially the guarantees of free speech and freedom of worship. We still also have a pledge of allegiance to our country and the <i>Republic</i> for which it stands, although many vestiges of the Republic of our fathers have disappeared. We still have a president, a Supreme Court, and a Congress, but in many areas they often proceed on different premises than our fathers intended. In the words of Dean Inge:<br><br><i>History seems to show that the powers of evil have won their greatest triumphs by capturing the organizations which were formed to defeat them, and that when the devil has thus changed the contents of the bottles, he never alters the labels. The fort may have been captured by the enemy, but it still flies the flag of its defenders.<sup>78</sup></i><br><h2><b>Great Britain's Entry into Socialism</b></h2><br>I suggest that it is not without significance that concomitant with Great Britain's entry into socialism, the Church of England adopted an official report stating that the work of the churches must start from the premise that Britain is a pagan nation--over one-half of the population of that country belong to no church. They have substituted the false god of socialism, and rely on the socialistic state for their welfare rather than the providence of God. And after socialism is once accepted, it continues and has continued regardless of party. That is happening in this country.<br><h2><b>Moral Decay in Our Nation</b></h2><br>Leaving the political and governmental aspect of our lives, let me review very quickly the demoralizing moral decay of our country which seems to be setting in.<br><br>1. <i>Serious Crime and Its Increase.</i> "The totalofserious crimes reported in 1974 was 10,192,020--up 1,525,800 from 1973. Crimes classified by the FBI as 'serious' are murder, forcible rape, aggravated assault, robbery, burglary, larceny and auto theft."<sup>79</sup> Of these there was a total of 20,600 murders for the year.<sup>80</sup> Based on the FBI figures, that means there were 20 serious crimes every minute. Specifically, there was one murder every 26 minutes of the year, one forcible rape every 10 minutes, one auto theft every 32 seconds, and one burglary every 11 seconds.<br><br>Based on these statistics, just while we have been sitting in this meeting (1 hour), there have been over 400 thefts of automobiles and over 900 burglaries. Today crime is costing this nation well over $60 billion per year. <sup>81</sup><br><br>2. <i>Juvenile Delinquency.</i> By 1973, 1,717,000 juveniles (persons under 18) were arrested as compared to 527,000 in 1960--an increase of over 300 percent.<sup>82</sup><br><br>"Youths under 18 accounted for 27 percent of all 1974 arrests, while 43 percent of those arrested were under 21 and 58 percent were under 25."<sup>83</sup><br><br>3. <i>Divorce.</i> In 1974, 4.6 out of every 10.5 ­marriages (almost one out of every two) ended in divorce.<sup>84</sup><br><br>4. <i>Illegitimacy.</i> In 1973 there were 407,300 illegitimate births in the United States. This represented 13 percent of all births. Undoubtedly the numbers would have been much higher without the huge number of ­abortions performed.<sup>85</sup><br><br>5. <i>Abortion.</i> It is estimated that legal abortions this year will be nearly l,000,000.<sup>86</sup> In 1973 about one of every seven children conceived was aborted.<sup>87</sup> The number aborted is now higher than that and will continue to be higher in view of the opinion of the Supreme Court that young girls no longer need the consent of their parents.<br><br>6. <i>Working Mothers.</i> In 1975 there were 36,507,000 working women in the United States. Of these, 22,717,000 were married, and of those married, 11,409,000 were mothers with children between the ages of birth and 18. This means almost one of every two married working women left her children at home with someone else.<sup>88</sup><br><br>7. <i>Diminishing Birth rate.</i> In 1972 there were only 3,258,000 births as compared to 4,258,000 in 1960. In 1972 there were only 15.6 births per 1,000 as compared with 23.7 births per 1,000 in 1960.<sup>89</sup> Since 1972 the birth rate caused by the false philosophy in favor of limiting families totwo children, the use of the "pill," and the availability of contraceptives by the government for which you and I pay in taxes has been going down.<br><br>8. <i>Immorality.</i> Between 1950 and 1973, the rate of illegitimacy among 15 to 19 year-old girls increased from 56,000 to 204,900--almost 400 percent.<sup>90</sup><br><br>9. <i>Liquor v. Education.</i> In 1972, $19.9 billion was spent for liquor<sup>91</sup> as compared with only $16 billion for higher education.<sup>92</sup><br><br>10. <i>Tobacco v. Churches.</i> In 1972, $7.7 billion was spent on tobacco and tobacco products,<sup>93</sup> only $844 million was spent for the construction of religious buildings.<sup>94</sup><br><br>11. <i>Church Membership.</i> In 1973, 62 percent ofall Americans professed to belong to a church,<sup>95</sup> but only 40 percent attended church in 1972 (also in 1972, 62 percent of all Americans professed to be members of a church).<sup>96</sup> You will be interested in knowing there are more Latter-day Saint members in Utah, Arizona, Nevada, and Idaho combined than members belonging to all other churches, but that is because most citizens of three of those states do not belong to any church.<br><br>This appalling and steady increase in crime and the letdown in moral standards necessarily raises the question of what will happen to America.<br><br>A few historical parallels might be significant. President J. Reuben Clark thus tells of the downfall of the Jaredite civilization:<br><br><i>We are not given the step-by-step backsliding ofthis Jareditic civilization till it reached the social and governmental chaos the record sets out, but those steps seem wholly clear from the results. Put into modern terms, we can understand them. First there was a forsaking of the righteous life, and the working of wickedness; then must have come the extortion and oppression of the poor by the rich; then retaliation and reprisal by the poor against the rich; then would come a cry to share the wealth which should belong to all; then the easy belief that society owed every man a living whether he worked or not; then the keeping of a great body of idlers; then when community revenues failed to do this, as they always have failed and always will fail, a self-helping by one to the goods of his neighbor; and finally when the neighbor resisted, as resist he must, or starve with his family, then death to the neighbor and all that belonged to him. This was the decreed "fullness of iniquity."</i><br><br><i> Then came the end; the Jaredites were wiped out in accordance with "the everlasting decree of God." A nation had been born; it had grown to maturity; then to a powerful manhood; had then gone on to sin, decay, and destruction, and all because its people had refused to heed the promises and commandments of Him who is their Creator and Father, all because the people who possessed the land had failed "to serve the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ." (Ether 2:12)<sup>97</sup></i><br><br>Does this have any of the ring of the present?<br><br>The masterly history by Will Durant entitled <i>The Story of Civilization</i>, volume three, entitled <i>Caesar and Christ</i>, covers the rise and fall of the Roman Empire. In listing the causes for the fall of Rome he states (in the words of President Ezra Taft Benson):<br><br><i>The first group of causes he termed biological, and no doubt most fundamental. They had to do with the limitation of families, the deferment and avoidance of marriage, the refusal of men and women to shoulder the great responsibilities, God-ordained, of honorable parenthood. He mentioned that sexual excesses were indulged in commonly, both in and outside the marriage covenant. The operation of contraception and abortion was common. This, together with other things, resulted in reduced fertility. Sex ran riot, and moral decay resulted . . . .</i><br><br><i> Then he lists with great emphasis the rising costs of government because of armies, doles, public works, expanding bureaucracy, a parasitic court, depreciation of currency, absorption of investment capital by confiscatory taxation.</i><br><br><i> Is there anything suggestive in this ­summary?<sup>98</sup></i><br><br>I know it will shock many of you to think that in a day when America is the leading power of the world, when Washington, D.C., has more influence than all other capitols of the world put together, when the slightest hint from Washington helps to shape the policy of any country in the world either for or against, we should be talking about the possible fall of our nation. But I remind you that when Rome was decaying within, she thought she was invulnerable because there were still the Roman legions, the Roman swords, the Roman culture, and Roman law everywhere in the world. Indeed, Rome occupied a greater place of leadership in that day than does our own country today. But Rome was doomed, and why? Because she had substituted the false gods of government and moral irresponsibility for the true god of personal responsibility, integrity and self-reliance. Hence decay and corruption were inevitable. It was the boast of proud Augustus Caesar that he found a Rome of brick and left it of marble. But he also found the Romans free, and he left them slaves. He found the Romans hard-working, self-reliant, and self-supporting; he left them indolent, dependent on the state for their sustenance and for subsidies.<br><br>Near the end of his great book on the decline and fall of the Roman Empire, Edward Gibbon gives his reasons for the dissolution of the great political force which had held the civilized world together for more than 500 years. The principal ones included:<br><br>• Excessive spending by the central ­government.<br><br>• Unwillingness of the young men to bear arms in defense of their country.<br><br>• Overindulgence in luxury.<br><br>• Widespread sexual immorality and easy divorce, which destroyed the integrity of family life.<br><br>• The spread of effeminacy--girls looking and acting like men, men looking and acting like girls.<br><br>• Disregard of religion.<br><br>That was Rome, 1,400 years ago. Do you ­recognize these symptoms in the United States today?<br><br>Were I left to my own to predict the future of our country, I might say that, with all its political excesses and the moral letdown in our country, we could well follow the decline of Rome and 21 other civilizations. Fortunately, however, we are informed by our prophetic leaders that, notwithstanding our false political philosophy and our moral decay, the kingdom of God, which is The Church of Jesus Christ ofLatter-day Saints, will survive. It will be ­followed, says Elder Petersen, by the kingdom of heaven, which will be merged with the kingdom of God when Christ reigns.<sup>99</sup> This does not mean, however, that our nation in its present form will continue--it means only that since this is the dispensation of the fullness of times, the gospel of Jesus Christ will not be taken from the earth, notwithstanding the ills of our society. President Joseph F. Smith told usthat<br><br><i>The kingdom of God is here to grow, to spread abroad, to take root in the earth, and to abide where the Lord has planted it by his own power and by his own word in the earth, never more to be destroyed nor to cease, but to continue until the purposes of the Almighty shall be accomplished, every whit thathas been spoken of it by the mouths of the holy prophets since the world began.<sup>100</sup></i><br><br>As to the Church itself, President John Taylor has made this declaration:<br><br><i>It has been asked . . . whether this kingdom will fail. I tell you in the name of Israel's God it will not fail. I tell you in the name of Israel's God it will roll forth, and that the things spoken of by the holy prophets in relation to it will receive their fulfillment. But in connection with this I will tell you another thing: a great many Latter-day Saints will fail, a great many of them are not now and never have been living up to their privileges, and magnifying their callings and their priesthood, and God will have a reckoning with such people, unless they speedily repent.<sup>101</sup></i><br><br>However, in a letter to N. E. Seaton, publisher in Rochester, New York, on January 4, 1883, the prophet Joseph Smith<br><br><i>predicted that the United States will be cleansed of the wicked by pestilence, hail, famine, and earthquake "to open and prepare the way for the return ofthe lost tribes of Israel."<sup>102</sup></i><br><br>The overflowing scourge he refers to is mentioned by the Lord in section 5 of the Doctrine and Covenants, wherein he says:<br><br><i>For a desolating scourge shall go forth among the inhabitants of the earth, and shall continue to be poured out from time to time, </i>if they repent not,<i> until the earth is empty, and the inhabitants thereof are consumed away and utterly destroyed by the brightness of my coming.</i><br><br><i>Behold, I tell you these things, even as I also told the people of the destruction of Jerusalem [Matthew 24]; and my word shall be verified at this time as it hath hitherto been verified (D&amp;amp;C 5:19–20). </i>[emphasis added]<sup>103</sup><br><br>President Wilford Woodruff has stated:<br><br><i> I know as God lives that if this or any other ­government departs from the principles of truth, becomes ripened in iniquity, forsakes the Lord, forsakes the principles of life and liberty, the God of heaven will hold it responsible. Judgments will come upon the wicked. When men depart from the principles of truth and cleave unto darkness and wickedness they reap the whirlwind; they lay the foundation for desolation.<sup>104</sup></i><br><br><i> In all the history of the dealings of God with man this one principle, sooner or later, has manifested itself: that virtue exalteth a nation, while sin is a reproach to any people. You will see that this has been manifested in the history of all nations under heaven--in their rise and progress and pros­perity, and in their fall and decline and in their final overthrow and destruction. You will find in every instance that sin, error, darkness, falsehood, wrong­doing, have laid the foundation of the overthrow of every nation and city under heaven from the foundation of the world until the present time. What men sow they will reap, and what measure they measure to others will be measured unto them.<sup>105</sup></i><br><br><i> We have a Constitution that was given by inspiration from God to man. I believe it is the best human form of government that was ever given to the human family. Now, I say if our rulers and governors become corrupt and attempt to trample those principles under their feet; though the nation itself might go to pieces, yet it is beyond the power of man to destroy the principles of the Constitution. They may destroy one another, yet the principles contained in that instrument will live, and the God of heaven will maintain them until Jesus Christ comes in the clouds of heaven to set up his throne in Jerusalem, and to reign on the earth a thousand years.<sup>106</sup></i><br><br>I know that it has many times been stated that when the Constitution of this country would hang by a thread, the elders of our Church would step forth and save it. Unfortunately, however, there is no precise record of what he said, for his prediction rests in the memory of those who heard it, and there is a variance in their memories. All those who heard it and have written about it agree that he said the time would come when the Constitution would be in danger and hang by a single thread; three of them, Brigham Young,<sup>107</sup> Jedediah M. Grant,<sup>108</sup> and Eliza R. Snow,<sup>109</sup> recalled that he said that at this point the elders would step forth and save it, but Orson Hyde, in an address in the Old Tabernacle in Salt Lake City on January 3, 1858, said:<br><br><i>It is said that Brother Joseph in his lifetime declared that the Elders of this Church should step forth at a particular time when the Constitution should be in danger, and rescue it and save it. This may be so; but I do not recollect that he said exactly so. I believe he said something like this--that the time would come when the Constitution and the country would be in danger of an overthrow; and said he, "Ifthe Constitution be saved at all, it will be by the Elders of this Church." I believe this is about the language, as nearly as I can recollect it.<sup>110</sup></i><br><br>We must therefore conclude that, notwithstanding the present and the future intensified wickedness of the world, the kingdom of God (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) will survive; that the constitutional principles of our government will survive, and that the Constitution and our nation as at present constituted will probably survive--we cannot be sure of it with any certainty. In the words of Robert Muntzel,<br><br><i>Great nations rise and fall--the people go from bondage to spiritual faith, from spiritual faith to great courage, from courage to liberty, from liberty to abundance, from abundance to selfishness, from selfishness to complacency, from complacency to apathy, from apathy to dependency, from dependency back again into bondage.<sup>111</sup></i><br><br>This history applies to us as well as other nations--we have been warned that we are in danger of losing our liberties and that, in the words of President J. Reuben Clark, Jr.,<br><br><i>Once lost, only blood will bring them back; and once lost, we of this Church will, in order to keep the Church going forward, have more sacrifices to make and more persecutions to endure than we have yet known, heavy as our sacrifices and grievous as our persecutions of the past have been.<sup>112</sup></i><br><br>It is known also, based on the statements of our prophetic leaders, that there will be a separation of the righteous and unrighteous and that there will be a scourge of the unrighteous and that only the righteous, by loving the Creator and keeping His Commandments, will survive.<br><br>I close with the fervent prayer that our nation, as well as our Church, will be preserved; that God will assist us in preserving our liberties and freedom--for we realize, in the words of Somerset Maughan, that<br><br><i>If a nation values anything more than freedom, it will lose its freedom; and the irony of it is that if it is comfort or money that it values more, it will lose that too.<sup>113</sup></i><br><br>In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.<br><br><i>Ernest L. Wilkinson was the president of Brigham Young University from 1951 to 1964 and from 1965 to 1971.

<h1>ions at BYU - Dallin H. Oaks - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Imagine the emotions I feel as I stand before you, my fellow students. You have come by the thousands to hear me speak. More thousands of your parents, grandparents, and friends are present by television. You are here through loyalty and faith that I will give you something of value. I am humbled by your confidence and totally dependent upon our Father in heaven to make me equal to this responsibility.<br><br>I have felt impressed to speak to you about expectations--what you can expect from your teachers at BYU. As I proceed you will recognize that I am also suggesting what your teachers will expect of you. That is typical of BYU. Here teachers and students study together, worship together, and commit themselves to the same standards.<br><br>I will describe nine expectations. I hope that each will be inspirational and challenging for students and teachers. You will know that these expectations are not casual or incidental. Some are central to the mission of the university--any university. Others are unique to this University and its sister institutions in our Church's Educational System. It is no exaggeration to say that these mutual expectations explain why we, teachers and students, have chosen to pursue our work at BYU.<br><h2><b>Scholastic and Spiritual Preparation</b></h2><br>1. First, you can expect your BYU teachers to be prepared, scholastically and spiritually. The doctor's degrees held by more than 70 percent of the full-time teaching faculty represent many years of arduous and expensive preparation in the various academic disciplines. Our faculty have been through the shoals and have fought the current where you expect them to pilot you. Many have left very promising positions elsewhere to spend their lives here in your service. For your own sake and out of respect for what they represent, honor them with your careful attention and your best efforts.<br><br>Your teachers are also prepared spiritually. It is not an easy task for a teacher to be both rigorously professional and explicitly faithful, but that is our invariable expectation of them. They are challenged to bring the insights of the gospel of Jesus Christ into their subjects wherever possible, and in any case to share their personal testimonies of Jesus Christ. Your teachers represent a synthesis of scholastic excellence and spiritual strength, which is the goal we pose for you. As President Kimball reminded us last year:<br><br><i>. . . education on this campus deliberately and persistently concerns itself with "education for eternity," not just for time. The faculty has a double heritage which they must pass along: the secular knowledge that history has washed to the feet of mankind with the new knowledge brought by scholarly research--but also the vital and revealed truths that have been sent to us from heaven. . . . Your double heritage and dual concerns with the secular and the spiritual require you to be "bilingual." As LDS scholars you must speak with authority and excellence to your professional colleagues in the language of scholarship, and you must also be literate in the language of spiritual things. We must be more bilingual, in that sense, to fulfill our promise in the second century of BYU.</i>["Second Century Address," (Provo: Brigham Young University Publications, 1975), pp. 1–2]<br><br>As BYU students you are also prepared. We are proud of your qualifications and your performance. I will give an example of each.<br><br>In the eight years from 1967 to 1975 the mean high school grade point average of our entering freshmen has remained solidly in the B range. Our freshmen's mean ACT Score has remained constant in this period, while the national average has dropped significantly, more than one point. What does this mean? In the fall of 1975 our entering freshmen had national test scores that averaged in the seventy-fourth percentile of all college-bound students in the nation. These are very satisfying levels for a university that admits more than six thousand freshmen and has made no attempt to increase its admissions standards to become an elitist institution. The conclusion: Our students are well qualified for university studies.<br><br>How about our students' performance in their studies? There are no better comparative evaluations of college seniors at various universities and colleges than their average scores on the law school and medical school admissions tests, which are general preparation tests given to thousands of students nationwide. We are proud to note that the average performances of BYU seniors are solidly above the national averages. We are behind the levels posted by the seniors at the most prestigious small private schools, but well ahead of institutions of comparable size, nationwide. Especially heartening is the fact that our students performances show steady increases from year to year on these revealing national tests.<br><h2><b>Proper Example</b></h2><br>2. Second, you can expect your BYU teachers to set a proper example. At BYU this means more than a proper example in a faculty member's professional discipline. It includes being a worthy example in faith, in church activity, in family life, in the community, and in every other aspect of life. You should not expect perfection in your teachers, but you are entitled to expect--and I believe you will see--that each is trying to be a role model in all of these areas. When you see BYU faculty members struggling to meet their teaching commitments, fulfill their church callings, raise their families, and still make a contribution to their profession and their community, be aware that the example they are trying to set is not easy, even for them. Remember their example when they ask something of you that is not easy either.<br><h2><b>Personal Concern</b></h2><br>3. Third, you can expect your teachers to be concerned about the personal conduct and appearance of their students. At BYU we believe that character is more important than learning. All who enroll at BYU sign a solemn covenant to observe all of the principles of our Code of Honor and our Dress and Grooming Standards. Our teachers and other workers are committed to the same standards. The observance of these requirements is a matter of honor. Persons in violation have broken a promise.<br><br>Since we are vitally concerned about teaching integrity, each BYU teacher needs to remind and counsel students about commitments that are obviously not being fulfilled. You should therefore expect your teachers to speak to you in the classroom and elsewhere on campus if you are in violation of the Dress and Grooming Standards. For men that means, among other things, no long hair, beards, or grubby clothing. For women that means no skirts of immodest length, and no blue jeans or grubby attire.<br><br>A recent poll suggests that almost half of the students at an eastern university had cheated on exams. Our teachers will not condone any cheating, and neither will our students. It is part of our teaching mission to abolish dishonesty in the academic environment and elsewhere.<br><br>Because the issue is honesty and our intention is to teach it, teachers who after appropriate warning exclude students from their classes or examinations when they have reneged on their commitments, such as by flagrant dress and grooming violations or by cheating or copying someone else's written work without proper credit, are perfectly within their teaching function as we perceive it.<br><br>Your teachers will encourage you to meet all of your commitments: to pay your debts, including student loans, to make full disclosure of all relevant facts when questioned, to be honest in identifying the source of your written work, and to be considerate of others, especially in study activities in the library or apartment.<br><br>I will illustrate BYU teacher and student concerns with character by four examples from my own experience.<br><br>A few years ago I taught a Book of Mormon class where students were invited to complete a workbook for extra credit or to offset a low examination grade. One fellow handed in a workbook that I saw to be in the handwriting of two different persons. The semester had concluded so I wrote the student for an explanation. No reply. In two months I wrote again. Still no reply. Over two years later he came to my office. He sadly confessed that he had, indeed, submitted work partly done by a friend. He hadn't answered my letters since he had been in the mission field, and had been too ashamed to respond. Now he wanted to confess his sin and make restitution. He should have done so earlier, he said, since this had bothered him through his entire mission. I lowered his grade from C to D, told him how he could take the course over to raise his grade, congratulated him on facing up to his mistake, put my arm around him, and wished him well. Was I too severe in lowering his grade? I don't think so. The principle of honesty was more important to both of us than the course or the grade. A low grade or the necessity to repeat the course was a suitable vindication of that principle, and the lesson taught by that sequence of events may be more important to that young man than any other lesson he learned that year.<br><br>A young woman who had learned that lesson wrote me some time ago to confess that she had falsely represented to a BYU teacher that she had read a required book when she had not. "I am in the LTM now," her letter reads;<br><br><i>I find I must get this off my mind so I can learn as I should. I am only sorry that my actions make this letter necessary. I ask your forgiveness and that of the entire student body. I wish I could tell them that they</i>must<i>be honest with themselves and their teachers, and make them understand why.</i><br><br>My third example involves a letter I received from a student who wanted advice. When he was a freshman he had been arrested and convicted of a minor crime. After he completed a successful probation his court record was removed and destroyed. Now he wanted to go to law school. How should he answer the invariable question on all law school application forms: "Have you ever been arrested?" A truthful "yes" might keep him from realizing his dream to attend law school. Karl G. Maeser, the founding genius of BYU and one of its greatest teachers, told his students that sooner or later everyone of them "must stand at the forks of the road and choose between personal interests and some principle of right" (<i>Brigham Young University: The First One Hundred Years,</i>1:591). As you would expect, I advised this student to make full disclosure of his earlier arrest, facing it at this point rather than answering dishonestly and having to bear the guilt of concealment and the risk of disclosure all his life. A year later he wrote me as follows:<br><br><i>I decided to take your advice and I made full disclosure on the law school application, and instead of facing a possible expulsion from a law school and a ruined career and, as far as that is concerned, a ruined life, I chose a hard route, but it's my pleasure to inform you that I was accepted into a law school. It was difficult at first to tell this truth, but I don't think words can express what has happened.</i><br><br>My fourth example also involves a letter, which illustrates the very high standards of honesty among BYU students. The writer had worked on a campus job a year earlier.<br><br><i>I must admit</i>[he explains]<i>that while I was employed by BYU I was not completely honest in my dealings. I am afraid that I "goofed-off" while at work (visiting with fellow workers, etc.) I don't feel that I worked sufficiently to merit the pay that I received. To me it seems that I stole that extra pay and I want to return it.</i><br><br>Figuring that he had wasted one hour each day for six months, the writer enclosed his check for the full amount, $273.60! Where but at BYU would that happen!<br><br>Our students and our teachers do care about honesty, and about facing up to mistakes and rising above them. We believe in eternal growth and you can expect your teachers to attach prime importance to the spiritual values upon which it is based.<br><h2><b>Truth</b></h2><br>4. Fourth, you can also expect your teachers to be direct about the truth. We have true academic freedom at BYU. Here we are free from the legal restrictions that put religious faith and insights off-limits to tax-supported colleges and universities. We are also free from the artificial neutrality on many moral values that hamstrings all public and most private colleges and universities. We are free to speak of what we know by the testimony of the Holy Ghost, as well as the theories we propound on the basis of observation and the scientific method.<br><br>We teach theories, for your education obviously demands them, but we also teach revealed truth. In the hands of a capable and skilled teacher the combination achieves the ultimate in academic freedom. We can come directly to the truth when the truth is known. That is liberating. As the Prophet Joseph Smith said in a sermon in Nauvoo, "I can never find much to say in expounding a text. A man never has half so much fuss to unlock a door, if he has a key, as though he had not, and had to cut it open with his jack-knife" (<i>Documentary History of the Church,</i>5:423). Our teachers need not whittle away at contested theories, pretending they do not know what God has revealed, such as, for example, that abortion is sinful, that sexual relations outside the bonds of marriage are destructive to the human soul, that repentance is available and can lift us out of our suffering and degradation, and that men and women are the children of God on an eternal journey whose designed purpose is to attain, as the Bible says, "the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ" (Ephesians 4:13). These principles affect our attitudes and studies in many disciplines in this University. Our concern with revealed truth also prompts our teachers and students to approach their responsibilities prayerfully. With teachers who are praying to teach the truth and students who are praying to learn it, we have the most favorable possible conditions for knowing the truth.<br><br>We take pride in that fact, and because we are explicit about the ideals and goals of the University, which include the strengthening of religious faith and practice, our accomplishments are honored by our colleagues and sister institutions of higher learning, as was evident from the very favorable report we received from an outside team of scholars during our ten-year accrediting visit last spring.<br><h2><b>Breadth of Education</b></h2><br>5. You can also expect your teachers to be concerned about the breadth of your education--not just in their particular discipline, but all of the knowledge and skills expected of a university-educated person. Our new general education program is a major step toward improving the excellence of our offering.<br><br>Our forum assemblies are also an integral part of our general education effort, just as our devotional assemblies and first-Sunday firesides are an integral part of our religious instruction. I urge each of you--just as I expect your teachers to urge you--to attend every forum and devotional. Be here in the Marriott Center each Tuesday at 10:00 a.m. The devotional speakers are usually General Authorities. The forum speakers are carefully chosen for the excellence of their presentation and the breadth and general interest of their topics.<br><br>Most of you have had the experience of receiving a spiritual witness and other inspiration from the Holy Ghost while listening to a devotional speaker. Something akin to that can occur when our minds are stimulated by a fine lecture on a secular subject, especially one of broad general interest somewhat removed from our specialized pursuits. Ideas cultivate the mind, as a farmer turns the soil. Our intellectual harvest in selective areas will improve as we stimulate our minds generally.<br><br>One of the most important marks of an educated person is the ability to communicate in writing. Your ability to write clearly and succinctly is a concern of every professor in the University. Each faculty member has been asked to help raise the level of written expression by BYU students. Do not be surprised if your teachers in every discipline hold you to high standards of written expression. For your sake, every class where you submit written work should be an English class. The commonest complaint that graduate schools and employers make about the graduates of modern colleges and universities is that their written work is not acceptable. We hear these complaints about some BYU students also. In fact, this may be a particular Mormon weakness. From our youth we are given opportunities to speak in Church gatherings, and most of us become pretty articulate--perhaps even glib--by the time we reach college age. But give us a pen instead of a microphone, and our communication skills are immediately seen to be deficient.<br><h2><b>Challenges for Excellence</b></h2><br>6. Sixth, expect your teachers to be concerned that you do the best that you can in whatever you undertake: your church work, your family life, your personal financial management even your social life, and of course your other classes as well as your classes with them. Karl G. Maeser told his students, "Don't be a scrub." That word may not be familiar to you. A "scrub" is something inferior or insignificant. In the case of a person it is one whose growth is stunted through lack of effort, shortage of determination, or absence of high standards. Our BYU teachers are still saying, in effect, "Don't be a scrub." Heed their advice. Rise to the best that is in you. The vision and efforts and contributions of hundreds of thousands have united to give you the opportunities you enjoy at BYU. You are false to their trust if you fritter away your time or let yourself be satisfied with a mediocre effort. Here is what President Kimball said of this:<br><br><i>It is a privileged group who are able to come here. . . .</i>[They]<i>have an even greater follow-through responsibility to make certain that the Church's investment in them provides dividends through service and dedication to others as they labor in the Church and in the world elsewhere.</i>["Second Century Address," p. 10]<br><h2><b>Challenges for Independence</b></h2><br>7. Seventh, expect that your teachers will also encourage you to think for yourself. They will not appreciate a "sponge" who thoughtlessly sops up the whole flow of text and lecture in anticipation of squeezing it back onto the examination paper without a droplet of absorption into the dry recesses of the brain. Pump your textual material and class lectures and discussions through the filter of your mind. The equivalent responsibility for the teacher is to see that students are not burdened with mere storage functions or busywork unrelated to the involvement of the mind. The greater the students' effort on a particular assignment, the easier it should be for the teacher to justify its educational purpose.<br><br>The attainment of an education is not so much the acquisition of a body of knowledge as the development of the ability to think--to evaluate information and to translate knowledge into wise action. That view of education sees the student as the key participant in the process, not as a compliant memory bank for data retrieval. Only with your active involvement in learning can BYU students and teachers meet President Kimball's challenge:<br><br><i>It ought to be obvious to you, as it is to me, that some of the things the Lord would have occur in the second century of BYU are hidden from our immediate view. Until we have climbed the hill just before us, we are not apt to be given a glimpse of what lies beyond. The hills ahead are higher than we think. This means that accomplishments and further directions must occur in proper order, after we have done our part. We will not be transported from point A to point Z without having to pass through the developmental and demanding experiences of all the points of achievement and all the mile-stone markers that lie between!</i>["Second Century Address," pp. 9–10]<br><h2><b>Frank Evaluation</b></h2><br>8. Eighth, you can expect your teachers to be explicit and forthright in describing your shortcomings. A teacher who rewards an average performance with a mark of distinction is false to the trust of his or her students. Evaluations are the signposts and milestones on the road of growth. Inaccurate markers can only lead us to a wrong destination or persuade us to rest complacently in the shade of a mediocre valley when we are still a far journey from the summit of excellence.<br><br>If you wonder how Brother So-and-so or Sister So-and-so could have been so hard on you when they are a brother or sister in the gospel, understand that they pay you their highest compliment by explicitly recognizing when you have not measured up to your possibilities and by forthrightly advising you of it. Our teachers should not and will not indulge in erroneous of shabby effort, and you should not expect them to do so, certainly not for the sake of a brotherhood or sisterhood in the gospel of the Master Teacher who has told us that those whom he loves he chastens and corrects (see Proverbs 3:11; D&amp;amp;C 95:1).<br><br>Though I still cringe to recall their disclosures of my inadequacies, I place the highest value on the teachers who have not indulged me with undeserved praise or misleading silence, but have given me a chance to be saved by honest criticism. I will give two examples.<br><br>When I was a law student I was handicapped by a self-satisfied assurance that I could write verse even though I had never been schooled in that discipline. A classmate and I entered a poetry-writing contest sponsored by three law professors who knew something about the subject. In this naive collaboration, my friend was to provide the rhymes and I was responsible for the meter. Our lengthy effort of fifteen or twenty stanzas attempted to describe and poke fun at a recent judicial opinion by a renowned judge, to whom we sent a copy of the finished version. Though our poem didn't win a prize, or even a favorable mention, I still thought we were the cleverest poets in the school. Proceeding on that assumption, I sought a compliment from one of the faculty judges by reminding him of our effort, telling him we had sent a copy to his friend the judge, and asking him if he thought the judge would be offended at our poem. His reply told me where I stood as a poet and probably saved me great subsequent time and embarrassment. "Oh, no, he won't be offended," the professor replied thoughtfully, "not unless he has a good sense of meter."<br><br>On another occasion I recall how Edward H. Levi, now attorney general of the United States but then my law school dean and teacher in an anti-trust course, rebuked me publicly for being unprepared in class. In classroom discussion he asked me to distinguish between the legal basis of decision in two complicated anti-trust cases. When I fumbled momentarily--revealing to his practiced eye that I was not completely prepared--he cut me down with a single remark: "Never mind, Oaks, you have to be good to answer that question." He never found me unprepared again, from that day to this. Some years later Edward Levi appointed me to his faculty, and later made me acting dean. Today he is a valued friend and colleague, but most of all I esteem him as my teacher. I will always be indebted to him for a lesson that would have gone untaught if he had let sympathy or misplaced goodwill interfere, with a teacher's responsibility to remind a student who was not measuring up to a potential. The reminders will probably be kinder at BYU, but if your teachers are so kind that they fail to make their point or let you miss it, they will not be serving you well. Jacob gave us a vivid example of this principle of correction in a religious context when he spoke these words to the people of Nephi:<br><br><i>Behold, if ye were holy I would speak unto you of holiness; but as ye are not holy, and ye look upon me as a teacher, it must needs be expedient that I teach you the consequences of sin.</i>[2 Nephi 9:48]<br><h2><b>Kindness and Love</b></h2><br>9. Ninth and finally, the BYU teacher will be kind and loving. At times that will be his or her greatest challenge, since students, I think you will concede, can sometimes be very difficult. Sometimes our resistance to knowledge is directly proportional to our ignorance. The less we know, the more we resist knowing, until some kindly teacher succeeds in planting the idea that there may be something to learn from that book or that lecture.<br><br>In this connection teachers of literature may appreciate, and perhaps students of literature will benefit from, Schopenhauer's clever criticism of students who reject a great written work without investing the effort to understand it. "Works like this are as a mirror," he said, "if a jackass looks in you cannot expect an angel to look out" ; and again, "when a head and a book come into collision, and one sounds hollow, is it always the book?" (W. Durant,<i>The Story of Philosophy,</i>12th printing, 1953, p. 221).<br><br>Many of our best teachers will not brand ignorance publicly or even privately to the person involved. Instead, they will hold up the standard of knowledge so vividly that their students will measure themselves against it, reach a correct conclusion, and direct efforts at improvement with a minimum of embarrassment. Such an effort takes consummate skill, but it is motivated by love.<br><br>Fortunately most students are lovable, and sometimes the most ignorant are the most lovable. Consider the unsuspected plight of the ignorant but lovable missionary who wrote his own letter of recommendation for admission to the University a few years ago. He called it a "self recommendation" :<br><br><i>I'm really proud of</i>[so-and-so, he wrote, giving his own name]<i>for the tremendous progress he has made these past few years, not only in self disapline</i>[sic]<i>and controal</i>[sic]<i>but in the phenominal</i>[sic]<i>growth he has made through maturity sense</i>[sic]<i>being out here serveing</i>[sic]<i>the Lord. Our Father in Heaven has really taken him in hand, now that hard and rough stone is no more, but is a smooth polished shaft in the quiver of the hands of the Lord. To better describe</i>[so-and-so]<i>and tell you how much he has progressed in order for you to accept</i>[him]<i>into the University let me for a moment tell you how much he has progressed. Let me tell you how teachable he is</i>[and so on].<br><br>Our BYU teachers teach with the principle of love. I felt that love as a student and it warmed me and encouraged me to try things I had not even dreamed possible. One of my teachers who epitomized love for students and who is still on our faculty is Professor Stewart L. Grow of political science like hundreds of his other students I felt his interest and concern for me so keenly that I reported my activities to him every year after I graduated, by letter or personal visit when I was in Provo. That kind of loving relationship, which is available with BYU teachers, will endure for eternity.<br><br>That loving and teaching relationship can also be enjoyed in BYU employment, where many of our students receive some of their most valuable lessons. One of our most memorable teachers in years past was B. T. Higgs, superintendent of buildings and grounds, who held short teaching sessions on honesty and other admirable traits with students who were working their way through school as part-time custodians. He and his boys would meet at 5:00 a.m. on lower campus before they began their work. In truth, every BYU worker is a teacher for good or ill, and we attach great importance to the informal curriculum that is taught by association with BYU personnel outside the classroom.<br><br>"The more I have seen of teaching," President Harold B. Lee once said in a reference to the elementary grades, "the more I think that this is the great demand upon those who teach our children. You love them and teach them to love you, and I will take a chance on the outcome of your instruction" (<i>Stand Ye in Holy Places,</i>pp. 296–97). The principle is no less true in the University, and we are proud of the fact that the spirit of love has always ennobled the relationship of teacher and student at Brigham Young University.<br><br>I will close with some of the words President Kimball spoke in his dedicatory prayer for the Centennial Carillon Tower, whose music is refining our second century. His prayer on that day is our prayer on each day of our lives in this great University:<br><br><i>Father, we thank thee for this institution and what it has meant in the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and their posterity, for the truths they have learned here, for the characters that have been built, for the families which have been strengthened here . . . Just as these bells will lift the hearts of the hearers when they hear the hymns and anthems played to thy glory, let the morality of the graduates of this University provide the music of hope for the inhabitants of this planet.</i>["Second Century Address," p. 12]<br><br>The means of fulfilling that challenge are open to every teacher and every student at BYU. May we use those means and fulfill our responsibilities, is my prayer, which I give to you as I bear my testimony of the truthfulness of the gospel and of the divine calling of our leaders, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Dallin H. Oaks was president of Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 31 August 1976.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>rist and Him Crucified - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
We have assembled here tonight in the spirit of worship and gratitude and thanksgiving, desiring, I think, to be fed the bread of life, to have the guidance and edifying, uplifting influence of the Holy Spirit. We need very much to be so guided. If I can be given utterance and be guided by the power of the Spirit, what I shall say will be what the Lord wants said; it will be what he would say if he personally were here. It will be the mind and will and voice of the Lord and the power of God unto salvation. And if each of you can have that same Spirit resting upon you, then you will have that burning assurance and feeling in your soul that will certify that the truths taught are accurate and right, and that, if we live our lives in conformity to them, we'll be making progress along the path leading to eternal life in our Father's kingdom.<br><br>Now, I've left my mind free, hoping that proper inspiration might be given, but I've thought that if I am properly guided, I shall take this sentence that Paul wrote and use it as a theme or a text. He said, "I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified" (1 Corinthians 2:2). That, then, is my subject: Jesus Christ, and him crucified.<br><br>To set the stage and lay a foundation for what appropriately might be said about this subject, I shall read three quotations. One is from the Doctrine and Covenants; in it the Lord says:<br><br><i>Learn of me, and listen to my words; walk in the meekness of my Spirit, and you shall have peace in me.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 19:23]<br><br>The second, Nephi writing, is from the Book of Mormon:<br><br><i>Believe in Christ, and . . . be reconciled to God; for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do. . . .</i><br><br><i>And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may look for a remission of their sins. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . believe in Christ, and deny him not; and Christ is the Holy One of Israel; wherefore ye must bow down before him, and worship him with all your might, mind, and strength, and your whole soul; and if ye do this ye shall in nowise be cast out.</i>[2 Nephi 25:23, 26, 29]<br><br>The third quotation, from the Prophet Joseph Smith, gives us information that he learned by translating the papyrus, a portion of which is published as the book of Abraham<br><br><i>Everlasting covenant was made between three personages before the organization of this earth, and relates to their dispensation of things to men on the earth; these personages, according to Abraham's record, are called: God the first, the Creator; God the second, the Redeemer; and God the third, the Witness or Testator.</i>[<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</i>p. 190<br><br>Now, we are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We have taken upon ourselves his name in the waters of baptism. We renew the covenant therein made when we partake of the sacrament. If we have been born again, we have become the sons and daughters of the Lord Jesus Christ. We are members of his family. We are obligated and expected to live by the standards of the family. Because of that family membership, that close association, we have the privilege of an intimate association with him. We have been given the gift of the Holy Ghost, which is the constant companionship of that member of the Godhead based on faithfulness. And that Holy Spirit has as one of his chief missions to bear record of the Father and the Son, and to reveal to us, in a way that cannot be controverted or questioned, his divine sonship and the glorious truths that are in him.<br><br>Salvation is in Christ. We have set ourselves apart from the generality of mankind and have become his witnesses. And so tonight, if we may be properly guided, and have all our thoughts and attentions centered on this matter, so that we will be mutually edified, I shall call attention to some of the great, basic realities in the eternal scheme of things. And as we shall see, all of these things, as far as we are now concerned, center in the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><h2><b>Truth and Heresy About the Godhead</b></h2><br>Now, to begin with, we start with God, our Heavenly Father, who is here named God the first, the Creator. And we have to understand that he is a holy and perfected and exalted person; that he is a being in whose image man is created; that he has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's; and that we are literally his spirit children, the Lord Jesus being the firstborn. I suggest that the greatest truth in all eternity, bar none, is that there is a God in heaven who is a personal being, in whose image man is made, and that we are his spirit children. We must build on that rock foundation before any progression ever begins in the spiritual realm. We first believe in God our Heavenly Father.<br><br>I suggest also that the greatest heresy that was ever devised by an evil power was the heresy that defines the nature and kind of being that God is as a spirit essence that fills immensity; as a being without body, parts, or passions; as something that is incomprehensible, uncreated, and unknowable. The greatest truth is God; the greatest heresy is the doctrine that recites the opposite of the truth as to God's person.<br><br>I suggest that the second greatest truth in all eternity is that Christ our Lord is the Redeemer; that he was foreordained in the councils of eternity to come down here and work out the infinite and eternal atoning sacrifice; that because of what he did we are ransomed from the effects of the temporal and spiritual death that came into the world by the fall of Adam. Because of what he did, all of us gain immortality, meaning that we shall come forth in the resurrection. And all of us have the hope, the potential, the possibility, to gain eternal life in addition to immortality, meaning that we can become like God our Heavenly Father. That is the second greatest truth in all eternity.<br><br>The second greatest heresy in all eternity is the doctrine that denies the divine sonship, that sets up a system that says you can give lip-service to the name of Christ, but you are saved by grace alone without efforts and without work on your part.<br><br>Now I suggest, conformable to what the Prophet said about God the third, who is the Witness or Testator, that the third greatest truth in all eternity is that the Holy Spirit of God, a personage of spirit, a member of the Godhead, has power to reveal eternal truth to the heart and soul and mind of man. And that revelation--known first as a testimony, and then known as the general receipt of truth in the spiritual field--that testimony is the great thing that man needs to lead him on a course back to our Father in heaven.<br><br>Since that is the third greatest truth in all eternity, it follows that the third greatest and most serious heresy in all eternity is the doctrine that denies that the Holy Spirit of God reveals truth to the human soul, and that denies that there are gifts of the spirit, that there are miracles and powers and graces and good things that the Lord by his Spirit pours out upon mortal men.<br><br>We ought to have in our hearts an overflowing feeling of gratitude and thanksgiving. We praise the Lord our God, meaning the Father, because he created us. If he had not created us, we would not be; neither would the earth, or the sidereal heavens, or the universe, or anything else. If there had been no eternal God and no creation, there would be nothing. And because we exist, we ought in our souls to have an infinite degree of gratitude and thanksgiving to God our Heavenly Father.<br><br>Now, secondly, we ought to have an infinite degree of gratitude and thanksgiving to Christ the Lord, because he worked out the infinite and eternal atoning sacrifice and put into operation the terms and conditions of the Father's plan. If there had been no atonement of Christ, there would be no resurrection. And if there had been no atonement of Christ, there would be no eternal life, and hence our bodies would have lain forever in the dust and our spirits everlastingly been cast out from the presence of God, and we would have become like the devil and his angels. What I am saying is that, through the atoning sacrifice of the Lord Jesus, the plan of the Father became operative. Its terms and conditions were put into force; they were given efficacy and validity. And so we ought to rejoice and have thanksgiving and gratitude in our souls to the Lord Jesus, who redeemed us.<br><br>Now, thirdly, by virtue of obedience to the laws that are ordained and by becoming clean and spotless and pure, because the Spirit will not dwell in an unclean tabernacle, we get in a position to receive revelation by the power of the Holy Spirit. Once we are in tune, then we become part of the family of the Lord Jesus. We partake of the same spirit that he possesses; we begin to believe as he believed, to act as he acted, to speak as he spoke. As a consequence, we get in a position to gain that glory and eternal life which he, as our prototype, has already gained. And so, thirdly, we rejoice in what has come to us by the power of the Holy Ghost and have, again, an infinite gratitude where those things are concerned.<br><h2><b>The Plan of Salvation</b></h2><br>God our Heavenly Father ordained and established the plan of salvation. Joseph Smith expressed it in these words. He said, "God himself, finding he was in the midst of spirits and glory, because he was more intelligent, saw proper to institute laws whereby the rest could have a privilege to advance like himself" (<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</i>p. 354). God is exalted and omnipotent and enthroned; he has all power, all might, and all dominion. He lives in the family unit, and the name of the kind of life that he lives is eternal life. And so if we advance and progress and go forward until we become like him, we then become, like Christ, inheritors of eternal life in the kingdom of God. That is our aim and our goal. Hence there is this thing which Paul calls "the gospel of God," meaning that the Father ordained and established the plan of salvation. But then Paul says, "Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh" (Romans 1:3), meaning that Christ adopted the Father's plan. He made it his own. He espoused it. He became the advocate of salvation, the leader in the cause of salvation--all because he was chosen to be born into the world as God's Son.<br><br>All of this was known and taught and understood in the great eternities that went before. We all heard the gospel preached. We knew its terms and conditions. We knew what would be involved in this mortal probation. We knew that it was necessary to come here and get a mortal body as a step toward gaining an immortal body, one of flesh and bones. We knew that when we came here we would need to be tried and examined and tested. We'd need to undergo probationary experiences when we were outside the presence of God, when we walked by faith rather than by sight, when the spirit was housed in a tabernacle of clay and subject to the lusts and appetites and passions of mortality. This we all knew. And then our Father sent forth the great decree through the councils of eternity, "Whom shall I send to be my son, to work out the infinite and eternal atoning sacrifice, to be born into mortality with the power of immortality, to inherit from me the power to work out the infinite and eternal atoning sacrifice?" He got two volunteers. Christ the Lord said, "Father, thy will be done" (see Moses 4:1–3). That is, "I will go down and do what thou hast ordained and sacrifice myself. I will be the lamb slain from the foundation of the world." Lucifer wanted to modify the Father's plan so radically that we could almost say he offered a new system of salvation. He wanted to deny all men their agency, to save all men and, in return, receive the power and dignity and glory of the Father. He wanted to take the place of the Father. The decision was then made: "I will send the first."<br><br>The plan was put into operation. Part of it was the creation of this earth. Then came its peopling. We are all the sons and daughters of Father Adam; all of us are eternal beings, offspring of Deity. Our mortal bodies have been made from the dust of the earth. We're here, having mortal bodies, being examined and tried and tested to see if we will walk uprightly and keep the commandments.<br><br>Now, our first obligation is to believe in Christ and accept him literally and completely and fully for what he is. We believe in Christ when we believe the doctrine he teaches, the words that he speaks, the message that he proclaims. When he came in the flesh as Mary's son, the account says that he "went about . . . preaching the gospel of the kingdom" (Matthew 9:35), meaning that his message was a revelation to people in that day of the plan of salvation, of the things that they had to do to overcome the world, to perfect their lives, and to qualify to go back with him to the presence of the everlasting Father.<br><br>So, first of all, we believe in Christ. And the test as to whether we believe in him is whether we believe his words and whether we believe those whom he hath sent--the apostles and prophets of all the ages. And then, having believed, we have the obligation of conforming to the truths that we have thus learned. If we do conform we begin to grow in spiritual graces. We add to our faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance and patience and godliness and all of the other attributes and characteristics that are written in the revelations (see 2 Peter 1:5–7). So step by step and degree by degree we begin to become like God our Heavenly Father.<br><br>We do not work out our salvation in a moment; it doesn't come to us in an instant, suddenly. Gaining salvation is a process. Paul says, "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling" (Philippians 2:12). To some members of the Church who had been baptized and who were on the course leading to eternal life, he said, "Now is our salvation nearer than when we believed" (Romans 13:11). That is, "We have made some progress along the straight and narrow path. We are going forward, and if we continue in that direction, eternal life will be our everlasting reward."<br><br>We start out in the direction of eternal life when we join The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We enter in at a gate, and the name of the gate is repentance and baptism. We thereby get on a path, and the name of the path is the straight and narrow path. And then if we endure to the end, meaning if we keep the commandments of God after baptism, we go up that straight and narrow path, and at its end is a reward that is named eternal life. All of this is available because of the atoning sacrifice of Christ. If he had not come, there would be no hope or no possibility under any circumstance for any man either to be resurrected or to have eternal life. Salvation comes by the mercy and the love and the condescension of God. In other words, it comes by the grace of God, meaning that our Lord made it available. But he has done his work, and we must now do ours; and we have the obligation to endure to the end, to keep the commandments, to work out our salvation, and that is what we are in the process of doing in the church and the kingdom of God on earth.<br><h2><b>The Process of Achieving Eternal Life</b></h2><br>We say that a man has to be born again, meaning that he has to die as pertaining to the unrighteous things in the world. Paul said, "Crucify the old man of sin and come forth in a newness of life" (see Romans 6:6). We are born again when we die as pertaining to unrighteousness and when we live as pertaining to the things of the Spirit. But that doesn't happen in an instant, suddenly. That also is a process. Being born again is a gradual thing, except in a few isolated instances that are so miraculous they get written up in the scriptures. As far as the generality of the members of the Church are concerned, we are born again by degrees, and we are born again to added light and added knowledge and added desires for righteousness as we keep the commandments.<br><br>The same thing is true of being sanctified. Those who go to the celestial kingdom of heaven have to be sanctified, meaning that they become clean and pure and spotless. They've had evil and sin and iniquity burned out of their souls as though by fire, and the figurative expression there is "the baptism of fire." Here again it is a<i>process.</i>Nobody is sanctified in an instant, suddenly. But if we keep the commandments and press forward with steadfastness after baptism, then degree by degree and step by step we sanctify our souls until that glorious day when we're qualified to go where God and angels are.<br><br>So it is with the plan of salvation. We have to become perfect to be saved in the celestial kingdom. But nobody becomes perfect in this life. Only the Lord Jesus attained that state, and he had an advantage that none of us has. He was the Son of God, and he came into this life with a spiritual capacity and a talent and an inheritance that exceeded beyond all comprehension what any of the rest of us was born with. Our revelations say that he was like unto God in the premortal life and he was, under the Father, the creator of worlds without number. That Holy Being was the Holy One of Israel anciently and he was the Sinless One in mortality. He lived a perfect life, and he set an ideal example. This shows that we can strive and go forward toward that goal, but no other mortal--not the greatest, prophets nor the mightiest apostles nor any of the righteous saints of any of the ages--has ever been perfect, but we must become perfect to gain a celestial inheritance. As it is with being born again, and as it is with sanctifying our souls, so becoming perfect in Christ is a process.<br><br>We begin to keep the commandments today, and we keep more of them tomorrow, and we go from grace to grace, up the steps of the ladder, and we thus improve and perfect our souls. We can become perfect in some minor things. We can be perfect in the payment of tithing. If we pay one-tenth of our interest annually into the tithing funds of the Church, if we do it year in and year out, and desire to do it, and have no intent to withhold, and if we would do it regardless of what arose in our lives, then in that thing we are perfect. And in that thing and to that extent we are living the law as well as Moroni or the angels from heaven could live it. And so degree by degree and step by step we start out on the course to perfection with the objective of becoming perfect as God our Heavenly Father is perfect, in which eventuality we become inheritors of eternal life in his kingdom.<br><br>As members of the Church, if we chart a course leading to eternal life; if we begin the processes of spiritual rebirth, and are going in the right direction; if we chart a course of sanctifying our souls, and degree by degree are going in that direction; and if we chart a course of becoming perfect, and, step by step and phase by phase, are perfecting our souls by overcoming the world, then it is absolutely guaranteed--there is no question whatever about it--we shall gain eternal life. Even though we have spiritual rebirth ahead of us, perfection ahead of us, the full degree of sanctification ahead of us, if we chart a course and follow it to the best of our ability in this life, then when we go out of this life we'll continue in exactly that same course. We'll no longer be subject to the passions and the appetites of the flesh. We will have passed successfully the tests of this mortal probation and in due course we'll get the fulness of our Father's kingdom--and that means eternal life in his everlasting presence.<br><br>The Prophet told us that there are many things that people have to do, even after the grave, to work out their salvation. We're not going to be perfect the minute we die. But if we've charted a course, if our desires are right, if our appetites are curtailed and bridled, and if we believe in the Lord and are doing to the very best of our abilities what we ought to do, we'll go on to everlasting salvation, which is the fulness of eternal reward in our Father's kingdom.<br><h2><b>Hope and Rejoicing</b></h2><br>I think we ought to have hope; I think we ought to have rejoicing. We can talk about the principles of salvation and say how many there are and how people have to meet these standards. And it may thereby seem hard and difficult and beyond the capacity of mortals so to obtain. But we need not take that approach. We ought to realize that we have the same appetites and passions that all of the saints and righteous people had in the dispensations that have gone before. They were no different than we are. They overcame the flesh. They gained the knowledge of God. They understood about Christ and salvation. They had the revelations of the Holy Spirit to their souls certifying of the divine sonship and of the prophetic ministry of whatever prophets ministered among them. And as a consequence they worked out their salvation.<br><br>Occasionally in the overall perspective someone came along who so lived that he was translated, but that's not particularly for our day and generation. When we die our obligation is to go into the spirit world and continue to preach the gospel there. So, as far as people now living are concerned, our obligation is to believe the truth, and live the truth, and chart a course to eternal life. And if we do it, we get peace and joy and happiness in this life; and, when we go into the eternal realms ahead, we continue there to work in the cause of righteousness. And we will not fail! We will go on to eternal reward.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith said that no man can commit the unpardonable sin after he departs this life. Of course he can't; that's part of the testing of this mortal probation. And on that same basis, anybody who is living uprightly and has integrity and devotion, if he's doing all that he can here, then when he leaves this sphere he's going to go into the paradise of God and have rest and peace--that is, rest and peace as far as the troubles and turmoils and vicissitudes and anxieties of this life are concerned. But he'll continue to labor and work on the Lord's errand, and eventually he'll come up in the Resurrection of the Just. He'll get an immortal body, meaning that body and spirit will be inseparably connected. That soul will never again see corruption. Never again will there be death, but what is equally as glorious, or more so, that soul will go on to eternal life in the kingdom of God. And eternal life means the continuation of the family unit. Eternal life means inheriting, receiving, and possessing the fulness of the Father, the power and might and creative ability and all that he has that enabled him to create worlds without number and to be the progenitor of an infinite number of spirit progeny.<br><br>Now, we can't really conceive of how glorious and wondrous all these things are. We can get some glimmering; we can get a little understanding. We know that they are available because God the Creator established the plan of salvation. We know that they are available because God the Redeemer put into force and gave efficacy and validity to all of the terms and conditions of that eternal plan. And we know that they can be revealed and known to us because God the Witness or Testator bears witness, certifies, testifies to the spirit that is within us in a way that cannot be controverted, that the things of which we speak are true.<br><h2><b>The Crucifixion</b></h2><br>Now I should like to speak of Jesus Christ and him crucified, of the atonement of the Lord. The Atonement was worked out in a garden outside Jerusalem's walls, a garden called Gethsemane. It was worked out in a way that is totally beyond our comprehension. We do not understand how. We know some of the why. We know that it did occur. We know that, in a way incomprehensible to a finite intellect, the Son of God took upon himself the sins of all men on conditions of repentance. That is, he paid the penalty. He satisfied the demands of justice. He made mercy available to us. Mercy cometh because of the Atonement. Mercy is for the penitent. Mercy is for the repentant. Everyone else has to suffer for his own sins and pay to the full extent the demands of justice. But our eternal Redeemer, and blessed be his name, has done for us what no one else could, and he did it because he was God's Son and because he possessed the power of immortality. He has taken our sins upon him on conditions of repentance. Repentance means that we have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, that we forsake our sins, that we come into the church and kingdom of God on earth and receive the Holy Ghost. Repentance is far more than reformation. Repentance is a gift of God, and it comes to faithful members of the Church. We get it by the power of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>The cleansing process that occurs in our lives comes because we receive the cleansing power of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost is a revelator, and the Holy Ghost is a sanctifier. The Holy Ghost reveals truth to every human soul that obeys the law. Obedience qualifies us to know the truth. And then the Holy Ghost sanctifies the human soul, so that we become clean and spotless and eventually are qualified to go where God and Christ are.<br><h2><b>Gratitude and Thanksgiving</b></h2><br>Now I say, as we turn our attentions and our thoughts to these infinitely great and wondrous and glorious eternal truths, that we ought to have in our souls gratitude and adoration and thanksgiving, beyond any measure of comprehension, to God our Father, who created us, to Christ our Lord, who redeemed us, and to the Holy Spirit of God, by whose instrumentality we come to know of the truth and verity of these eternal principles upon which salvation rests.<br><br>I've recited these principles, or at least I have talked about them. I haven't taken occasion to read any revelations. We could do that, but it doesn't seem needed or appropriate under the circumstances. Let me just suggest to you that the doctrine I have taught and the explanations I have made are scriptural and they are true.<br><br>I can bear witness of their truth and verity because I know by the power of the Holy Spirit what is involved. And if the Spirit has been poured out on you, as I think it has upon many of you, then you also know by the power of that Spirit of the truth and verity of the things about which we are now speaking. And since you know them, then light and truth and knowledge have come into your soul and you have an obligation not only to believe, but also to conform your life to the things that you believe and thereby to chart the glorious and wondrous course leading to eternal life.<br><br>I bear record and testimony that what we have been teaching here is true; we are obligated to bear testimony whenever we speak by the power of the Spirit. I say in plain, simple, unambiguous words that the Lord Jesus is the Son of the living God; that he came into the world to be lifted up upon the cross, and to be crucified for the sins of the world; that he was born with the power of immortality on the one hand and the power of mortality on the other; and that thereby he voluntarily laid down his life and then took it up again, and in some way (incomprehensible to us) worked out the infinite and eternal atoning sacrifice. These things are true!<br><br>What a wondrous thing it is to be members of a church and kingdom established by God himself, where these truths are known and understood and taught. I came in here tonight and looked at this wonderful student body, some twenty-four thousand of you assembled for this devotional service, and I thought to myself about what the voice of God spoke to Moses out of the burning bush. He said, "Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground" (Exodus 3:5).<br><br>We just happen to be members of God's true Church, and we have apostles and prophets and living oracles to teach and bear record of the truth. We also have elders and witnesses almost without number to reveal and explain these things to us. We are walking where the prophets of God have walked. We go to school at an institution that is guided by the spirit of inspiration, where the hand of the Lord is involved. And if we might paraphrase what his voice said to Moses, we might well say for all of us, with reference to our labors and works at this great institution, "Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou walkest is holy ground."<br><br>The Lord's hand is in this work. He wants us to be saved. He is pleading with us to keep the commandments. We are in an environment and a climate and living under circumstances where we have every opportunity so to do. And the most glorious, wondrous thing about this whole system of revealed religion is that it is true. You ponder that in your heart. There is nothing connected with our whole system of revealed religion to compare with the simple, pure, unadulterated fact that it's true. And because it's true, it will save a human soul. Because it's true, it will prevail. In due course the knowledge of God will cover the earth as the waters cover the sea. God grant us the insight to live in harmony with the truth. God grant us the revelations of his Holy Spirit so that with one voice we may testify of the truth and renew our determinations to live in harmony with it. And I testify of this truth in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Bruce R.

<h1> and Divorce - Spencer W. Kimball - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My beloved brothers and sisters: This is an overwhelming situation. I was born in Salt Lake City, but I grew up in Thatcher, Arizona, a great and important place that few of you know about. Many things happened in that little town. We went through the usual, normal experiences. We had the Fourth of July celebrations; we had contests; we had school activities; we had everything that is available in a town of that size.<br><br>It was a glorious life. Many wonderful young people were my companions. I was always proud of the town and happy to live there. For some forty-five years, that was my home, and then I exchanged it for a location in Salt Lake City.<br><br>It is a real pleasure to be with you today. I humbly come before you to say a few words. I will not give you any spectacular sermon, but I hope to call to your attention some of the things that disturb us, some of the problems that are before us. I make no apology, therefore, for discussing the subject about which I have come to talk. I have come, not to entertain you, but am here on a very serious mission. I desire to speak to you of matters which I feel are extremely important to you, to the people, to the world, and to the Church.<br><br>The entertainer gives to the people that which they desire; the true leader gives to the people that which they should have. Like Paul, I am pressed in the Spirit to warn and exhort and to strengthen. May I have the blessings of our Heavenly Father in my utterances.<br><br>I realize that many of you are married; some are contemplating marriage and will likely be married in the next few years.<br><br>In other talks which I have given to this student body in previous assignments, I have warned the youth of Zion against the sins and vices so prevalent in our society--those of sexual impurity and all of its many ugly approaches. I have spoken of immodesty in dress and actions as one of the softening processes of Lucifer. I hereby express appreciation to the many who have carefully responded to those exhortations and rewarn those who have ignored them.<br><br>I spoke plainly, warning youth of the pitfalls of petting and of all the other perversions into which young men and young women sometimes fall. I endeavored, also, to give hope to those who might have stepped over the bounds of propriety, and I outlined to them the path by which total repentance might bring them to forgiveness.<br><br>I have warned the youth against the many hazards of interfaith marriage, and with all the power I possessed, I warned young people to avoid the sorrows and disillusionments which come from marrying out of the Church and the unhappy situations which almost invariably result when a believer marries an unbelieving spouse. I pointed out the demands of the Church upon its members in time, energy, and funds; the deepness of the spiritual ties which tighten after marriage and as the family comes; the antagonisms which naturally follow such mismating; the fact that these and many other reasons argue eloquently for marriage within the Church, where husband and wife have common backgrounds, common ideals and standards, common beliefs, hopes, and objectives, and, above all, where marriage may be eternalized through righteous entry into the holy temple.<br><br>Today, it is my hope to follow with a discussion of family life. This topic is not new nor is it spectacular, but it is vital. Marriage is relevant in every life, and family life is the basis of our existence.<br><h2><b>Marital Happiness and Unhappiness</b></h2><br>The ugly dragon of divorce has entered into our social life. Little known to our grandparents and not even common among our parents, this cancer has come to be so common in our own day that nearly every family has been cursed by its destructive machinations. This is one of the principal tools of Satan to destroy faith, through breaking up happy homes and bringing frustration of life and distortion of thought.<br><br>Honorable, happy, and successful marriage is surely the principal goal of every normal person. One who would purposely or neglectfully avoid its serious implications is not only not normal but is frustrating his own program. There are a few people who marry for spite or marry for wealth or marry on the rebound after having been jilted. How distorted is the thinking of such an one!<br><br>Marriage is perhaps the most vital of all the decisions and has the most far-reaching effects, for it has to do not only with immediate happiness, but also with eternal joys. It affects not only the two people involved, but their families and particularly their children and their children's children down through the many generations.<br><br>It is absolutely appalling, the number of children today who are growing up in our society who do not have two parents, a father and a mother, and neither one is totally sufficient, if two could be had.<br><br>In selecting a companion for life and for eternity, certainly the most careful planning and thinking and praying and fasting should be done to be sure that, of all the decisions, this one must not be wrong. In true marriage there must be a union of minds as well as of hearts. Emotions must not wholly determine decisions, but the mind and the heart, strengthened by fasting and prayer and serious consideration, will give one a maximum chance of marital happiness.<br><br>Marriage is not easy; it is not simple, as evidenced by the ever-mounting divorce rate. Exact figures astound us. The following ones come from Salt Lake County, which are probably somewhere near average. There were 832 marriages in a single month, and there were 414 divorces. That is half as many divorces as marriages. There were 364 temple marriages, and of the temple marriages about 10 percent were dissolved by divorce. This is substantially better than the average, but we are chagrined that there should be any divorce following a temple marriage.<br><br>We are grateful that this one survey reveals that about 90 percent of the temple marriages hold fast. Because of this, we recommend that people marry those who are of the same racial background generally, and of somewhat the same economic and social and educational background (some of those are not an absolute necessity, but preferred), and above all, the same religious background, without question. In spite of the most favorable matings, the evil one still takes a monumental toll and is the cause for many broken homes and frustrated lives.<br><br>With all conditions as nearly ideal as possible, there are still people who terminate their marriages for the reason of "incompatibility." We see so many shows and read so much fiction and come in contact with so many society scandals that the people in general come to think of "marrying and giving in marriage," divorcing and remarrying, as the normal patterns.<br><br>The divorce itself does not constitute the entire evil, but the very acceptance of divorce as a cure is also a serious sin of this generation. Because a program or a pattern is universally accepted is not evidence that it is right. Marriage never was easy. It may never be. It brings with it sacrifice, sharing, and a demand for great selflessness.<br><br>Many of the TV screen shows and stories of fiction end with marriage: "They lived happily ever after." Since nearly all of us have experienced divorce among our close friends or relatives, we have come to realize that divorce is not a cure for difficulty, but is merely an escape, and a weak one. We have come to realize also that the mere performance of a ceremony does not bring happiness and a successful marriage. Happiness does not come by pressing a button, as does the electric light; happiness is a state of mind and comes from within. It must be earned. It cannot be purchased with money; it cannot be taken for nothing.<br><br>Some think of happiness as a glamorous life of ease, luxury, and constant thrills; but true marriage is based on a happiness which is more than that, one which comes from giving, serving, sharing, sacrificing, and selflessness.<br><br>Two people coming from different backgrounds soon learn after the ceremony is performed that stark reality must be faced. There is no longer a life of fantasy or of make-believe; we must come out of the clouds and put our feet firmly on the earth. Responsibility must be assumed and new duties must be accepted. Some personal freedoms must be relinquished and many adjustments, unselfish adjustments, must be made.<br><br>One comes to realize very soon after the marriage that the spouse has weaknesses not previously revealed or discovered. The virtues which were constantly magnified during courtship now grow relatively smaller, and the weaknesses which seemed so small and insignificant during courtship now grow to sizable proportions. The hour has come for understanding hearts, for self-appraisal, and for good common sense, reasoning, and planning. The habits of years now show themselves; the spouse may be stingy or prodigal, lazy or industrious, devout or irreligious, may be kind and cooperative or petulant and cross, demanding or giving, egotistical or self-effacing. The in-law problem comes closer into focus, and the relationships of the spouses to them is again magnified.<br><br>Often there is an unwillingness to settle down and to assume the heavy responsibilities that immediately are there. Economy is reluctant to replace lavish living, and the young people seem often too eager "to keep up with the Joneses." There is often an unwillingness to make the financial adjustments necessary. Young wives are often demanding that all the luxuries formerly enjoyed in the prosperous homes of their successful fathers be continued in their own homes. Some of them are quite willing to help earn that lavish living by continuing employment after marriage. They consequently leave the home, where their duty lies, to pursue professional or business pursuits, thus establishing an economy that becomes stabilized so that it becomes very difficult to yield toward the normal family life. Through both spouses working, competition rather than cooperation enters the family. Two weary workers return home with taut nerves, individual pride, increased independence, and then misunderstandings arise. Little frictions pyramid into monumental ones. Frequently, spouses sinfully return to new and old romances, and finally the seemingly inevitable break comes with a divorce, with its heartaches, bitternesses, disillusionments, and always scars.<br><br>While marriage is difficult, and discordant and frustrated marriages are common, yet real, lasting happiness is possible, and marriage can be more an exultant ecstasy than the human mind can conceive. This is within the reach of every couple, every person. "Soul mates" are fiction and an illusion; and while every young man and young woman will seek with all diligence and prayerfulness to find a mate with whom life can be most compatible and beautiful, yet it is certain that almost any good man and any good woman can have happiness and a successful marriage if both are willing to pay the price.<br><br>There is a never-failing formula which will guarantee to every couple a happy and eternal marriage; but like all formulas, the principal ingredients must not be left out, reduced, or limited. The selection before courting and then the continued courting after the marriage process are equally important, but not more important than the marriage itself, the success of which depends upon the two individuals--not upon one, but upon two.<br><br>In a marriage commenced and based upon reasonable standards as already mentioned, there are no combinations of power which can destroy it except the power within either or both of the spouses themselves; and they must assume the responsibility generally. Other people and agencies may influence for good or bad. Financial, social, political, and other situations may seem to have a bearing; but the marriage depends first and always on the two spouses who can always make their marriage successful and happy if they are determined, unselfish, and righteous.<br><br>The formula is simple; the ingredients are few, though there are many amplifications of each.<br><br>First, there must be the proper approach toward marriage, which contemplates the selection of a spouse who reaches as nearly as possible the pinnacle of perfection in all the matters which are of importance to the individuals. And then those two parties must come to the altar in the temple realizing that they must work hard toward this successful joint living.<br><br>Second, there must be a great unselfishness, forgetting self and directing all of the family life and all pertaining thereunto to the good of the family, subjugating self.<br><br>Third, there must be continued courting and expressions of affection, kindness, and consideration to keep love alive and growing.<br><br>Fourth, there must be a complete living of the commandments of the Lord as defined in the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>With these ingredients properly mixed and continually kept functioning, it is quite impossible for unhappiness to come, misunderstandings to continue, or breaks to occur. Divorce attorneys would need to transfer to other fields and divorce courts would be padlocked.<br><h2><b>Unselfishness in Marriage</b></h2><br>Two individuals approaching the marriage altar must realize that to attain the happy marriage which they hope for, they must know that marriage is not a legal coverall; but it means sacrifice, sharing, and even a reduction of some personal liberties. It means long, hard economizing. It means children who bring with them financial burdens, service burdens, care and worry burdens; but also it means the deepest and sweetest emotions of all.<br><br>Before marriage, each individual is quite free to go and come as he pleases, to organize and plan his life as it seems best, to make all decisions with self as the central point. Sweethearts should realize before they take the vows that each must accept literally and fully that the good of the little new family must always be superior to the good of either spouse. Each party must eliminate the "I" and the "my" and substitute therefore "we" and "our." Every decision must take into consideration that there are two or more affected by it. As she approaches major decisions now, the wife will be concerned as to the effect they will have upon the parents, the children, the home, and their spiritual lives. His choice of occupation, his social life, his friends, his every interest must now be considered in the light that he is only a part of a family, that the totalness of the group must be considered.<br><br>Every divorce is the result of selfishness on the part of one or the other or both parties to a marriage contract. Someone is thinking of self-comforts, conveniences, freedoms, luxuries, or ease. Sometimes the ceaseless pinpricking of an unhappy, discontented, and selfish spouse can finally add up to serious physical violence. Sometimes people are goaded to the point where they erringly feel justified in doing the things which are so wrong. Nothing, of course, justifies sin.<br><br>Sometimes a wife or a husband feels neglected, mistreated, and ignored until he or she wrongly feels justified in adding to the errors. If each spouse submits to frequent self-analysis and measures his own imperfections by the yardstick of perfection and the Golden Rule, and if each spouse sets about to correct self in every deviation found by such analysis rather than to set about to correct the deviations in the other party, then transformation comes and happiness is the result. There are many pharisaic people who marry who should memorize the parable of the Savior in Luke--people who prate their own virtues and pile up their own qualities of goodness and put them on the scales against the weaknesses of the spouse. They say, "I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all I possess" (see Luke 18:12).<br><br>For every friction, there is a cause; and whenever there is unhappiness, each should search self to find the cause or at least that portion of the cause which originated in that self.<br><br>A marriage may not always be even and incidentless, but it can be one of great peace. A couple may have poverty, illness, disappointment, failures, and even death in the family, but even these will not rob them of their peace. The marriage can be a successful one so long as selfishness does not enter in. Troubles and problems will draw parents together into unbreakable unions if there is total unselfishness there. During the depression of the 1930s there was a definite drop in divorce. Poverty, failures, disappointment they tied parents together. Adversity can cement relationships which prosperity can destroy.<br><br>The marriage that is based upon selfishness is almost certain to fail, The one who marries for wealth or the one who marries for prestige or social plane is certain to be disappointed. The one who marries to satisfy vanity and pride or who marries to spite or to show up another person is fooling only himself. But the one who marries to give happiness as well as receive it, to give service as well as to receive it, and who looks after the interests of the two and then the family as it comes will have a good chance that the marriage will be a happy one.<br><br>Many people there are, though, who do not find divorce attorneys and who do not end their marriages, but who have permitted their marriages to grow stale and weak and cheap. There are spouses who have fallen from the throne of adoration and worship and are in the low state of mere joint occupancy of the home, joint sitters at the table, joint possessors of certain things which cannot be easily divided. These people are on the path that leads to trouble. These people will do well to reevaluate, to renew their courting, to express their affection, to acknowledge kindnesses, and to increase their consideration so their marriage again can become beautiful, sweet, and growing.<br><br>Love is like a flower, and, like the body, it needs constant feeding. The mortal body would soon be emaciated and die if there were not frequent feedings. The tender flower would wither and die without food and water. And so love, also, cannot be expected to last forever unless it is continually fed with portions of love, the manifestation of esteem and admiration, the expressions of gratitude, and the consideration of unselfishness.<br><br>Total unselfishness is sure to accomplish another factor in successful marriage. If one is forever seeking the interests, comforts, and happiness of the other, the love found in courtship and cemented in marriage will grow into mighty proportions. Many couples permit their marriages to become stale and their love to grow cold like old bread or worn-out jokes or cold gravy. Certainly the foods most vital for love are consideration, kindness, thoughtfulness, concern, expressions of affection, embraces of appreciation, admiration, pride, companionship, confidence, faith, partnership, equality, and dependence.<br><br>To be really happy in marriage, one must have a continued faithful observance of the commandments of the Lord. No one, single or married, was ever sublimely happy unless he was righteous. There are temporary satisfactions and camouflaged situations for the moment, but permanent, total happiness can come only through cleanliness and worthiness. One who has a pattern of religious life with deep religious convictions can never be happy in an inactive life. The conscience will continue to afflict, unless it has been seared, in which case the marriage is already in jeopardy. A stinging conscience can make life most unbearable. Inactivity is destructive to marriage, especially where the parties are inactive in varying degrees.<br><br>Religious differences are the most trying and among the most unsolvable of all differences.<br><h2><b>Divinity of Marriage Institution</b></h2><br>Marriage is ordained of God. It is not merely a social custom. Without proper and successful marriage, one will never be exalted. Read the words of your Lord, that it is right and proper to be married.<br><br>That being true, the thoughtful and intelligent Latter-day Saint will plan carefully his life to be sure there are no impediments placed in the way. To make one serious mistake, one may place in the way obstacles which may never be removed and which may block the way to eternal life and godhood--our ultimate destiny. If two people love the Lord more than their own lives and then love each other more than their own lives, working together in total harmony with the gospel program as their basic structure they are sure to have this great happiness. When a husband and wife go together frequently to the holy temple, kneel in prayer together in their home with their family, go hand in hand to their religious meetings, keep their lives wholly chaste, mentally and physically, so that their whole thoughts and desires and loves are all centered in the one being, their companion, and both work together for the upbuilding of the kingdom of God, then happiness is at its pinnacle.<br><br>Sometimes in marriage there are other cleavings, in spite of the fact that the Lord said:<br><br><i>Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 42:22]<br><br>This means just as completely that "thou shalt love thy<i>husband</i>with all thy heart and shall cleave unto<i>him</i>and none else." Frequently, people continue to cleave unto their mothers and their fathers and their chums. Sometimes mothers will not relinquish the hold they have had upon their children; and husbands as well as wives return to their mothers and fathers to obtain advice and counsel and to confide, whereas cleaving should be to the wife in most things, and all intimacies should be kept in great secrecy and privacy from others.<br><br>Couples do well to immediately find their own home, separate and apart from that of the in-laws on either side. The home may be very modest and unpretentious, but still it is an independent domicile. Your married life should become independent of her folks and his folks. You love them more than ever; you cherish their counsel; you appreciate their association; but you live your own lives, being governed by your decisions, by your own prayerful considerations after you have received the counsel from those who should give it. To cleave does not mean merely to occupy the same home; it means to adhere closely, to stick together:<br><br><i>Wherefore, it is lawful that . . . they twain shall be one flesh, and all this that the earth might answer the end of its creation;</i><br><br><i>And that it might be filled with the measure of man, according to his creation before the world was made.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 49: 16–17]<br><br>Our own record is not pleasing. Of 31,037 marriages, our records say only 14,169 were in the temple for eternity. This is 46 percent. There were 7,556 members married out of the Church. This is terribly disturbing to us. This is 24 percent, which means that about 9,000, or 30 percent, apparently thought so little of themselves and their posterity, they married out of the temple, which could give them a key to eternal life. Is it possible they do not know, or do they not care?<br><br>Of course, most such people who marry out of the Church and temple do not weigh the matter. The survey I mentioned disclosed the fact that only about one out of seven nonmember spouses would be converted and baptized into the Church. This is a great loss. It means that in many cases there is not only a loss of the unbaptized spouse, but also of the children and even sometimes the other spouse.<br><br>We love those few who join the Church after marriage. We praise them and honor them, but the odds are against us. According to the figures given above, this means that nearly 6,500 of the new marriages may never find both parties finally joining the Church to make the family totally united. This grieves us very much. The total program of the Lord for the family cannot be enjoyed fully if the people are unequally yoked in marriage.<br><br>We call upon all youth to make such a serious, strong resolution to have a temple marriage that their determination will provide for them the rich promises of eternal marriage with its accompanying joys and happiness. This would please the Lord, who counts on you so heavily. He has said that eternal life can be had only in the way he has planned it.<br><br>May I quote a word or two from the scriptures before closing.<br><br><i>And a white stone is given to each of those who come into the celestial kingdom, whereon is a new name written, which no man knoweth save he that receiveth it. The new name is the key word.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:11]<br><br>It is the<i>normal</i>thing to marry. It was arranged by God in the beginning. One is not wholly normal who does not want to be married. Remember:<br><br><i>Neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.</i>[1 Corinthians 11:11]<br><br>No one can reject this covenant (of celestial marriage) and reach the eternal kingdom of God. This is certain.<br><br><i>In the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees;</i><br><br><i>And in order to obtain the highest, a man must enter into this order of the priesthood</i>[meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage];<br><br><i>And if he does not, he cannot obtain it.</i><br><br><i>He may enter into the other, but that is the end of his kingdom.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 131:1–4]<br><br><i>For behold, I reveal unto you a new and an everlasting covenant; and if ye abide not that covenant, then are ye damned.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 132:4]<br><br>And<i>damned</i>means stopped in progress.<br><br>These are the words of the Lord. They were said directly to us. There is no question about them.<br><br><i>And as pertaining to the new and everlasting covenant, it was instituted for the fulness of my glory; and he that receiveth a fulness thereof must and shall abide the law. . . .</i><br><br><i>Therefore, when they are out of the world</i>[after they have died]<i>they neither marry nor are given in marriage; but are appointed angels in heaven; which angels are ministering servants, to minister for those who are worthy of a far more, and an exceeding, and an eternal weight of glory.</i><br><br><i>For these angels did not abide my law; therefore, they cannot be enlarged, but remain separately and singly, without exaltation, in their saved condition, to all eternity; and from henceforth are not gods, but are angels of God forever and ever.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 132:6, 16–17]<br><br>And one closing thought:<br><br><i>Abraham received all things, whatsoever he received, by revelation and commandment, by my word, saith the Lord, and hath entered into his exaltation and sitteth upon his throne. . . .</i><br><br><i>Go ye, therefore, and do the works of Abraham; enter ye into my law and ye shall be saved.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 132:29, 32]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, may I say, this is the word of the Lord. It is very, very serious, and there is nobody who should argue with the Lord. He made the earth; he made the people. He knows the conditions. He set the program, and we are not intelligent enough or smart enough to be able to argue him out of these important things. He knows what is right and true.<br><br>We ask you to think of these things. All of you students, be sure that your marriage is right. Be sure that your life is right. Be sure that your part of the marriage is carried forward properly.<br><br>Now I ask the Lord to bless you. These things worry us considerably because there are too many divorces and they are increasing. It has come to be a common thing to talk about divorce. The minute there is a little crisis or a little argument in the family, we talk about divorce, and we rush and see an attorney. This is not the way of the Lord. We should go back and adjust our problems and make our marriage compatible and sweet and blessed.<br><br>I pray the Lord will bless each one who faces decisions before marriage and after marriage. I ask his blessings upon each one of you and give you my testimony that this Church is true and divine, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Spencer W.

I really don't want to apologize for being here, but I apologize in the sense that you are used to a General Authority. You will understand, however, that it is general conference week and a very busy time for them. So you do not have a General Authority. In me, you do not even have a specific authority. In me, you do not even have any authority at all. So I pray that you will be patient and that the Lord will provide. I feel a little bit like the politician who, after his fact-filled address, asked if there were any questions. There was only one: "Yes, who else is running?" Tonight, no one else is running, and I pray that you don't.<br><br>I'm deeply grateful for your attendance; I realize that you've been in meetings since six o'clock this morning. Somebody said the definition of a Mormon is one planning for, going to, sitting in, thinking about, or coming from a meeting. That is really the idea about which I want to speak tonight, but I have no illusions about why you're here (except perhaps in the case of the missionaries--I exclude them). But for the rest of you, don't kid me! I know why you're here. I didn't just fall off the turnip truck, you know. I see you out there, and you haven't looked up here to the podium once. Your vision is all horizontal, lateral. I can hear on the great eternal sound system what you fellows are thinking: "She<i>is</i>here. She said she might not come, but she's here. I think a strategically timed stroll to the water fountain would do it." She's saying, "Oh, he's here! He's here! but he's with<i>her."</i>I know your thoughts; I went to this school.<br><br>Now I'll tell the only boy-girl story that I know and get right on with my message. It's really President Tanner's story. It's about the very shy, reticent young man who dated a girl for quite a while. She had waited through a mission and most of an educational career. He wasn't given to a lot of talk anyway (which was one of the things that bothered her), but one night he finally summoned up the supreme, ultimate courage and said this one line: "Will you marry me?" Well, she exploded. "Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Where shall we have the reception? What colors do you think will be best for the bridesmaids? What about the open house? We ought to call mother!" She went on and on and on for I suppose thirty minutes and didn't take a breath. He just sat there in his silent, eloquent way. Finally she realized that she had monopolized the conversation. She said, "Oh, sweetheart, I'm so sorry. Say something. Say something. Don't let me capture all of the splendor of this moment." To which, after some silence, he said, "I think I've said too much already."<br><br>It's a great thing to belong to a church that brings us together. I have worried about, prayed about, and struggled over the message that I might give to you tonight, and I'm giving the message I feel I should. It is not a message that I might usually give, but through the blessing and timeliness of the calendar, it may be the kind of message that I will not have the opportunity to give you ever again so appropriately.<br><h2><b>Purposes of Church Meetings</b></h2><br>You do not have a General Authority here tonight because of general conference. And it is about general conference that I wish to speak. It is also about other conferences, not unlike that in which you now gather, that I also wish to speak. That is why I say it is great to belong to a church that brings us together. "And see that the church meet together often," the Lord directs the priesthood; "it is expedient that the church meet together often" (D&amp;amp;C 20:55, 75). The same counsel was given to the Nephites (see Mosiah 18:25). But let me specifically suggest why, as it seems to me, the Lord asks us to come together--specifically at general conference, about which I wish to say more, but in part at firesides and sacrament meetings and family home evenings and family prayers and other kinds of conferences that we hold before the Lord.<br><br>Section 43 of the Doctrine and Covenants comes from a very, very rich period of Church history. It was one of those forty-five- or sixty-day periods in which the blessings and the revelations of the Lord were pouring out. You will note from the sequence of sections that within this period we have received section 42 containing the law of the Church, section 46 enumerating the gifts of the spirit, and other revelations. I quote from section 43:<br><br><i>And now, behold, I give unto you a commandment, that when ye are assembled together ye shall instruct and edify each other, that ye may know how to act and direct my church, how to act upon the points of my law and commandments, which I have given.</i><br><br><i>And thus ye shall become instructed in the law of my church, and be sanctified by that which ye have received, and ye shall bind yourselves to act in all holiness before me....</i><br><br><i>And ye are to be taught from on high. Sanctify yourselves and ye shall be endowed with power.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 43:8–9, 16]<br><br>Administratively, ecclesiastically, in terms of priesthood power, that seems to be a marvelous description of what is supposed to happen when we come together: instruction, edification, ultimately sanctification, that we may "bind" ourselves "to act in all holiness" before him.<br><br>Now, I assume that binding may have a couple of meanings. It surely means to bind ourselves to him, that we come together under covenant. Remember it is the<i>church</i>which is called to meet together--those who have made promises to the Lord. But I suspect it also means that we bind ourselves together, to each other, to act before God as a church ought to act, to administer in the affairs of his law, to see that the Church is what the Church is supposed to be, and to in fact see that the kingdom comes. Now that's part of what we do, I think, when we get together and participate in that kind of binding. Let me read one more verse. It is one of the last lines Moroni gives before closing his book:<br><br><i>And after they had been received unto baptism, and were wrought upon and cleansed by the power of the Holy Ghost, they were numbered among the people of the church of Christ; and their names were taken, that they might be remembered and nourished by the good word of God, to keep them in the right way, to keep them continually watchful unto prayer, relying alone upon the merits of Christ, who was the author and the finisher of their faith.</i><br><br><i>And the church did meet together oft, to fast and to pray, and to speak one with another concerning the welfare of their souls.</i><br><br><i>And they did meet together oft to partake of bread and wine in remembrance of the Lord Jesus.</i><br><br><i>And they were strict to observe that there should be no iniquity among them.</i>[Moroni 6:4–7]<br><br>I suppose there may be a branch president or a high councilor or an elders quorum president or a visiting teacher in the room who wants to know what it is we are to accomplish as Church members when we get together, even if it's only in a home evening group or an opportunity to pray together. Well, this passage indicates that it may have something to do with remembering each other. We all count. Everyone matters. We have a name and it's recorded and we need to remember that here. No one must get lost. "And their names were taken, that they might be remembered and nourished by the good word of God ... to keep them continually watchful unto prayer, relying alone upon the merits of Christ ... to fast and to speak with one another concerning the welfare of their souls ... to observe that there should be no iniquity among them"--what a great thought about meetings and what they are supposed to do, what a Sunday School class can be, what a scriptural discussion in an apartment can be.<br><h2><b>History of General Conferences</b></h2><br>Well, we've been having conferences and meetings of that kind for a long, long time. I don't know when the first was held--in a very private sense I suppose it was held in the Garden of Eden. More publicly, in any sense that we could talk about a general conference, I suppose the first is the one described in section 107 of the Doctrine and Covenants. You will recall that passage describes the moment when Adam calls together his posterity in the valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman and there prophesies, to the very last generation of his family, about what would befall his people. And it says, "The Lord appeared unto them, and they rose up and blessed Adam, and called him Michael" (see D&amp;amp;C 107:41–57). That kind of gathering, to receive the word of the Lord, has continued ever since.<br><br>King Benjamin's sermon--for which he had to bring people together in such a crowd that they could not all see him or hear him, for which he had to build a tower and distribute a multilithed text of his talk--gave us the first example of the<i>Conference Report,</i>I suppose. That's part of the reason we have the<i>Ensign.</i>Every May and November we have a new religious text. Like King Benjamin, President Kimball wants the text to be heard and to be read. If we're not all able to crowd into the Tabernacle, as King Benjamin's people were not, then it is important that we see and hear and read as much as we can. The<i>Conference Report</i>becomes scripture to us in our own day. Christ, on both continents, held those kinds of conferences--on mountaintops, by the seashore, in a boat, in an upper room. He held them almost anywhere and everywhere because the people hungered and thirsted for the kind of message that comes by the voice of the Lord.<br><br>How hungry and thirsty are we? Let me read you one general conference address given by the Savior, or at least the conclusion of it:<br><br><i>I perceive that ye are weak, that ye cannot understand all my words which I am commanded of the Father to speak unto you at this time.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, go ye unto your homes, and ponder upon the things which I have said....</i><br><br><i>But now I go unto the Father, and also to show myself unto the lost tribes of Israel, for they are not lost unto the Father, for he knoweth whither he hath taken them.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that when Jesus had thus spoken, he cast his eyes round about again on the multitude, and beheld they were in tears, and did look steadfastly upon him as if they would ask him to tarry a little longer with them.</i>[3 Nephi 17:2–5]<br><br>They were so sensitive and appreciative. Apparently no one was saying anything. No one said aloud, "Won't you stay? We're not tired. We haven't even noticed that we haven't eaten all day. Won't you stay?" They said it with their eyes and with their spirits, however.<br><br><i>And he said unto them: Behold, my bowels are filled with compassion towards you.</i><br><br><i>Have ye any that are sick among you? ...</i><br><br><i>... and he did heal them everyone as they were brought forth unto him.</i><br><br><i>And they did all, both they who had been healed and they who were whole, bow down at his feet, and did worship him; and as many as could come for the multitude did kiss his feet, insomuch that they did bathe his feet with their tears.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that he commanded that their little children should be brought....</i><br><br><i>... he wept, ... and he took their little children, one by one, and blessed them, and prayed unto the Father for them.</i><br><br><i>And when he had done this he wept again;</i><br><br><i>... and [he] said unto them: Behold your little ones.</i><br><br><i>And as they looked to behold they cast their eyes towards heaven, and they saw the heavens open, and they saw angels descending out of heaven as it were in the midst of fire; and they came down and encircled those little ones about and they were encircled about with fire; and the angels did minister unto them.</i>[3 Nephi 17:6–7, 9–11, 21–24]<br><br>If there is a more touching scene in all scripture anywhere, I don't know where it is. I hope everyone cared enough to attend that kind of conference. I hope no one stayed home that day. Perhaps there was a ball game on, or the gardening needed to be done, or some very legitimate work in the basement. But if anybody stayed home from the general conference that is just concluding in 3 Nephi 17, I can promise you that he must have surely missed what has to be, for me, one of the greatest moments ever recorded in scripture anywhere.<br><br>What would it have been like to hear the Savior pray?<br><br><i>He himself also knelt upon the earth; and behold he prayed unto the Father, and the things which he prayed cannot be written, and the multitude did bear record....</i><br><br><i>... The eye hath never seen, neither hath the ear heard, before, so great and marvelous things as we saw and heard Jesus speak unto the Father.</i>[3 Nephi 17:15, 16]<br><br>How do you "see" a prayer? What did they see? I don't know. It cannot be written. No one has ever been able to record what this group both<i>saw</i>and<i>heard</i>Jesus speak unto the Father. Surely no basement, no garden, no ball game was worth missing that. I don't know any more about it than what I read here, but I am confident it was glorious to those in attendance.<br><br>Of course the early Church continued its general conferences. You'll remember in the first book of Acts that Peter called the Church together. The attendance figure given is 120. That's interesting. I wonder whether that meant some sort of conference by invitation or whether it meant that the antagonism and the antipathy and the emotion of what had just been experienced, both in terms of Roman persecution and Jewish persecution and the death of the Savior, meant that we now had a church of only 120. Remember the five thousand that met out on the hill? It was four thousand on another occasion and probably in the thousands frequently. Now we've got 120. I don't know whether that's the entire Church or not, but it is at least a general conference of some sort (or a general priesthood meeting) in which Peter, the presiding officer of the Church, calls the brethren together and says that they have to fill the quorum and go on with the work of the Lord. Of course, they do so in a dramatic and impressive way.<br><br>All of this is only to suggest that we come down in our own day to the work of the Lord, to continue the work of Adam and of King Benjamin and of Christ and of Peter after him. Now we meet at the feet of President Spencer W. Kimball, whom I testify with all my heart to be a prophet. Whatever else I may choose to say at the conclusion of this talk, I need<i>you</i>to know that<i>I</i>know this with all my heart.<br><h2><b>General Conferences Early in this Dispensation</b></h2><br>The practice of holding a Church conference in our dispensation was officially initiated on April 6, 1830, the same day that the Church was organized. At that time this very small congregation was called upon to ratify something (a brief document) called the<i>Articles an Covenants of the Church.</i><br><br>It stipulated:<br><br><i>The several elders composing this Church of Christ are to meet in conference once in three months, or from time to time as said conferences shall direct or appoint;</i><br><br><i>And said conferences are to do whatever church business is necessary to be done at that time....</i><br><br><i>It shall be the duty of the several churches, composing the church of Christ, to send one or more of their teachers to attend the several conferences held by the elders of the church.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 20:61–62, 81]<br><br>Pursuant to that instruction given by the Lord the day the Church was organized, the first conference thereafter was held, as directed, three months later--on June 9, 1830, in the Peter Whitmer, Sr., home of Fayette, Seneca County, New York. Approximately thirty members assembled in this very small home, which I hope you have had a chance to visit. According to the minutes which were taken by Oliver Cowdery, Joseph Smith, Jr., read the fourteenth chapter of Ezekiel and then offered prayer. If I were to call for a response, how many of you could tell me what is contained in the fourteenth chapter of Ezekiel? That's an interesting text for the first conference of the Church. I would not have known, quite frankly, what was in the fourteenth chapter until I reviewed this history and read it again. May I invite you to do so, and then may I invite you to compare it with the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants, which as you know is called the "preface" to this dispensation. Would you see if there is any theme in Ezekiel's chapter fourteen which would link it with section one of the Doctrine and Covenants, which of course had not yet been revealed? I leave with you the invitation to read Ezekiel 14 and D&amp;amp;C section one.<br><br>Joseph Smith in his own diary supplem-ented the minutes of Oliver Cowdery and documented that they sang a song and partook of the sacrament and then received by unanimous voice the<i>Articles and Covenants of the Church.</i>Oliver Cowdery ordained Samuel Smith an elder, and Joseph Smith, Sr., and Hyrum Smith were ordained priests. At this conference:<br><br><i>Much exhortation and instruction was given and the Holy Ghost was poured out upon us in a miraculous manner. Many of our number prophesied whilst others had the heavens opened to their view. ... The goodness and the condescension of a merciful God unto such as obeying the everlasting gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ combined to create within us a sensation of rapturous gratitude and inspire us with fresh zeal and energy in the cause of truth.</i>[<i>Times and Seasons,</i>4:23]<br><br>If there has ever been given a line about the purpose of a general conference of the Church or a stake conference of the Church or a sacrament meeting of the Church, it surely could be that: "[It] combined to create within us a sensation of rapturous gratitude and inspire us with fresh zeal and energy in the cause of truth."<br><br>Fourteen years later John Taylor, soon to be the President of the Church, said of this experience:<br><br><i>A few men assembled in a log cabin; they saw visions of heaven, and gazed upon the eternal world; they looked through the rent vista of futurity, and beheld the glories of eternity; they were laying the foundation for the salvation of this world.</i>[<i>Documentary History of the Church,</i>6:295]<br><br>Sidney Rigdon, who was to have difficulties of his own, said fourteen years later:<br><br><i>We knew ... that the Church would become as large as it is today. We were as big then as we ever shall be. We began to talk like men in authority and power. ... If we did not see these very people [who fourteen years later were before them], we saw by vision the Church of God, a thousand times larger ..., although we were then not enough to well man a farm. ... all the Elders, all the members met in conference in a room twenty feet square. ... We talked about people coming as doves to the windows; and nations should flock into it. ... We talked such big things that most men could not bear them.</i>[<i>Documentary History of the Church,</i>6:289. The first conference that Sidney Rigdon could have attended personally was held in January 1831. This may have been the one to which he was referring.]<br><br>Take the opportunity, if you can, to be in Salt Lake City sometime this next weekend. Ask yourself if the doves are flocking to the windows and if from every nation there are not those representatives of the church and kingdom of God coming. Whatever talk Oliver and Sidney and the Prophet Joseph and the Whitmers had, however big it must have seemed to all twenty or thirty in attendance, I suppose--could they have seen it--they would not have imagined what salvation of men they were in fact initiating.<br><h2><b>Modern General Conferences</b></h2><br>From that day to this, general conferences have been held under the commandment of God and have provided us with opportunities to note our growth and to reassess our faith and to recommit our efforts. I noticed something last night in the<i>Church News</i>. (I hope you read the<i>Church News.</i>) These are the opening lines on page one. The purpose of general conference, according to President Spencer W. Kimball, is to<br><br>"r<i>efresh our faith, strengthen our testimonies, and learn the ways of the Lord from his duly appointed and authorized servants." With the opening of the 146th Semiannual General Conference of the Church on October first in the Tabernacle on Temple Square, members of the Church in many parts of the world will have a chance to be refreshed, strengthened, and taught. "For me conference is really a happy time . ... I have always enjoyed conference. I always come away from conference with a new resolve that I will do better."</i>[<i>Church News,</i>25 September 1976]<br><br>President Kimball leaving conference, committed to do better! How does that make the rest of us feel? I suppose that you and I can profit from that kind of commitment to an event that is about to take place. Institutionally, and in a very dramatic way, we are allowed to see that which is the lifeblood of this Church.<br><h2><b>Revelation</b></h2><br>Joseph Smith once said that the Book of Mormon is the keystone of our religion. Why is the Book of Mormon the keystone of our religion? What is the Book of Mormon? Whatever else it is, it is revelation. In fact, it is a revelation about revelation. It is the basic document by which we would begin to testify to the world, with a copy in our hands, that the heavens are opened and that God lives and that he speaks and that Jesus is the Christ. That is a basic message of salvation. And the process by which that message comes is revelation. And Joseph Smith taught that that is the characteristic of this Church, a characteristic by which it will always be known and recognized. This weekend will be a most majestic example of revelation. Surely in terms of numbers and impact and scope and concentration and power and priesthood we will learn anew, as a church, that God does live, that Jesus is the Christ, that the heavens are opened, that there are living prophets alive and well in the Salt Lake Tabernacle. They will be on television, and people can see and hear them and respond to their testimony if they will.<br><br>I do not minimize the revelations that come privately. I do not minimize in any sense, as you would know, the revelation that comes to a stake president or to a bishop or to a Relief Society president or to a father and mother. But I am saying simply as a declaration to this world that the heavens are open in a much broader way. I quote Joseph Smith: "Salvation cannot come without revelation. It is vain for anyone to minister without it. ... The plea of many in this day is that we have no right to receive revelations; but if we do not get revelations, then we do not have oracles of God; and if they do not have oracles of God, they are not the people of God" (<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</i>pp. 160, 272). Well, we are the people of God, because we have oracles who receive revelation. We cannot with impunity act as if this were any other weekend. It is not. It never has been. It never will be. It is the most dramatic moment in any six-month period of the year, wherein the power and the ability and the voice of the Lord are made manifest to the inhabitants of this earth, and that includes the students at Brigham Young University.<br><br>I have here a sheaf of quotes of which I will not read all, but I would like to read you two. One is from John Taylor about the role of a prophet in this Church, that thing by which this Church is known. John Taylor said:<br><br><i>We require a living tree--a living fountain--living intelligence, proceeding from the living priesthood in heaven, through the living priesthood on earth. And from the time that Adam first received a communication from God, to the time that John, on the isle of Patmos, received his communication, or Joseph Smith had the heavens opened to him, it always required new revelations, adapted to the peculiar circumstances in which the churches or individuals were placed. Adam's revelation did not instruct Noah to build his ark; nor did Noah's revelation tell Lot to forsake Sodom; nor did either of these speak of the departure of the children of Israel from Egypt. These all had revelations for themselves, and so did Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Jesus, Peter, Paul, John, and Joseph. And so must we, or we shall make a shipwreck.</i>[<i>Gospel Kingdom,</i>p. 34]<br><br>I remember President Harold B. Lee's last conference as vividly as if it were yesterday. I remember him leaning across the pulpit and sort of sliding his text aside and looking at the people in the audience. This is what he said at his last conference:<br><br><i>Now, you Latter-day Saints, I think you've never attended a conference where in these three days you have heard more inspired declarations on most every subject and problem about which the world is worrying. If you want to know what the Lord would have the Saints know and to have his guidance and direction for the next six months, get a copy of the proceedings of this conference, and you will have the latest word of the Lord as far as the Saints are concerned. And</i>[also]<i>all others who are not of us, but who believe what has been said has been "the mind of the Lord, the will of the Lord, and the voice of the Lord, and the power of God unto salvation."</i>(D&amp;amp;C 68:4) [<i>Ensign,</i>January 1974, p. 128]<br><br>Within three months of that conference President Lee was gone, leaving that powerful testimony with us.<br><h2><b>Elijah's General Conference</b></h2><br>Conference can do a great deal to caution us if we need cautioning. I'm reminded of one general conference that was not as pleasant as some we've described. This is what the Lord said about Ahab. It is not the kind of thing that I personally would want to record in<i>my</i>Treasures of Truth, but this is what was said: "Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord above all that were before him. ... And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings, of Israel that were before him" (1 Kings 16:30, 33). That's not a great thing to have said about you, but I suppose, if you need it, someone should say it.<br><br>You'll recall the story that Elijah comes under the direction of the Lord and calls down a famine, a drought, in which there is no rain and no product from the fields. Then after three years the Lord calls Elijah out of the mountains, where he has been fed by ravens and has drunk water at the brook Cherith. He comes down out of the mountain and faces Ahab, who walks up and says with alarm or disbelief--or both--"Art thou he who troubleth Israel?" (1 Kings 18:17). It hasn't been a great three years for Elijah. (I don't know what ravens bring this season, but it's not a heavy menu.) Elijah confesses that, in the name of the Lord, he<i>has</i>been the cause of Israel's grief. He then says that he would like to call a general conference:<br><br><i>Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal, four hundred and fifty.</i>["I've got a general conference address I want to give."] ...<br><br><i>Let them</i>[the priests of Baal]<i>give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under;</i><br><br><i>And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the Lord: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.</i>[1 Kings 18:19, 23–24]<br><br>You can just hear that murmur, their response, right out of the tabernacle, can't you?<br><br><i>And they</i>[the priests of Baal]<i>took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.</i>[1 Kings 18:26]<br><br>They were getting a little nervous by about noon and they were sort of leaping around, crashing into the altar a little bit. It was a lot less formal than what had happened about eight o'clock in the morning. The pressure was on them.<br><br>Now at this point Elijah removed himself slightly from the traditional prophetic role. By and large, prophets do not mock their opposition. But, as I said, this had not been a particularly pleasant three years for him either. And so at noon, when everyone was getting nervous and crashing into the altar as they did their chanting, Elijah was over resting on a chaise lounge nearby. He'd just been watching. It wasn't his turn yet. The scripture says, "It came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them" (1 Kings 18:27). (That's why I say it's not the traditional prophetic role, but the tenth-century B.C. equivalent of "ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!" Elijah mocked them and said something like this: "Cry louder. The problem obviously is volume. You've got to get up there with this message. Cry louder. Surely he's there; there's no question about that. Perhaps he's talking--you know, been in a long conversation. His wife's worried about the petunias, and perhaps she's talking to him about them. Or perhaps he's 'pursuing.' Maybe he's in the basement woodworking and they don't have a phone down there. Or perhaps he's on a journey. Or perhaps he's sleeping and must be awakened. Surely there is some good reason why he doesn't answer you, and I think volume is the answer. Cry louder." The fun thing is that the next line reads, "They cried louder." They were taking advice from<i>any</i>source by noon. "And [they] cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them" (1 Kings 18:28). You can tell they were really concerned. They weren't just running into the altar now; this was serious business.<br><br>"And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice" (1 Kings 18:29)--probably six o'clock at night. They may have gone as long as twelve hours, and Elijah hadn't even had his chance yet. The priests had gotten nowhere. There sat that bullock and no fire. "There was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded. And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me" (1 Kings 18:29–30). The time was nearly gone. If there was to be a sacrifice it would have to be very soon. Elijah would have no time to do any of their chants, to march around the altar, or to cut himself.<br><br><i>And all the people came near unto him</i>[Elijah].<i>And he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down.</i><br><br><i>And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the Lord came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:</i><br><br><i>And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.</i><br><br><i>And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.</i><br><br><i>And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.</i><br><br><i>And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.</i>[1 Kings 18:30–35]<br><br>And now with this sacrifice soaked, saturated, drenched--wood, bullock, stone, and sand--"it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near" (1 Kings 18:36). I declare to you that that line is<i>explicitly</i>used. This crowd had just seen 450 cheap imitations. They had heard all kinds of prayers and all kinds of strange incantations. And now here came this thin little man who had been away for three years. The record describes him in the word of God as "Elijah<i>the prophet</i>" (emphasis added). That's exactly what he was. And he knelt down and said:<br><br><i>Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word.</i><br><br><i>Hear me, o Lord, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the Lord God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.</i><br><br><i>Then the fire of the Lord fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.</i><br><br><i>And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The Lord, he is the God; the Lord, he is the God.</i>[1 Kings 18:36–39]<br><br>"And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. ... I, even I only, remain a prophet of the Lord" (1 Kings 18:21–22). I think we all need a little fire of the Lord to fall into our lives. I think we do, in fact, fall prey to the very kind of idol worship which Joseph describes in Ezekiel 14 and D&amp;amp;C section one--the very kind of idol worship which has beset the priests of Baal and their groves. Elijah asked, "How long will it go on? Will it go on forever and ever and ever? Will not Israel ever, ever cease to follow those false gods which have attracted and lured and offered their enticements since time began? How long? O Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, how long?"<br><h2><b>Benefits from Modern Conferences</b></h2><br>This weekend the Lord goes on record one more time with the truth. Are you wondering whether you should go on a mission or not? I'll bet you dollars to doughnuts you hear an answer this weekend. Do you think you ought to get a year's supply or prepare your families? I'd be willing to bet that you hear something about that this weekend. Are you worried about prayer? Are you worried about charity? Are you uncertain about the Book of Mormon? I'll bet you will hear about all of those this weekend. Somewhere, sometime, those testimonies are going to be borne, because they always have and they always will, because, like Elijah, President Spencer W. Kimball and his associates will go before us and declare that they are indeed prophets, seers, and revelators in the only true and living church on the face of the earth. That says something about the power of the prophet. That is what these young missionary men and women on this side of the hall are going to say to the world. And if we can say it well enough, if we can believe it and honor it enough, I believe we'll get a chance to tell the world why we know that Jesus is the Christ and what that means in our day, in a living church in 1976.<br><br>I suggested earlier that there are other kinds of conferences besides general conferences. I wish I had time to talk about them. I believe with all my heart that sacrament meeting is a conference, made more available than once in six months.<br><br>I suggest that family home evening is a conference, both now as students and when you have your own families. I wish I could tell you about the experience that Pat and I had while we were in graduate school, which (short of this last 130 days) was the busiest time I've ever had in my life. We made a couple of promises to ourselves then: first, that we would continue to "date" each other, even without any money or without any time; second, that even with two little children, both small enough not to know if we didn't, we would never miss a family home evening. Someday maybe I can tell you what those promises have meant in our lives.<br><br>I wish we could take time to talk about what kinds of conferences you can have with each other, one on one. A marvelous, touching, beautiful story was told to me just the other day about a girl that I had tried to reach and could not<i>,</i>that her mother had tried to reach and could not, that her bishop had tried to reach and could not, that her stake president had tried to reach and could not. Nobody could reach her--except her girlfriend, who took her by the collar, shook her, started to cry, and said, "Don't you see? Don't you see what you're doing to me? You break my heart!" She sobbed. She just shook, and she shook her friend. That girl, when nobody (it appeared) on the face of this earth could touch her, is in the Church. With the help of her bishop, she is on the way to repentance in as dramatic and as beautiful and as glowing a way as I have ever seen in my life. I could not reach her; her mother could not reach her; her bishop could not reach her; but a friend reached her and literally grabbed her and shook her and said, "You're breaking my heart!" That's one kind of a conference worth having. I invite you to hold it--maybe less dramatically, but to talk about "the welfare of your souls" and to "see that there is no iniquity among you." It might not hurt to read again Moroni 6, sometime when you're alone in your apartment.<br><br>Prayer is perhaps the greatest conference of all. But that's a subject for another complete talk.<br><br>I was recently in Vavau, Tonga. It is a little island which is one and a half hours away from Nuku'alofa by plane and twenty-four hours away by boat. By boat it is the worst trip that can be made. (If you don't believe that, ask Elder Gordon B. Hinckley, who went there recently to organize a stake and could not get a plane.) When the area conference was announced for Tonga, it was determined that only one boat would be available for the Saints from Vavau. The boat held 150 people. If you stuffed bodies into every possible corner of the ship, you could get close to three hundred people.<i>Eight hundred Tongans jammed onto that boat</i>and stood up for twenty-four hours without sleep, without food, without drink, without anything--because they knew that a prophet of God was going to be in their islands and they were not going to miss him for anything in the world.<br><br>Do you want to go to conference that badly? Do you care that the prophet of the Lord is speaking in the neighborhood? Do you care enough to flip on a television set, a radio, or to come to this building to watch a priesthood meeting? Eight hundred people stood up for twenty-four hours to get to conference, and they didn't think anything about it. "The President of the Church is here," they said. "That's our prophet, and we may not see him again soon." And they came.<br><br>The other story I want to tell you comes out of southern Utah. A man who'd been away from the Church for half a century came back to Utah and took a job as custodian of the local chapel, promising the bishop that he'd come to church and stop smoking. But he did neither. The bishop did not rebuke him, but he kept asking, "Do you remember the promise you made?"<br><br>The man said, "Yes, I remember, Bishop." The bishop would smile and shake hands and walk away, but the man did not come to church and he did not stop smoking. One night, inside the chapel when he was working late, he was overcome with the most terrifying, paralyzing fear he had ever experienced in his life. (I heard him say this with his own lips, though I do not know the man's name.) He said, "I have never been so fearful, so frightened, so petrified in my life. I've been afraid. I have been in dangerous, frightening circumstances, but there is nothing in this world with which I can compare or any way in this world I can describe the experience I had that night. Every creak and crack and dark corner of the chapel terrified me, and I began to run." This was a grown man speaking, a grandfather. "I began to run from the building and fled to my home. But I was also just as terrified in my own home, and I could not control my emotions. I ran from my home and went to a shed behind my house. And for the first time in half a century I fell to my knees and I prayed. I said, 'O Lord, save me from whatever this is that terrifies me so.'" Quaking, trembling, perspiring on his knees in this shed out behind his home, he continued his prayer. He said, "I was lisping like a child the only prayers I knew, when there came into my heart the words of a song that I had not heard nor sung for that half century. I think I did not ever know the words, and I surely do not know them now. But I heard them with symphonic accompaniment and angelic choirs. I heard them, music and word, in that shed behind my home in the middle of that night." It's a hymn that you know, my young friends, and the opening line is "We thank thee, O God, for a prophet." The man said, "I stopped trembling, and I stopped crying, and I know I heard the angels sing. I've never missed a church meeting since that day. I've never smoked a cigarette, and I've tried to do everything I should have done for all those years. But I want you to know that I did not then, and I probably do not now know, the words to the hymn that I heard sung that night in a shed behind my home with a celestial symphony and an angelic choir." It was indeed a message to a world that's fearful and frightened and desperately in need.<br><br>"We thank thee, O God, for a prophet"--of whom I testify, Spencer W. Kimball, and who will give his testimony this weekend. To that I bear witness and of him I bear witness, and of the Church he leads I bear witness, and of the Son of God who leads him I bear witness, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Jeffrey R.

<h1>hets and the Scriptures - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brethren and sisters, I'm thrilled as I look at this great audience, and I'm highly honored at having been invited to occupy this position here this morning. Considering my age, I doubt if I'll ever get another invitation to come back, but I'll treasure as long as I live the opportunities that I've enjoyed over the years to attend this institution and the devotionals and so forth. I think it's wonderful to come here. This is a wonderful campus, wonderful buildings, wonderful faculty, and wonderful young people--nothing else like them in all this world. And I thank the Lord for each one of you and for your faith and for your presence here today.<br><br>In thinking what I might say to you today, I thought of what President Kimball has written in the editorial in the September issue of the<i>Ensign.</i>In that article there are three full pages, six columns, where he's exhorting us to study the scriptures. I like that thinking. I love the scriptures, and I love President Kimball. I thank the Lord for him and his great leadership ability and for his life because we need men of his stature to guide us in these latter days. You remember the song that we all sing with such fervor: "We thank thee, O God, for a prophet to guide us in these latter days." And we do thank him, and we want to follow his counsel and his advice.<br><h2><b>The More Sure Word of Prophecy</b></h2><br>In thinking of what I might say about the scriptures, I thought of an experience that I had in Ogden a few years back when I attended a conference there and had as my companion one of the counselors in the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association of the Church. In his talk he made this statement which I want to present to you here today. He said that a university professor once said to his class, "Is there anyone in this class who believes that there's any way we can know a thing before it transpires?" Nobody answered. Then the teacher commented, "I'm happy to know that none of you believes in those silly ideas of your parents that you can know things by prophecy, know in advance." That's all this man said about it. When my turn came to speak, I said, "Listening to what my companion has said, I thought, if one of my children had been in that class, they might not have said anything, but in their hearts they would have said, 'Well if he doesn't know any better than that, let him think what he wants to.'" Now, that's my idea of prophecy.<br><br>You remember, following the resurrection of the Savior, he walked along the way by two of his disciples on the way to Emmaus. (We're told that "their eyes were holden" that they didn't recognize him.) When he heard what they had to say about him and his ministry and his crucifixion, he realized that they didn't comprehend what the prophets had said and predicted about him. He said, "O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken." And commencing with Moses and the prophets, he showed them how that in all things the prophets had testified of him (see Luke 24:13­27). That would be a nice lesson in itself--just to consider those prophecies--because the prophets foretold his life and ministry in such minute detail that they even declared men would cast lots for his clothing at the time of his crucifixion--and that they did. Then we're told by Peter that he opened the understanding of his apostles that they might understand the scriptures. And that's what the Lord has done in the restoration of his truth to the earth. In our day, he has opened our understanding that we might understand the scriptures.<br><br>I like the statement by the apostle Peter:<br><br><i>We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the daystar arise in your hearts:</i><br><br><i>Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation.</i><br><br><i>For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</i>[2 Peter 1:19­21]<br><br>Now according to Peter, prophecy is more sure than anything else in the world because, when prophets speak under the influence of the Spirit of the Lord, their prophecies will surely come to pass.<br><h2><b>Prophecies about the Growth of the Church</b></h2><br>I would like to give you an illustration of prophecy in our day. In the general conference of the Church in 1898, President Wilford Woodruff told about when he first met the Prophet Joseph Smith. He said he met the Prophet for the first time when he attended a meeting where many of the brethren bore testimony of the Restoration. When they got through, the Prophet said, "Brethren, I have been very much edified and instructed in your testimonies here tonight, but I want to say to you before the Lord that you know no more concerning the destiny of this church and kingdom than a babe upon his mother's lap." It is only a little handful of priesthood you see here, and yet our last priesthood meeting during April conference was broadcast in 1,050 different buildings all over the land. Is there anything else like it in this world? Has there ever been anything like it in the world, as far as the priesthood of God is concerned? The Prophet Joseph understood all of this, and he said, "It is only a little handful of priesthood you see here tonight, but this Church will fill North and South America. It will fill the world. It will fill the Rocky Mountains." (This was fourteen years before our people came to the Rocky Mountains.) As our Brethren used to say, they came willingly because they<i>had</i>to. They were driven out, but the Prophet Joseph knew all of that in vision before ever they came: "There will be tens of thousands of Latter-day Saints who will be gathered in the Rocky Mountains, and there they will open the door for the establishment of the gospel among the Lamanites."<br><br>You know what's going on down in Mexico and South America, the great multitudes of Lamanites that are being brought into the Church. Now the Brethren have planned eight area conferences down in those lands, and the people are coming in by the thousands. We had a report from one mission President who reported his mission recently. He said, during the three years he presided, they had had seventeen thousand new converts come into the Church in that mission. Well, the Prophet Joseph saw all of that. Prophecy, Peter says, is the most sure thing that we have in the world.<br><h2><b>Isaiah's Prophecies</b></h2><br>Now, in the Book of Mormon, we're told in three places that we should study the prophecies of Isaiah because they would all be fulfilled. Let me just read you what the Savior said when he visited the Nephites here in this land of America:<br><br><i>Ye remember that I spake unto you, and said that when the words of Isaiah should be fulfilled--behold they are written, ye have them before you, therefore search them--</i><br><br><i>And verily, verily, I say unto you, that when they shall be fulfilled, then is the fulfilling of the covenant which the Father hath made unto his people, O house of Israel.</i>[3 Nephi 20:11­12]<br><br>The Lord decreed through Jeremiah that he would make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah, and we have that new covenant that he has made with the house of Israel. The Savior also said that at the time when these things--the words of Isaiah--should come to pass he would make this covenant. Then he added:<br><br><i>And then shall the remnants which shall be scattered abroad upon the face of the earth, be gathered in from the east and from the west, and from the south and from the north; and they shall be brought to the knowledge of the Lord their God, who hath redeemed them.</i>[3 Nephi 20:13]<br><br>It was a long while ago that he made that statement, but you and I are living to see the literal fulfillment of it today.<br><br>Moroni, speaking of the words of Isaiah, said, "For the eternal purposes of the Lord shall roll on, until all his promises shall be fulfilled" (Mormon 8:22). We don't need to worry about that. As Isaiah said, the Lord hath declared the end from the beginning (see Isaiah 46:10). He said, "The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand forever" (Isaiah 40:8). Moroni said that all of Isaiah's promises shall be fulfilled. We should search the prophecies of Isaiah.<br><br>Then Nephi made this statement regarding the prophecies of Isaiah: "But behold, I proceed with mine own prophecy, according to my plainness; in the which I know that no man can err; nevertheless, in the days that the prophecies of Isaiah shall be fulfilled men shall know of a surety, at the times when they shall come to pass" (2 Nephi 25:7). Now, as I study the prophecies of Isaiah, it seems to me that he almost lived more in our day than in the time when he was actually upon the earth. He saw so much of what would transpire in this dispensation.<br><br>Then Nephi continues, "Wherefore, they [the prophecies of Isaiah] are of worth unto the children of men, and he that supposeth that they are not, unto them will I speak particularly, and confine the words unto mine own people; for I know that they shall be of great worth unto them in the last days; for in that day shall they understand them; wherefore, for their good have I written them" (2 Nephi 25:8). That's why our prophet and seer and revelator advises us to study the scriptures--because, as Nephi said, they shall be of great worth to us in the latter days. That's a marvelous statement about the prophecies of Isaiah.<br><br>I'd like to give you a few of these prophecies and refer to them because I think that Isaiah lived more, as I tell you, in our day. He saw the day when the desert should blossom as a rose. If this wasn't a desert when our people first came here over a thousand miles from transportation, I don't know what you'd call a desert. Isaiah said:<br><br><i>The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.</i><br><br><i>It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing: the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon</i>[those great ancient cities];<i>They shall see the glory of the Lord, and the excellency of our God.</i>[Isaiah 35:1­2]<br><br>When I was in the real estate business years ago, I attended a real estate board convention back in Kansas City. The president of the national organization (this was before we had planes to fly around in, and we had to go by train) said he'd visited nearly every large city in the United States during his presidency. He said cities were like people. They had personality. He said, "And after visiting most of these cities, as I left, I never thought of them again. But there were a few cities that stood out as I visited them, that were above all others. When I left, I wanted to return again." He named about six of the cities, and one of them was Salt Lake City. This is a beautiful country in which we live, and in the words of the Book of Mormon, the Lord hid it away from the eyes of the world that it should not be overrun, that it might be the gathering place of his people in the latter days. I thank the Lord for this beautiful city.<br><br>Isaiah said, "Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened" (Isaiah 35:5). I don't know how you'd fulfill that except, in our day, we have the Braille system. They never had anything like that when this statement was made by Isaiah; now the blind can read. Isaiah also said, "And the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped" (Isaiah 35:5). I don't know if they had any books in those days or not, but not very many. You remember, even in the days of Lincoln, how he borrowed books from all around the neighborhood and read at the fireside. Then think of what we have today. The ears of the deaf are opened because they can read everything due to the multitude of books that have been written. And then Isaiah added, "And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where each lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes" (Isaiah 35:7). Think of what's happened here in this country since the pioneers arrived here. And then he added, "And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away" (Isaiah 35:10). They came here in sorrow, but their sorrow has been turned to gladness.<br><br>Speaking of singing, we'll find another statement where they shall come and sing in the heights of Zion. Where can you find anything in the history of the world to fulfill that prophecy like the singing of the Tabernacle Choir for over forty-five years without missing? And now through the telstar they are singing to the entire world.<br><br>Well, then the ransomed of the Lord shall return--that's the gathering to this latter-day Israel. Then Isaiah saw the gathering and how swiftly they'd be gathered. Remember that in his day their method of travel was with camels and donkeys and so forth; yet he saw the railroad train, the airplane. He couldn't name them in those terms but he described them in an unmistakable manner so that we could know he was speaking of the trains and the airplanes. He said this:<br><br><i>And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far</i>[this great institution is part of that ensign],<i>and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth</i>[via the great missionary force]:<i>and behold, they shall come with speed swiftly</i>[in his day they<i>couldn't</i>come swiftly]:<br><br><i>None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep</i>[he knew they wouldn't need to slumber or sleep by plane or train];<i>Neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken;</i><br><br><i>Whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint. . . .</i><br><br><i>Their</i>[the trains']<i>roaring shall be like a lion, they</i>[the planes]<i>shall roar like young lions; yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey</i>[their passengers],<i>and shall carry it away safe, and none shall deliver it.</i>[Isaiah 6:26­29]<br><br>That was a statement made way back in Isaiah's time, when they had no more means of travel than they had at that time.<br><br>A few years back President McKay went over to Wales for the dedication of the first chapel built in the city where his mother was raised and spent her youth. On his return, in reporting to us Brethren of the Twelve, he said that he had left London at two o'clock in the afternoon, spent a little time with the brethren in Chicago, and was in his own bed that night here in Salt Lake. Then he compared his trip to when his people came to Zion in the early days, when they were forty-three days on the water with a sail vessel and then weeks getting across the plains. See what's happened just in the period of our lifetime? No wonder Isaiah said that when these things should happen, it should be given to us to understand them. Well, so much for the airplanes.<br><br>Now, Isaiah saw the rivers in the desert, and I quote you this little statement:<br><br><i>I will open rivers in high places</i>[we've reservoired the water in these mountain vastnesses for summer's use],<i>and fountains</i>[these flowing wells]<i>in the midst of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.</i><br><br><i>I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree, and the pine, and the box tree together.</i>[Isaiah 41:18­19]<br><br>If you'd look through these valleys now where they're watered and think of what they were when the Saints first landed here in this wilderness, you'd see a miracle.<br><br>Isaiah also asked "that they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the Lord hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it" (Isaiah 41:20). No wonder President Brigham Young said that he didn't lead the people here; he said that the Lord led them here into this land. The Lord had it tucked away, as the Book of Mormon said, for the gathering of his people. No other people in this world has fulfilled the prophecies of Isaiah as have the Latter-day Saints. Then Isaiah saw this gathering and said, "And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, . . . and all nations shall flow unto it. And say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths" (Isaiah 2:2­3). I think that temple up in Salt Lake City is the very house of the God of Jacob that Isaiah was permitted to see.<br><br>He also saw the gathering from every land when we didn't have temples outside of Utah. When I filled my first mission in Holland, back in 1905­7, as soon as we'd bring new converts into the Church, the first thing they wanted to do was to come to Zion. I was the secretary of the mission, and on our mission books we had many accounts of our people, humble people there, saving their money by nickels and dimes till they could get enough to come to Zion. I had a very earnest investigator, a businessman, who said, "I'll never join your church."<br><br>I said, "Why?"<br><br>"I don't want to go to America."<br><br>I said, "Good for you. You just join the Church and stay right here and help strengthen these branches." He'd been a member only a few months when he came to me one day and said, "Brother Richards, I have a chance to sell my business."<br><br>"What do you want to sell your business for?"<br><br>"Oh, I want to go to Zion." And he came. They'd sell everything they had--their furniture and everything--and leave their loved ones and come to Zion. Isaiah saw all of this when he said that all nations should flow unto the mountain of the Lord.<br><h2><b>Jeremiah's Prophecies</b></h2><br>Jeremiah saw that gathering, too: "The days come . . . that it should no longer be said, the Lord liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt. But, the Lord liveth that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands whither he had driven them" (Jeremiah 16:14­15). Then he said that the Lord would call many fishers and many hunters, and they should fish them and hunt them from the hills and the mountains and the holes and the rocks (see Jeremiah 16:16). That's what these missionaries are going out to do and have been doing all over the world. And then Jeremiah said, "Turn, O backsliding children, . . . for I am married unto you [what a covenant!] and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion. And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and with understanding" (Jeremiah 3:14­15). If you'd like to listen to some of those pastors that Jeremiah referred to, just tune in or attend the general conference that starts next Friday and continues through Saturday and Sunday. There you'll find the leadership that God has ordained for the leading of his people. These holy prophets saw these things in days that were past.<br><br>I think I have time to give you one more prophecy on the gathering. This is from Jeremiah. He said, "For there shall be a day, that the watchman upon the mount Ephraim [not Judah, but Ephraim] shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the Lord our God" (Jeremiah 31:6). Now, I think that this prophet wrote the history of the Latter-day Saints almost three thousand years ago just as plainly as we've written it in our Church history today. Then he continues:<br><br><i>For thus saith the Lord, Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout among the chief of the nations</i>[what our missionaries have been doing]:<i>publish ye, praise ye, and say, O Lord, save thy people, the remnant of Israel</i>[not the Jews].<br><br><i>Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the coasts of the earth, and with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a great company shall return thither.</i>[Jeremiah 31:7­8]<br><br>Is there anything in the history of the world to fulfill that like the journeys of our people when they were driven out of Nauvoo?<br><br>Now this was said back in the Holy Land. Jeremiah didn't say they shall return<i>hither,</i>but they shall return<i>thither,</i>which means to a far-distant point. He saw that in holy vision; and prophecy, as Peter tells us, is the most sure word of the Lord. Then the record says they were to come in a great multitude; nearly twenty thousand of them were driven out of their homes and came here to these valleys of the mountains:<br><br><i>They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them</i>[because they were driven out of their homes, given only a few weeks in order to get out of the city of Nauvoo]<i>: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way</i>[they followed along the Platt River for some five hundred miles--nothing else like it in the history of the world]<i>, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.</i><br><br><i>Hear the words of the Lord, O ye nations, and declare it in the isles afar off, and say He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd doth his flock.</i><br><br><i>For the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he.</i><br><br><i>Therefore they</i>[the Tabernacle Choir]<i>shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of the Lord, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; And they shall not sorrow any more at all.</i>[Jeremiah 31:9­12]<br><br>I'm old enough to remember the fast meetings we used to hold after coming here to these valleys of the mountains when the Saints would stand up and thank God that they had been delivered from the hands of their enemies and they'd come here into this land of safety. Surely the Lord turned their sorrow into rejoicing.<br><br>"Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old together." We built our recreation halls when our people first arrived in Salt Lake Valley, before we built our chapels. Other churches criticize us for our dancing, but it was a marvelous thing. Jeremiah foresaw all of this, and he said, "For I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow. And I will satiate the soul of their priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the Lord" (Jeremiah 31:13­14). These men are not being paid to go on their missions, and yet you couldn't persuade them not to go when they're called. Their souls are satiated with fatness, as the Lord decreed.<br><br>Now that's only a part of the prophecies. No wonder Brother Kimball has asked us to study the scriptures and to read them. And so I leave you my love and blessing, and I leave you my witness that these things are true: that the prophets<i>did</i>see our day and time, that we're living as the prophets said we should in the day of their fulfillment, and it does us well if we understand and comprehend and walk in the ways of the holy prophets.<br><br>In closing, I leave you this one thought: When Brother Marion G. Romney was called to be one of the Assistants to the Twelve, President Grant said, "Marion, if you'll follow the President of this Church, you'll never go astray." If we'll walk in the way of the Lord and follow his holy prophets, as Peter said, we'll have a more sure word of prophecy. We'll never go astray. God bless each one of you to achieve the righteous desires of your hearts, and this great institution, and all who have anything to do with it, I humbly pray. I leave you my blessing, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>LeGrand Richards was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 28 September 1976.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<br>
Honored guests and my wonderful young friends, I'm delighted to have this opportunity this morning. Having spoken at your twelve-stake fireside recently, then being invited to the devotional, I feel like Ed Gardner. Ed Gardner had retired. He and his wife were home alone one night. All of the children were raised and married. They sat together, he reading the newspaper and she working on some knitting. It just happened that she was a little hard of hearing. He read the newspaper awhile, and then he put it down and watched her. He got a little melancholy as he thought about all the years they had had together. Then he said to her, "You know, I'm just kind of proud of you." She put her knitting down and said, "Well, I'm getting tired of you, too." Having been here twice in the last two and a half months, I can understand if that happens.<br><br>This morning I would like to read part of a letter received from a missionary. After a few introductory statements he said, "Let me tell you something neat. The last few months I've been searching for an answer as to what I really wanted, not only out of my mission but more out of life. I was really caught up one morning in Helaman, the third chapter, verses 27 through 31. There it was. 'Lay hold upon the word... and lead the man of Christ.' That was it--to be a man of Christ. There are so many men of one thing or another, but a man of Christ was a rare thing. I started looking for ways, patterns, etc. I went to the Beatitudes and remembered long back reading an article written by you on purity of heart. I found that article and literally sat and wept because there was the answer. As I read the article I saw the word<i>faith</i>keep coming up. I went to Moroni's discourse on faith in Ether." The missionary went on and told the different things that he tracked down that morning, trying to determine what a man of Christ should be.<br><br>I would like, for a few moments with you this morning, to suggest what I think the man of Christ is.<br><h2><b>Selfless Service</b></h2><br>I might begin by telling of the experience one man had. He came home from work one day, went to his wife, and said, "You know, I think a woman ought to serve her husband according to the order of the priesthood and the Church. If it's all right with you, when I come home at night, I'll just stand in the entry hall, and you'll come up and give me a hug and a kiss. Then you'll usher me into the living room and seat me in the big easy chair. Then you'll bring the stool over, take my shoes off, and put my slippers on. Then you'll bring the newspaper for me, and, to climax this great achievement, you'll bring in a nice, tall, cool lemonade."<br><br>She agreed, and so the next night he came home from work and stood in the hallway. Nothing happened. He went and sat down in the big easychair and had to get up to bring the stool over. He took his shoes off, put his slippers on, and then went and got the newspaper. Then he went into the kitchen to get a drink. When he was there, he said to his wife, "I thought you agreed with me that it would be appropriate for a wife to serve her husband like that."<br><br>She said, "Well, I think it's a good idea."<br><br>The next night again he stood in the hall, but nothing happened. Then he decided to change his strategy. He decided to love her into it. When Saturday came, she started getting cleaned up and ready to go to the store. So he started to change clothes. She said, "Where are you going?"<br><br>He said, "Well, I want to go to the store with you." When she got over the shock, they went to the store together. In the store she thought, "Well, he's going to check and see if I'm paying the right price for the groceries." But he was a perfect gentleman--up and down the aisles, never a complaint. They got to the check stand, and she thought, "Well, he'll blow his stack when he has to write out the check for the groceries." But no problem--again a perfect gentleman. They went home. He helped her in with the groceries. He helped her put them away. During the next six weeks he was absolutely the perfect husband. He helped her do the dishes, he helped her scrub the floor, he washed the windows, and he kept the lawn the way it ought to be and the garage. In the bedroom, he actually threw his underwear and stockings in the hamper--not<i>near</i>it, but actually<i>in</i>the hamper. He even squeezed the toothpaste at the<i>bottom</i>of the tube.<br><br>Finally it happened. Six weeks later, home from work, met in the hallway, a big hug and a squeeze, ushered into the living room, seated in the big easy chair, the stool brought over, shoes taken off, slippers put on, a newspaper brought in, and then finally, to climax this great achievement, a nice, tall, cool lemonade brought in. But instead of<i>him</i>in the chair it was<i>her.</i>The great thing about that is that's the way he wanted it.<br><br>You see, I believe the man of Christ is so involved in serving other people that he loses himself in that service. "As you sow, so shall you reap" (see Galatians 6:7). All these things will come back to you.<br><h2><b>David Against Goliath</b></h2><br>You recall the story of David, having been anointed king by Samuel; then he helped his father on the farm as a shepherd boy. His older brothers were, involved in the service of Saul. The armies of the Philistines gathered on one mountain, and the armies and the hosts of Israel gathered on the other mountain (see 1 Samuel 17). There was a champion, Goliath, who went out from the Philistines. He was six cubits tall. Now, as I understand it, a cubit is the distance from your elbow to the end of your forefinger. That would make him probably over eight feet tall. Anyway, Goliath had on heavy armor. He had a man to carry his shield. I should tell you about his spear. They didn't say it was some kind of rod with a heavy end. They described his spear as "like unto a weaver's beam." I imagine that this was some formidable kind of a weapon.<br><br>Goliath marched back and forth and called to the Israelites saying, "I am a Philistine. Send down one of your men, and I will fight him to the death. Should he win, then, we will be thy servants. Should I win, then you will be our servants, the servants of the Philistines."<br><br>For forty days and forty nights he walked up and down. I should stop here just long enough to tell you I can't imagine, if President Kimball had been up on the mountain on the side of the Israelites, even in his eighties, that he would have tolerated Goliath cursing the God of Israel and taunting the Israelites. I believe President Kimball would have gone down off the mountain to meet Goliath.<br><br>So would have Captain Moroni from the Book of Mormon. He would have<i>boomed</i>down off the mountain. You know what he would have said? "We will end the conflict." I believe he would have gone down to take care of Goliath.<br><br>David's father called him as he was taking care of the sheep and gave him an ephah of parched corn and ten loaves to take to his brethren. Then he gave him ten cheeses that might be delivered to the captain of the thousands of men. And so David went. When he arrived, David left the carriage with the cheeses and the loaves and the other goods. Then he went to see what was going on. As he stood there, the man Goliath came out. David heard Goliath's taunts and cursing. He saw that the Israelites fled, from Goliath, and they were afraid. He stood and listened, and the Israelite men told him the story. Then they said to him, "Whosoever would slay Goliath, in that same hour the king will enrich him, will make his father a free man, and will give unto him his daughter."<br><br>Then David said something very significant. "Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?" I guess others heard him and saw in David the courage that hadn't been found in others, and so they went and told King Saul. Saul called David to come forth, and David went to King Saul and offered to go down and fight Goliath. King Saul said, "Thou art but a youth. It would not be good to send thee against this man, for he is a man of war<i>since his youth.</i>"<br><br>Then David told of slaying the lion and the bear and said, "The Lord will deliver this man into my hands." He persuaded King Saul, and King Saul let him go forth. They put on David all of the armor of King Saul. (You can imagine it was probably the best armor that could be had, since the king would wear the best of everything.) But David decided not to go with this armor. Sometimes, when we see someone who is willing to do something, we impose upon him<i>our</i>ideas and standards. That handicaps him by imposing upon him the things which we think he ought to do--even when we finally find the one man who is courageous enough. David took off the armor and put his shepherd's bag over his shoulder. He took a staff, and then he went to the brook and selected five smooth stones. Then he started toward Goliath. The scripture says, "And when he drew nigh unto Goliath, Goliath came to him." Then when Goliath could see who this was (Goliath's shield bearer was out in front of him), he saw a mere shepherd boy with a staff and a shepherd's bag over his shoulder. Goliath, over eight feet tall, with all of his armor, said, "Am I a dog, that you would come before me with staves? Today, the birds will feed upon the flesh from thy bones, and the beasts will feed upon thy flesh."<br><br>David said, "You come to me with a shield, and with a sword, and with a spear, but I come to you in the name of the living God of the hosts of the armies of Israel. This day shall the God of Israel deliver thee into my hands, and I will remove thy head from thy body." I don't know that that scared Goliath much, but at least it was a threat. David also said, "And the beasts of the fields and the fowls of the air shall feed upon the bodies of all of the army of the Philistines." This, of course, must have provoked Goliath a little, and he increased his speed toward David. But the scripture says that "David<i>ran</i>to Goliath." He ran to Goliath, selected from his shepherd's bag one of the stones, and put it in his sling. The scripture says he slung it at Goliath. (Elder Sterling W. Sill has said that, when it struck Goliath, that was probably the first time such a thing had ever entered Goliath's head.) Then Goliath, as you recall, toppled to the earth. David ran and stood on him. Not having a sword, he removed Goliath's sword from the hilt and severed his head from his body. Then all of the hosts of the Philistines fled in fear and terror.<br><br>Now I want to make a point. The man of Christ, I believe, is anyone in our generation who<i>does</i>get involved. David was young; he wasn't a member of the army or a part of the army. He could easily have stood and watched this thing go on, listened maybe in a frightened way, taken the carriage, and gone back to his father and his sheep. But the man of Christ<i>does</i>get involved.<br><h2><b>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego</b></h2><br>You should also remember from the scripture that Nebuchadnezzar the king built a giant golden image and demanded that all of his officers and sheriffs and governors--all of the key people in that entire land--come and worship it. The image was threescore cubits high (something like eighty or ninety feet high) and six cubits across (about eight feet). All of the sheriffs and the governors and the princes and the rulers came forth to the dedication. Then a herald stood up and said to all of the hosts of those who were there--the leaders of all of the kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar: "At the time ye hear the cornet and the flute and the harp and the sackbut and the psaltery, dulcimer, and all the different musical instruments, then you will bow down and worship the golden image. And if not, in that same hour you shall be delivered unto the burning, fiery furnace" (see Daniel 3:5–6). That would be a pretty good incentive for most of us to kneel down and worship the golden image.<br><br>There were those who sounded the cornet and the harp and the sackbut and the psaltery and the dulcimer and the other musical instruments. Then all those who heard bowed down before and worshiped the golden image as per the king's instructions. There were certain men who went to Nebuchadnezzar afterwards, and they said, "O King Nebuchadnezzar, live forever." Then they told King Nebuchadnezzar that there were three Jews over the province of Babylon who would not bow down before the golden image. So Nebuchadnezzar, in his wrath and in the fury of his heart, ordered that these three men should be brought before him. When they were brought before him, he said, "It has been told to me that you would not bow down and worship the golden image." Apparently he was going to give them another chance, because he said, "Now when you hear the cornet and the flute and the sackbut and the psaltery and the harp and so forth, you will bow down and worship the golden image."<br><br>Here was the king with the scepter in his hand, the all-powerful ruler, and then beside him and around him were all of the leading citizens of the communities. The sheriffs and the officers and the governors and the princes and the presidents were all gathered together. I don't know that there has been an experience that would equate to the social pressure the three men must have felt at that minute. Nebuchadnezzar said, "If at that time ye bow down and worship the golden image, then well with you. But if not, then at that same hour shall ye be cast into the burning fiery furnace." Now mark the words: "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, We are not careful to answer thee in this matter. For if it so be, the God of heaven can deliver us from the burning, fiery furnace, and he will deliver us from the burning, fiery furnace. But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, we will not bow down and worship the golden image."<br><br>Again the wrathful king commanded that the furnace be heated "seven times more than it was wont to be heated." He had Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego bound, and then he had the mightiest men in his kingdom put on heavy coats and hats and "hosen" so that they might not be burned also as they delivered the three men into the burning, fiery furnace. So great was the heat of the furnace as they were cast into it that the mighty men were also burned by the fire and died. Then King Nebuchadnezzar stood back. Apparently he could see into the furnace, and he said, "Were there not three? Did we not cast in three into the fiery furnace? And behold, I see four, and one of them has a countenance like unto the Son of God." Then he commanded Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to come out of the burning, fiery furnace. When they came out, not a hair of their heads had even been singed, nor had their clothing the slightest smell of smoke. So King Nebuchadnezzar declared that their God, the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, was the only true and living God. Watch the giant change in King Nebuchadnezzar: "And all those who will not bow down and worship the true and living god of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego shall be cut in pieces and their houses shall be burned on a dunghill."<br><br>Here were three men, minding their own business, carrying on the affairs they had jurisdiction to do under King Nebuchadnezzar in a way that was right. This incident was imposed upon them, and I suppose, if they could have avoided it, they would have done that, but they did not. They were not like David, who ran to meet Goliath. The situation was imposed upon them, and yet they had their integrity and maintained it. They would not compromise that integrity, even for their own lives.<br><br>I believe the man of Christ does not compromise his integrity no matter what the cost is. As you know, in life there are many things we can have if we will pay the price of compromise. We can have things of a lesser value than those which we really<i>would</i>have if we followed the Lord's commandments. Someone once said you should never want anything so badly that the man who has power to give it to you could take from you the thing which you must not lose. What you must not lose is your own free agency, your own pride, and your integrity.<br><h2><b>Daniel and Belshazzar's Dream</b></h2><br>Nebuchadnezzar had a son who was Belshazzar the king. Belshazzar the king had a feast one night and invited a thousand of his governors and sheriffs and rulers and princes and their concubines and wives (see Daniel 5). They had a giant feast, including wine that they celebrated with. Then King Belshazzar caused that the servants should bring the golden vessels that had been plundered from the temple in Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar the king. They were filled with wine, and the concubines and wives and the sheriffs and rulers drank from these golden vessels. Then they worshiped the gods of gold and brass and silver and wood and ivory and so forth. While they were worshiping, the finger of a man's hand appeared near the candlestick and wrote on the plaster of the wall. The scripture suggests that Belshazzar the king feared greatly: the visage of his countenance changed, and his knees smote one against the other. Then the hand disappeared. The writing remained, and so he called the soothsayers and the priests and the astrologers to decipher or interpret these writings. They all came, but none could decipher or translate. Finally the queen came in, and she recalled that there was one Daniel who could interpret dreams. So Daniel was brought forth. The king said, "To whomsoever or, if you, Daniel, can interpret these things, a gold chain shall be placed about your neck, and you shall be third in command of the kingdom, and you'll be dressed in scarlet robes."<br><br>Daniel said, "Keep thy gifts unto thyself. I will interpret the dream." Then he rehearsed with Belshazzar some of the things that had been wrong during his kingship. Finally he said, "The words<i>Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin--</i>this is the interpretation:<i>Mene</i>--the Lord hath numbered the days of thy kingdom and it is finished;<i>Tekel--</i>thou hast been weighed in the balance and hast been found wanting;<i>Peres--</i>the Persians and Medes shall this day overthrow the kingdom" (see Daniel 5:26–28). That night Belshazzar the king was slain, Darius the Mede came and took over the kingdom, and the kingdom, was lost.<br><br>Daniel had an excellent spirit, as the scripture describes him. He was one of three presidents who were over 120 princes. The 120 princes resented Daniel having this high place, and so they decided to have him removed. They sought to find, fault or occasion against Daniel, but they could not find anything against him. And so they decided to find fault and occasion against the God of Daniel. You cannot find fault or occasion against the man of Christ, who has an excellent spirit, as did Daniel. Those things are simply not part of the lives of such men.<br><h2><b>A Modern Man of Christ</b></h2><br>As I have thought about the man of Christ, I have also thought about many other things. You may recall a Dr. Kenneth McFarland. I guess he is one of the internationally renowned speakers of all time, a great super-patriot, and a wonderful individual. He told two incidents that I would like to share with you this morning.<br><br>One occurred on a farm somewhere in the central part of Kansas. The people there had what they called Pole Pond. Pole Pond was a large pond, and it was fairly deep. They put a pole out to mark the drop-off so that the children in the community who couldn't swim very well wouldn't go out over their heads. As the children were swimming one day, one of the boys got a little too far out, went around the pole, and all of a sudden had stepped off of the drop-off point. He was in water over his head. A farmer walking nearby heard the rest of the boys yelling for help. He ran as quickly as he could and saw the boy drowning. Although unable to swim, he went out into the water and with his mighty arm threw the boy back into shallow water. He himself, in water over his head, drowned. During the next week, the boys and the youth in the community talked about nothing else except this brave man who had gladly given his life in an instant. I believe the man of Christ would do just exactly that.<br><br>This same Dr. McFarland was once invited to speak at the graduation exercises in Coffeeville, Kansas. As he was preparing to give the talk, he was meeting with Dean Blakesmire. They talked about the arrangements for the next day, and Nancy Hollingsworth came in. She went over to the desk, ordered her regalia, and then said, "One seat in the parents' section, please." Dr. McFarland said he remembered well that she asked for only one seat. Soon she left, and Dean Blakesmire and Dr. McFarland talked for a few minutes more and went out in the hall where Nancy was waiting. She said, "Dr. McFarland, I've got a special favor to ask of you. Would you mind doing something for me?"<br><br>"Well, if I possibly can. That's what it's all about is to help people. I'll do it if I can."<br><br>She said, "Can I share a story with you?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>She said, "Many years ago, just after I was born, my father, who worked on the railroad, somehow slipped under a train and was killed. And so my mother started raising the three children--Richard, my brother Tommy, and me. She did that all through the years. She'd go to work in an apparel shop and then she'd come home in the evening and stay with us. We just loved her. We didn't have one other living relative except my mother's brother, Uncle Ben, and he was a drunken ne'er-do-well. It seemed Mother didn't care to have Uncle Ben come to our home, but we kids just loved him because whenever he'd come he'd always have time to play with us. He'd work just long enough to get a little money, and then he'd spend it on booze. But we loved him and we thought he was all right. During all those years mother tried to compensate for not having a father in our home. She would take us upstairs and tuck each one. of us in our beds, and then she'd sit and tell us stories. One night when I was about six, she tucked Richard in bed and kissed him, and then she tucked Tommy in bed and kissed him, and then she came over and sat on my bed and tucked me in. She told us some stories, and we laughed so hard that night I got a pain in my stomach. My mother had to rub it out with her hand. Then she kissed me and left. Well, during that night, Dr. McFarland, our mother passed away. The angels came and got her for some reason, and the next morning we three children got up and went into mother's room. We found her dead. We didn't know what to do, and so we ran down to Uncle Ben's house and told Uncle Ben, 'Our mother has passed away. We don't know what to do. What are we going to do now?' He said, 'I don't know, kids, but it'll never be as good as you had. You'll never have anyone who'll love you like your mother loved you. But after the funeral arrangements, I'll go to see the judge and see if he will let me take care of you.' When the funeral ended, he went down to see the judge and got custody of us. During those years, Dr. McFarland, I can't tell you what a job he has done. It's been over twenty years now. He has never missed a day's work, and he has never even been sick--not once in all of those twenty years. He has not had a drink in all of those twenty years. And we've never heard one complaint. You know, Dr. McFarland, they always ask all the parents of the graduating students to please stand. My Uncle Ben won't even sit in the parents' section. He doesn't feel he's worthy to do that. He thinks that's a place where only our mother ought to sit, and he doesn't feel he could take her place. Would you mind asking my Uncle Ben to stand with the parents tomorrow night at the graduationexercise?"<br><br>He said, "Well, Nancy, I'd love to do that."<br><br>The next night at graduation, it was a beautiful, cool evening. They had the exercises out in the stadium. Dr. McFarland said, "Everyone was there well ahead of time. The graduating students came in and took their places. Behind the students was the parents' section, and then behind that was the relatives and friends' section." He looked down and saw Nancy Hollingsworth on the front row. They went through the commencement exercise, had the opening hymn, the invocation, and then several talks. Finally they got around to Dr. McFarland. He stood up, and, as was customary, he had all the parents stand up.<br><br>Then they sat down, and he honored them. Then he looked down on the front row and saw Nancy Hollingsworth. Her chin was just about on the floor. She thought that he'd forgotten Uncle Ben. But Dr. McFarland said, "Now, I'd like to have all those Uncle Bens who have graduates in this class, please stand." It was very quiet. Everyone looked around, and there was just a murmur that went throughout the entire congregation of people. Nothing happened, so he said, "I'm not going to go on with my talk until the Uncle Ben who has a graduate in this class stands." Way back behind the students, the graduates, the parents, way back in the friends and relatives' section, a very tall, lean man slowly made his way to his feet. As he stood up, it looked as if everything in him were pulling him down, but he was being forced to stand. An ovation started across one part of the stadium and roared through to the other end. It lasted for several minutes as he stood there with his head bowed, somewhat embarrassed at this great thing that was taking place in his life. Finally it finished, and he sat down. Then Dr. McFarland went on with the talk.<br><br>After the main talk at the commencement exercise, each graduate received his or her diploma. "Pomp and Circumstance" was played as the graduates filed out. Then Dr. McFarland said, "Quite a number of people came up on the stand to shake hands with me. All of a sudden, Nancy Hollingsworth was there. I took hold of her hand, and she said, 'Would you please come with me? I want you to meet my Uncle Ben.'" He excused himself from the others and went down off of the stand. Halfway down the aisle, here was Uncle Ben coming up. Nancy introduced him to Uncle Ben, and he shook hands with him and said, "Now, Uncle Ben, I want to have you tell me what it was like. Just answer a couple of questions. First, what was it like when all these people were applauding you for what you had done through all those years?"<br><br>He said, "Oh, I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was asleep. I thought, 'If I'm asleep and dreaming and it's Nancy's commencement exercise night, then I've missed it.'"<br><br>Then Dr. McFarland said, "Well, now the second question: How were you ever able to talk the judge into letting you take the children? As I understand it, you didn't have much of a reputation."<br><br>He said, "Well, after the funeral, we went down to see the judge, and I said to him, 'Judge, if you'll let me take these children, I promise you I'll never have another drink as long as I live. Then I'll get down on my knees every single day of my life and I'll ask God to give me the gumption to keep that promise. Will you please let me take them?' The judge took his glasses off, looked out the window for a long moment, and then he put them back on. He said, 'Ben, I'll go with that. We'll put you on probation for about six weeks. If you can keep that promise, then we'll make the children yours permanently.' We went home after that. We got inside of the house and talked for a minute. Then the three children and I knelt down together. We prayed to the God of heaven to give me the gumption to live the way that I had promised the judge I would. And the five of us--God and the three children and me--have been going along ever since."<br><br>I believe the man of Christ would be that kind of individual. When it was required that his life would change and conform to correct principles, he would do it. There are many other things we could talk about. I believe the man of Christ would have an unparalleled commitment to serve his fellowmen. I think he would have total faith. I believe he would have a pure heart and soul. I believe he would have a reverence for the Savior if he were truly a man of Christ.<br><br>I'd like to share with you my testimony about one particular man of Christ, President Spencer W. Kimball. I know of no one on the face of the earth who comes nearer to measuring to the total stature of the man of Christ than Spencer W. Kimball. I have an absolute witness and assurance that President Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet of God, and I know that he is only a whisper away from the Savior, Jesus Christ, whose church this is.<br><br>May we each, whether young man or young woman, become a "man of Christ," in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Vaughn J.

<h1> from My Life - Neal A. Maxwell - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
President Oaks, brothers and sisters, it's good to be home. I wasn't sure I qualified for continuing membership in this intellectual community after I read a definition the other day of an intellectual as "any individual who can hear the<i>William Tell</i>Overture and not think of the Lone Ranger." I don't pass that test, but I'm glad to be home.<br><br>Mention was made by President Oaks in his generous introduction of my duties in connection with priesthood correlation. Correlation is a concept I'm often asked to define. I sometimes respond by citing a story that is told about the Church when a federal army was sent out here to harass the Saints. The Brethren had decided on a policy of irritation without violence. In keeping with that policy Porter Rockwell and Lot Smith were dispatched to a distant army camp where Lot Smith was to secretly and quietly remove the pins from the army's wagon wheels while Porter Rockwell was to drive off all the army's horses. In the dark of night, Lot was busily taking out wagon wheel pins, and Porter war-whooped into the camp and drove off all the horses, including Lot Smith's. Lot later walked wearily many miles back to Church headquarters and reportedly said, "Brethren, we've just got to get correlated." Today's correlation challenges are different, but the basic need remains.<br><br>As I pondered possible topics, some members of my family urged me to use some relevant autobiographical themes. They have had to endure my tales of trudging through snow to school--snow which grew deeper with each parental retelling. They probably saw no reason why you should escape the same punishment. Beware today, therefore, those vertical pronouns and the selectivity of my memory. At other times I have spoken in praise of parents and prophets who have helped me so much, as well as about my renewing and loving wife and family.<br><br>Today's episodes involve other people, most of them not known to you. The episodes may seem small, but the lessons were large. We speak and sing in the Church of counting our blessings, and that's a good thing. So is inventorying our insights. My format today will make use of some of the sample experiences I've had, with their resultant or related insights, as a part of my inventory. As you indulge me, remember that there are wheat and chaff in every life. A wise lady once said that what we hope our friends will do is to separate the wheat from the chaff and, with a breath of kindness, blow the chaff away. I am grateful now, as I have been over the years, for friends who have had strong lungs.<br><h2><b>Regrets and Aspirations</b></h2><br>My mid-teen years were years when there was a confluence of conditions that tried and vexed me. Those are years when peer approval weighs so heavily, as you know. I found myself contending with shortness of stature, shyness, outdoor plumbing, and a 4-H pig project--each of which had by then become an embarrassment. The periodic pain, can be smiled at now, but it was real enough then. Programmed by doting uncles and by myself in early childhood to love basketball and to aspire to become all-state, I had, until this period in my life, been more adept at basketball than most of my peers. Soon, however, I started not making the first string, and then the second. It was a bitter pill. This failure for the first time to achieve athletically--cruelly combined with other indications that I was, for the first time, outside that hard-to-define but very real inner ring--was a time of long thoughts. Somehow, being at home feeding the pigs was not like working out with the varsity--especially when the boy down the block, whom I had helped some learn to play basketball, was where I wanted to be. He went on to be all-state player, which he deserved.<br><br>During this period I noticed that recycling regrets didn't change reality. Pawing through the past is not productive. This period was a time when my aspirations got diverted to the world of words, where there were teachers who would not let me pass without genuine achievement. I honor and sustain them evermore. Thus an insight dawned, although not all at once, showing me that too much attention to what might have been actually gets in the way of what still can be. Those valleys you and I are sometimes in are really the sloping sides of hills to be climbed, with as little muttering as possible.<br><h2><b>Divine Blessings and Human Potential</b></h2><br>In the spring of 1945 I was on Okinawa as a frightened and barely adequate infantry replacement--concerned with victory, to be sure, but very much concerned with selfish survival. Japanese artillery pieces had tried for several days without success to hit the little plateau on which our mortar squad was located. Then one evening they dropped three shells around us. They had finally found the range, and we knew it. Surely they knew it. Since one of those shells fell just several feet from my foxhole, I was stimulated, as you might imagine, to intense prayer, full of promises. Strangely, no more shells fell near us that evening, the very time when more shells should have been fired for effect. Foxhole faith brought some real blessings that evening, causing me to make some covenants which I am still striving to keep. I have often wondered--if the Lord that night not only blessed me and others as he did, so clearly and mercifully, but had also told me to be of good cheer, for not only would I live, but one day, just a few ridges away, I would preach the gospel of Jesus Christ to an LDS chapel full of members--could I have managed that insight. Probably not; yet that is precisely what happened in 1973, twenty-eight years later, as I was privileged to go back to that island and that spot which, for me, is a sacred spot.<br><br>Sugar cane has since covered the little plateau, but not my poignant memories of Okinawa, the bloodiest battle in the Pacific. Two insights emerged. First, it is naive to think we can repay God for his blessings. I am more and more in debt to him now than I ever was in 1945, and I will be forever. God blesses according to law, but out of all proportion to the ratios we mortals reckon by. Second, along with believing in the gospel, we need to believe in our own possibilities--not as to status, but as to power to do good. God could surprise--yes, even stun--each of us here today if we could manage such divine disclosures. Such must usually be kept from us (or can only be hinted at) for now. But specific and special opportunities are pending for every person here today, if we can trust God and do each day's duties and bear our present pain. We can't walk a straight and narrow path in the dark; hence, God gives to us the gospel, by which we get<i>direction, motivation,</i>and<i>illumination.</i>But there appears to be no point, I learned, in God's constantly illuminating the trail beyond where my eyes of faith can now see.<br><h2><b>Praise and Criticism</b></h2><br>Several times in early manhood, friends (who probably did not know then that what they said had such an impact) gave me rather specific and encouraging words, prospective praise. I can remember their specific words today. (Incidentally, I have since told some of those friends who are still living how helpful they were.) You and I listen so well when we are ready to hear. These friends, like good outside auditors, confirmed my net worth and also pointed to possibilities for service in ways that were both timely and tender. Sometimes, in the mutual climb along the straight and narrow path, brothers and sisters, we need friends to shout warnings to us or to give us instructions, but we also need those moments when warm whispers can help us to keep putting one foot in front of the other. Good friends can give us the gifts of approval and acceptance and of perspective. How many of us have rendered that specific service for someone this month? How long has it been since you have been the recipient of such a gift? Perhaps too long in both instances. "Deserved specific praise" is the ingredient of fellowship, of commending Christians.<br><br>Several times in our early marriage I was thrust in a close church or professional association with those of whom I had, for one reason or another, been critical. In one case, less than worthy words had fallen from my lips only a day or two before a call came to work with that individual, a development which turned out to be a rich and happy experience. In such circumstances, one winces for his words, and pride goes first; then comes reluctant reclassification, and finally genuine appreciation. It has happened to me several times in life. It has helped to teach me a recurring lesson: God gives to us the lessons we need most, not the ones we think we need. Also, often that which we resist learning vicariously we must learn the hard way--experientially. There is a learning efficiency that comes with being humble<i>per se</i>, because of the word, instead of being compelled to be humble and to be open. I was so grateful I was not too proud in such associations, which will, I trust, be eternal. The Christian receives a customized curriculum in life, which is but one of many signs that we have a loving<i>and knowing</i>Father in heaven.<br><h2><b>Uses and Dangers of Silence</b></h2><br>There have been insights for me, too, about the role of silence, its usefulness and its dangers. A few dealings with student dissenters taught me (too late to help them, I'm sorry to say) that my silent disgust did not necessarily teach them. It often created distance. Unexplained indignation is not always communication. True, silence in some circumstances is a powerful reprover, but not in other situations. To withhold deserved reproof, and the reasons therefore, may be to withhold a warning that is urgently needed. Reproof is often a last railing before an erring individual goes over the edge of the cliff.<br><br>I've learned, too, that silence can also be productive, even though it makes us very anxious. A fine colleague and friend called my office shortly after I had been sustained as a General Authority to ask for an appointment. I was out, but happily my secretary scheduled an appointment, and it was for more than a mere ten minutes. The friend came. I greeted him warmly, but, contrary to my usual style, I stayed mostly silent. His eyes brimmed with tears as finally he said that, as he had listened to conference, he knew he needed to come and set things right. I resisted the impulse to intervene reassuringly, since I knew of nothing that was wrong. He then continued, saying that he was becoming active in the Church again and knew he needed to repair certain relationships. Happily, again I resisted stemming his flow of feeling. With courage and tenderness, he indicated that at times he had said things about me that were untrue and unkind. He wanted to seek my forgiveness. Only then did I respond by telling him of my regard for him and my unawareness of and unconcern over what he had reportedly said. Most importantly, I told him of my love and admiration and forgiveness. We embraced. I expressed then my admiration also for his courage and for his manhood. He then said how difficult it had been to come that day and how he had almost called to cancel the appointment. We spoke together of the wisdom contained in Matthew 18:15 and Jesus' counsel therein as to what we should do when there are impasses in human relationships: "Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother." I love that man and respect him for taking the initiative, since I had been unaware of the matter. He is fully and effectively active in the kingdom today. He needed to say what he said more than I needed to hear it, but I am so grateful I did not rush in to fill the silence that morning in the lesson he taught me so well.<br><br>Spiritual silence is a school. We may think we are sitting in that school only waiting, but really we are witnessing those marvelous moments of creative communication and of new commitment.<br><h2><b>Conversation and Sensational Journalism</b></h2><br>Ten years of interviewing on a television program on KUED increased my respect and appreciation for the lives of individuals whom I got to know a little bit more about, other than in their formal roles of U.S. senators, presidential candidates, U.S. Supreme Court justices, or prophets. The small talk of great men and women is worthwhile. We discover so many wonders when walking carefully through another's garden, not by crashing into it with a Mack truck. Tenderness is usually better than trapping, so far as learning about another is concerned. These insights have given me pause when I see so much of modern journalism searching for sensation--a search which can be addictive to journalists as well as to audiences.<br><br>Conversation is a dying art that may go underground--not because it is afraid of light, but because, in certain conversations, confidentiality and mutuality go in tandem. What I call "drop the hanky" reporters, who are still a minority, are too often in the service of accusatory patriotism, which can condition citizens to become eager to believe the worst, whereas "pure charity is never glad," Paul wrote, "when others go wrong" (1 Corinthians, chapter 13, Moffatt translation).<br><br>About twenty-two years ago, the late Senator Joseph McCarthy was finally condemned by his colleagues. I was involved in a peripheral way in that episode. I remember, after the votes were taken, that McCarthy went off the Senate floor into a small room with three or four reporters. I went in to watch the final scene. The reporters, who had over the months disagreed with him, in some ways still liked him. In their final exchanges in that room I saw how symbiotic sensationalism can be. McCarthy had been good copy, and now it was over. Some commentators concluded that erring politicians get their just due, that "time wounds all heels." But I saw, too, the realities that crucial causes often fall into the hands of those least able to champion them effectively and also that the media use people--sometimes cruelly.<br><h2><b>Workhorses and Show Horses</b></h2><br>While recognition is a basic human need and is important in the public service, there are those who do too many things to be seen of men. I had the privilege of seeing this on a grand scale in the U.S. Senate, where there is normally an imbalance between the show horses and the work horses. I can vividly remember standing next to Lyndon Johnson, then majority leader, one day in a Senate chamber anteroom as we both read the ticker tape with a news story about a major bill coming out of a Senate committee after months of labor. One senator, who had not been attending the sessions while the hearings were being held and the tedious testimony was being taken, had managed, nevertheless, to show up the very day the bill was reported out of committee to take his bows before waiting TV cameras. He was one of those senators who would show up for the opening of an envelope. The man at my side, later to become president, profaned in his disgust for the show horse senator, declaring that the show horse senator was also a lazy liberal who let other liberals do the work while he took the bows.<br><br>So often in human affairs I have learned the many depend upon the few to lead, to set the pace, to show the way, to deal with the detail. It was so, even in the inspired sessions of the Constitutional Convention of 1787. I'm grateful to have received, in diverse ways, that insight while yet in my twenties.<br><br>Some modest adventures of various kinds into the world of public service have helped me to see, too, that the shaping of choices in the political process is at least as important as choosing among the choices. In electoral ecology, there is a greater impact and influence at the front end of the process than in the voting booth, as sacred and special as the latter is. The voting booth is very democratic, but the shaping of the alternatives is aristocratic; it is work that is done by a few. I've been struck over and over again in my experiences with government and politics, modest as they are, by the Lord's counsel that honest, wise, and good individuals "should be sought for diligently" and that such individuals we should "observe to uphold" (see D&amp;amp;C 98:10). Ponder those words. Seeking out special individuals implies that the special individuals needed may not be those who are first in line as eager volunteers. Along with the search for good candidates is the requirement that we thereafter uphold such while in office. Too many prospective candidates are rightly wary of being abandoned by friends after they have filed or after being elected. It is all so much more than going into the little voting booth and being sixty-second citizens. Lazy citizens who then complain about the choices confronting them are like those who ask not to be disturbed until time for dinner and then sit down to a spare meal and complain about the menu--when they have consistently refused to plant, cultivate, and harvest the garden from which the meal comes.<br><h2><b>Family and Government</b></h2><br>Public service has also helped me to appreciate my many non-LDS friends, whom I have found, on the whole, to be caring and thoughtful individuals. They are able to understand when we must differ without jeopardizing what we have in common, which is so very much. My non-member friends have so often met me more than halfway in our common causes.<br><br>I do believe the gospel gives us some insights which are not easy to transmit, such as how vitally appropriate early life experiences are and their impact on society's institutions later on. We know that it is the family wherein all those virtues on which society depends are first and best developed: for instance, self-restraint, the commitment to work, doing one's share, compassion for others. Like it or not, society and the state will mirror our homes. Adolf Hitler's early life experiences may have impacted more on Germany than the Weimar Republic's constitution.<br><br>In any event, possessed of such insights, we Latter-day Saints are often responded to a little like John the Baptist. Minus such fundamental insights, I fear that, as conditions worsen, many will react to the failures of too much government by calling for even more government. Then there will be more and more lifeboats launched because fewer and fewer citizens know how to swim. Unlike some pendulums, political pendulums do not swing back automatically; they must be pushed. History is full of instances when people have waited in vain for pendulums to swing back.<br><br>A little experience with federal and state bureaucracies has taught me that such bureaucracies are inhabited by basically good civil servants, onto whom voters have pushed too much power for their good or ours. What we unwittingly court in such circumstances is learning again, painfully, that "almost all" men can't handle authority without abusing it. Whether or not the American people, regardless of party, can tame their governments is yet to be determined, but sunset laws alone will not do it. If citizen appetites, once aroused, merely look to a new agency to do what a disestablished agency once did, it won't be enough. Addicts can always find new pushers.<br><br>In one of those illuminating but sad stories that would be funny if it had not involved something terribly important, Peter Druecker tells us that the czar of Russia in 1914 had ordered a general mobilization to fight the Germans, but then he had second thoughts about it. The czar called in his chief of staff and asked him to halt the mobilization. The general answered, "Your Majesty, this is impossible. There is no plan for calling off the mobilization once it is started." Perhaps World War I might not have been any different regardless of what the Russians did, but the sweeping events flowing out of the collapse on the Russian front, paving the way for the rise of Bolshevism, deserve to be pondered in the context of that stupid, bureaucratic rigidity. I remember all too well a brief experience in one federal department when it reached a point in our little shop that the methodology of filing came out by directive and assumed a preeminence over our primary task. This trend was symbolically accompanied by the domesticating appearance of sweet potato foliage on the desk (which was accompanied by my disappearance from that department in search of better tasks).<br><h2><b>The Church and Personal Righteousness</b></h2><br>Yet we need some institutionalization, even in the kingdom. Random goodness is, by itself, not enough to resist the march of evil, which takes its victims without pity or remorse. How many of the tens of thousands who went to help victims of the flood would have made their way individually to southeastern Idaho to help without the Church's organization of that concern? I am grateful that God has so organized us and that he has given us specific things to do. Otherwise, we would be like the lonely sharp-shooters trying to slow the advancing army of evil. Sharp-shooters can delay the enemy heroically, but such solitary souls are not the way in which counterattacks are mounted. Counterattacks must be expressed institutionally, as in the case of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Concerning this need, the Lord has given us an immense clue in an analogy when he said, "But first let my army become very great, and let it be sanctified before me . . . That the kingdoms of this world may be constrained to acknowledge that the kingdom of Zion is in very deed the kingdom of our God and his Christ" (D&amp;amp;C 105:31, 32). Such remarkable recognition, brothers and sisters, will come in a time of stunning contrasts. It was President Brigham Young who said that it was revealed to him in the commencement of this Church that, as it grew and extended into the nations of the world, so also would the power of the adversary rise--cheek by jowl, wheat by tares.<br><br>To wonder if our faith is strong enough for such remarkable developments is natural. The father of Elder Bruce R. McConkie, President Oscar W. McConkie, Sr., in a situation of stress years ago prayed for adequacy. He prayed that he would be able to carry out his heavy assignment and that he could be given the faith of Enoch. The answer to his prayer was Enoch's faith came through personal righteousness. There is a great lesson, brothers and sisters, in that response, which is consistent, of course, with the words in section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants, in which we are reminded that we cannot control the powers of heaven<i>except</i>upon the principles of righteousness. If you and I want to be more effective, we must be more righteous. If we want to have more faith, we must be more righteous, and we might just as well face that reality.<br><br>In a time when increasing numbers of our fellowmen are wrongly concluding, but nevertheless concluding, that man is alone in the universe, there is a cosmic chill settling in, an astral aloneness that seems to be about and in the hearts of so many, for which the truths of the gospel are the only real remedy. The hungry of the world are reaching out for these truths, even when you and I present them fumblingly and live them less than perfectly.<br><h2><b>Freedom and Violence</b></h2><br>In addition to this yearning for identity and belonging, we see about us also a yearning for freedom taking its familiar forms--political and economic. But we also see more and more individuals who sense that the freedom they desire involves more than a new constitutional caress. Thoughtful souls see that something even deeper is involved. So many have erred, thinking that freedom, included both freedom to obey or not to obey eternal laws and, wrongly, that it included freedom to change those laws. Not so. Ultimately, freedom involves choice between eternal alternatives,<i>but not the altering of the alternatives.</i>We can choose wickedness or happiness, but not wickedness with happiness. A confused Cain, a vain Cain, not only murdered his brother while they conversed together in the field, but also gloried in the murder of Abel, when Cain said (probably shouted), "I am free."<br><br>So often violence creates the<i>illusion</i>of freedom or possession. So often sin creates a momentary illusion which those involved are taken in by. I've never been able to erase from my mind the boasting words of army buddies following their night of adultery, which I heard while trying to go back to sleep on an army cot no farther away from here than Camp Williams. I saw the shame of several of those same men in the days and weeks that followed. It seemed to me then, as it does now, that the raucousness and the shouting of sin, the Cain-like glorying in it, is also the sound of pain trying to erase itself.<br><br>I have found, too, that it is better to trust and sometimes be disappointed than to be forever mistrusting and be right occasionally. This is to endorse empathy, not naivete. Neither is this to suggest that our fellowship be flaccid. The finest of friends must sometimes be stern sentinels, who will insist that we become what we have the power to become. The "no" of such stern sentinels is more to be prized than a "yes" of others. God's seeming sternness is actually a sweetness beyond our comprehension.<br><br>Petitioning in prayer has taught me that the vault of heaven, with all its blessings, is to be opened only by a combination lock: one tumbler falls when there is faith, a second when there is personal righteousness, and the third, and final tumbler falls only when what is sought is (in God's judgment, not ours) "right" for us. Sometimes we pound on the vault door for something we want very much, in faith, in reasonable righteousness, and wonder why the door does not open. We would be very spoiled children if that vault door opened any more easily than it does now. I can tell, looking back, that God truly loves me by the petitions that, in his perfect wisdom and love, he has refused to grant me. Our rejected petitions tell us not only much about ourselves, but also much about our flawless Father.<br><br>You have been patient with my reminiscences and with this very partial inventory. May I suggest you try not only counting your blessings, but also inventorying your insights from time to time. It "will surprise you what the Lord has done" in teaching you things you so much need to know. Nourish your spirits, brothers and sisters. Your spirit can drive your body and your mind beyond the borders now known to you. I vividly remember first reading the lines that went as follows: "Over a hundred years ago a sailor walked down the streets of Portsmouth, with one arm and one eye and a persistent state of nerves, and unable to tread a ship's deck without being seasick." Indeed, this man would have probably given up except his name was Admiral Lord Nelson.<br><br>Now, brothers and sisters, the spirit not only can drive the body beyond where the body first agrees to go; the spirit can enlarge our minds beyond borders we think are fixed, which are not really fixed, but which are movable.<br><br>May God bless us to cherish the insights he has given us and to live in such a way that new insights can flow to us. As we count our blessings, let us inventory our insights also, and, in appropriate ways, share with others where they may be helpful. I witness to you, as I have so many times before and which I always do gladly, that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is<i>the</i>Church of Jesus Christ. It is a living Church, not a dying Church. It is built upon, not partial truths, but the wholeness of truth as God has given it to us. May He help us, individually, to rise to that discipleship which is so needed. The time will come in the lifetime of many here when the people of the world will acknowledge that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is, in fact, the kingdom of our God and His Christ--just what we have said all along it is. What high promises, what soul-stretching experiences await us! May we so live in order that we will not only witness these events, but also accelerate their completion and fulfillment, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Neal A.

<h1>of Consecration - Victor L. Brown - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
This is a wonderful sight to see so many of you here. I was thrilled with this musical rendition of our Lamanite brothers and sisters and am grateful to them.<br><br>I appreciate the opportunity this evening of spending a few minutes with you at this fireside. I pray that the Spirit of the Lord will be with us, as I have chosen a subject about which little is said and too little is known. I refer to the law of consecration, which is lived through the united order. In 1874, a year before this University was founded, President Brigham Young, who was spending the winter in St. George, organized the Saints there into a cooperative economic and spiritual union. His intent, evidently, was to help the people there do a better job of caring for the poor and to reverse a growing tendency toward worldliness. This movement or organization was legally incorporated and was called the United Order of Zion. The following rules of conduct were drawn up for those who entered the order:<br><br><i>We will not take the name of Deity in vain, nor speak lightly of his character, or of sacred things. We will pray with our families morning and evening and also attend to secret prayer. We will observe and keep the Word of Wisdom, according to the spirit and the meaning thereof. We will treat our families with due kindness and affection, and set before them an example worthy of imitation. In our families and intercourse with all persons, we will refrain from being contentious or quarrelsome, and we will cease to speak evil of each other, and will cultivate a spirit of charity towards all. We consider it our duty to keep from acting selfishly or from covetous motives, and will seek the interest of each other and the salvation of all mankind. We will observe the Sabbath day to keep it holy, in accordance with the revelations. ... In our apparel and deportment we will not pattern after nor encourage foolish and extravagant fashions. ... We will be simple in our dress and manner of living, using proper economy and prudence in the management of all intrusted to our care. ... We will honestly and diligently labor and devote ourselves and all we have to the "order" and to the building of the kingdom of God.</i>[<i>Comprehensive History of the Church,</i>4:485–86 ]<br><br>As President Young returned to Salt lake City in the spring of 1875, he stopped in many of the settlements of southern and central Utah, encouraging them to establish united orders. Others of the Brethren visited settlements of northern Utah to encourage similar action.<br><h2><b>United Orders in Orderville and Brigham City</b></h2><br>Perhaps two of the better-known examples of these orders as practiced by the Saints in Utah in the 1870s and 1880s were located in Orderville and Brigham City. The Orderville united order began in 1875. The settlers deeded all their property to the community corporation, including<br><br><i>several hundred acres of land, houses, cattle, horses and mules, sheep, hogs, chickens, agricultural machinery and equipment, sawmills, and a large variety of provisions and supplies. ... The order operated a number of farms, gardens, and orchards, including a cotton farm, a poultry project, three dairies, a sheep enterprise, a steam sawmill, and water-powered gristmill, and several molasses mills. ... Almost complete self-sufficiency was attained. ... The order had its quota of blacksmiths, clerks, artists, musicians and teachers, and even an herb doctor.</i>[Leonard J. Arrington,<i>Great Basin Kingdom,</i>pp. 334–35]<br><br>This particular order in southern Utah was probably the most communal of any of the orders ever established. During its first years of existence, the order was very successful. The financial statements that were produced in the order's third year indicated a remarkable self-restraint and discipline among the seven-hundred-odd members of the community. However, problems soon developed, caused partly by a lack of restrictions on new members, changing economic conditions in the surrounding communities, and a growing discontent among the young people. It seems that the young people began to envy those in surrounding prosperous mining towns, thinking that Orderville's ways were old-fashioned.<br><br>The story is told of a certain young man in Orderville who felt the need for a new pair of pants:<br><br><i>As he gained in stature, the pants he wore seemed to shrink, but as there were no holes in them, and no patches, his application for a new pair was denied. But where "there is a will, there is a way." There was a big crop of lambs that spring. When the lambs' tails were docked</i>[or cut off]<i>, the young brother surreptitiously gathered them and sheared off the wool which he stored in sacks. When he was assigned to take a load of wool to Nephi, he secretly took the lambs' tail wool with his load and exchanged it for a pair of store pants. On his return, he wore his new pants to the next dance. His entrance caused a sensation. The story is that one young lady rushed up to him, embraced and kissed him. The president of the order demanded an explanation, and when it was truthfully given, he said: "According to your own story these pants belong to the order. You are requested to appear before the board of management tomorrow evening at half past eight, and to bring the store pants with you."</i><br><br><i>At the meeting, the young brother was commended for his enterprise, but was reminded that all pants must be made of cloth from the same bolt. However, to prove its good will, the board of management agreed to have the store pants unseamed and used as a pattern for all pants made in the future, and further, the young man in question would get the first pair.</i><br><br><i>The tailoring department was soon swamped with orders for pants. The elders of the order protested. The boys went to work, as usual, but loafed on the jobs. It was noticed that the everlasting pants worn by the boys were getting thin in spots, and even some holes had developed. These boys were often on their knees when at prayers or when weeding the garden, but not much time was spent sitting down. Why was this unusual wear on the seat of the pants? When the elders saw the boys going in groups to the shed where the grindstone was housed, they became suspicious and investigated. Yes, the boys had been wearing out their pants on the grindstone. The elders protested and then capitulated. A load of wool was dispatched to Washington mills to trade for cloth. The tailor shop was a busy place. The boys were hard at work. The pants rebellion was over!</i>[Arrington,<i>Great Basin Kingdom,</i>p. 336]<br><br>In Brigham City, under the direction of Elder Lorenzo Snow of the Council of the Twelve, a cooperative developed in a much different direction. Rather than turning properties over to a community corporation as in Orderville, the members were invited to take shares in a cooperative venture that by 1874 included some forty branches covering almost every phase of industry and agriculture in the valley. The Saints in the community were urged to trade locally within the cooperative. Brigham City came to be known as one of the most prosperous, progressive cities in the territory. The cooperative was so successful that the Panic of 1873, which hit the rest of Utah, was virtually unnoticed in the Brigham City area. Eventually, however, for various reasons--including an influx of nonmembers, Brigham Young's death, changing economic conditions, and the extreme pressure brought to bear by the federal government because of polygamy--the united order movement was generally short-lived. In the mid-1880s the First Presidency counseled the few remaining orders to disband.<br><h2><b>Revelations About the United Order</b></h2><br>As we look back over these noble experiments in Utah, we now see that the original law of consecration, revealed through the Prophet Joseph in the early 1830s, was never strictly followed in any instance, either in Utah or in Missouri. To better understand the history and doctrines behind the original united order, not the united orders practiced in Utah, but the order envisioned by the Prophet Joseph, we need to turn to the Doctrine and Covenants. This was sometimes referred to as the order of Enoch and, more commonly, simply the united order. The united order described in these revelations will be the pattern to which we will someday return when Zion is redeemed--and this may not be very far off.<br><br>During the first year after the restoration of the Church, the Prophet Joseph received the revelation now recorded in section 42 of the Doctrine and Covenants, referred to by the Prophet as "embracing the law of the Church." In this revelation the Lord said:<br><br><i>If thou lovest me, thou shalt serve me and keep all my commandments.</i><br><br><i>And behold, thou wilt remember the poor, and consecrate of thy properties for their support that which thou hast to impart unto them, with a covenant and a deed which cannot be broken.</i><br><br><i>And inasmuch as ye impart of your substance unto the poor, ye will do it unto me; and they shall be laid before the bishop of my church and his counselors, two of the elders, or high priests, such as he shall appoint or has appointed and set apart for that purpose.</i><br><br><i>And it shall come to pass, that after they are laid before the bishop of my church, and after that he has received these testimonies concerning the consecration of the properties of my church, that they cannot be taken from the church, agreeable to my commandments, every man shall be made accountable unto me, a steward over his own property, or that which he has received by consecration, as much as is sufficient for himself and family.</i><br><br><i>And again, if there shall be properties in the hands of the church, or any individuals of it, more than is necessary for their support after this first consecration, which is a residue to be consecrated unto the bishop, it shall be kept to administer to those who have not, from time to time, that every man who has need may be amply supplied and receive according to his wants.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, the residue shall be kept in my storehouse, to administer to the poor and the needy, as shall be appointed by the high council of the church, and the bishop and his council;</i><br><br><i>And for the purpose of purchasing lands for the public benefit of the church, and building houses of worship, and building up of the New Jerusalem which is hereafter to be revealed--</i><br><br><i>That my covenant people may be gathered in one in that day when I shall come to my temple. And this I do for the salvation of my people.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.29-36?lang=eng#p28">D&amp;amp;C 42:29–36</a>]<br><br>Somewhat later in the same revelation, the Lord said:<br><br><i>Thou shalt not be idle; for he that is idle shall not eat the bread nor wear the garments of the laborer. ...</i><br><br><i>Thou shalt live together in love. ...</i><br><br><i>Thou shalt stand in the place of thy stewardship.</i><br><br><i>Thou shalt not take thy brother's garment; thou shalt pay for that which thou shalt receive of thy brother.</i><br><br><i>And if thou obtainest more than that which would be for thy support, thou shalt give it into my storehouse, that all things may be done according to that which I have said.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.42,45,53-55?lang=eng#p41">D&amp;amp;C 42:42, 45, 53–55</a>]<br><br>In this revelation, given in February 1831, the Lord began to reveal the principles and procedures of the united order. From 1831 to April 1834, when section 104 of the Doctrine and Covenants was revealed, the Lord gave many instructions concerning the united order and the law of consecration. The Lord placed great emphasis on our obligation to care for the poor and the needy when he said:<br><br><i>I, the Lord, stretched out the heavens, and built the earth, my very handiwork; and all things therein are mine.</i><br><br><i>And it is my purpose to provide for my saints, for all things are mine.</i><br><br><i>But it must needs be done in mine own way; and behold this is the way that I, the Lord, have decreed to provide for my saints, that the poor shall be exalted, in that the rich are made low.</i><br><br><i>For the earth is full, and there is enough and to spare; yea, I prepared all things, and have given unto the children of men to be agents unto themselves.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, if any man shall take of the abundance which I have made, and impart not his portion, according to the law of my gospel, unto the poor and the needy, he shall, with the wicked, lift up his eyes in hell, being in torment.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/104.14-18?lang=eng#p13">D&amp;amp;C 104:14–18</a>]<br><br>As I mentioned earlier, we learn from the historical record that in addition to the Utah activities there were early attempts by the Saints in Ohio and Missouri to live the united order. Because of transgressions and because the people were not obedient in all things, the Lord on June 22, 1834, suspended the requirement that the Saints live the united order as of that time. This revelation is recorded in section 105 of the Doctrine and Covenants.<br><br>President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., explained these early failures by saying that<br><br><i>in practice the brethren in Missouri got away, in their attempts to set up the united order, from the principles set out in the revelations. This is also true of the organizations set up here in Utah after the Saints came to the valleys. ... This instrument is not in accordance with the principle laid down in the revelations touching upon the united order.</i><br><br><i>The basic principle of all the revelation on the united order is that everything we have belongs to the Lord; therefore, the Lord may call upon us for any and all of the property which we have, because it belongs to Him. This, I repeat, is the basic principle.</i>[<i>Conference Report,</i>October 1942, p. 55]<br><h2><b>Righteous Stewardships</b></h2><br>It is most important that we remember the united order is based on the underlying principle that the earth and all things therein belong to the Lord and that men hold their temporal positions as stewards accountable to the Lord. According to the revelations, each man entered the united order by consecrating to the Church all that he had. This was done, as we have read, "with a covenant and a deed which could not be broken" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.30?lang=eng#p29">D&amp;amp;C 42:30</a>), whereupon the bishop, in consultation and after reaching agreement with the donor, deeded back to the donor sufficient for his and his family's needs. This, then, became his stewardship.<br><br>President Clark has cautioned us:<br><br><i>One of the places in which some of the brethren are going to stray is this:</i><br><br><i>There is continuous reference in the revelations to equality among the brethren, but I think you will find only one place where that equality is really described, though it is referred to in other revelations. That revelation affirms that every man is to be "equal according to his family, according to his circumstances and his wants and needs." Obviously, this is not a case of "dead-level" equality. It is "equality" that will vary as much as the man's circumstances, his family, his wants and needs, may vary.</i>[<i>Conference Report,</i>October 1942, p. 55]<br><br>This procedure, the bishop deeding back to the individual his stewardship, preserved in every man the right to private ownership and management of property. Private ownership of property was basic to the united order. The intent was that each man would improve his stewardship--that is, use the property to produce a living for himself and his family. Any surplus that he might produce above the wants and needs of his family was consecrated to the Church. This surplus went into a bishops storehouse, from which the needs of the poor, the orphan, and the widow were met; from which stewardships were given to others; and from which the activities of the Church were financed<br><br>Joseph Smith, in a letter to Bishop Edward Partridge in 1883, wrote:<br><br><i>The matter of consecration must be done by the mutual consent of both parties; for to give the Bishop power to say how much every man shall have, and he be obliged to comply with the Bishop's judgment, is giving to the Bishop more power than a king has; and upon the other hand, to let every man say how much he needs, and the Bishop be obliged to comply with his judgment, is to throw Zion into confusion and make a slave of the Bishop. The fact is, there must be a balance or equilibrium of power between the Bishop and the people, and thus harmony and good will may be preserved among you.</i>[<i>Documentary History of the Church,</i>1:364]<br><br>From this letter we can see how important it is for each member to keep all the commandments in order to be in tune with the Spirit of the Lord sufficiently to live the united order.<br><br>Some have erroneously thought that consecration and the united order resembled either communism or socialism. This is incorrect. In 1942 the First Presidency of the Church issued this statement:<br><br><i>Communism and all other similar isms bear no relationship whatever to the united order. They are merely the clumsy counterfeits which Satan always devises of the gospel plan. Communism debases the individual and makes him the enslaved tool of the state to whom he must look for sustenance and religion; the united order exalts the individual, leaves him his property, "according to his family, according to his circumstances and his wants and his needs," (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/51.3?lang=eng#p2">D&amp;amp;C 51:3</a>) and provides a system by which he helps care for his less fortunate brethren; the united order leaves every man free to choose his own religion as his conscience directs. Communism destroys man's God-given free agency; the united order glorifies it. Latter-day Saints cannot be true to heir faith and lend aid, encouragement, or sympathy to any of these false philosophies. They will prove snares to their feet.</i>[<i>Conference Report,</i>April 1942, p. 90]<br><br>The results of socialism and communism are far different from the results of living the law of consecration. In Moses we read, "And the Lord called his people Zion, because they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.18?lang=eng#p17">Moses 7:18</a>). In the Book of Mormon we read of the marvelous experiences the Nephites had during the two-hundred-year period following the Savior's visit to this continent:<br><br><i>And it came to pass in the thirty and sixth year, the people were all converted unto the Lord, upon all the face of the land, both Nephites and Lamanites, and there were no contentions and disputations among them, and every man did deal justly one with another.</i><br><br><i>And they had all things common among them; therefore there were not rich and poor, bond and free, but they were all made free, and partakers of the heavenly gift. ...</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that there was no contention in the land, because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people.</i><br><br><i>And there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor whoredoms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor any manner of lasciviousness; and surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God.</i>[4 Nephi 2–3, 15–16]<br><br>Wouldn't it be a glorious experience to live in such a society? In actual fact, this is the society to which those will belong who are prepared to live the law of consecration when the Lord sees fit to ask it of us. Some would say that this is fantasy, considering that human beings are what they are. Perhaps this is true. Nevertheless, it is also a fact that, when we reach the point of self-mastery and become converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ sufficiently to keep all of his commandments, we will reach a plane of human happiness and peace which does not exist in the world today.<br><h2><b>Preparation to Live the United Order</b></h2><br>It is my conviction that we cannot begin too early in life to prepare to live the law of consecration. We know of the second coming of the Savior. We do not know the day nor the hour, but we know he will come again. We also know that, although there is still much to be done prior to his coming, many prophecies are being fulfilled today. We also know that we must be prepared to live the law of consecration prior to his coming. The question is--what do we do to properly prepare ourselves to live this law? I suppose the point of beginning is our conversion to the principle that everything we have really belongs to the Lord. Until we feel in total harmony with this, it will be difficult, if not impossible, for us to accept the law of consecration. As we prepare to live this law, we will look forward with great anticipation to the day when the call will come. If, on the other hand, we hope it can be delayed so we can have the pleasure of accumulating material things, we are on the wrong path.<br><br>In other words, do we really accept the scripture found in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/6.33?lang=eng#p32">Matthew 6:33</a>, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you"? I suppose another way of saying it is that we need to set our priorities or our goals of life now, and then conform our lives to those principles that will permit us to reach them.<br><br>Now may I suggest some specific steps that everyone here can take in preparing to live this great law. First, tithes and offerings. Some years ago I was a member of a stake presidency. One day, as we were reviewing the tithing record of some of the officers in our stake, we noted the tithing of a member of the branch presidency of our Spanish-American branch. He lived in humble circumstances, had a large family to provide for, and was sustaining a son in the mission field. He had his own business, digging ditches with a ditch-digging machine. His tithing seemed excessive for his circumstances. In an interview with him we questioned him as to his understanding of the law of tithing. His response was, he knew he was expected to pay 10 percent of his personal income. But he said, "The Lord has been so good to me and my family, I can never repay him. I pay 10 percent of the income of my business, not my personal income." This wonderful brother is already prepared to live the law of consecration. The amount is of no consequence. The spirit and attitude of being honest with the Lord are what is important. President Harold B. Lee once said, "I have had difficulty understanding how a people who are not able to sacrifice to a point where they can pay a tenth of their interest annually are more than ten percent ready for the united order" (<i>Conference Report,</i>October 1941, pp. 110–15).<br><br>Now as to fast offering. Fast offering funds are used for the care of the poor. President Kimball has recently said, "I think we should be very generous and give instead of the amount we save by our two meals of fasting, perhaps much, much more--ten times more where we are in a position to do it. I know there are some who couldn't" (Welfare Services Meeting, April 1974, p. 12). We realize that as students you are not yet particularly affluent. Notwithstanding this, when I visited one of your stakes here on campus some years ago, I was thrilled at the per capita fast offerings. As I recall, it was a stake of married folks, and the fast offerings were higher than in many off-campus stakes. This tells me that many of you are well along the road in preparing to live the law of consecration.<br><br>Another important experience in this preparation is the living of the second great commandment: "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." I should like to relate to you two inspiring stories having to do with this law. Each of them has to do with students who were on this campus. Bob and Shauna were newlyweds who lived off campus in a humble ward in Provo. During his second year of graduate school and while Shauna was carrying their first child, Bob lost his part-time job. Shauna became very despondent, uncertain of how they would properly care for their expected baby. One evening while Bob was away at class, Shauna spent the evening on her knees, tearfully pleading for the Lord's help. Her prayer was interrupted by a soft knock on the back door. She opened the door cautiously and peered out, encountering a large box of groceries neatly overlaid with used but clean and serviceable baby clothing. Bob and Shauna never found out who their thoughtful neighbors were. Several struggling young couples in the ward were preparing themselves to live the law of consecration by silently gathering and sharing part of their surplus, even though it was very meager, with those in need.<br><br>One very special situation involved a young man who had cerebral palsy--and I know this young man. He came to BYU with a stranger as a companion. His father had asked for help so his son, virtually helpless in a wheelchair, could come to BYU. One young man, hearing the plea for help, volunteered to live with and care for this palsied student. The story's a long one, filled with love, frustration, optimism, and despair. The results are very special. Today this young man still is in a wheelchair. He still is afflicted with cerebral palsy, but far from helpless. He is an attorney, specializing in Russian, is married and the father of two lovely children. It is safe to say that his unusual talents and strengths might never have been developed without the consecrated service of his roommate and others. Again, someone was preparing to live the law of consecration.<br><br>In conclusion, may I suggest that we seriously reflect on the words of Jacob in the Book of Mormon:<br><br><i>Think of your brethren like unto yourselves, and be familiar with all and free with your substance, that they may be rich like unto you.</i><br><br><i>But before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God.</i><br><br><i>And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to do good--to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.17-19?lang=eng#p16">Jacob 2:17–19</a>]<br><br>My dear, wonderful brothers and sisters, I'm so grateful to see you here tonight and pray the Lord will touch your hearts. I know he's touched many. I bring the greetings and the love of a prophet of God to you, President Spencer W. Kimball. As we go out to our various responsibilities, he constantly reminds us that he loves us. It's so wonderful to have a prophet to lead us. The heavens are opened. Our Heavenly Father is so close.<br><br>The other day I was in a small meeting at which President Kimball presided. One of those in the meeting who has a heavy load of responsibilities said, "You know, I can't sleep after 3:00 in the morning." Another said he had the same experience, whereupon President Kimball said, "There is no need for you to waken at 3:00; 3:30 will do."<br><br>There's an urgency, my brethren and sisters, about our relationship with our Heavenly Father, an urgency such as I have never felt before in my life. I feel that urgency primarily through the urgency expressed by President Kimball. May we be blessed to understand our relationship with our Heavenly Father. May we understand that we are preparing the world for the second coming of the Savior. No man knows the day nor the hour, but it isn't very far off.<br><br>I bear my witness that God truly lives. This is his kingdom; this is his Church. He is the head of this Church and is constantly involved in directing the affairs of the Church through his servant and our President, Spencer W. Kimball. I bear this witness to you, and leave my blessing that you may feel that sweet spirit of peace that comes from keeping his commandments; for he said, "If ye love me, keep my commandments," in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Victor L.

<h1>l Marriage—A Little Heaven on Earth - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My brothers and sisters, it's a pleasure to be here today. Many thoughts went through my mind as I prepared for this occasion. I wanted to make sure that I deliver the kind of a message that is going to be helpful. I hope the Spirit will be with me that I might do just that.<br><br>The subject will be that of marriage, with an eternal perspective.<i>Temple marriage</i>describes the place you go to have the marriage performed.<i>Celestial marriage</i>is being true to the sacred covenants you make in that temple marriage ceremony--living celestial principles in the marriage relationship.<br><br>A celestial marriage requires, after the vows are taken, a continuing consecrated life of worthiness leading to happiness and exaltation, which President Kimball has talked to you about. If we live the laws properly, as they are intended, we will, with another individual and with our family, be able to have a little heaven on earth. We are practicing, when we live the laws pertaining to celestial marriage, the same laws that are practiced in heaven. We are practicing how to live with God the Father and his Son and with our families in the eternities to come. That to me is the message to the world of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br><br>So my title this morning is "Celestial Marriage--A Little Heaven on Earth." I would like to reinforce in your minds the principle of celestial marriage and the gospel lesson it gives to us.<br><h2><b>Goals for Righteous Living</b></h2><br>Something as wonderful as a celestial marriage doesn't just happen.<br><br>In the story<i>Alice in Wonderland,</i>Alice approaches the Cheshire Cat and asks, "Would you please tell me which way I ought to go from here?"<br><br>The Cheshire Cat replies, "That depends a great deal on where you want to go."<br><br>Alice says, "I admit, I don't much care where."<br><br>The Cheshire Cat then says, "Then it doesn't really matter much which way you go, does it?"<br><br>"Just so I get somewhere," responds Alice.<br><br>Then the Cheshire Cat reveals an interesting truth, "Oh, you're sure to get there if you keep walking long enough."<br><br>What is the message? How many of us are going through life today telling ourselves, "If we keep going long enough, we're going to get somewhere," but are not defining exactly where that place is we want to be? "Somewhere" is not good enough. We must know where we want to go and be firmly committed to getting there. And we should get that knowledge and commitment early.<br><br>Alma stated, "Oh, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God" (Alma 37:35). That says it all. Do it now.<br><h2><b>Temple Recommends</b></h2><br>Once we are committed to a celestial marriage, we should understand and do the things that lead to it:<br><br>To enter the temple, you will need what is called a recommend. A searching interview will be conducted first by your bishop and then by your stake president.<br><br>First, they will ask, "Do you have a testimony of the gospel?"<br><br>Second, "Do you support your local leaders and the General Authorities? Do you sustain the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a prophet, seer, and revelator, recognizing no other person on earth as authorized to hold all of the keys of the priesthood? Do you sustain the other General Authorities and local authorities in your stake and ward?"<br><br>Third, "Do you accept and follow the teachings and programs of the Church? By that we mean, do you earnestly strive to live in accordance with the accepted rules and doctrines of the Church?" Further, "Do you have affiliation with or sympathy with any groups or individuals who teach or practice doctrines which are not officially sanctioned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints?"<br><br>Fourth, "Do you keep the Word of Wisdom, including abstinence from the use of harmful drugs?"<br><br>Fifth, "Are you morally clean? Are you free from adultery, fornication, homosexuality, and all of the other moral transgressions that confront you in this life?"<br><br>Sixth, "Are you a full tithe payer?"<br><br>Seventh, "Are you totally honest in your dealings with your fellowmen?"<br><br>Eighth, "Will you and do you regularly wear your temple garments, if you have already been to the temple?"<br><br>Ninth, "Are you a member in good standing in the Church? By that we mean, will you earnestly strive to do your duty in the Church, to attend your sacrament, priesthood, and other meetings, and to obey the rules, laws, and commandments of the Church and of God?" Next, "Is anything amiss in your life that has not been fully resolved with your appropriate priesthood authorities that should be cleared up at this time?"<br><br>Tenth, "Are you free of legal entanglements?"<br><br>Eleventh, "Do you consider yourself worthy in every way to go to the temple?"<br><br>The importance of thinking of this recommend in connection with marriage is that, when you choose the companion you're going to live with for time and all eternity, you should ask yourself, "Am I sure he or she is able to live within the confines of this recommend?"<br><h2><b>The Endowment</b></h2><br>After you obtain a recommend, you may then go to the temple and receive an endowment. Before a person can be married or sealed as husband or wife in the temple, he or she receives the ordinances of the endowment. What is the temple endowment? In the<i>Discourses of Brigham Young</i>we read:<br><br><i>Let me give you a definition in brief. Your endowment is to receive all those ordinances in the house of the lord which are necessary for you after you have departed this life, to enable you to walk back to the presence of the Father, passing the angels who stand as sentinels, being enabled to give them the key words, the signs and tokens pertaining to the holy priesthood and gain your eternal exaltation in spite of earth or hell.</i>[<i>Discourses of Brigham Young</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1941), p. 416]<br><br>"The endowment," Elder ElRay L. Christiansen has said, "is a most important and significant blessing, and the Lord desires his worthy children to receive it" (<i>Temples of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1976</i>).<br><br>Elder James E. Talmage, formerly of the Council of the Twelve, spoke very significantly of the temple endowment as it is administered in our modern temples when he said:<br><br><i>It comprises instruction relating to the significance and sequence of past dispensations, the importance of the present as the greatest and grandest era of human history. This course of instruction includes a recital of the most prominent events of the creative period, the condition of our first parents in the Garden of Eden, their disobedience and consequent expulsion from that blissful abode, their condition in the lone and dreary world when doomed to live by labor and sweat, the plan of redemption by which the great transgression may be atoned, the period of the great apostasy, the restoration of the gospel with all its ancient powers and privileges, the absolute and indispensable condition of personal purity and devotion to the right in present life, and a strict compliance with gospel requirements.</i><br><br><i>The ordinances of the endowment embody certain obligations on the part of the individual, such as covenant and promise to observe the law of strict virtue and chastity, to be charitable, benevolent, tolerant and pure; to devote both talent and material means to the spread of truth and the uplifting of the race; to maintain devotion to the cause of truth; and to seek in every way to contribute to the great preparation that the earth may be made ready to receive her King,--the Lord Jesus Christ. With the taking of each covenant and the assuming of each obligation, a promised blessing is pronounced, contingent upon the faithful observation of the conditions.</i><br><br>Elder Talmage also said that "no jot, iota, or tittle of the temple rites is otherwise than uplifting and sanctifying" (James E. Talmage,<i>The House of the Lord</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1968], pp. 83, 84).<br><br>So it is that we have the privilege as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints to plan for and prepare for a celestial marriage. It is your parents' responsibility to teach this early in your life. It is your responsibility to teach it to your children. It should be taught at family home evening. Pictures of a temple should be in your home. I hope that in your room here at college you have a picture of a temple.<br><br>President Kimball told a story at the dedication of the St. George Temple of a mother with three boys. Their father had gone off to sea, never to return. As a reminder of her husband, and to remind the boys not to go to sea, she put up a picture in her living room of a beautiful clipper ship sailing on the ocean. Every day she stood there and told the boys, "Never go to sea." There isn't a mother here who doesn't know what happened. All three boys went to sea. Why? Because when they looked at that picture, they saw the adventure their father saw: the wind and the sails of that great clipper ship, the spray coming up. The visual image had a powerful effect upon the boys' desires. And so it is that President Kimball has indicated, "Wouldn't it be well to put up a picture of the temple in our homes and give that same adventure to your children, that they might set the objective for themselves to go to the temple?"<br><h2><b>Selecting a Companion</b></h2><br>The selection of a companion is what I would like to talk about next. You are here at an important period of your life, and are asking yourself, "What is marriage all about? How do I find the right person to marry?" Let me suggest an approach. Measure the spiritual level of your potential future companions. First, if they are members, are they active and fully committed? Are they passive? Are they antagonistic? Second, if they are not members, are they receptive to the gospel and its teachings? Are they non-committal or antagonistic?<br><br>I'd like to spend just a moment, drawing from twenty years of priesthood work, to talk to you on this. If you marry an active member in the temple, marry for time and all eternity in the new and everlasting covenant, will you have problems? Yes. Will you be able to solve them? Yes. Will your chance be better to solve the problems and strengthen your testimony than if you had not married in the temple? Yes. My brothers and sisters, if you marry somebody who is antagonistic to the Church or passive, I merely want to say one thing to you. You are placing yourself in a position where you will find, someday, that you will have to choose between that individual and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. That is a very heavy responsibility.<br><br>When you are choosing your companion, make sure that both of you have a desire for a celestial marriage relationship, a desire to have a family for eternity, a desire to have a companion for eternity and to live in the presence of our Heavenly Father.<br><h2><b>The New and Everlasting Covenant of Marriage</b></h2><br>The Lord has made it clear that we can be together in eternity with our companion only if we abide the law. In modern revelation he says, "Therefore, prepare thy heart to receive and obey instructions which I am about to give unto you; for all those who have this law revealed unto them must obey the same. For behold, I reveal unto you a new and an everlasting covenant" (D&amp;amp;C 132:3–4). Every member of the Church should read and study section 132 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Do you realize that, when one has the responsibility to be a sealer in the temple and has these keys, there is no one between him and God when that ordinance is performed? There is no priesthood authority between them, you and your loved one at the altar, and God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ. It is a beautiful and a touching ceremony.<br><br>The deep underlying purpose of temple marriage was clarified by the Redeemer himself when he said, "And as pertaining to the new and everlasting covenant, it was instituted for the fulness of my glory; and he that receiveth a fulness thereof must and shall abide the law, or he shall be damned, saith the Lord God" (D&amp;amp;C 132:6).<br><br>The Lord said also in that same section of the Doctrine and Covenants, "Therefore, if a man marry him a wife in the world, and he marry her not by me nor by my word, and he covenant with her so long as he is in the world and she with him, their covenant and marriage are not of force when they are dead, and when they are out of the world; therefore, they are not bound by any law when they are out of the world" (D&amp;amp;C 132:15). Do we really realize that in the Doctrine and Covenants we are told that unless we enter into celestial marriage we cannot reach the highest degree of glory in the celestial kingdom? It is also clear what will happen to those who never receive the blessings of the temple marriage, and that is that their binding is until "death do thee part"--a very sad thing to contemplate.<br><br>The aim of the gospel and the purpose of celestial marriage are not only to keep us together, but also to make us eligible for our Heavenly Father's highest reward, exaltation in the celestial kingdom, increase in that kingdom, and being together with our families.<br><h2><b>Supporting Each Other</b></h2><br>I would now like to discuss the partnership aspect of marriage and family life.<br><br>Let us talk frankly for a moment. Marriage is like climbing a mountain. You tie yourself to a companion, and you start up the mountain of life. As a child comes along, you tie him to mom and dad and continue your journey. The ropes will hold all of the mountain climbers together. But there are many elements--the wind and the rain and the snow and the ice--all the elements of the world will tear at you to pull you off that eternal mountain. How do you reach the summit? If either mom or dad cuts the rope which binds them, chances are that one or the other may fall off the mountain and perhaps pull down some of the rest of the family. The whole family could fall off that gospel mountain and not reach that eternal summit. Let us always be mindful that, as older brothers and sisters, you are also tied to this mountain team that is attempting to return back into the presence of your Heavenly Father. If you cut the rope that binds you to mom and dad and fall off the mountain--chances are that you will take one or two of your brothers and sisters with you. You can't take that chance. You, by definition, are a leader.<br><br>Someone has said it this way: "Thee lift me, and I'll lift thee, and we'll ascend together." What does that mean? I can remember an experience in my life that illustrates this idea. I was at Harvard Business School. I was stretched to my capacity. In the first year of that institution, the teachers take away every bit of self-confidence you have, no matter what your background is before you get there, so that you learn what it's like to have to achieve more than you've ever done in your life before. The program is designed to teach you how to think under pressure. They try to duplicate real life.<br><br>At an important point in my schooling, a mission president, John E. Carr, asked me to be an elders quorum president. It is the only time in my life that I ever questioned an assignment. I went home to talk to my wife. For every woman here and every man here the question will come in life, "When is the time to serve? When is the right time?" The only answer I can give you is, "When you are asked." So I went home and said to my wife, "There is a chance of failing in my schooling if I become an elders quorum president." She said to me the words which have helped for many years: "Bob, I would rather have an active priesthood holder than a man who holds a master's degree from Harvard." But as she put her arms around me, she said, "We'll do them both." That is eternal partnership.<br><br>"Thee lift me, and I'll lift thee, and we'll ascend together"--that's the message.<br><br>A marriage partnership is not a crutch. You do not marry somebody you think is a little higher than the angels and then lean on him. You develop yourself and your own gifts and talents. As each partner develops, you grow together, supporting and strengthening one another.<br><br>My wife has always supported me. We sat down before we were married, and I said to her, "You know, Mary, I feel that to be successful in business I will have to work hard domestically and perhaps internationally. Do you want to go on that trip with me?" She said she did. Ten years after we were married, I was asked to go to England, and there she was with me. Then we went to Germany, and then to Spain. She became international, bicultural, bilingual, because she had made her mind up that we would work and develop together.<br><br>Remember, if you would, to treat each other in kindness, to respect each other for who you are and what you want to be.<br><br>I would like to tell you the story of a woman who was in my ward some years ago when I was a bishop. She and her husband were having a marriage problem. As they spoke with me, she began to tear down her husband in all those key areas that a man must have to have some respect for himself. She alked of his inadequacy as a father, his inadequacies in marital relations, his inadequacy as a provider, his inadequacies socially, contrasted with what she had expected. I asked her, "Why do you do this to a man you should love and sustain?" She said, "Oh, it's much better to argue with someone you love because you know where you can hurt them the most." And she<i>meant</i>it.<br><br>Now let's think about that for a minute. Can you really hurt a stranger? Who are the people you can hurt the most? Is it your roommate? Is it your companion? Is it your mom and dad? Is it your brother or sister? Isn't it true that while you're at this institution you should learn how to strengthen those around you, not tear them down? Shouldn't you be developing an attitude with your roommates so that it becomes a natural part of you to be supportive and helpful? You share your strengths and weaknesses with their strengths and weaknesses, again, as you climb that mountain together and help one another.<br><br>The hero of Homer's<i>Iliad,</i>Achilles, had a mother, Thetis, who dipped Achilles in the waters of the River Styx so that he became invulnerable, the story goes, except for that part of his heel by which she held him. There he was unprotected. From this story has come the idea of the proverbial Achilles' heel. Everybody in this room has an Achilles' heel. Achilles was the bravest, handsomest, swiftest of the army of Agamemnon, but he was slain by Paris, whose arrow was guided by Apollo to his vulnerable heel. Every mother would love to dip her children into the waters of the River Styx and give them protection, but this is impossible. We must learn to use our free agency and take our opportunities for growth. Everyone has his weaknesses. The adversary knows our Achilles' heels. He knows the Achilles' heels of your loved ones, your friends, your roommates, your brothers and sisters, your parents. Do<i>you</i>understand your Achilles' heel? Do you know the situations you have to stay away from and what your weaknesses are? Sit down and talk to yourself, because the secret of a happy marriage is to protect the Achilles' heels of those you love and not take advantage of the weaknesses of those you know the best, love the most, and ultimately can hurt the most.<br><br>In the Doctrine and Covenants (I would hope each one of you would write this verse down and put it in your pocket and have it with you at all times for those challenging moments) we read, "Therefore, strengthen your brethren in all your conversation, in all your prayers, in all your exhortations, and in all your doings" (D&amp;amp;C 108:7). In other words, every day you help one another as you speak, as you pray, in your exhortations, and in your doings.<br><br>Working together is a sacrifice. You have to make sure that the person you're dating right now is going to be willing to sacrifice. I'll give you one story in life that helped me learn this. I can remember a young couple just out of college. One parent gave them a home; the other parent gave them the furnishings and a new car. They had everything. They were beautiful people and they were popular. They had everything in the world given to them. Well, you know the story. Within three years they were divorced. They hadn't worked and sacrificed. They had leaned on each other and on their parents as a crutch, had crippled themselves, and hadn't grown. They hadn't learned the hard part. They hadn't worried about making their marriage work. How do you support your wife? What is the role of a priesthood holder? What is the role of a woman with the priesthood? Again, it's making sure that you share and grow together.<br><h2><b>Family Support in Church Callings</b></h2><br>My wife has taught me to grow in a number of ways, one of which I'll share with you for a moment. (Usually it's a little easier to tell this story when she's not with me. She's here today, and I'm sure I'll be talked with afterwards.) After serving as an elders quorum president, a branch president, and a bishop over a period of five years, we moved to a new stake. The stake president recognized the great leadership talents of my wife. In fact, I've spent most of my life being known as the husband of Mary Hales, but I don't mind that. My wife was asked to be a Relief Society president, which she has been twice in her life. (As I've been a bishop three times, we've shared our priesthood and our Relief Society responsibilities.) She went to her first meeting with the bishop, a welfare meeting and a priesthood correlation meeting, while I chased two youngsters up and down the halls, through the parking lot, through the cultural hall, and had my first experience with waiting. I waited one and a half hours. When she came out, I had one boy in my arm and was holding the other by the hand. As the door opened and she came out of the bishop's office, I had that look on my face. You know the look. I didn't have the courage to say anything, but I just gave her a look that said, "Do you realize you've kept me waiting an hour and a half?" All she did was raise five fingers and say, "Five years." That is how long she had been waiting for me. Then I began to realize it was going to be my job to support my wife in her calling just as she had supported me as a priesthood holder. There isn't a man here who can't learn from that story.<br><br>I've heard of one husband who, on a Tuesday evening, was putting on his blue suit, his white shirt, and his blue tie. His wife asked him, "Where are you going?" His answer was very clear: "I'm going to Relief Society. One of us has to go." That story would warm the heart of every Relief Society president in the world.<br><br>At the University of Utah, in an evening seminar, I was speaking to the M.B.A.'s and senior business students. I noticed a young man with a baby sitting alone near the front of the hall. Afterwards he came up and spoke to me, still holding the baby. He had a few questions about his career. I said, "Where is your wife?" He said, "Well, when we were married, I promised her that she would have the opportunity of attending Relief Society. Tonight is Relief Society, and so I have our son at this seminar."<br><br>Every woman here should understand the importance of Relief Society in her marriage, and every priesthood holder should understand it.<br><br>I travel to stakes now, and I have learned that about one out of every five women, on average, goes to Relief Society. Sisters, start your habit of going to Relief Society at Brigham Young University. And brethren, you start your habit of supporting them in this activity. It is one of the most important chances they'll have for continuing education, for feeling self-worth, for being able to share testimonies in a testimony meeting.<br><br>There will be times when your wives will say to themselves that they won't be able to get through another day. There will be two or three children around the house, they'll be speaking on the level of a two- or three- or five-year-old, and at some point they will want to get out and have some cultural refinement. They will want to experience some growing. So it is that the testimony meeting helps your wives to share their feelings with each other. It also helps those of you women who will be alone, who may not have a partner. You should go to Relief Society for the association you will find there. It will help every woman in the Church to grow, to have new experiences. Someday you will go to Relief Society and hear someone bear her testimony; it will make you feel as though life is worth it.<br><br>There are two major reasons why women don't go to Relief Society. First, women do not know how important it is to them individually for their growth, or they don't know how important it is for their families and for their companionship with their husbands. Second, some priesthood holders do not support their wives and do not understand why it is important for them.<br><br>May I give just one last suggestion. When your companion is gone to Relief Society and you're all alone, you'll have some of the best "memory moments" with your children. That's also the time, maybe, to do a few dishes and to clean up the house a little bit, so that when she returns home she doesn't feel as though she has the weight of the world on her shoulders.<br><br>Many men feel that the physical part of their relationship in marriage is the most important part. But I want to tell each and everyone of you, very personally, that to clean a few dishes, vacuum a room, and have all of the kids in bed when mom comes home has got to be one of the most rewarding experiences your wife will ever have in marriage. It's a much better way, at times, of expressing your feelings than saying, "I love you."<br><br>You two also have to ask, as you travel through life in your marriage, "What are the anticipated problems if we don't follow the counsel which we've talked of today? What can we expect if we disregard the counsel of the Brethren, of the President of the Church, and of those who will counsel us on a temple marriage?" Thinking seriously about the answers to those questions may inspire us to do what is right.<br><br>In closing, I would like to give you my testimony. How I realize the importance of setting your course, of knowing where you are going. I ask the Lord's blessings to be with you so that you will not lean on one another as a crutch, but you'll both stand strong. Strengthen each other. Ask for help as you pray each night. Please date extensively. Please know the kind of person you want to be with. Please make sure that you help those you come in contact with. Please point them in the direction of associating with many people.<br><br>And please make sure that none of you sets an artificial goal for those you are going to marry. If you say, "I'll go with you or marry you if you go on a mission, or if you'll marry in the temple," and if that isn't what they feel inside they want to do, fifteen or twenty years from now you may have a tragic circumstance. Make sure that you know before you get married what that person really wants to be inside. You can do that by seeing if he goes to his meetings and has a testimony and can talk to you about eternal goals, now.<br><br>I ask the Lord's blessings to be with you. I know that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ. I bear testimony to you that those moments in my life when I have been unhappy, depressed, or sad are when I have deviated, even in a minor degree, from the teachings of the Lord. That you might have true happiness and find the joy of a celestial marriage with a little heaven on earth is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Robert D.

<h1> and Spiritual Success - O. Leslie Stone - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
You each come to this University because you want, in one way or another, to be a success. Of course, to different people the term<i>success</i>means different things. Some of us look for success in acquiring money; some of us seek it in the attention that comes from fame and renown; some of us view the gaining of knowledge as one of the most important forms of success; some of us find success in being happy in our work and in our family life. For some of you, the most important success right now may seem to be the attention of a particular young lady or young man, or perhaps the attention of anyone at all.<br><h2><b>Secular Success and Money Management</b></h2><br>In the context of the gospel, we tend to emphasize spiritual forms of success, and for good reason. But before we go very far this morning, I would like to remind you that secular success does have its place. In fact, when we analyze what is necessary to achieve such lofty goals as happy family life, we come to realize that some degree of financial success is essential. The members of our family need shelter, food, and clothing, and we also must be able to meet financial requirements for Church contributions, missions, education, health care, and many other things. All these obligations take money, and more now than ever before.<br><br>Therefore, we need to give a great deal of thought and effort to financial matters, not only to earning money, but also to developing the skills of good money management. On one occasion President Brigham Young said:<br><br><i>If you wish to get rich, save what you get. A fool can earn money, but it takes a wise man to save and dispose of it to his own advantage.</i>[<i>Discourses of Brigham Young,</i>comp. John A. Widtsoe (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1942), p. 292]<br><br>As those of you who are studying this field are probably coming to realize, money management can be a very complicated subject. I would like to take time to comment on only three basic suggestions.<br><br><i>First,</i>always pay your tithing. The Lord has promised us that he will open the windows of heaven and pour out blessings greater than we can receive if we pay our tithes and offerings. I testify that this is so. Keep yourselves eligible for these great blessings.<br><br><i>Next,</i>after you have paid the Lord his share, pay yourself something off the top. Save something out of each dollar you earn, even though the amount may be small at the beginning. Increase that amount as you can.<br><br><i>Finally,</i>in addition to setting aside your contributions to the Lord and your savings for yourself, you must also be wise in spending the rest of your money. Budget your money carefully, and avoid going into debt. In this economy we live in today, we are all being encouraged to buy now and pay later. Advertisements make it sound easy and even glamorous to surround ourselves with the things we desire before we can afford them. But to spend consistently more than you earn makes it more difficult to control your "wants" and thus avoid many temptations.<br><br>When I was president of the Salt Lake Temple I had the privilege of officiating at the marriages and sealings of hundreds of couples. I talked to nearly every couple about money management and suggested to them that, instead of buying now and paying later, they should "save now and buy later." I always told them that if they would follow this advice, they would not only save a high interest charge, but, more importantly, they would avoid financial entanglements.<br><br>In the scriptures the Lord equates debt, even justifiable debt, with bondage. Regarding the obligations incurred in printing the Book of Mormon, the Lord commanded Martin Harris: "Pay the debt thou hast contracted with the printer. Release thyself from bondage" (D&amp;amp;C 19:35).<br><br>Each of us must decide for himself what things are worth going into debt for--such as a home or an education--but the principle is to avoid, as completely as you can, going into financial bondage. As President J. Reuben Clark advised us:<br><br><i>Let us avoid debt as we would avoid a plague; where we are now in debt let us get out of debt; if not today, then tomorrow. Let us straitly and strictly live within our income, and save a little.</i>[<i>Conference Report,</i>April 1937, p. 26]<br><h2><b>Requirements for Success</b></h2><br>Although we must not overlook these material concerns in our quest for success, still the most lasting forms of success are to be found in less tangible areas. The requirements for success in these areas are much the same as for success in most other fields of endeavor. So I would like to mention and discuss briefly some of the requirements that I think are important.<br><br><i>1. Be determined.</i>One of the top requirements needed for success is determination, the firm commitment to follow a chosen path and obtain a desired goal. Not many have this quality, but it can be developed by anyone who is willing to pay the price through hard work.<br><br>I firmly believe you can be what you want to be in this life. All you need to do is to set your goals and then work and sacrifice to the extent necessary to reach your objective. It is worth the effort. It can be done.<br><br><i>2. Establish your priorities.</i>Often we get so occupied with small concerns that we don't have the time or the energy for bigger, more important matters. "Don't get thickly involved in thin things."<br><br>We all need to work out our values and evaluate our time. Then we can establish priorities and use wisely the time granted us, which is one of our most valuable possessions. Remind yourself often that "things that matter most should not be at the mercy of things that matter least." We should organize our time and efforts appropriately, according to the importance of our various tasks.<br><br><i>3. Constantly evaluate your progress.</i>In my father's day business organizations took an inventory only once each year. In the early days of my own business career we took an inventory every three months. Now, most successful businesses find it essential to maintain perpetual inventories. In addition, up-to-the-minute records must be maintained on all phases of the business, so that management can keep constantly informed. Such information is required in order to analyze what has been accomplished, to evaluate the present condition of the business, and to set goals for the future. The electronic age has made all this not only possible but necessary. If it is important for a business to have an up-to-date analysis of past performance, present condition, and plans for the future, think how much more important it is for us as individuals to constantly evaluate our own situation: Where have we been? Where are we now? Where are we going?<br><br>In this modern, rapidly moving age we now live in, it just is not good enough to take stock once a year or once a quarter. If we are to live righteous lives and accomplish the purpose of our creation, then we must constantly review our past action, determine our present status, and set goals for the future. Without this process we have little chance of reaching our objectives in this life.<br><br><i>4. Take action.</i>Charles F. Kettering, an American electrical engineer and inventor, once said:<br><br><i>You will never stub your toe standing still. The faster you move, the more chance there is of stubbing your toe, but the more chance you have of getting somewhere.</i><br><br>A father said to his son about to graduate from college: "With all thy getting,<i>get going:</i>Be on the march."<br><br>We should always remember that the Lord cannot direct our path until we move our feet. Your education and training here will do little good until you start to make use of it. In the Doctrine and Covenants we read:<br><br><i>It is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant; wherefore he receiveth no reward.</i><br><br><i>Men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 58:26–27]<br><br>5. Be<i>optimistic.</i>If you are an optimist it will help you to be happy in all of your endeavors.<br><br>You may have heard the story about a father teaching his son to play baseball in the backyard of their home.<br><br>The boy tossed the ball into the air. He swung and missed. "Strike one," the father called.<br><br>The boy again tossed the ball into the air. He swung and missed. "Strike two," the father called.<br><br>For the third time the boy tossed the ball into the air. He swung and missed again. "Strike three, and out," the father called.<br><br>The boy then said: "Dad, I may not be a very good batter, but you must admit that I'm a darn good pitcher."<br><br>He was a real optimist, looking for the bright side in every situation. It doesn't pay to be a pessimist.<br><br><i>6. Develop and maintain endurance.</i>We need to "stick" with our goal even if we run into great difficulty. "Stick-to-it-iveness" is a common synonym for endurance. Often we are tempted to quit or give up when success may be just around the corner. Success comes not to quitters, but to those who stay with the job no matter how tough it may be. A person who gives up easily will never gain success in any worthwhile field.<br><br>There are bound to be times when we are disappointed, but we should never be discouraged. Discouragement is a tool of the devil. I pass on to you the admonition that my wife has given me on many occasions throughout our married life: "Do the very best you can, and remember the angels can do no better." There are times when, after doing everything you can, you have to leave it in the hands of the Lord.<br><br><i>7. Establish good work habits.</i>We need to develop promptness, initiative, diligence, accuracy, and the ability to give complete effort. Good work habits influence everything we do from our occupation to the work we do at home, in school, or in the Church. A person who is lazy at home will probably be lazy at school and will probably become a lazy missionary and a lazy worker.<br><br>One can develop good work habits only by getting at the work to be done at the time it needs to be done, by applying reasonable diligence, by taking pride in good performance, and by looking for ways to improve. The habit of being prompt, thorough, and accurate in all that we do is essential to good work habits.<br><br>Success will seldom be gained without hard work. In my opinion, forty hours a week won't bring success. President David O. McKay said, in one of his conference talks not long before he passed on:<br><br><i>Within my experience there has never been a time when the doctrine of individual initiative and individual effort should be more generally taught and more earnestly put into effect than at the present day. Too many are claiming that the world owes them a living and are sitting effortlessly by, expecting the world to throw its luxuries into their passive laps. Too late they will learn that the earth rewards richly only the strenuous struggler.</i>[<i>Pathways 10 Happiness,</i>comp. Llewelyn R. McKay (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1957)]<br><br>I love the phrase "strenuous struggler." It means willingness to work and sacrifice as necessary to achieve our goals.<br><br><i>8. Be well groomed.</i>We do not have to be dressed in our "Sunday best" at all times, but we should wear clothes to fit the occasion. Personal cleanliness is also essential to good grooming. It has been my experience through long years in business that the person who really wants to succeed and be a leader is careful about his personal appearance and uses good taste.<br><br><i>9. Associate with good people.</i>Those with whom we associate will contribute to our success or failure. Their actions and ideals cannot help but have a profound influence on our lives and actions, either for good or for evil. Learn to walk in the company of good people. Shun evil by staying out of the devil's territory.<br><br><i>10. Honor your principles.</i>I have been asked on numerous occasions whether I found it necessary to violate my principles in order to succeed in business. The answer is no. Others will respect you for adhering to your beliefs.<br><br>While it is important for us to live according to our standards, we should never try to force our beliefs on others. The Lord intended that every man should have his free agency, and it is not our prerogative to judge others or to be critical of those who do not share our beliefs.<br><br><i>11. Be honest.</i>The thirteenth Article of Faith tells us that "we believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous and in doing good to all men." Honesty includes freedom from lying, deceiving, cheating, and stealing. These types of sins are all reprehensible, and the scriptures condemn them emphatically. Jacob, the brother of Nephi, declared:<br><br><i>Wo unto the liar, for he shall be thrust down to hell.</i>[2 Nephi 9:34]<br><br>And when priests were sent among the Nephites, they<br><br><i>did preach against all lying, and deceiving, and stealing, robbing, plundering.</i>[Alma 16:18]<br><br>In the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord commands:<br><br><i>Thou shalt not steal; and he that stealeth and will not repent shall be cast out.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 42:20]<br><br>To be honest, we must not only refrain from stealing money or goods from our employer or from others--but we must do a good day's work for a day's pay. If we shirk on the job, we are stealing time from our employer, and this habit is as bad as stealing money or merchandise. If a person wastes thirty minutes a day, he steals about three and a half work weeks in a year. If we are honest in our small dealings we acquire the habit, and we will then find it easier to be honest in handling larger transactions.<br><br>Honesty also includes the keeping of one's word or contract. We must fulfill our obligations promptly or make prior arrangements if we are unable to meet deadlines. A<i>good credit rating is an invaluable financial and moral possession</i>and<i>thus should be carefully guarded.</i><br><h2><b>Examples of Successful Saints</b></h2><br>We have literally hundreds of Latter-day Saints who have gained both temporal and spiritual success. One good example is the man who donated to BYU this wonderful building in which we are meeting.<br><br>His name is J. Willard Marriott. He started out in an A&amp;amp;W root beer stand in Washington, D.C., and has achieved great success in the business world. Only last week I read in the financial news that his company earned over ten million dollars<i>last year.</i><br><br>He and his family have been and still are very active in the Church. He has been a great help in the building of the kingdom in Washington, D.C., particularly, but the results of his generosity are found worldwide. His son, J. Willard Marriott, Jr., now president of the Marriott Company, is also serving as a bishop of the Chevy Chase Ward in the Washington, D.C. Stake.<br><br>Such men are examples of those who possess the attributes I have been talking about. They have demonstrated<i>determination, endurance, good work habits, proper grooming.</i>They have lived according to their principles and have been honest in dealing with their fellowmen. They have established and maintained a good credit rating and a fine reputation.<br><h2><b>Requirements for Gaining Eternal Life</b></h2><br>As you may have noticed, what we're really talking about is character--about the qualities and attitudes that will help us succeed in whatever worthwhile goals we may set. I'd like to mention a few more qualities and attributes that enable us to achieve the most important success--<i>exaltation and eternal life.</i><br><br>There are very few things that we acquire in this life that we will be able to take with us into the next life, but one of the most important things that will endure is intelligence. The Prophet Joseph taught:<br><br><i>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i><br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come</i>. [D&amp;amp;C 130:18–19]<br><br>The Lord revealed the importance of this process when he said, "The glory of God is intelligence" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36). Gaining knowledge and intelligence should be a constant quest in our lives.<br><br>I commend you who are in school on your desire and effort to gain knowledge. But at the same time I challenge you not to be diverted from this goal. Do not let the drudgery that sometimes accompanies learning or the pressure that comes from all the assignments obscure the privilege you have of learning, expanding, and understanding.<br><br>Never be content with mediocrity, and never let yourself be complacent with what you have learned. The following words of the Lord might be applied to all types of knowledge:<br><br><i>For behold, thus saith the Lord God: I will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little; and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will give more; and from them that say, We have enough, from them shall be taken away even that which they have.</i>[2 Nephi 28:30]<br><br>When we become complacent and cease to grow we also begin to lose what we already have, but if we continue to search, then what we have will be magnified.<br><br>President Hugh B. Brown said:<br><br><i>As our understanding deepens and we gain new insights, our capacity to do and to become increases. There are limitless areas all about us which are yet unexplored, and they become increasingly evident as we push back the horizons of our knowledge.</i>[<i>The Abundant Life</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1965)]<br><br>Develop curiosity and an attitude of searching for knowledge. Always remember, however, that secular knowledge should not be your only goal. The Lord advises us:<br><br><i>Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you</i>. [Matthew 6:33]<br><br>Set aside part of each day for learning spiritual things, for expanding your spiritual intelligence. One of the best sources for this sort of study is the scriptures. Do you read in the scriptures each day? We would all do well to study and ponder the scriptures, for they contain the keys to those things that will contribute to success. Here are just a few questions that are answered in the scriptures:<br><br>How can we be healthy?<br><br><i>Cease to sleep longer than is needful;</i>retire to thy bed early<i>, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:124; emphasis added]<br><br>And of course, you should read the Word of Wisdom in section 89 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Read all the do's as well as the don'ts.<br><br>How can we acquire riches and security?<br><br><i>He that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father's kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:38]<br><br><i>Seek not for riches but for wisdom, and behold, the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto you, and then shall you be made rich. Behold, he that hath eternal life is rich.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 6:7]<br><br><i>If ye seek the riches which it is the will of the Father to give unto you, ye shall be the richest of all people, for ye shall have the riches of eternity; and it must needs be that the riches of the earth are mine to give; but beware of pride, lest ye become as the Nephites of old.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 38:39]<br><br>How can we gain wisdom?<br><br><i>As all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:118]<br><br><i>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</i>[James 1:5]<br><br>How can we be sure we are making a right decision?<br><br><i>Behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</i><br><br><i>But if it be not right you shall have no such feeling, but you shall have a stupor of thought that shall cause you to forget the thing which is wrong.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 9:8–9]<br><br>How can we be loved and respected?<br><br><i>All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them, for this is the law of the prophets.</i>[Matthew 7:12]<br><br>How should we treat others?<br><br><i>This is my commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you.</i>[John 15:12]<br><br><i>Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.</i>[Galatians 6:2]<br><br>How can we serve the Lord?<br><br><i>When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.</i>[Mosiah 2:17]<br><br><i>Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 4:2]<br><h2><b>Testimony</b></h2><br>Now, my brothers and sisters and friends, no one can give us knowledge or a testimony, nor can we buy these treasures. They can only be secured through individual effort. We need to take a few minutes' time each day to study and ponder the scriptures, carefully analyze our position, and set our goals in the right direction so as to reach our objectives.<br><br>President Harold B. Lee has said:<br><br><i>A testimony isn't something you capture today and can always have . . . A testimony is just as fragile as an orchid, it's as elusive as the moonbeam, it is something you have to recapture day by day.</i>[<i>Church News,</i>3 March 1973. "S" (Seminary) Day, Assembly Hall on Temple Square, 24 February 1973]<br><br>A testimony of the gospel by itself cannot save us. When the book of life is opened we will be judged by our faithfulness--by both our faith and our works. But a testimony can help us strengthen our faith and should motivate us to put forth greater effort to keep the commandments and live righteous lives.<br><br>Men and women who enter into a partnership with God, who live his commandments, and who are<i>strenuous strugglers,</i>will be successful; so stay close to the Church and take advantage of opportunities to learn, develop, and give. The Church provides unlimited opportunities for us to learn and develop ourselves, through the priesthood, Sunday School, the youth program, the Melchizedek Priesthood MIA, seminaries and institutes, Relief Society, sacrament meeting, and other Church meetings.<br><br>We need to ask ourselves constantly whether we are fulfilling our potential or whether we are drifting along with the tide. It takes no ability to be a drifter. One of the prime purposes of life on this earth is to provide us with the opportunity to meet, combat, and overcome evil. Through this process we develop character and gain strength, power, and skill to prepare us for further development throughout the endless ages of eternity. All this can only be accomplished when we have problems and then meet them head on with zeal, courage, and determination. Don't ever feel sorry for yourself. We have all been blessed to one degree or another with obstacles. God intended it to be that way in order to give us opportunity for self-development.<br><h2><b>Commitment to the Future</b></h2><br>Finally, we should be neither complacent nor despondent about the past. Success depends upon constantly reevaluating and recommitting ourselves. Elder Richard L. Evans explained:<br><br><i>The moment we close the books on one period, we open them on another and compare our performance with the past. In business we look back and compare cost and production and prices and profits. And no matter how good last year was, there is this year now to be considered.</i><br><br><i>We have to keep at it, for life is a process and not a finished product, and there is no moment at which we can say the picture is completed.</i><br><br><i>Likewise, failure need never be final as long as a person can improve his performance. Failure need never be final so long as a person has the spirit of repentance.</i><br><br><i>Neither failure nor success is final so long as we are trying, so long as we have the spirit of improvement and repentance--and if we keep moving, keep working, keep improving upon the past, we can hardly help finding the happiness that we so much wish for one another--which is what the Lord God wants for His children--as we want it for our own.</i>[<i>The Everlasting Things</i>(New York: Harper &amp;amp; Brothers, 1957)]<br><br>Our Heavenly Father wants us to succeed. The gospel is the plan he has given us for achieving eternal success. I admonish you to live close to the teachings of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Our beloved prophet, President Spencer W. Kimball, has told us the price of happiness is to keep the commandments. I testify this is true. Through obedience we can not only find joy in this life, but also make the necessary preparations to secure our salvation, exaltation, and eternal life.<br><br>May our Heavenly Father grant you success in all your righteous undertakings and bless you with every blessing that will be for your good, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>O. Leslie Stone was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 30November 1976.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>e Should Do - N. Eldon Tanner - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As I was getting up to address you, Sister Tanner said, "You have a large audience tonight. Be sure you speak loudly enough." This reminded me of President McKay when he was standing before an audience. Someone in the back said, "Speak up. We can't hear you." Someone near the stand said, "Sit down and be glad you can't." So you take your choice.<br><br>As I saw my family here, I realized I had my own cheering section. I'll signal to them when I want them to cheer.<br><br>It's near enough to Christmastime that I am reminded of two little stories I would like to tell you. While our youngest daughter was in school, she came home just before Christmas and said to her mother, "Do you know what they tell me at school?" Her mother said no, and my daughter said, "Well, those kids tell me there's no Santa Claus."<br><br>My wife said, "What did they say about the presents?"<br><br>"They say their fathers and mothers give them to them."<br><br>"What did you say?"<br><br>"Well, you don't know<i>my</i>dad and mother."<br><br>I was thinking about a little girl whose mother was telling her about Christmas, and how Joseph and Mary had to go to Bethlehem to pay their taxes, and because there was no place for them to stay, the babe was born in a stable. The little girl said, "Why didn't they stay with their grandmother?" It made me wonder why we hadn't heard more about the grandmother of Jesus.<br><h2><b>Preparation for Obtaining Eternal Life</b></h2><br>My beloved young brethren and sisters, it is a most inspiring sight to look into the faces of this vast audience of members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who understand and know that they are spirit children of God, and whose greatest desire and determination is to prepare themselves to go back into his presence. This is a tremendous goal, and to think that you have most of your lives to prepare for it! Don't waste it.<br><br>As I stand before you this evening I humbly pray that the Spirit and blessings of the Lord will attend us, each and everyone of us, that we may communicate with one another and be benefited thereby.<br><br>As I was looking through my notes and copies of talks I have given here, I was reminded of the fact that I talked at one of your devotional services ten years ago. It was most interesting to me to review the conditions then and compare them with the conditions now as they pertain to the growth and development of the Church and Brigham Young University. In that talk, I, as a counselor to President David O. McKay, who was then President of the Church, referred to the message which he had asked me to take to the members of the Church wherever I went. It was: "Remind those people to remember who they are and to act accordingly, and to take an individual responsibility." This is a great message.<br><br>Since then we have had three other Presidents of the Church, each one with his own distinctive message. President Joseph Fielding Smith's message was: "We are living in the Saturday evening of time, and it is our responsibility to prepare ourselves and help prepare the world for the second coming of Christ."<br><br>Next, President Harold B. Lee said his greatest message to the Church and the world was: "Keep the commandments" --just three simple words. Now President Spencer W. Kimball practices and preaches: "We should lengthen our stride and do all we can to take the gospel message to all the world--every nation, kindred, tongue, and people."<br><br>If the members of the Church would accept and put into practice these four messages, they as individuals would be greatly blessed, the growth and progress of the Church would be phenomenal, and its influence on the world would be tremendous.<br><h2><b>Ten Years of Growth in the Church</b></h2><br>Much growth and progress has taken place in the Church during these past ten years. The Church membership has grown from 2.5 million to over 3.5 million. We had thirteen thousand full-time missionaries then, and today we have twenty-five thousand. To envision this, just imagine this great auditorium filled to capacity, and you will realize how many missionaries are laboring to bring the blessings of the gospel to the world.<br><br>Many of these are local full-time missionaries working in their own homelands. Where we had practically none ten years ago in any area, we now have in the South America East Area 400 local full-time missionaries. In the Hawaii Pacific Islands Area there are 385. In the Mexico Central America Area there are 350, as well as large numbers in other areas. We had nearly 69,000 convert baptisms in 1966, while in the first nine months of this year we have had over 100,000.<br><br>In 1966 we had thirty-nine General Authorities, eleven of whom have passed on. Today we have fifty-eight General Authorities. The growth of the Church is such that we have found it necessary to divide the world outside of Canada and the United States into eleven areas, each of which is supervised by a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy. Others will be established.<br><br>Then we had 69 Regional Representatives of the Twelve, and today we have 115. In another recent development the Lord has directed that the First Quorum of the Seventy should be organized and comprised of those who were Assistants to the Twelve, the First Council of Seventy, and of new members as they are called and ordained and set apart as members of the First Quorum of the Seventy. There are now thirty-nine members of the Quorum of the Seventy, of whom seven are presidents.<br><br>During this period the area conference program was introduced, and as of this date we have held ten series of area conferences in twenty-eight different countries, with attendance ranging from 1,600 to 16,000 in each session, with a total of nearly 200,000 attending from thirty-four countries throughout the world.<br><br>We have also been holding solemn assemblies in the United States and Canada for the purpose of edifying, strengthening, and encouraging the priesthood leadership of the Church in their duties and responsibilities. The three members of the First Presidency and two other General Authorities attend and speak at these solemn assemblies. To date we have held thirty meetings in twenty-five cities in the United States and Canada, with a total attendance of just over thirty thousand.<br><br>The leaders of the stakes and missions within a radius of two or three hundred miles of each meeting place are invited to attend these solemn assemblies. It is certainly encouraging and most inspiring for us to meet with these groups of dedicated stake and mission leaders. We have had as many as twenty-two hundred in attendance at one meeting. Just last month we held a solemn assembly in Tallahassee, Florida, on Friday evening, and in New York City on Saturday afternoon.<br><br>Now, regarding the University. In 1966 Ernest L. Wilkinson was President of Brigham Young University and was responsible for much of the growth and maintaining the high standards of the school. Today President Dallin Oaks is leading this University to even greater heights, and, it is continuing to make its influence felt in the academic world, where it is held in high regard. During this ten-year period the faculty and the students have contributed much in business, industry, and community life. Many are holding responsible positions in industry, business, professions, and in community and government offices.<br><br>As I was thinking of these things I realized that even an old man like me experiences some changes in ten years. During that time twelve of our grandchildren have married and have given us twelve great-grandchildren.<br><br>I wish to emphasize that in ten years<i>you</i>will be ten years older. (Sometime you ought to stop and think about that.) Many changes will occur in your lives. Many of you will be parents. Many of you will be holding leading positions in your communities, in the Church, and in governments.<br><h2><b>Preparation for Spiritual Success in a Material World</b></h2><br>Just about a year ago I spoke to the twelve-stake fireside here in this same building and talked about "Some Things to Ponder." Tonight I hope it will be possible for me to discuss with you "Things We Should Do" if we want to be more successful and happy as we go through life, trying to be of service and preparing ourselves for eternal life.<br><br>Many students have asked themselves, and some have asked General Authorities and others, "How can a person live the teachings of the gospel and maintain its standards, and yet be totally successful while living in this cold, materialistic, competitive world?" Also many missionaries, as they have finished their missions, have asked me what vocation they should follow.<br><br>I have given both groups the same answer: "It matters little what vocation you choose, but choose one in which you think you will be happy. Then set about to be the best you can in your chosen vocation. But wherever you are, whatever you do, remember that the Lord has said: 'Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you' (Matthew 6:33). Also remember the admonition of Paul: 'For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth' (Romans 1:16)."<br><br>I should like to say that I have never been embarrassed or felt deprived in any way in government or industry by living the standards of the Church. As I was introduced, you were told of the positions I have held, and I think I've had a great opportunity to prove this very same thing that I'm talking about. Most of my time while in government service has been spent with nonmembers of the Church, and I have never been embarrassed in any way.<br><br>As a result of my own experience and observation I can promise you that as you follow these exhortations you will enjoy the respect of all and meet with success and happiness. One who believes and seeks first the kingdom of God and his righteousness will live righteously, keep the commandments of God, and be honest, honorable, upright in his dealings, and will occupy himself in the service of men and try to give the best service that is possible for him to give. If he is a doctor, he will do all he can in the interest of the health of the individual whom he serves. If he is a lawyer, he will do all he can in the interest of his client, never thinking how much money he can make or how it will inconvenience him or how much effort he must put into his service. One who chooses to be a successful nurse, secretary, schoolteacher, or salesperson will lose himself in that service and think first of the welfare of the individual whom he or she is serving. If one will do this he cannot help but succeed. His satisfied customers or his employers will praise his name, and people will make a trail to his door.<br><br>Many of the present leaders in business, industry, professions, universities, and research will be retired in a few years, and those jobs will be available to the youth who have graduated from school and prepared themselves to fill these positions. Whether a person is able to be successful in his vocation depends on what he is doing now to prepare himself.<br><br>Tremendous progress has been made in all fields of endeavor, and in education itself during the past twenty years. In fact, opportunities are there that were never there before, and great progress will continue to be made. How many of us realized ten years ago that within three years we'd have a man on the moon? Now we have directed explorations on Mars and are moving into other areas of space.<br><br>In order to progress in any field of endeavor and keep up with the progress of the world, it is essential that we be prepared to put our best efforts into learning. It is no time for loitering. There is no use in waiting for the future in the hope that everything will turn out all right. We must determine as early in life as possible what is available, what we would like to do, and then be prepared to pay the price in study, work, and devotion. Remember:<br><br><i>Heights by great men reached and kept</i><br><i>Were not attained by sudden flight;</i><br><i>But they, while their companions slept,</i><br><i>Were toiling upward in the night.</i><br><br>Never become discouraged if you have to work hard to reach your goal. Men who become great in any occupation have a passion for work. Anyone who wants anything badly enough will work to get it, and one really deludes himself if he thinks he can gain success without doing what he can to deserve it. Top positions are not held by lazy people. In fact, the future belongs to those who plan where they are going, who prepare themselves for the journey, perform their tasks skillfully, seize their opportunities, and persist in spite of setbacks. There is very little difference in the effort needed to make you what you could have been and what you are, and your effort determines the extent of your success.<br><br>We should not become so completely engrossed in work that we neglect our family. We should let them know that we love them and be where we should be when they need us. Also, remember that "all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy." Take time for diversion and recreation, but don't forget your goal.<br><h2><b>Free Agency in Our Country and Church</b></h2><br>We are fortunate to live in a land where we can do these things. I cannot emphasize too strongly how much we should appreciate what a great blessing it is to live in a land of freedom, where the standards of living are higher, the opportunities are greater, and where we can freely choose our lives and what we will be. In many countries in the world neither youth nor adults are free to make their choices, and I wonder--yes, I seriously wonder--if we really begin to appreciate the great privilege and blessing it is to live in a free country.<br><br>May we always remember that many men have given their lives to make it possible for us to enjoy this freedom. It is our responsibility to do all in our power to preserve it and make it available to those who succeed us.<br><br>The importance of freedom is emphasized by the fact that God's greatest gift to man is free agency, which affords us the opportunity to choose between good and evil, virtue and vice, life and death. The prime purpose of our mortal existence is to prove ourselves through the exercise of this great gift. Winston Churchill, one of the greatest leaders of this generation, once said: "I have seen many things happen, but the fact remains that human life is presented to us as a simple choice between right and wrong."<br><br>It is most important that we choose at an early age just what we want out of life, what we want to accomplish, what we want to be, the kind of community in which we wish to live, the kind of parents we want to be, the kind of families we want to have, and whether or not we choose to serve God and keep his commandments. It is your responsibility to make your own choices. The power of choice is yours; the roads are clearly marked--one offering an animal existence, and the other life abundant. Successful people in life have one thing in common: they decide what it is that they want and stay with it until they get it. It is just about as simple as that.<br><br>Another important fact for us to remember is that we are fortunate to belong to a church where this principle of free agency is understood and taught; and to attend this University, where the teachers know this and realize that you are children of God and that the soul of man is great in the sight of the Lord, and where you are encouraged to make your proper choices and to live an honest, honorable, and righteous life.<br><h2><b>Humility</b></h2><br>Though we know that we have the gospel in its fulness, and that we belong to the church of Jesus Christ, and that this is the greatest University in the world because it is directed under the influence of the gospel, we must never adopt a "holier than thou" attitude or give the impression that we are perfect, that we are better than others, that we need not repent, that we have arrived, or that we are saved. Everyone of us needs to repent of things that we have failed to do, or things that we should have done, and things we have done that are wrong, and concentrate on trying to improve ourselves and live more closely and completely the teachings of the gospel. Where members of the Church adopt a smug or self-satisfied or superior attitude, we deserve the criticism we receive, and we often turn away prospective converts.<br><br>Let us be what the Lord expects us to be and live as he expects us to live, remembering that he has said the first great commandment is to love him with all our hearts, minds, and souls, and the second is to love our neighbors as ourselves. As we do this we will not be inclined to criticize or gossip or carry false tales about our friends, associates, classmates, or neighbors, but will look for the good in them and hand out bouquets instead of brickbats. We must be tolerant and not find fault because others do not see or live as we think they should.<br><br>When we feel like criticizing or finding fault with others, we would do well to stand before a mirror and look that image straight in the eye and tell him or her where and how he or she can improve. We have a full-time job trying to improve and prepare ourselves for a full and successful life.<br><br>Christ gave us a parable about this, which we read from Luke:<br><br><i>And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:</i><br><br><i>Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.</i><br><br><i>The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.</i><br><br><i>I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.</i><br><br><i>And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.</i><br><br><i>I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for everyone that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</i>[Luke 18:9­ndash;14]<br><h2><b>Education of the Whole Man at BYU</b></h2><br>These are some of the lessons you should be learning here along with your academic studies. You are learning how to build the whole man--mental, physical, and spiritual. Most schools and universities do not concern themselves about the spiritual side of life, and therefore their students fail to obtain the most essential knowledge of all--how to prepare for eternal life.<br><br>While speaking last April to the graduating class of this great University, Dr. John A. Howard, president of Rockford College in Rockford, Illinois, referred to the problems and sacrifices made by our early pioneers who crossed the plains to the Great Salt Lake Valley. (I repeated this in the general priesthood meeting last October.) Then he said:<br><br><i>The work that faces your generation is no less arduous. The deserts you must bring to blossom are no less arid, but your mission may demand even more of you, for unlike the early pioneers of this state you are confronted by a wilderness which is subtle and fluid and elusive. Indeed the wilderness which you must conquer is disguised as a civilization so that there is the double necessity to unmask the deceit, to distinguish between what is authentic and what is counterfeit, and to labor to support the one and oppose the other.</i><br><br><i>The moral depravity which appears on television is rivaled by the moral tone of campuses where cohabitation is commonplace and where the use of illegal drugs doesn't even raise an eyebrow anymore. The swelling tide of crime is matched by the deluge of dishonesty--and I think that word is adequate and accurate. The tide of crime is matched by the deluge of dishonesty on the part of politicians who promise what they know they cannot deliver and who try to deceive the people into believing that projects can always be paid for out of somebody else's pocket.</i><br><br><i>It may be difficult for</i>your<i>generation to conceive what this society was like a scant ten years ago. Gutter language was almost unknown on public platform and in plays and movies. Coeducational dormitories were</i>unthinkable anywhere<i>in this country. . . . Salacious literature was not publicly available on the newsstands . . . nor. . . in the bookstores.</i><br><br>He then gave this challenge:<br><br><i>I believe there is no single large group of your generation in the United States as consistently trained in its religious obligations, as ready to work long hours and make sacrifices for its principles, and as well versed in the dignity of self-reliance as you are. If that estimate is correct, you are greatly blessed and highly privileged.</i><br><br>This is a great compliment to Brigham Young University and to those who attend it. Remember, this is given by a nonmember of the Church who is president of another university and who is acquainted with the conditions in the world today and is qualified to speak on the subject. He has clearly pointed out what our responsibilities are here at BYU. These responsibilities are great. I do hope that everyone here is prepared to accept the challenge and do his part through study and by good, clean living to make this a better world in which to live.<br><h2><b>The Word of Wisdom</b></h2><br>If you are going to do this, you must be united in your stand against the evils of the day, about which all of you are aware. One of the most important things you can do is to live the Word of Wisdom strictly. We are all convinced of the many problems arising from the use of alcohol, tobacco, and drugs. How fortunate we are to have this health code as part of the gospel! Keeping your bodies and minds free from the deleterious effects of these forbidden things will aid you greatly in your climb to success, to say nothing of the spiritual effect it will have on you in your goal for eternal life. The breaking of the Word of Wisdom weakens one and often leads to other serious transgressions.<br><br>I'd like to tell you of a man that I knew well when I was in the government. He was head of one of the largest drilling companies in Canada. He began social drinking and continued until his friends were telling him he was an alcoholic and encouraging him to leave it alone. I was talking to him one day (I knew him well) after he had greater control of himself. He said, "I wouldn't believe that I was an alcoholic until I found myself in the gutter. And then I went to Alcoholics Anonymous."<br><br>I said, "Would you come and talk to my M-Men and Gleaner group?"<br><br>He said, "I'll be glad to tell anybody if I can help them."<br><br>As he talked to them, he told them how he had become an alcoholic, and then he said, "No man, no matter how well-to-do he is, can afford to take the first drink of alcohol." He was fortunate in that Alcoholics Anonymous made it possible for him to cure himself.<br><br>I want to read something here that I read in the paper the other day. I think you all know Gifford Nielsen and are aware that he is making news in papers across the country. I was interested in reading a story about him which appeared in a New York paper. It gave a description of him, told of his record in football, quoted some things that he had said, and then concluded with this comment:<br><br><i>Another advantage Nielsen feels he has is his religion. A Mormon in the strictest sense, Nielsen doesn't smoke or swear or drink alcoholic beverages, coffee, or tea.</i><br><br><i>"We call it 'The Word of Wisdom,'" he said. "When you play at BYU, whether you're a Mormon or non-Mormon, you have to sign your name to a list of guidelines to live by. I thoroughly stand by this, because otherwise you're hurting your body. There's no place for that in athletics."</i><br><br>That's the kind of courageous stand that everyone of us should take. It has been published in papers all over the country. He has brought credit to himself and to his University.<br><h2><b>Moral Cleanliness</b></h2><br>Also, let me remind you to keep yourselves morally clean. Ancient and modern prophets and our present President, Spencer W. Kimball, have reminded us over and over again of the importance of virtue and chastity. You know all of the reasons why you should refrain from any immoral or impure practices. Keep yourselves worthy--young men, to hold the priesthood and go on missions--and, all of you, to enjoy the blessings of the temple: a temple marriage for time and all eternity, with your children sealed to you as an eternal family unit. Why jeopardize these great blessings? Prepare to be worthy parents so that you can raise worthy children, who will be able to follow your good example. Make up your minds while you are here what you will do and what you will not do.<br><br>I'd like to give you an experience I had some years ago when I was president of the branch in Edmonton. A couple called me early one Sunday morning and said, "We must see you, President Tanner." The boy had wanted to go on a mission, and they had planned to be married in the temple on his return. They had been planning and thinking about it for some time.<br><br>They came with tears in their eyes and sorrow in their hearts, and they told me of the experience they had had Saturday night. The girl said: "I received a letter from my father just last week. He said he was worried about me, reminded me who I am, and told me to guard my virtue. But we didn't think this temptation would ever overcome us." Then she added, "See what I have done to myself, my parents, and my family."<br><br>The young man said: "And I am responsible, and not worthy now to go on a mission."<br><br>This example should help us to understand and appreciate how important it is that we keep ourselves morally clean.<br><h2><b>Honesty</b></h2><br>Next, be<i>honest</i>in all you do. Be dependable in every way. Keep your name unsullied so that your posterity can point to you with pride for the heritage you have left to them. Worldly riches are not nearly so important as the value of a good name.<br><br>I remember so well when I wanted to go to normal school to prepare myself to be a schoolteacher. We were poor people. Father said, "We really need you here on the farm, and I can't possibly pay for your schooling. But if you can borrow the money, you may go, and we'll try to get along."<br><br>I went down to the bank, met with the manager, and told him why I had come. I wanted to borrow money to go to normal school. He said, "Oh, are you so-and-so Tanner's boy?"<br><br>I said, "No, I'm not. I'm N. W. Tanner's boy."<br><br>"N. W. Tanner's boy?"<br><br>"Yes, sir."<br><br>"How much money would you need?" I told him.<br><br>He said, "When can you start paying it back?"<br><br>I said, "As soon as I start teaching and receive my wages."<br><br>He said, "If you're N. W. Tanner's boy, you may have the money and pay it back as you said you would."<br><br>I thought then what a tremendous thing it was for me to be the son of a man whose name was such that the bank manager would let me have the money with no security other than that name. I suppose he knew dad would pay it back if I didn't, though he didn't sign the note with me. I made up my mind then that I would so live that if my family needed my assistance my name would not be a deterrent to them in any way, but I hoped it would be helpful.<br><br>Do not be as the hypocrites whom Christ chastised so severely. Live what you profess and preach and lead others to believe you are. Be a good friend and neighbor. Be tolerant and kind, and give the best service you can to your fellowmen. In short, keep the commandments.<br><br>We have been talking about the progress that has been made in the last ten years and how we can succeed in life. As it is near the end of the year, it is a good time to take stock and ask ourselves a few questions.<br><br>Think back for just ten years and see where you were, how old you were, what you had in mind, and the progress you have made. Then take this year alone. It would be well to ask yourself these questions:<br><br>Have I accomplished all that I intended to do in 1976? If not, what progress have I made? What have I done that has hindered me? Am I happy with the progress I have made? Is the Lord happy with the way I live and the things I have done and am doing? Where do I want to be ten years from now, or one year from now? Have I set my goals firmly? Am I determined to reach them? Is what I am doing now preparing me for those goals? Am I determined to repent where necessary? The Lord has said:<br><br><i>Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more.</i><br><br><i>By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins--behold, he will confess them and forsake them.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 58:42­ndash;43]<br><br>Before sitting down I should like to bear my testimony to you, referring back to these two statements: "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you." "[Be] not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth."<br><br>I know, as I know I stand before you young people tonight, that God is a living God, that Jesus Christ is his Son in the flesh. We had a premortal existence, and Christ came and gave his life for you and me that we might enjoy immortality and, by living the gospel, enjoy eternal life. The gospel has been restored in these latter days by God the Father himself and Jesus Christ appearing to that boy Joseph Smith, so that Christ's church could be established here upon the earth. Jesus Christ directs the affairs of this Church today.<br><br>It has been a great privilege for me to be so closely associated with four Presidents of the Church and to counsel with them, sit at their feet, and see and know that the Lord directs his work through them. We have his prophet, Spencer W. Kimball, on earth with us today. Follow him and you cannot go astray. Remember who you are and act accordingly always, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>N.

<h1>for the Occasion: Put on Your Spiritual Clothes - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
What a wonderful sight you are, my beloved young brothers and sisters. It was just last week I saw about this many assembled in a department store where I was trying to get a Christmas present gift wrapped.<br><br>I'm thrilled to be here. I hope without offending I can say in all sincerity you're a very favorite audience of mine. I feel of your spirit, I can identify with your greatness, and I'm always pleased to be included here.<br><br>On behalf of the Church, the Board of Education, the Board of Trustees, Latter-day Saints everywhere, I would like to congratulate this marvelous football team on their accomplishments this year. To you, Coach Tuckett, Coach Edwards, all of the coaches, players--we congratulate you. I have an opportunity, as one of your representatives, to meet with many non-Latter-day Saints throughout the world. Even while this team was finalizing many of its accomplishments, I was in Europe, and your fame had preceded you. What a thrill it is for one in my station to be able to identify with a school that, while it has a great football reputation, stands even higher in its moral and spiritual values. So while we honor you, I pay equal honor to this great student body, which is rare and unique indeed. I salute all of you, for it's a great pride to be associated with you.<br><h2><b>The Spirit of Christmas</b></h2><br>Now, I appreciate the spirit of Christmas in the air. I'm a little boy at heart. I love the feeling, the goodwill that seems to emanate. I had an interesting experience this last weekend. I had an opportunity to be in a stake conference down in President Kimball's home country in Arizona. One of the things I like to do each Sunday morning before going in with the parents in the general session of conference is to visit in the Junior Sunday School. The children are exciting and refreshing and challenging, as you know. It perks up their spirits to think that the General Authorities know they exist, and I like to involve them where I can. I was doing just that this past Sunday and, knowing that President Kimball had come from their area, I thought I'd try to set the stage by asking some simple questions. I said, "Can any person in this Sunday School this morning tell me what person who is very special to all of us comes from this community?" One little fellow, about four, shot his hand up. I said, "Tell us, young man, who comes from this area that's very special and lives in Salt Lake?" He said, "Santa." Well, I knew where his mind was, and it prompted me at this time to brush up on some interesting comments from other young people--all very real, perhaps not members of our faith, who each year write real letters to Santa Claus. The post office receives thousands of these every year. Here's a little collection of these letters. Think about them now, the refreshment of youth:<br><br><i>Dear Santa Claus, how can you tell who are the good children and who are the bad? Please tell me as quick as you can.</i><br><br><i>Dear Saint Nick, could you send me a snorkel and some flippers? I'm learning to be a deep-sea diver in the bathtub.</i><br><br><i>Dear Santa Claus, I love Christmas because at Christmas there is pretty white snow, and everybody is nice to everybody, even grownups.</i><br><br><i>Hi Santa! Could you leave a nice doll for my sister so she will have something to play with? My mother always makes</i>me<i>play with her.</i><br><br><i>Dear Santa, can you give a pretty present to my teacher, Miss Lewis, and tell her it came from me, Jeffrey? I think it would help a lot.</i><br><br><i>Dear Santa Claus, I think you should leave a big present for my grandma. She knew you when you were a kid.</i><br><br><i>Hello, Santa Claus, I wrote to you last Christmas that I wanted a surprise, and you left me a book. I don't want any more surprises.</i><br><br>Well, they're refreshing, to be sure--honest and sincere at heart.<br><br>I hope, particularly on this date, our minds are remembering another great occasion. Most of you are obviously too tender to recall personally, but historically I'm sure you can identify with December 7, 1941. I was just a little younger than most of you on that fateful Sunday morning, little realizing that that event would involve me personally. Without walking you through all the details, several months later I found myself fulfilling General MacArthur's commission that he would return. I went in two days ahead of him. Several weeks later, near this very date, on the island of Leyte, I learned a great lesson as a young Latter-day Saint in combat. I belonged to the seventy-seventh infantry division. At the time, we were fighting General Yamashita, who was the General MacArthur of the Japanese infantry. Theirs was a crack outfit. We had just taken the Valencia airport and secured it on the island of Leyte, about two days before Christmas 1944. In making preparation for the final assault on a rather large mountain near the airport, we were commissioned to dig in our foxhole at the base of the hill. There were about one thousand of us in our particular garrison. We did not know it at the time, but the enemy, holding the top of the ridge, numbered approximately three thousand. Whenever you take the offensive in combat, just as in football, you need a little greater power. But we didn't have that intelligence at our disposal at the time.<br><br>In that situation my heart and my mind naturally drifted back home. I was a nineteen-year-old boy at the time, and Christmas had always been very special in our home. So I was naturally thinking of mom and dad and my brothers and my girlfriend and what they would be doing on that special occasion. As Christmas Eve approached, a slight drizzly rain set in on the mountainside. It was cold and shivery for those of us who knew better circumstances, but dug in we did. I was even bold enough to keep a family tradition going. A 37 antitank gun was located near my foxhole position, and I hung my stocking on the muzzle and settled in for the night. The rain continued. It turned to bitter cold, high in the mountains. We knew, because of the characteristic of the enemy, that about midnight they would invade our lines. They would often send in suicide squads to weaken our front and then follow with infantry attacks. And so we were preparing for the inevitable. About eleven o'clock that evening, Christmas Eve 1944, out of nowhere on the side of the mountain a young tenor, whom I had never met before and still haven't, from somewhere on our infantry line in a beautiful voice sang a solo: "It came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of old."<br><br>By the time he got to the second verse, one thousand American soldiers had joined him. Why, you would have thought these hard-crusted old infantrymen were the Mormon Tabernacle Choir! He next sang "Hark, the Herald Angels Sing," "O Come, All Ye Faithful," and a great medley of songs that are very dear to us. Then he concluded with "Silent Night, Holy Night." We all joined in chorus with him. I guess, because of the circumstances, I haven't been touched quite like that before or since.<br><br>Twelve o'clock came, and the enemy didn't come. For the first time in my combat experience, they had not acted according to schedule. One o'clock, two o'clock, and all night we sat ready with our weapons. But the enemy still didn't come. The next morning, as Christmas dawn broke, we very carefully came out of our foxholes, gave each other an exchange of greetings, talked about home, girls, the things that mattered most. The day passed. We had an interesting Christmas dinner, as you can in a front-line situation, and then on into Christmas night. Finally, about five minutes to twelve, as Christmas was fading into another day, the first enemy mortar crossed our lines, and World War II had commenced again. But for twenty-four hours I was a personal witness that peace on earth, goodwill toward men, can actually occur when people are touched by a true spirit.<br><h2><b>The Gospel Spreading Throughout the World</b></h2><br>I couldn't help but think, as I watched this marvel unfold before me, if a simple Christmas carol will do that between a Christian and a non-Christian nation, what will the gospel of Jesus Christ do for people everywhere? If only you and I, imbued with that same sweet spirit and testimony, could go forth (as President Kimball has challenged us to do) to touch the hearts and minds of people in all nations. Well, I think we already know what would follow. We're seeing it happen: the greatness of the gospel in transforming the lives of people. I think that's significant, particularly at this time of the year.<br><br>Now, I guess I'm as Santa Claus-oriented as anybody, and I think it's a great tradition, although I hope and pray that it never overshadows the true purpose and meaning of why we celebrate this time of the year. While we know it's not the exact birthdate, it's a date that we've set apart to commemorate the birth, and I think even more particularly the mission, of our Lord and Savior. People everywhere I find, like you, really want to know the gospel. They don't know how to find it occasionally, or they are a little confused sometimes when it is presented. Maybe they don't quite relate to it, but you and I have this tremendous opportunity to share. I see it as a part of your great educational process here, learning sufficiently the gospel along with your other disciplines so that you might, in your own wonderful way, transform people everywhere throughout the world. I give you that challenge again on this occasion.<br><br>Some time ago I wrote a book, and I appreciate that what the world does not need is another book. But I like to write because it forces me to think. (My schoolteachers could tell you that I was not much of a thinker.) I've thought of some of the passing records I made when I was in high school. The greatest passing record I hold was getting<i>out</i>of high school, and I think that still stands. But be as it may, the important thing as we get our education is to keep that spiritual balance so that we might do the things the Lord has basically asked us to do.<br><br>One of the books I have written is on the Osmond family. Now, I'm not here to debate whether you think they're great or not. (I have a personal opinion about it, obviously.) They're tremendous missionaries. I just came back from England, and they're the most popular singing group in all the United Kingdom. They're the most popular in France, they're the most popular in Scandinavia, they're the most popular in the Orient, and they're not too far from the top in the United States. They're opening doors no other Latter-day Saints could through a medium that, while some may have a question or two, is softening and touching many hearts. I thought their true story should be told from a personal point of view, and I wrote the book as a missionary tool.<br><br>This book is having an interesting reaction. Many hundreds of letters from non-Latter-day Saints come to me each month in response to it. Quite a few, of course, are from the teenage level, but surprisingly many of the letters are from those in their mature years, grandmothers and grandfathers who identify with a great family who are doing so much for so many. Would you like to hear a typical letter from an Osmond fan not of this Church? One came from Tokyo the other day. (Keep in mind that the writer, twelve years old, is not a Christian.)<br><br><i>Dear Mr. Dunn:</i><br><br><i>Thank you for writing the book on the Osmonds. They're my favorite people. I understand you're a General Authority for your church and therefore you work with a prophet. I would like to know about prophets. Would you please write me back as quick as you can?</i><br><br>One comes from a young girl in England:<br><br><i>Dear Mr. Dunn:</i><br><br><i>Thank you for writing the book on the Osmonds. They are wonderful people. They've touched my heart very much. I understand in your position that you must know God. I would like to know God, too. Would you write me soon and tell me how I can get to know him?</i><br><br>Oh, I get lots of P.S.'s--particularly from the female audience: "I dreamed last night I married Donny. Do you think you could arrange it?"<br><br>Young people, older people all over the world are seeking what you and I have to give. Now, I often think as I read those letters that hopefully you and I are prepared in our own right, first as parents, next as members and leaders of the Church, to give honestly the answers that people seek. That's one of the great purposes I see in this marvelous University, to prepare us academically, but also spiritually. It's that spiritual realm that concerns us the most, as you well know. I've often wondered what kind of parents these young people have. I could make some guesses. These youth are seeking to know, not knowing where to find.<br><h2><b>Jesus' Parable About Spiritual Preparation</b></h2><br>I couldn't help but think at this Christmastime of a great parable that Jesus taught many years ago. You know, one of the exciting things about religion is that it solves all problems. There isn't a question you have academically, personally, financially, or otherwise but what the Lord has given you an answer through a prophet. The question, I guess, is do you know where to find the answers to your problems? When you do, you resolve the challenges in your life accordingly.<br><br>Jesus was asked a certain question about God many times. It is perhaps one of the greatest single questions asked in the New Testament times, and I'm sure he also answered it while visiting this continent. The question is "What is the kingdom of God like? What is it like to be with God?" Jesus, in Matthew, gave the answer, and it's fitting for this particular audience in time of preparation.<br><br>Let me first set the stage for you. Matthew, of course, is a great teacher. He draws frequently upon the great parables to convey a heavenly principle in an earthly way that the people can understand. A multitude has gathered. The classroom for the Savior, in most cases, was by the seashore, the mountainside, in the village. He was asked, "What is it like to be with God? What is the kingdom of God like?" "And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said, The kingdom of heaven [the dwelling place; in modern venacular, the celestial kingdom] is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son" (Matthew 22:1–2). People in Palestine understood kingdoms, because that's what they were part of. Today, he might have used the words <i>democracy,</i> or <i>governments,</i> or <i>Congress,</i> or <i>president. King</i>they understood. When I was in England, a couple of weeks ago, I found the people there understand royalty, and it's very easy for them to identify with this parable. The king represents the highest authority. The king made a marriage for his son.<br><br>Keep in mind that in the time of Jesus, as it is today, a marriage is perhaps the single greatest event. He's saying to his multitude, "Think of the greatest, most important event that can happen in your life. That's what it's going to be like to be with God in his dwelling place." (I can identify with some of this because I've married off two daughters.) Weddings in those days lasted a little longer than they do today. It wasn't uncommon for them to go three, four, five, six, seven days. Can you imagine standing in a reception line in a tuxedo three days? I can't. My wife couldn't even keep her shoes on for two hours. But the people in Jesus' time went about this in great celebration.<br><br>Could I just confide in you for a minute? I'm a very practical person, or at least I try to be. We sat down with both of our daughters at the time of their marriages, and we talked about cost and image. You know, the things that you're trying to do you do because you want to do right by your children, but not to overdo it. We finally settled on a caterer that would cost dad fifty-two cents per head. As the guests would come through the line, they'd take those dainty little cups, cakes, and juice--at fifty-two cents per head. I think everybody in Salt Lake City got in that line. You know, I think some people just saw the line and got in it to see who was at the end of it. Well, I could handle it for about two hours, but at the end of the third hour I was becoming frantic. You know, I was doing this, "Hello, Tom, Bill, Jim, thanks for coming." Then I was thinking, "There's 52¢, $1.04. . . ." So I can identify with the practical side of a marriage celebration.<br><br>Jesus was saying, "Think of the greatest event that can happen in your life. That's what it's going to be like to be with God." Continuing the parable, Jesus said, "And then the king sent forth his servants to invite the guests." There was no printing press in those days, and so they had to send invitations out by word of mouth.<br><br>Have you noticed the color and variety of announcements we have these days? I got an announcement the other day from one of my former missionaries. He was clever. His announcement had a picture of the couple on one side, and the words inviting you to the reception on the other. The picture showed the bride chasing him around a tree. I knew the elder, and I appreciated that picture, but there was no printing press in Jesus' day. They sent out invitations by word of mouth.<br><br>They were all invited to the great palace, and you can imagine what kind of festive affair it was. "And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment" (Matthew 22:11). In those days, when you went to a festive occasion, particularly a wedding, you got dressed up and you went properly dressed. What the king said to this man, I think, is one of the great, great lines in scripture. Don't tell me the Savior doesn't have a sense of humor. Watch this one: "Friend, How camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment?" (Matthew 22:12). Look, the guy shows up at the palace dressed in his levis. I mean, he's got his Saturday grubs on, and he's standing there in front of royalty. The king says, "Friend, how come you came to my palace, this great reception, in your levis?" (That's not a modern translation. I'm just interpreting it for you.) Now notice the next line. It's terrific. "And the man was speechless." You got the picture? Can you see him standing there without a word, thinking, "Well, you got me there, king"?<br><br>Could I make a modern analogy for you? If I invited you up (this would be great and I'm sure both sides would appreciate it if we could work it out, but I don't know how we could mechanically) to see President Kimball for a special interview, I think you wouldn't need to have me tell you, "Put on a tie or a Sunday dress." I think you'd just do that. You dress up automatically for certain occasions, don't you? But there are some people who might be a little dense, who wouldn't get the message.<br><br>The parable continues, "Then said the king to his servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness" (Matthew 22:13). Boy, what a penalty for wearing levis!<br><br>Well, what does all that mean in plain old Brigham Young University language? The king is our Heavenly Father; wedding guests, you and me coming back into his presence; wedding garment, getting spiritually prepared to meet God. The time of mortality is the place to prepare, which is an eternal gospel principle. Can you imagine if you and I did not prepare, not only academically but spiritually, and we reported back home improperly dressed? Can you get an idea of how you might feel, standing in the presence of God, not being spiritually dressed? I think we'd be speechless. Now that's not a threat; it's a basic law of the gospel.<br><h2><b>Spiritual Preparation Through the Scriptures</b></h2><br>You young people, of all people in the world, know that basically there are only two things you can take with you out of this world. Think about it a minute. (I thought for a long time that I'd take my ball glove, but some teacher told me I couldn't.) There are certain physical possessions I like, but I can't take them. Only two things will I take with me when I depart. You see if I'm not correct. One is my character, which would include in a Mormon setting my intelligence. The other is my personal relationships with my friends and my family. That's it.<br><br>Now let me ask you a very honest question: Why is it you and I spend most of our time accumulating things we can't take, at the expense of the things we can? Why do we do that in this world? That's the problem in the world today. And the Lord is saying to us that the time will come when we will have that opportunity to stand in his presence. Hopefully, we will be spiritually dressed for the occasion.<br><br>Now, as I look at you at Brigham Young University, you're preparing to get dressed for the greatest event that will ever occur in your lives. I thank God every day for great men and women like these, for great leaders who do so much to help us know how to put our spiritual clothes on. I thank God for it. The scriptures, then, become the process of learning how to get dressed. You know what the challenge is from President Kimball to learn the scriptures. All the General Authorities for the last six months have had a challenge to try to teach this more emphatically to members all over the world.<br><br>I ran across a little verse that I think is significant:<br><br><i>Old Brother Higgins built a shelf</i><br><i>For the old family Bible to rest itself,</i><br><i>Lest a sticky finger or a grimy thumb</i><br><i>Might injure the delicate pages some.</i><br><i>He cautioned his children to touch it not,</i><br><i>And it rests there with never a blot,</i><br><i>Though the Higgins tribe were a troublesome lot.</i><br><br><i>His neighbor, Miggins, built a shelf.</i><br><i>"Come, children," he said, "and help yourself."</i><br><i>Now his book is old and ragged and worn,</i><br><i>With some of the choicest pages torn,</i><br><i>Where children have fingered, and thumbed, and read,</i><br><i>But of the Miggins children I've heard it said,</i><br><i>That each carries a Bible in his head.</i><br><br>I would hope and pray, my young brothers and sisters, in this great moment of your life as you obtain knowledge, of the world, that you will place above it all the holy, sacred scriptures and the counsel from prophets that will assist you in becoming better dressed in the Spirit.<br><br>I love you and I sustain you. I bear witness that these things are true. I pray at this Christmas season--as we sing our carols, as we exchange our gifts, as we share mutual admiration, feelings of love and affection--that above all else, you and I with our faith and testimony, like the lonely twenty-year-old soldier on the island of Leyte, will transform the lives of millions. Can you imagine, if one tenor on a battleline could stop a war for twenty-four hours, what twenty-five thousand Latter-day Saints turned loose on a sick world could do with your knowledge and your testimony? Now I challenge you to go do it.<br><br>For heaven's sake, have a little enjoyment when you do it. You know, if I have one personal concern as I travel the Church, it's occasionally when I run into a long-faced Mormon. He worries me. You know, if this Church is really true, and I testify it is, you and I ought to be the happiest people in the world. We ought to just<i>bounce</i>through life, hardly waiting to share it. That's the challenge I give to you.<br><br>Did I ever tell you the counsel my dad gave me? My dad told me one time, "Paul, will you remember that life is a journey, not a camp? And when you grow up, if you're not careful, you're going to be very disappointed because too many Mormons are camping." And then with that clenched fist he said,<i>"You break camp and move now."</i>I've been trying to move ever since because a great father gave me the direction in which I ought to go.<br><br>I challenge you to go into the world. Take your new degrees; take your education and your learning. Make your impact on our society. But more importantly, take your testimony and your faith and your service and your dedication and build a better world, because if you will (and I know you can) there will really come a time when there will be peace on earth, goodwill toward men.<br><br>May the Lord bless you to do that, I pray as I leave my witness that I know God lives and that Jesus is the Christ. I think you know I know that, for if you and I are ever in tune with the Spirit, the Spirit has borne that witness to you. God bless you wonderful University students, whom I love and admire and respect, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Paul H.
