<h1>on and Resolution - Russell M. Nelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The title of my message tonight is "Reflection and Resolution," for indeed this is a time for reflection on activities of the past, and for resolution pertaining to the future. This evening is a real milestone--the first Sabbath day of new semester, of a new year, and of a new decade.<br><br>We are pleased to be accompanied by several members of our family, including my father. We had my father, Marion C. Nelson, seated on the stand. Then he felt a little immodest about doing that, so he preferred to sit by the family. But I'd like my father to stand. I want you to know that in four days we will, as a family, celebrate his ninety-third birthday. We enjoy the blessings of both his reflections and his resolutions.<br><br>Speaking of age, I'll relate a spoof attributed to an elderly person who was not as sharp as my father. This gentleman, who was a bit absentminded, quipped that "old age isn't all bad; your forgetfulness allows you to greet new friends every day, and you can even hide your own Easter eggs."<br><h2><b>When We Were Young</b></h2><br>But tonight we should not speak much of age. You are young, and life's exciting challenges are yet before you. Sister Nelson and I reflect on times when we were young. We met during our university days. Dantzel was a campus queen when I fell in love with her. I proposed to her while we were picking peas in a pea patch. Then and there we made a resolution that temple marriage was a must for us.<br><br>By the time I entered medical school we had become very good friends. Often, after I had spent a morning in the anatomy lab with its pungent aroma of formaldehyde, we ate our sack lunches together on the campus lawn. She always preferred for me to sit downwind from her.<br><br>We were married when she was a senior and I had graduated, but I was being recycled--as a sophomore once again, this time in medical school. We were so young that my father even had to sign my marriage certificate. Early married life on the campus was wonderful. With our limited means, we could only afford to share a can of soup for lunch. We really worked hard. She received her baccalaureate degree at age twenty, and I became a doctor of medicine at twenty-two. I thought I knew so much. My parents thought I knew so little.<br><br>We traveled east for what we thought was to be one year of internship. That year expanded to many years of postdoctoral education, research, and military service. My academic appointments took us to major cities of the central and eastern sectors of the United States as President Taylor has mentioned. In all, more than twelve years elapsed from the time I received my doctor of medicine degree until I was finally able to enter private practice. By then we had six children. But never through that long period of study did Sister Nelson murmur about the lack of material possessions.<br><br>Oh yes, there was one exception. I remember a night in Boston when we were walking down Boylston street. She pressed her nose against the windowpane of a furniture store and asked, "Do you think we will ever be able to afford a lamp?"<br><br>As you've been told, our family grew to include nine daughters and one son. Our son has applied for admission to BYU, well aware of the fact that competition is keen for scarce seats here and that enrollment at BYU is a great privilege available only to a fortunate and steadily diminishing percentage of the youth of the Church.<br><br>To each of you I feel a special debt of gratitude. In my apostolic calling I speak with rulers, magistrates, and ministers of many countries. My assignments in 1989, for example, took me to twenty-one different nations. Wherever I go, BYU has a remarkable reputation, for which I thank you. It is known for good among many nations. Truly, the world is your campus.<br><h2><b>A New Year, a New Decade</b></h2><br>Now, if I had the wish of my heart, I would welcome a private hour with each of you. I would like to hear your own reflections and then listen to your resolutions for this new year and for this new decade. Somehow I don't see you as a vast and faceless congregation. I see you as an assembly of individuals, each one a person with unique talents, hopes, challenges, and a powerful potential beyond even your fondest dreams.<br><br>I would like to share with you a vision of what each of you can become in your own special way. A proverb of warning applies just as much to you as it did to me in the surgical operating room: "Where there is no vision, the people perish" (Proverbs 29:18).<br><br>I would like to provide such vision. So let's follow the pattern of the Lord, who often chose to instruct his disciples on a high mountain. He also took Moses to a mountain to see the scope of the work that was ahead (see Moses 1:1). To another high mountain the Lord later took Peter, James, and John (see Matthew 17:1). There, power and authority, vision and purpose were given to them to qualify them for the work (see also Isaiah 40:9; Ezekiel 40:2).<br><br>I would like to share a similar vision with each of you. Let us imagine that you and I are alone together on a mountaintop.<br><br>William, let's start with you. We reflect first on your accomplishments that have brought you here. I met you initially as a handsome and bright elder on your mission. You rendered such wonderful service. Many people now understand the gospel because of you. Some have even joined the Church. They and their posterity will always hold your name dear to their hearts. Reflections on your mission should always give you a sense of deep satisfaction.<br><br>Now, William, what will your resolutions include as you begin a new semester, a new year, and a new decade? What would you like to be? Have you gone to a quiet, secluded spot to be all alone? Have you found your own "Sacred Grove" equivalent, where you can pour out the secret longings of your soul in prayer to your Father in Heaven? Have you really conversed with God as one man speaks to another? Have you really declared your allegiance to him and your availability to him, without any reservation? Have you said, "Here I am Lord! Use me!"? Have you pleaded with him, and as you did, have you put behind any counterfeit clichés that may have been part of your prayers in the past? Have you cleanly and completely declared your commitment to be a saint, an elder, a righteous disciple through good times and bad? Such a resounding resolution would bring joy to your Heavenly Father.<br><br>Now I see Mary--beautiful Mary. You and your future husband plan to be sealed in the temple. I reflect on days when you were small and so full of fun. Now you are a woman, mature and wise.<br><br>What will you resolve in your heart to be? You will surely help your husband honor his priesthood as you share its blessings together. I already know of your commitment to chastity. It is the powerful protector of virile manhood and the crown of beautiful womanhood. You will continue in your resolve to be clean--to avoid flirtatious or flippant behavior unbecoming a lovely daughter of God.<br><br>You and your companion should resolve never, never to make uncomplimentary comments about one another to anyone at anytime. Good habit patterns are best established during your courtship. Never stoop to demeaning words that hurt. Together, resolve now to make of your home a place of prayer. Make it a sanctuary of faith where servants of the Lord are always welcome and where scriptures are read and discussed together. You will both want to grow in true spiritual symmetry.<br><br>Remember, Mary, your partner's feelings about paying tithing will be in a large measure shaped by your attitude. Words of encouragement from you will help him feel confident in his commitment to tithe, especially during your early years together when pocketbooks are so thin. Plan to introduce yourselves to your new bishop with resolution to help build the kingdom in the fraction of the frontier where you are called upon to live.<br><br>Calls in the Church are not only opportunities to help others, but they will bless your lives, too. The Lord said, "Thy duty is unto the church forever, and this because of thy family" (D&amp;amp;C 23:3). Now is the time to make that resolution to continue to serve the Lord. God bless you, Mary and your partner, and may you always remain best friends.<br><br>Next I would like to visit with Natasha. Your last name is usually mispronounced because of its roots in eastern Europe. Think of what has happened in that part of the world during the historic year of 1989. Surely your reflections include gratitude for recent events, not only in your country but in neighboring nations as well.<br><br>In 1989 ground was broken for a new Latter-day Saint chapel in Warsaw, Poland. The foundation is now in place. Throughout Poland our missionaries are doing well.<br><br>During 1989 our missionaries entered the German Democratic Republic. Hundreds of grateful converts of the Church have since been baptized. New chapels are bulging with faithful Saints who have made covenants to come unto Christ. Also in 1989, native sons from the German Democratic Republic entered the mission field to serve in England, Canada, Argentina, Chile, and the United States of America. The holy temple in the German Democratic Republic, dedicated in 1985, has become a beacon of faith, blessing that country and its neighboring nations.<br><br>In Hungary, the first LDS chapel was dedicated less than three months ago. There, too, missionaries have been remarkably successful.<br><br>In calendar year 1989, the following countries have abolished constitutional guarantee of communist supremacy and have legalized a multiparty system with free elections: Lithuania (one of fifteen Soviet Republics), Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, Bulgaria, and Romania. Freedom to vote is closely related to freedom of worship. Both will be doubly welcomed by people who have waited so long. The year 1989 was one of enabling. The year of 1990 will be one of implementing.<br><br>Apostolic blessings and dedicatory prayers were offered in many other countries--all evidences of the growth of the Church, not only in your area but in other parts of the world as well. The year 1989 was truly remarkable.<br><br>Church membership has just passed the seven million mark. Conservative projections indicate that by the year 2000, the Church will have doubled in size. Its membership will then number at least fourteen million. While we now have 1,730 stakes, by the end of the decade there will be more than 3,600 stakes and many more temples. We will be precisely on course in fulfillment of scriptural prophecy that this work will eventually and literally fill the earth (see D&amp;amp;C 65:2).<br><br>Can you possibly imagine what could happen in ten more years like this last one? The next decade could have Pentecostal potential. Truly the hand of the Lord is apparent. He said, "I will hasten my work" (D&amp;amp;C 88:73), and that time of hastening is upon us.<br><br>In light of these reflections, Natasha, what will be your New Year's resolutions? Keep your eye on this big picture. But while you survey large fields, cultivate small ones. Prepare to serve. Take full advantage of your opportunity for an education; it will be invaluable to you. I don't think it matters much whether you study to become a librarian, a lawyer, or a musician. Complete the course you have begun, and then God can use you to bless people with the fruits of your education.<br><br>Next, I would like to visit with Peter. As a relatively recent convert to the Church, you are so happy with the truths of the gospel that have expanded your mind. As you reflect on your past, Peter, remember that before you found the Church, you had many doubts. But your confusion departed when you discovered the fulness of the gospel. Ignorance was replaced by information, and then by conviction. Next came repentance. You became converted--changed--never to return to the ways of the spiritual skeptic who is devoid of faith.<br><br>Your choice of a career is yet a bit uncertain. That can be frustrating at times. But much more important than what you do is what you are. To be your best, will you quietly and personally resolve to remain a believer? Will you continue to nurture your faith in God? Keep your faith strong enough to defend attacks upon your religious conversion? Beware! Wherever you go, there will be clever destroyers of faith, many even masquerading as fellow believers.<br><br>Your love for research is a great gift. Cultivate it. As you continue your advanced studies in this university, and perhaps elsewhere, resolve now, Peter, to know what you will do when confronted with ideas contrary to established doctrines of the Lord. Resolve now how you will react to those who stir up contention and contest the teachings of the prophets. Prepare now for the possibility that people of prominent status will deny their own Creator. Their skeptical teachings try to diminish the divinity of the mission of the Savior and even try to nullify the doctrine of the Atonement.<br><br>Resolve now to be steadfast. Be like Nephi of old, who did "liken all scriptures unto [himself]" (1 Nephi 19:23). Resolve now never to compartmentalize your faith. Faith is not to be separated from your works but is to be an integral part of your works.<br><br>May I share with you some reflections of my own? Years ago, in my research career in a scientific discipline I helped to develop, I found success by applying truths gleaned from the scriptures. Let me explain.<br><br>When I first started medical school, we were taught that one must not touch the heart, for if one did, it would stop beating. But later I pondered the scripture that tells us that "all kingdoms have a law given; . . . and unto every kingdom is given a law; and unto every law there are certain bounds also and conditions" (D&amp;amp;C 88:36, 38). I also pondered the scripture that certifies "when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated" (D&amp;amp;C 130:21).<br><br>With these scriptures in mind, I concentrated on the "kingdom" of and the blessings of the beating heart. I knew that the function of even this vital organ was predicated upon law. I reasoned that if laws applicable could be understood and controlled, perhaps they could be harnessed ultimately for the healing of the sick.<br><br>To me, this meant that if we worked, studied, and asked the proper questions in our scientific experiments, we would be blessed to learn the laws that govern the beating of the heart.<br><br>In 1949 our team of researchers presented at the American College of Surgeons the report of the first successful use of an artificial heart-lung machine. It had sustained the life of an animal for thirty minutes without the animal's own heart powering its circulation.<br><br>In the decade of the 1950s, successes in the laboratory with animals were extended to human beings. Today, many of those laws governing the heart have been learned. As a result, delicate repairs are performed on damaged valves and vessels. The heartbeat can be temporarily turned off and then turned on again--provided the laws are obeyed upon which that blessing is predicated. Hundreds of thousands of open-heart operations are now performed throughout the world every year, thereby extending life for many. But you should know that it was through understanding gained from study of the scriptures, and "likening" them to this area of my interest, that I was able to make the advances I did in the field of heart surgery. But more about that later.<br><br>Bless you, Peter, in your desire for excellence in scientific research. Liken the scriptures to the kingdoms that pertain to your own studies. Quietly effect a warm fusion of your faith with your scholarship. Then you will have power, even the power of God, which will bless you and enlighten your way.<br><br>In the next concourse I see Dorothy. And I think I can see Dave seated beside her. You don't have plans for marriage at the moment. That day seems far, far in the future. Meanwhile, your reflections contain a mixture of both sweet and sour memories. Sweet are the happy times of your youth, but sour are the deeds of "friends" who weren't really friends after all. Some placed sordid temptations before you for which you were ill-prepared at the time. Tonight, on the milestone of this Sabbath evening, what will each of you resolve to be? Now is the time to shape your behavior to your hopes. It is not always easy. I can empathize with you.<br><br>Years ago, while I served as a young intern in a large medical center, I attended a Christmas party. The host was the chief of surgery. I had made a major commitment to work for and be loyal to him and his world-famous institution, which had produced many of the great surgeons, scholars, and researchers of our generation. At the party, the chief's head resident offered alcoholic beverages to Sister Nelson and me. Of course, we politely declined.<br><br>Minutes later he returned with a more persuasive pitch: "Take a drink," he said, "or the chief will be offended." Again we declined. Our refusal infuriated the head resident. Red-faced and indignant, he said, "Nelson, you take this drink or I'll make life around here mighty miserable for you!"<br><br>I simply replied, "You do what you must, doctor, but I will do what I must."<br><br>I fulfilled my promise, and he fulfilled his.<br><br>He saw to it that I had no vacation that year. His responsibility to prepare the schedule of assignments and on-call duty bore the stamp of his vitriolic vengeance against me. But now, as I reflect on this matter some forty years later, I would not trade places with him today, or ever.<br><br>Dorothy--and you too, Dave--remember that decisions are best made before the time of testing, whether those resolutions concern forsaking drugs, alcohol, and other addicting substances, or pornography, which can become an addiction of the mind. Resist any temptations of lust disguised as love. Instead of vice, let virtue garnish your thoughts. To all the Dorothys and Daves here, I urge you to choose companions well and cherish those friends who lift you and make you better in their presence. And be such friends to one another.<br><br>In the next section I see Richard. Reflect upon your parents. They sacrificed much so you could be here. I met them both in a stake conference a long distance away. A little unrealistically but very hopefully they said, "When you go to BYU, look for our son, Richard. We are so proud of him." So Richard, I bring regards from your parents.<br><br>What will you resolve to be? If I can read your thoughts correctly, you are committed to strive for personal righteousness. That is a wonderful goal. But it is a little more difficult to measure than a goal to shed ten pounds of unwanted weight, or to run or to swim a measured distance. Come with me to the high mountain, and I'll suggest some ways in which you can measure your progress toward personal righteousness.<br><br>To begin, ask yourself, "What do I think of when I partake of the sacrament? Do I really concentrate on the atonement of Jesus Christ? Do I comprehend the magnitude of his sacrifice and the magnificence of my future as I take upon myself the name of Jesus Christ and resolve to keep his commandments? As his witness, do I worthily partake of the broken bread in remembrance of his broken body? Do I worthily partake of the water, blessed and sanctified to the souls of all those who drink of it, in remembrance of his blood shed for us?<br><br>You can recognize progress each week as you thoughtfully, regularly, and worthily partake of the sacrament.<br><br>Here's another spiritual yardstick: How do you feel about the Sabbath day? I'll share some of my personal reflections with you. When I was your age, I wondered just what activities were appropriate for the Sabbath. I read lists of do's and don'ts, all compiled by others. But now I have a much better understanding, which I gained from two Old Testament scriptures. One is from the book of Exodus:<br><br><i>The Lord spake unto Moses, saying,</i><br><br>. . .<i>my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you.</i>[Exodus 31:12–13]<br><br>A similar message is in the book of Ezekiel:<br><br><i>I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them.</i>. . .<br><br><i>I am the Lord your God;</i>. . .<br><br>. . .<i>hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the Lord your God.</i>[Ezekiel 20:12, 19–20]<br><br>Pondering these scriptures has helped me to understand. My behavior on the Sabbath constitutes my sign to the Lord of my regard for him and for my covenants with him. If, on the one hand, my interests on the Sabbath day are turned to activities such as pro football games or worldly movies, the sign from me to him would clearly be that my devotions do not favor him. If, on the other hand, my Sabbath interests are focused on the Lord and his teachings, on the family, or on folks who are sick or poor or needy, that sign would likewise be evident to God. I have concluded that our activities on the Sabbath will be appropriate when we honestly consider them to be our personal sign of our commitment to the Lord.<br><br>Next, Richard, prepare to do work of real worth for your fellowmen. This is one of the fundamental reasons for enrollment at this institution of higher learning. The critical difference between your just hoping for good things for mankind and your being able to do good things for mankind is education.<br><br>I'll share another personal reflection. Many years ago when I was a young intern, we had a wonderful neighbor lady named Netta Davis. She had a serious heart condition--a diseased mitral valve--destroyed in her youth by the ravages of rheumatic fever. Her husband, Don, was a fellow physician. Because he and I were usually at the hospital, Netta and my sweetheart, Dantzel, became very close friends. Sadly, as the years went by, Netta's strength ebbed. Her congestive heart failure worsened. Her little body finally died because of this malfunctioning valve.<br><br>This was long before the advent of surgical repairs within the heart. Such was hardly dreamed of in those days. But Netta's passing changed my life. I determined that her death was not to have been in vain.<br><br>Then I joined forces with a small team of researchers at a well-known university. Together we embarked on a project to develop an artificial heart-lung machine, as I mentioned earlier. The ultimate purpose of this effort was to allow repairs to be made within the empty heart while the circulation of the patient's blood was temporarily maintained by the apparatus we were developing.<br><br>To make connectors for tubing, I learned quite a bit about glassblowing. And I learned how to operate lathes, drill presses, and other machines required to make pumps, valves, and cylinders. With my associates, I also had to learn the physiological requirements for oxygenation of the blood and the requirements for blood flow to and oxygen consumption of the tissues. We had to learn how to anticoagulate the blood and then reverse the anticoagulation so normal clotting could again be restored. And we learned the hard way that bacterial contamination could destroy an otherwise successful experiment. Incidentally, the conquering of that problem was the project for my Ph.D. thesis.<br><br>Long years elapsed before we were able to graduate from the laboratory to practical application in the operating room of a hospital. But finally it happened in 1951. The human heart could be opened. In the years that followed, thanks also to research in laboratories and clinics at many other universities, defective valves and other components could be repaired. The pioneering road was long and rugged. More than eight years elapsed from the time I received my doctor of medicine degree before I performed the first successful open-heart operation in Utah in 1955.<br><br>Netta Davis did not die in vain. Her desperate need motivated me as nothing else could. I thought of her the day I operated upon the heart of President Spencer W. Kimball. In a real sense, it was partially because of Netta that I was able to perform that operation President Kimball needed.<br><br>So, Richard, maintain your motivation and perseverance to do work of worth. It will be a measure of your individual righteousness. No matter what your career may be, the long hours of sacrifice and effort required to achieve excellence are really worth it.<br><br>Meanwhile, in your quest for personal righteousness, go periodically to the mountain of the Lord's house--his holy temple. There, learn of him. Covenant with him. There and wherever you are, pray to our Heavenly Father in the name of his Son. Merge your faith with your scholarship to give a spiritual depth of focus to all of your righteous desires. Richard, if you will do these things, you will develop an "eye single to the glory of God" (D&amp;amp;C 4:5). Then you will really have 20/20 vision!<br><br>As we all contemplate resolutions for a new year, let us reflect on such a special behavioral blueprint given by revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith during the Christmas-New Year holiday season of 1832–33.<br><br>These verses from section 88 are worthy resolutions equally applicable in our day for this new year and for the next decade. The Lord said:<br><br><i>Cease from all your light speeches, . . . from all your lustful desires, from all your pride and light-mindedness, and from all your wicked doings.</i>. . .<br><br><i>See that ye love one another; cease to be covetous; learn to impart one to another as the gospel requires.</i><br><br><i>Cease to be idle; cease to be unclean; cease to find fault one with another; cease to sleep longer than is needful; retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated.</i><br><br><i>And above all things, clothe yourselves with the bond of charity, as with a mantle, which is the bond of perfectness and peace.</i><br><br><i>Pray always, that ye may not faint, until I come. Behold, and lo, I will come . . . and receive you unto myself.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:121, 123–126]<br><br>Upon each of you, my beloved brothers, sisters, and fellow students, I would like to invoke a blessing as you commence this new decade of your lives. Learn from your personal reflections. Let them help you understand who you are, from where you have come, and what God expects you to be. Let your resolutions strengthen your future. Cherish the privilege of education in this institution. Feast on the words of Christ. Apply his teachings in your lives. Then you will achieve your greatest potential for good. You have been reserved for this time and place in order that the nations of the earth shall be blessed through your efforts.<br><br>I testify to you that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that this is his Church, that Joseph Smith was and is a prophet of God, that each succeeding prophet has been a chosen instrument in the hands of the Lord for preparing his people for his second coming. Of this I testify, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Russell M.

<h1>uty in the Storm: Cancer, Trials, Prayer, &amp; Love - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<b>Janet</b>: We welcome you back to a new semester and a new year. For us, as for many of you, last semester was a first time BYU experience. And we really loved it. Over the years, Rex and I have shared many things, but since his training is in law and mine in education, we have never shared a job. Now, for the first time, we are even sharing that, and it has been one of many unanticipated joys that we have experienced over the last six months.<br><br><b>Rex</b>: It reminds me of something I think Willie Mays said right after he started playing professional baseball: "I can't believe they pay me for doing something that's so much fun." Maybe I shouldn't describe a job that is so demanding as fun, and in some respects it isn't, but on balance I agree with Janet; I've never done anything that I have enjoyed more.<br><br><b>Janet:</b>Today we want to tell you a story. In a very real sense, it is a love story--our love story. We want to discuss with you some of the things that we learned, together, from the most trying and unpleasant experience that either of us has ever had, our experience with cancer. Rex made a brief allusion to it in his devotional talk last fall, and several news commentators have reported on some aspects of that experience. But we have never publicly given our own account of what happened and what we learned during that time. Some aspects of it are not easy for us to talk about. But we have decided that we want to tell that story. We want to do it only once, and you are the right audience. We really do feel a close identification with you. To be sure, we do not know each of you personally, but we have felt the warmth of your spirit and your sustaining influence and interest as we have taken on our new responsibilities.<br><br><b>Rex</b>: We recognize we are not the only ones who have suffered adversity. Many of you, though much younger, have already endured trials at least as great, and in some cases greater, than the one we went through two years ago. But there are lessons we can learn from adversity, and we can all learn by sharing these lessons with each other.<br><br><b>Janet:</b>The spring of 1987 was probably the happiest and certainly the most prosperous time of our marriage. We had moved back to Provo from Washington, D.C. Rex loved his work, both teaching at the law school and arguing Supreme Court cases. My life was easier and more pleasant than it had been in years. All seven of our children were doing well and living in Provo. We had our daughter's wedding in April and were looking forward to our son's marriage in June.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>On May 18 I wrote in my journal, "Life is interesting, enjoyable, and busy. I cannot imagine any combination of activities and circumstances that could make me as happy right now as I am with the combination I have. I love living in Provo, being a bishop, being on the BYU law faculty, being a Sidley &amp;amp; Austin partner who does mostly Supreme Court work, and married to Janet with whom I have seven wonderful children. This isn't just a Pollyanna statement. Life could not be better."<br><br><b>Janet:</b>My journal entry at about the same time was: "Washington was wonderful, but it's great to be back in Provo. Our lives have never been busier, but also never happier. A day never goes by without realizing how very blessed we are. Life is as close to perfection as it can get in this life. It makes me uneasy. I feel there must be a challenge ahead. I know the cycle well. Each time our lives become too easy, it is time to grow again."<br><br><b>Rex:</b>And then came the rapid-fire events of the morning of Monday, June 22. For several weeks I'd had a pain in my back, which over the weekend had become unbearable. My friend, jogging partner, and personal physician, Lyman Moody, wanted to run some tests at the hospital, which had to be done very early in the morning because by 10 a.m. we had to leave for our son's wedding reception in Boise. An X ray was followed by a CAT scan, and as I came out of that, I heard Lyman say to another doctor over the phone: "Then they are definitely destructive lesions."<br><br>Destructive lesions? I'd never heard that phrase before, but my friend confirmed my worst suspicions: I had cancer.<br><br><b>Janet:</b>I was just hanging up the telephone when Rex opened the door, calling my name. "Do you know?" he asked. Holding back tears, I whispered yes. Although his pain was severe, Rex spent the next several hours writing a legal brief and making financial calculations for the survival of his young family without him while I drove silently to Boise in my own world of pain. Both of us thought we were spending our last summer together.<br><br>In my journal, I described the rest of that week--after we returned from Boise--as follows: "The past several days have been a blur--tests and more tests, each confirming the diagnosis: Cancer! Lymphoma! T-cell immunoblastic lymphoma, in the final stage! All such ugly, terrible, ruthless words. I wish we could run away, but where can we run? There is no way to run away from truth--from the awful facts. In a few short days, my beautiful, wonderful life has been shattered, and I am terrified!"<br><br>It was also during that week that we made the very difficult decision about where to take the treatments. Thanks to some unsolicited efforts by one of Rex's law partners, we found that he was entitled to full, all-expense-paid treatment at one of the nation's premier cancer treatment centers' the National Cancer Institute, which is part of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, just outside Washington, D.C. It was not an easy decision. We had the highest confidence in our local doctors, and it would have been easier to stay here in our own home with our own family. But Washington was also our home--we had moved from there only ten months earlier.<br><br>The irony was that though I had spent seven years in government service, it was not that service that entitled me to free treatment at NIH, but rather the fact that I had one of the kinds of cancer that NIH was studying at the time. So, it's not whom you know but what kind of cancer you have.<br><br>For exactly four months, July through October 1987, my twenty-four-hour-a-day home was the NIH hospital, where I underwent the most intense dosages of chemotherapy and radiation that in the opinion of my doctors my body could absorb and still survive. My principal physician, Dr. Richard Rosenberg, told me that what they were doing was bringing my body just as close to death as they could without pushing me over the line. And then they hoped I would be able to make it back.<br><br>In short, those were not recreational drugs they were giving me, and I've never been so sick or so debilitated in my whole life. But even in those four months some things happened that were among the most memorable and most pleasing of our lives.<br><br><b>Janet:</b>Among them was the realization of what dear friends we have, how much they mean to us, and how much they truly care for us. For example, special fasts were held in the wards of some of our college friends, many of whom resided thousands of miles away. The entire stake where Rex grew up in Arizona had a daylong fast, as did our home stake in Provo. Our ward had several. The mother of a longtime colleague at the Department of Justice persuaded her Protestant congregation to do the same. Rex's mother, brothers, aunts, uncles, countless cousins, and our own children submitted to blood tests in an effort to find a possible donor for a bone marrow transplant. Rex wanted very much to remain a bishop; this was made possible because of extra-mile efforts by his two counselors. Both our stake president and Rex's father gave him blessings, assuring him without qualification that his time had not come, that the Lord had other things for him to do in this life.<br><br>Our Utah and Virginia friends helped with our children, giving untold hours of loving service. Hundreds of cards and letters were sent, wishing us well and expressing love and cheer. The sisters in our Provo ward made a beautiful quilt bearing the names of all the families in our ward. It is displayed in our home and will always be cherished for its excellence in workmanship and its symbol of love.<br><br>Several very helpful insights were contained in letters we received. My sister Lois encouraged me to find beauty in the storm. She reminded me of a time as children when we feared the dark clouds, explosive thunder, and rain slamming against our windows. As the storm passed, however, a contrasting cleansing calm settled and the sun shown again, now clearer and brighter than before. The next time the storm clouds gathered, we were not afraid. "Remember, dear sister," she said, "the storm exposes some surprise jewels of insight and compassion for others as well as individualized lessons borne of sacrifice rendered all the dearer. Find beauty in your storm." That metaphor seemed to summarize our whole experience and helped me find something beautiful within my darkest days.<br><br>Our good friend Larry Wimmer, who had recently gone through a similar experience with his wife Louise, sent us a piece he had written entitled "When Someone You Love Has Cancer." This thought from his essay seemed especially pertinent: "Commonly, it is believed that there are winners and losers in the battle against cancer. Louise eventually died of her disease, but she did not lose. In life and in death, Louise was a winner who taught us how to live, how to suffer if that be our lot, and eventually how to die."<br><br>But the most focused and the most heartwarming of all the efforts came from our immediate family. Remember that while we were in Bethesda, the children were in Provo, and four were still living at home. The three married couples helped with the younger ones. When school started, our youngest came back to live with me, and one of our newly married couples moved into our home, taking over everything from laundry to parent-teacher conferences while carrying full schedules at BYU. Each child did his or her part as they pulled together to make life work.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>One day in August, our home teacher in Provo called and asked how long we would be in Bethesda. I told him it certainly would be several months and might be as long as Christmas. He said something to the effect that that was too long to be without our children. The next thing we knew he had arranged to fly all seven of them back to see us. His plane and pilot waited in Washington for several days while the children visited with us. For those of you who are trying to think of something nice to do for your home teaching families, you might keep that one in mind.<br><br><b>Janet:</b>One of the most touching personal incidents involved one of the nurses, Juildene Ford. Probably the most serious continuous threat was infection because the chemotherapy almost destroyed Rex's immune system, which was already dangerously low long before he had cancer. I called the hospital once in the early morning hours when I knew he had been running a fever that the antibiotics had not been able to control. Ms. Ford responded: "He's going to be okay now. Let me tell you what happened. During the night when his fever continued to climb, I went into the nurse's station and prayed, 'Lord, this is a good man. Let him live.' After only about twenty minutes I went back in his room to take his vital signs. His fever had begun its decline, and now it is almost normal." I could barely pronounce a choked-up thank you. I hung up the phone and cried with relief.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>I have often wondered if Ms. Ford--for whom I developed a great fondness--saved my life that night. Probably no more so than the hundreds of others in LDS or other congregations across the country who were praying for me. But my doctors--who may or may not have had any religious convictions--were as convinced as I am that those kinds of things really do make a difference. Their explanation was different from the one you or I would have given, but the result was the same.<br><br><b>Janet:</b>There was one particularly pointed illustration of that fact. In November, after Rex had left the hospital but was still spending most of each day there as an outpatient, one of the greatest concerns was his extremely low platelet count, which endured for weeks. One Sunday Rex asked permission to go to church, a luxury he had not experienced for months. Dr. Rosenberg granted permission on the condition that he have a blood test first and then call from the chapel two hours later when the results were in to determine if he would have to return to the hospital for a platelet transfusion. Rex made the call and learned that his platelet count had more than tripled. The next Sunday when Rex was given permission to leave for a while and asked for instructions, Dr. Rosenberg said, "I have only one: Go to church."<br><br><b>Rex:</b>We learned so many things during those months and also during the more than two years that have intervened. You probably won't want to consider cancer, chemotherapy, and radiation as a kind of academic steroid. But in my case, at least, they enhanced my capacity to gain knowledge. In the time remaining, we would like to tell you of just three of the many things we learned.<br><br>First, one of the enduring questions coming out of this experience has been, and continues to be, why me? Actually, included within that simple little two-word question are two subparts. The first is, Why was I the one who got cancer? That one, interestingly enough, was never one I asked myself. But many of my friends did ask it, some of them with a tinge of resentment, and some with more than just a tinge. The second subpart of the "why me" question is, Why did I survive, when others, every bit as worthy, every bit as needed by their families, and for whom just as many family and friends prayed just as fervently, are not alive today? That second question is the one that I asked.<br><br><b>Janet:</b>With regard to the first question, Why did Rex get cancer, we found our friends' comments were based on two quite opposite premises. The first, and probably the more common, was that bad things--or at least really terrible things like cancer--just shouldn't happen to good people. That is a notion that has very ancient roots.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>Consider Job. His friends had basically the same notion as our friends had, except they were more blunt and less charitable in the way they expressed it. In their view, his terrible illnesses were a manifestation of his wickedness. Some of our friends were more charitable toward me, but the premise was the same. Similarly, the Savior was asked, concerning a blind man, "Who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?" (John 9:2).<br><br>I received a card from a longtime friend at the Justice Department with whom I have carried on a longstanding and good-natured banter about the net value of my Mormon lifestyle. His card contained a six-word variation on this basic theme that some have held from Job's day to ours. His card said, "Well, so much for clean living."<br><br><b>Janet:</b>The other assumption, made by another group of friends, was quite the opposite from the first. In their view, Rex's cancer was due to his righteousness, rather than the lack thereof. He was being tested because he was so valiant.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>It reminded me of Elder Dallin Oaks' story about the man who was being ridden out of town on a rail and commented that if it weren't for the honor of the thing, he would just as soon walk.<br><br>For me, the answer to the first aspect of this "why me" question seems fairly clear. I got cancer not because I was particularly wicked or because I was particularly righteous. The Savior himself made that clear in his answer to the question about the blind man. The Savior explained, "Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him" (John 9:3). We believe that what this and other scriptures teach is that the plan under which we are here necessarily assumes that we are on our own as to many matters, and one of those is susceptibility to serious illness or other disasters. If our Heavenly Father intervened to spare the really good ones from those kinds of experiences, much of the effect of this life's developmental and testing process would be blunted. If it were readily and objectively determinable that living a certain kind of life--either good or evil--in effect immunized a person from many of life's crises, it would be much easier to persuade people to live such a life. As it is, the case must be made exclusively on the merits of living a good life.<br><br>What about the second question, not the one my friends asked but the one that I asked myself: Why didn't I die two years ago? Here again, my friends--this time by the trainload--have been willing to supply the answer. My life was preserved, they say, because there were important things for me to do here, specifically, to fill the position that entitles me to be speaking before you on this occasion. I think in her heart that is what Janet believes.<br><br>I respect that view. I acknowledge that it may be correct. I am reluctant to announce unequivocally that it is, however, for three reasons. First, it seems inappropriate and immodest for me to take that view. Second, every argument--and I mean<i>every</i>argument, including the one that the Lord needed a BYU president to succeed Jeff Holland--that could be made as to why I ought to be left on this earth can also be made for my friend Terry Crapo, whose cancer took his life almost eight years ago. And finally, the only thing that is really certain is that we just don't know why some people recover from serious illness while others, with the same illness, the same worthiness, and the same faith and prayers, do not. Both the scriptures and my own personal experiences and observations make it very clear that formal, extraordinary efforts (principally fasting and prayer) to invoke divine intervention on behalf of loved ones are proper, should be undertaken, and frequently bear fruit. But for the same reasons already explained in connection with why some of us acquire these afflictions in the first place, we cannot be assured this will always be the case. Otherwise, two of the fundamental premises of this existence--the need for independent earthly experiences and the need to be tested--would be frustrated.<br><br>What I do know is that I am alive, able to live outside a hospital, away from an I.V. pole, to work in a job that I love, to jog, and to live with a family that I love and particularly with a wife who during less happy times gave me a new insight into what love really means. Far more important than knowing why this recovery happened is taking full advantage of the fact that it has, in fulfillment of the most fervent prayers that I have ever offered.<br><br><b>Janet:</b>Through all of this, I learned how to really pray. Now, like most of you I had been praying since I was two or three and through the years had learned the fundamentals of expressing gratitude for blessings received as well as asking for what was needed. There had been times when I not only prayed with real intent but had listened carefully for answers that gave new direction to my life or helped me know I was on the right path. Now, for some reason, faced with a frightening ordeal, I forgot much of what I had learned and became a child again. During those first few days, as I look back now, I must have sounded like a two-year-old, demanding and insisting that I have my way. "Please, Heavenly Father," I would beg over and over, "make him well." I<i>had</i>to pray. I knew nothing else to do. No one on this earth could help me. But such a prayer did not offer the healing balm that I needed for my wounded spirit. Prayer had always brought relief, but there was no peace for my soul.<br><br>Soon, without realizing it, my prayers took on another focus. I began to instruct, reason, even bargain with the Lord. "Surely," I would plead, "there are things on this earth for him to do. He is still useful here. Send him anywhere, ask him to do anything, and I will be at his side helping him. Take away everything we own, but please leave him here. Canst thou see how much I need him, how much I love him? Please let him live." Again peace did not come.<br><br>Then one day, after I had been fasting, I went into a wooded area across from the hospital. I knew many others had been fasting, too, and I felt strengthened as I found a quiet place to pray. I don't know why, but for the first time since Rex's diagnosis my prayer was significantly different. "If it be thy will," I began, "let Rex recover from his cancer. Thou knowest the desires of my heart, but I recognize that I do not understand all things. Please strengthen me to meet the challenges ahead, and calm my troubled heart." Finally, peace came.<br><br>This same type of prayer became my greatest source of strength during the ensuing months. Sometimes I would awaken in the night frightened and alone, in need of help. Although Rex had been told in blessings that his time had not come, reality seemed to indicate otherwise. It was at these times--when I could not shut out the doctors' diagnosis--that I would fall on my knees in prayer, asking for the strength and peace that would always follow. I realized more fully than ever before that changing the circumstances is not always an option, but being given the strength to deal with what we are facing is the greatest blessing of all.<br><br>Scriptures I had known and loved for years took on new meaning. Certain passages seemed to be speaking directly to me and would be recalled when I needed them. "Be of good cheer," I would remember from the Doctrine and Covenants, "for I am in your midst, and I have not forsaken you" (D&amp;amp;C 61:36).<br><br>I used to think that faith in God came in the form of feeling certain that life would be as I wanted it to be. I have grown to understand that to have ultimate faith in God is to know he is with us and will give us unfailing strength to help us through life's challenges. My greatest strength came not in knowing for a surety that Rex's cancer would be cured forever but in putting aside anxious thoughts as my faith in God matured.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>The final thing we learned that we want to talk about today is something that each of us may describe in different words, but I will call it the real meaning of love. Like many of you, Janet and I first fell in love when we were students at BYU. Over the years, our love matured. But my most profound insight into the meaning of love developed two years ago in the 3-B-South wing of the NIH hospital.<br><br>I have concluded that we achieve the ultimate in love for someone else when that other person's welfare, happiness, and sometimes even survival are in every respect just as important to us as our own. The Savior told us that the greatest commandments are to love our Heavenly Father and to love other people as ourselves. He was the only person who ever attained that measure of love for all people, and that is why he was willing to do what he did for us. For most of us, we certainly care for other people, and the level of our concern and affection varies from person to person. But how many people do you know for whom you can literally say that you care just as much about them as you do about yourself--that their welfare and happiness are truly as important as your own? In the summer and fall of 1987 it became very apparent to me that I am the recipient of the fullest possible measure of love from at least one person.<br><br>Those of you who have spent any time in a hospital know how much fun it is. During those four months, July through October, I had no choice. I had to stay there. But day after day, Janet was there also, not just part of the time, not just in the morning or the afternoon, but all day. I would tell her, "Look, I can't leave this place. But you can. I'll be fine without you for a morning, an afternoon, or even a day. Get out of here and preserve your own sanity. Go see your friends. Go sightseeing. Go to the park. Go anywhere. Certainly I would if I could." And friends would call, inviting her to go places. She usually found ways to turn them down. Occasionally she went, at their insistence and mine. When she got back, she would invariably tell me she had felt uncomfortable all the time she was away.<br><br>At first I thought that was positively weird. And then I began to realize: This was no put-on. She wasn't just trying to make me feel good. As astounding as it was to me, Janet really preferred to be there in that miserable hospital with me. My life, and every aspect of my welfare and happiness, were just as important to her as they were to me. And that, my friends, is love. It is also a part of our experience that I will never forget.<br><br><b>Janet:</b>Watching someone suffer, and helping in the care of a possibly terminally ill loved one, had been one of my greatest fears. How could I ever give care and love under those circumstances and not fall apart emotionally? I had read books and articles about strong people who became stronger through a family crisis, but I didn't want to become strengthened in that way. To me, it seemed far less distasteful to fight severe illness myself than to suffer through it with someone I love.<br><br>When faced with the threat of losing my husband and the demands of his care, I was surprised to discover by-products of my trauma that gave me strength. Instead of being repelled by the effects of chemotherapy, my love for him intensified. As I applied cool towels to Rex's fevered brow or rubbed his legs and feet, a new dimension to our love appeared. He had helped me through seven pregnancies and births. Now I was getting a chance to care for him.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>It wasn't the same. I performed for a few hours at a time. She was there for months. There was also a qualitative difference. She learned enough about my kind of cancer that she actually became something of a collaborator with the doctors.<br><br><b>Janet</b>: My love for him increased each day as I administered to his needs. Now please don't think that what I did was entirely unselfish. While serving him I felt my greatest peace. I was in torment when I left his room. Nights were agony for me. My only joy during those months came in making him happy, comfortable, or in helping him with his work.<br><br>When his cancer was first diagnosed I had envisioned sitting by his bed, holding his hand, and gazing into his eyes while we told each other how in love we were (like in the movies). This lasted for about forty-eight hours. It then appeared there were other needs--especially for him. Even confined to a hospital bed, he needed to feel that he was an important part of ongoing life. He needed to work, to be productive.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>She's wrong. The fact is, I was essential to the cause of right, truth, and justice in America's courtrooms.<br><br><b>Janet:</b>I was horrified when he first suggested that we set up an office in his room. I thought working would be too difficult for him and the most romantic words he would speak to me would be, "Will you please read from pages two through five of this legal brief." But as I sat on the foot of his bed facing him, reading what he was too sick to read for himself, I felt a powerful outpouring of love and admiration for him. Sometimes he would close his eyes and I would think he was asleep, only to hear him interrupt to make a pertinent comment. This went on for months, with days when he could work only a few minutes, and days when he could barely hold up his head to take a bite or two of distasteful, often rejected, but much needed nourishment.<br><br>I was fearful that working would take a negative toll on Rex, yet this hospital office served him well. It was there he prepared for a Supreme Court case argued early in October. On the day of the argument, we literally unhooked his I.V.s, got him out of bed, dressed him, and took him to the Supreme Court. A nurse went with us carrying a bag full of medicine to meet any emergency. The Supreme Court clerk's office had a stool for him, in case he couldn't stand for the full half hour. He didn't use it. We were all frightened, but I sincerely believe that this was one of many experiences that helped to save his life. He was a vital, needed part of society.<br><br>There were painful tests, treatments, X rays, CAT scans, ever-present nausea, and those endless I.V.s and transfusions. Rarely did he ever lose his sense of humor or curiosity about his disease and treatment. He joked with the doctors and nurses even during the most grueling procedures. Before his illness when I had read about others in my circumstance, I often thought that given their situations I would want to leave or run away. My comfort came in being there, in comforting my husband, talking to the doctors and nurses, being informed, and helping make decisions about his care. To watch his strength, humor, and indomitable spirit in the face of all he was going through made me love and admire him in a way that was never before possible.<br><br>I realized that his failing body was only the temporal part of him as I grew to know his spirit more intimately. He was completely bald, his face was swollen from medication, and he had lost over twenty-five pounds. He looked like an old man in his feeble attempts to walk. His shoulders slumped, and he shuffled his feet as he slowly pushed his I.V. pole trying to get in a few minutes of daily exercise. Was this the same handsome husband who only weeks before had run with me and joked when I asked how it would feel if one of us would someday not be able to join the team? "Oh, I'll describe the run to you when I get back," was his quick reply. We laughed like children in the warm spring sunshine, unaware of what was ahead. I loved him with all my heart. He was strong and healthy and still young after twenty-eight years of marriage. How could I ever love him more? That was the last time we ran together before he was hospitalized, and as I sat by the bedside of someone who barely resembled my husband, I knew that I loved him more completely than I had ever loved before.<br><br>I also gained a deeper understanding of our Heavenly Father and his love for us. How could I have ever missed this part of our lives together? I would not have chosen this way to learn the lessons I was learning, but I was there and I had to take a crash course in many things. The alternative to learning was to fail the most important test I had ever been given.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>She's right. It was a test. And it may not yet be finished. As students, you know about tests. You take a lot of them. Whether they occur in the classroom or some other place, tests will always be experiences from which we should learn. We learned some things from this test of ours. We learned about love, about prayer, about each other, and about ourselves. We don't seek life's storms, but they will come. And we can find beauty in them. That our Heavenly Father will help us to understand and appreciate not only tests but also life itself, of which tests are an important part, is our prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Rex E. Lee was president of Brigham Young University when he and his wife, Janet, gave this devotional address was given on 23 January 1990.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<br>
<br>
This address will attempt to "survey the wondrous cross" by focusing on the Christology in the book of Mosiah, using not only the words of King Benjamin, Mosiah, Abinadi, and Alma the Younger, but scriptures that lie in the suburbs of Mosiah and other related scriptures. The final focus will be on the requirements for our becoming what King Benjamin called "the children of Christ," which is my text (Mosiah 1:11; 5:9, 11; 26:18).<br><br>Left unexplored are other possibilities, such as some our LDS scholars are reconnoitering. For instance, the biblical term<i>mosiah</i>was probably a political designation; it also is an honorific title in Hebrew meaning<i>savior</i>or<i>rescuer</i>(<i>FARMS Update,</i>April 1989). Not bad for a bright but unschooled Joseph Smith who, while translating early on, reportedly wondered aloud to Emma if there were walls around Jerusalem (<i>The History of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints,</i>vol. 4, 1873–1890 [Independence, Missouri: Herald House, 1967], p. 447).<br><br>There is so much more in the Book of Mormon than we have yet discovered. The book's divine architecture and rich furnishings will increasingly unfold to our view, further qualifying it as "a marvelous work and a wonder" (Isaiah 29:14). As I noted from this pulpit in 1986, "The Book of Mormon is like a vast mansion with gardens, towers, courtyards, and wings (<i>Book of Mormon Symposium,</i>10 October 1986). All the rooms in this mansion need to be explored, whether by valued traditional scholars or by those at the cutting edge. Each plays a role, and one LDS scholar cannot say to the other, "I have no need of thee" (1 Corinthians 12:21).<br><br>Professor Hugh Nibley has reconnoitered much of that mansion, showing how ournew dispensation links with the old world. There is not only that Nibley nexus, but also one between him and several generations of LDS scholars.<br><h2><b>Scriptures of the Restoration</b></h2><br>The book of Mosiah begins with a father instructing his sons, just as was done in ancient Israel. Alma the Younger remembered a critical Christ-centered prophecy of his father, you'll recall (see Deuteronomy 6:7; Alma 36:17–18). The book of Mosiah ends as the successor son approaches death, having sought to "do according to that which his father [King Benjamin] had done in all things." As a result, Mosiah's people "did esteem him more than any other man" (Mosiah 6:7; 29:40). So did the Mulekites, who accepted him as their next king, though he was an immigrant among them.<br><br>Within the book's sixty-plus printed pages occur not only family and political drama, but some stunning verses of Christology concerning the role, mission, and deeds of Jesus Christ. The Christology of the Restoration, brothers and sisters, restructures our understanding of so many fundamental realities.<br><br>A significant portion of King Benjamin's towering sermon was given to him by an angel, and angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost (Mosiah 3:2; 2 Nephi 32:3). At its center is the masterful sermon about the exclusive means of salvation:<br><br><i>There shall be no other name given nor any other way nor means whereby salvation can come unto the children of men, only in and through the name of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent.</i>[Mosiah 3:17; see also Mosiah 4:7–8]<br><br>It is not only the divinity but also the specificity of King Benjamin's sermon that marks it. Hence Father Helaman, in sending his two sons, Lehi and Nephi, on a mission to the land of Nephi, exhorted them to "Remember, remember, my sons, the words which King Benjamin spake unto his people" (Helaman 5:9).<br><br>In Restoration scriptures, not only is salvation specific, but so also is the identity of the Savior as various scriptures foretell. A savior was to be provided in the meridian of time (Moses 5:57). His name was to be Jesus Christ (2 Nephi 25:19). Christ volunteered for that mission premortally (Abraham 3:27). He was to be born of Mary, a Nazarene, but in Bethlehem--a fact over which some stumbled in the meridian of time (John 7:40–43; see also Micah 5:2, Luke 2:4, Matthew 2:23, 1 Nephi 11:13, Alma 7:10). There would even be a new star celebrating his birth (Helaman 14:5, 3 Nephi 1:21).<br><br>And then we learn from the holy scriptures of the sacrifice of the Father's Firstborn premortally; his Only Begotten Son in the flesh was the sacrifice of a Creator-God. The Atoner was the Lord God Omnipotent, who created this and many other planets (D&amp;amp;C 76:24, Moses 1:33, Mosiah 3:5). Therefore, unlike the sacrifice of a mortal, Christ's was an "infinite atonement" made possible, declared King Benjamin, by the infinite goodness and mercy of God (see Mosiah 4:6; 2 Nephi 9:7; Alma 34:10, 12; Mosiah 5:3).<br><br>Ironically, the Mortal Messiah would be disregarded and crucified, said Benjamin and Nephi:<br><br><i>And lo, he cometh unto his own, that salvation might come unto the children of men even through faith on his name; and even after all this they shall consider him a man, . . . and shall scourge him, and shall crucify him.</i>[Mosiah 3:9]<br><br><i>And the world, because of their iniquity, shall judge him to be a thing of naught; wherefore they scourge him, and he suffereth it; and they smite him, and he suffereth it. Yea, they spit upon him, and he suffereth it, because of his loving kindness and his long-suffering towards the children of men.</i>[1 Nephi 19:9]<br><br>This pattern of denigrating Jesus that existed in the meridian of time has continued in our time as noted in this next quotation:<br><br><i>The sweetly-attractive human Jesus is a product of 19th-century skepticism, produced by people who were ceasing to believe in Jesus' divinity but wanted to keep as much Christianity as they could.</i>[C. S. Lewis,<i>Letters of C. S. Lewis</i>(London: Geoffrey Bles Ltd., 1966), p. 181]<br><br>However mortals regard him, there is no other saving and atoning name under heaven! (See Mosiah 3:17, Moses 6:52.)<br><br><i>O remember, remember, . . . that there is no other way nor means whereby man can be saved, only through the atoning blood of Jesus Christ, who shall come; yea, remember that he cometh to redeem the world.</i>[Helaman 5:9]<br><br>All other gods, brothers and sisters, fail and fall, including the gods of this world. Currently we are seeing Caesars come and go--"an hour of pomp, an hour of show."<br><br>The Christology of Restoration scriptures constitutes the answer to what Amulek called "the great question," which is: Will there really be a redeeming Christ? (See Alma 34:5.)<br><br>If, as Abinadi declared, Christ were not risen as the first fruits with all mortals to follow, then life would end in hopelessness (Mosiah 16:6, 7). But he is risen, and life has profound purpose and rich meaning! One day, said King Benjamin, such knowledge of the Savior would spread:<br><br><i>The time shall come when the knowledge of a Savior shall spread throughout every nation, kindred, tongue, and people.</i>[Mosiah 3:20]<br><br>This spreading is happening in our day at an accelerated rate, brothers and sisters. At a later day, divine disclosure will be total and remarkable:<br><br><i>And the day cometh that . . . all things shall be revealed unto the children of men which ever have been among the children of men, and which ever will be even unto the end of the earth.</i>[2 Nephi 27:11]<br><br>There will be so much to disclose that we don't now have. All the prophets have testified of the coming of Jesus Christ (Mosiah 13:33). Jesus, the Lord of all the prophets, even called them all "my holy prophets" (3 Nephi 1:13). How could he, as some aver, merely be one of them? Worse still, some consider Jesus only as another "moral teacher." Pronouncements such as Abinadi's underscore Jesus' transcending triumph:<br><br><i>And thus God breaketh the bands of death, having gained the victory over death; giving the Son power to make intercession for the children of men--</i><br><br><i>Having ascended into heaven, having the bowels of mercy; being filled with compassion towards the children of men; standing betwixt them and justice; having broken the bands of death, taking upon himself their iniquity and their transgressions, having redeemed them, and satisfied the demands of justice.</i>[Mosiah 15:8, 9]<br><br>It is very significant, brothers and sisters, that leaders and founders of other world religions made no such declarative claims of divinity for themselves, though millions venerate these leaders.<br><br>No wonder the Book of Mormon was urgently needed for "the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ" (title page). Such testifying is the purpose of all scripture. The Apostle John stated:<br><br><i>But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.</i>[John 20:31]<br><br>Of the Christ-centered plan of salvation, Nephi declared, "How great the importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth" (2 Nephi 2:8).<br><br>Jesus is even described as the Father, because he is the Father-Creator of this and other worlds. Furthermore, he is the Father of all who are born again spiritually (see D&amp;amp;C 76:24). When we take upon ourselves his name and covenant to keep his commandments, we then become his sons and daughters, "the children of Christ" (see Mosiah 5:3–7; 15:1–5; 27:24–29).<br><br>In addition, since he and the Father are one in attributes and in purpose, Jesus acts for the Father through divine investiture, sometimes speaking as the Father (see D&amp;amp;C 93:3–5).<br><br>The world desperately needs such divine declarations and instructions concerning<i>why</i>we are here and<i>how</i>we should live--concerning what is right and what is wrong, what is true and what is false. Much needed, too, is the Restoration's verification of the reality of the Resurrection. Much needed, too, is the Restoration's clarification as to the nature of God and man. Likewise, much needed is the Restoration's enunciation of the divinely determined purposes of this mortal existence.<br><h2><b>Feasting on Essential Truths</b></h2><br>The millions who have lived on this planet in the midst of the famine foreseen by Amos, one of hearing the word of God, have never known the taste and nourishment of whole-grain gospel (see Amos 8:11–12). Instead, they have subsisted on the fast foods of philosophy. When Jesus spoke of himself as the bread of life, it caused some to walk no more with him (see John 6:66). No wonder Jesus said, "Blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me" (Matthew 11:6; see John 6:61). To which I add, "Blessed is he who is not offended by the Restoration!"<br><br>The pages of Restoration scriptures ripple and resound with so many essential truths! For example, through correct Christology we learn about Christ's premortal pinnacle as the Creator-God and how, even so, only later did he receive a fulness (see D&amp;amp;C 93:12–13, 16). The Lord has told us how important it is to understand not only "what" we worship, but also "how" to worship (see D&amp;amp;C 93:19, John 4:22).<br><br>After all, real adoration of the Father and Jesus results in the emulation of them! How shall we become more like them if we do not know about their character and nature?<br><br>Said King Benjamin, "How knoweth a man the master whom he has not served, and who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart?" (Mosiah 5:13).<br><br>Furthermore, unless we understand how the schoolmaster law of Moses was a preparing and a foretelling type, we will not understand dispensationalism, including the place of meridian Christianity in the stream of religious history.<br><br><i>It is expedient that ye should keep the law of Moses as yet; but I say unto you, that the time shall come when it shall no more be expedient. . . .</i><br><br>[For]<i>God himself should come down among the children of men, and take upon him the form of man, and go forth in mighty power upon the face of the earth.</i>[Mosiah 13:27, 34; see also Mosiah 3:15; 13:29–35; 16:14; Galatians 3:24]<br><br>For modernity, brothers and sisters, the relevancy of the message in Mosiah is especially real. For instance, we are clearly indebted to our English ancestors for our precious King James Version. Yet, that nation subsequently suffered from a wave of irreligion. Your academic vice president, Stan L. Albrecht, wrote of that wave of irreligion:<br><br><i>The pattern of downturn in religious activity in British society . . . made "agnosticism respectable if not universal by the turn of the century." . . . By the early 1900s Arnold Bennett could say, ". . . The intelligentsia has sat back, shrugged its shoulders, given a sigh of relief, and decreed tacitly or by plain statement: 'The affair is over and done with.'"</i><br><br><i>. . . By the 1970s only about 5 percent of the adult population in the Church of England even attended Easter religious services, and the percentage continues to decline.</i>[Stan L. Albrecht, "The Consequential Dimension of Mormon Religiosity,"<i>BYU Studies,</i>vol. 29, no. 2, Spring 1989, p. 98]<br><br>This next mid-twentieth century expression is from a candid dean of Saint Paul's Cathedral in London:<br><br><i>All my life I have struggled to find the purpose of living. I have tried to answer three questions which always seemed to be fundamental: the problem of eternity; the problem of human personality; and the problem of evil.</i><br><br><i>I have failed. I have solved none of them and I know no more than when I started. And I believe no one will ever solve them.</i><br><br><i>I know as much about the after-life as you--NOTHING. I don't even know that there is one--in the same sense in which the Church teaches it. I have no vision of Heaven or of a welcoming God. I do not know what I shall find. I must wait and see.</i>[Dean William Ralph Inge, former dean of Saint Paul's Cathedral, London, England,<i>Daily Express,</i>London, England, 13 July 1953, p. 4]<br><br>I marvel with you at how the Restoration scriptures are repetitively able to inform us and inspire us; they enthrall us again and again. Ordinary books contain comparative crumbs, whereas the bread of life provides a feast!<br><br>Through those scriptures we learn that salvation is specific, not vague; it includes individual resurrection and triumph over death. We each will stand before God as individuals, kneeling and confessing (see Alma 12:13–15, 34–35). The faithful will even sit down, as individuals, with the spiritual notables of ages past, for God has said he will<br><br><i>land their souls, yea, their immortal souls, at the right hand of God in the kingdom of heaven, to sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and with Jacob, and with all our holy fathers, to go no more out.</i>[Helaman 3:30; see also Alma 7:25, Matthew 8:11, D&amp;amp;C 124:19]<br><br>Thus we will not be merged into some unremembering molecular mass. Nor will we be mere droplets in an ocean of consciousness.<br><br>In one way or another, sooner or later, all mortals will plead, as Alma did at his turning point, "O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me" (Alma 36:18). Thus we are blessed with enlarged perspectives because "through the infinite goodness of God, and the manifestations of his Spirit, [we] have great views of that which is to come" (Mosiah 5:3).<br><br>Many in the world today are like some among the Book of Mormon peoples who believed "when a man was dead, that was the end thereof" (Alma 30:18). For others, there are certain existential "givens" as now quoted: "There is no built-in scheme of meaning in the world" (Irvin D. Yalom, Stanford University psychiatrist, "Exploring Psychic Interiors,"<i>U.S. News</i>&amp;amp;<i>World Report,</i>30 October 1989, p. 67). "No deity will save us; we must save ourselves" ("Humanist Manifesto II," "Liberal Family,"<i>The Encyclopedia of American Religions: Religious Creeds,</i>edited by J. Gordon Melton [Detroit: Gale Research Company, p. 641).<br><br>No wonder the Restoration is so relevant and so urgent, having come, as the Lord said, so "that faith also might increase in the earth" (D&amp;amp;C 1:21).<br><br>Compared to the great, divine declarations being noted this evening, which are central to real faith, what else really matters? Illustratively, two Book of Mormon prophets in referring to a lesser concern, death, used the phrases "it mattereth not" or "it matters not" (Ether 15:34, Mosiah 13:9). Happily, the reality of the Atonement does not depend upon either our awareness of it or our acceptance of it! Immortality is a free gift to all, including to the presently unappreciative (see 2 Nephi 2:4).<br><br>Meanwhile, however, even the spiritually sensitive feel less than full joy because, said C. S. Lewis:<br><br><i>We have a lifelong nostalgia, a longing to be reunited with something in the universe from which we now feel cut off, to be on the inside of some door which we have always seen from the outside, this is . . . the truest index of our real situation.</i>[C. S. Lewis,<i>A Mind Awake</i>(New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp;amp; World, Inc., 1968), p. 23]<br><br>In that sense, brothers and sisters, we are all prodigals! We, too, must come to ourselves, having determined, "I will arise and go to my father" (Luke 15:18). This reunion and reconciliation is actually possible. Because of the Atonement, we are not irrevocably cut off.<br><h2><b>Great Teachers and Leaders</b></h2><br>The book of Mosiah has so many jewels, including what seem to me, as a political scientist, to be some marvelous principles of politics and leadership. As more and more people on this planet are currently reaching out for a greater voice in their affairs, how relevant and instructive are the words of King Mosiah:<br><br><i>Now it is not common that the voice of the people desireth anything contrary to that which is right; but it is common for the lesser part of the people to desire that which is not right; therefore this shall ye observe and make it your law--to do your business by the voice of the people.</i>[Mosiah 29:26]<br><br>However, a democracy devoid of spiritual purpose may remain only a process, one within which citizens are merely part of a "lonely crowd," feeling separated from the past including their ancestors.<br><br>In contrast, King Mosiah's people had spiritual purpose; they deeply admired his profound political leadership.<br><br><i>And they did wax strong in love towards Mosiah; yea, they did esteem him more than any other man . . . exceedingly, beyond measure.</i>[Mosiah 29:40]<br><br>Laboring with his own hands, he was a man of peace and freedom. He wanted the children of Christ to esteem neighbors as themselves (see Mosiah 27:4). King Mosiah was deeply anxious that all the people have an "equal chance" (see Mosiah 27:3; 29:38). Yet there would be no free rides, because "every man [would] bear his [own] part" (Mosiah 29:34).<br><br>King Benjamin wanted his people to be filled with the love of God, to grow in the knowledge of that which is just and true, to have no mind to injure another, to live peaceably, to teach their children to love and serve one another, and to succor the needy, including beggars (see Mosiah 4:12–30).<br><br>Mosiah was certainly not without his personal trials, for Mosiah went through that special suffering known only to the parents of disobedient children. The wickedness of his sons, along with Alma the Younger, created much trouble. Only after "wading through much tribulation" did they finally do much good and repair much of the damage they had done (see Mosiah 27:28). Even later, however, after his sons had repented, before they were to have an enlarged missionary role, Mosiah first consulted with the Lord (see Mosiah 28:6).<br><br>Mosiah also faced the challenges of leading a multigroup society: Nephites, Zoramites, Mulekites, Nehorites, Limhites (in Gideon), as well as those covenanters in Alma's group. How varied these interest groups were, and yet how united in love of their leader!<br><br>Ponder this indicator of how Mosiah was an open, disclosing, and teaching leader:<br><br><i>And many more things did king Mosiah write unto them, unfolding unto them all the trials and troubles of a righteous king, yea, all the travails of soul for their people, and also all the murmurings of the people to their king;</i>and he explained it all unto them. [Mosiah 29:33; emphasis added]<br><br>The political leader as a teacher of his people: King Benjamin and King Mosiah are examples of the leader-servant; they followed the pattern of their master, Jesus. Prophets and leaders like Benjamin and Mosiah were charged to "regulate all the affairs of the Church." They did so both with style and with substance. There was love, but also admonishing discipline--with the repentant numbered among the Church and the unrepentant having their names blotted out. Missionary work went well; many were received into the Church by baptism (see Mosiah 26:35–37).<br><br>So it was that their people became the children of Christ. The children of Christ in any dispensation willingly make the sacrifice of a broken heart and a contrite spirit (see 3 Nephi 9:20, D&amp;amp;C 59:8, Psalms 51:17). The children of Christ are meek and malleable--their hearts can be broken, changed, or made anew. The child of Christ can eventually mature to become the woman or man of Christ to whom the Lord promises that he will lead "in a strait and narrow course across that everlasting gulf of misery" (Helaman 3:26).<br><br>The children of Christ are described by King Benjamin as being submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, and--then the sobering line--"willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon [them], even as a child doth submit to his father" (Mosiah 3:19). Significantly, twice in the ensuing book of Alma the very same recitation of these important qualities is made with several added: to be gentle, temperate, easily entreated, and longsuffering (see Alma 7:23; 13:28).<br><br>These virtues are cardinal, portable, and eternal. They reflect in us the seriousness of our discipleship. After all, true disciples will continue to grow spiritually because they have "faith unto repentance" (see Alma 34:16, 17; 13:10). These qualities will finally rise with us in the Resurrection. Interesting, isn't it, in contemplating each of the qualities in this cluster, how they remind us of the need to tame our egos? Blessed is the person who is progressing in the taming of his or her egoistic self. King Benjamin, for example, had not the least desire to boast of himself (see Mosiah 2:16). He was unconcerned with projecting his political image because he had Christ's image in his countenance.<br><br>We are instructed not only in what we are to become, but also in what we are to avoid. Abinadi noted how Jesus suffered temptation but yielded not (see Mosiah 15:5). Unlike many of us, Christ gave no heed to temptations (see D&amp;amp;C 20:22). This is yet another instructive example to us, his children, for even if we evict temptations we often entertain them first.<br><br>The development of these cardinal virtues is central to God's plan for us. Lack of perspective about God's plans is part of the failure of Laman and Lemuel:<br><br><i>And thus Laman and Lemuel, . . . did murmur because they knew not the dealings of that God who had created them.</i>[1 Nephi 2:12; see also Mosiah 10:14]<br><br>Illustratively, we are advised that on occasion God will chasten his people and will try our patience and faith (see Mosiah 23:21). Is not the question "Why, O Lord?" one that goes to the heart of the further development of faith amid tutoring? Similarly, the question "How long, O Lord?" is one that goes to the very heart of developing patience. Thus we see how interactive all of these things are in the developmental dimensions of God's plan of salvation that culminates in eternal life.<br><h2><b>Accepting God's Greatest Gift</b></h2><br>Immortality comes to all by God's grace--it is unearned "after all we can do" (2 Nephi 25:23). Full salvation, eternal life, is God's greatest gift (D&amp;amp;C 6:13; 14:7). However, unlike the blessing of immortality, eternal life is conditional. Eternal life, said King Benjamin, is more than endless existence; it is endless happiness! (See Mosiah 2:41.) It was this that was promised to Alma the Younger: "Thou art my servant; and I covenant with thee that thou shalt have eternal life" (Mosiah 26:20).<br><br>Eternal life will feature the joys of always rejoicing and being filled with love (Mosiah 4:12), of growing in the knowledge of God's glory, of being in his presence, of being in eternal families and friendships forever (see D&amp;amp;C 76:62; 130:2; 132:24, 55).<br><br>Eternal life also brings the full bestowal of all the specific promises made in connection with the temple's initiatory ordinances, the holy endowment, and temple sealings--thereby God "may seal you his" (Mosiah 4:15). In addition, all other blessings promised upon the keeping of God's commandments will likewise flow in the abundant Malachi measure, so many "there shall not be room enough to receive [them]"! (See Malachi 3:10.) John declared that the faithful shall "inherit all things" (Revelation 21:7). Modern scriptures confirm that the faithful will eventually receive "all that [the] Father hath" (D&amp;amp;C 84:38). Meanwhile, how much of that promised birthright will some of us sell and for what mess of pottage?<br><br>Comparing the magnitude of this and all the great gifts given to us of God and our<br><br>meager service to him, no wonder, said King Benjamin, we are beggars and unprofitable servants (see Mosiah 2:21; 4:19).<br><br>As we accept Christ and become his children, there begins to be a change--even a "mighty change" in us. As we earnestly strive to become one with him and his purposes, we come to resemble him. Christ who has saved us thus becomes the Father of our Salvation, and we become the "children of Christ," having his image increasingly in our countenances and conduct (see Mosiah 5:7).<br><br>The children of Christ understand the importance of feasting regularly on sacred records that testify of Jesus (see 2 Nephi 31:20; 32:3; Jacob 2:9; JS–M 1:37). Without such records, belief in him and in the glorious resurrection can quickly wane:<br><br><i>And at the time that Mosiah discovered them, . . . they had brought no records with them; and they denied the being of their Creator.</i>[Omni 1:17]<br><br><i>There were many of the rising generation that could not understand the words of king Benjamin, being little children at the time he spake unto his people; and they did not believe the tradition of their fathers.</i><br><br><i>They did not believe what had been said concerning the resurrection of the dead, neither did they believe concerning the coming of Christ.</i>[Mosiah 26:1–2]<br><br>For those either untaught or unheeding of the essential gospel truths, the lapse of faith in Christ is but one generation away!<br><br>So many scriptures point to the reality that Jesus really is to be the specific example for the children of Christ. We really are to emulate him in our lives. Consider these examples:<br><br><i>Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.</i>[Matthew 5:48]<br><br><i>Therefore I would that ye should be perfect even as I, or your Father who is in heaven is perfect.</i>[3 Nephi 12:48]<br><br><i>Therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am.</i>[3 Nephi 27:27]<br><br><i>Ye shall be holy; for I am holy.</i>[Leviticus 11:44]<br><br><i>Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.</i>[Luke 6:36]<br><br><i>For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.</i>[John 13:15]<br><br><i>Jesus Christ</i>[shows]<i>forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.</i>[1 Timothy 1:16]<br><br><i>Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.</i>[1 Peter 2:21]<br><br><i>And again, it showeth unto the children of men the straitness of the path, and the narrowness of the gate, by which they should enter, he having set the example before them.</i>[2 Nephi 31:9]<br><br><i>Ye know the things that ye must do in my church; for the works which ye have seen me do that shall ye also do; for that which ye have seen me do even that shall ye do.</i>[3 Nephi 27:21]<br><br><i>Behold I am the light; I have set an example for you.</i>[3 Nephi 18:16]<br><br>No wonder, in view of these and many other scriptures, that Joseph Smith taught, "If you wish to go where God is, you must be like God, . . . drawing towards God in principle" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 216).<br><br>The loving kindness of the Lord that Nephi spoke about is likewise noted in Exodus.<br><br><i>And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth.</i>[Exodus 34:6]<br><br>In this soaring scriptural declaration, mercy and justice both make their rightful claims, but even so, mercy "overpowereth justice" (Alma 34:15).<br><br>Since his qualities are to be emulated by his children, as the Prophet Joseph Smith taught us, it is vital for us to comprehend the character and personality of God if we are to comprehend ourselves (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 343). However, as we truly emulate Jesus' example, we will thereby encounter the costs of discipleship through our own micro-experiences. We will come to know what it is to suffer and to be reproached for taking upon ourselves the name of Christ (see Luke 6:22, 1 Peter 4:14). Therefore, our fiery trials, said Peter, should not be thought of as "some strange thing" (1 Peter 4:12).<br><h2><b>There Is No End to His Works</b></h2><br>As the believing and trusting children of Christ become more Christlike, it will be evident in their daily lives, whether in the treatment of the poor or in the management of their civic affairs (see Mosiah 4:16). Ammon taught, for instance, of how those who become the children of Christ will truly be "a great benefit to [their] fellow beings" (Mosiah 8:18). Alma, Mosiah's successor, learned from the Lord how the illuminated individual can actually evoke faith in other people by "words alone" (Mosiah 26:15, 16; see also 3 Nephi 11:2, D&amp;amp;C 46:13–14).<br><br>With his highly developed sense of proportion, King Benjamin said, "Even so I would that ye should . . . always retain in remembrance, the greatness of God, and your own nothingness, and his goodness and long-suffering towards you" (Mosiah 4:11; see also Moses 1:9–10). We who have the Restoration scriptures have further reasons to feel overwhelmed by the greatness of God. We are told that there is no space in which there is no kingdom (D&amp;amp;C 88:37). God's works are without end, and he has created worlds "innumerable . . . unto man" (Moses 1:4, 33, 35). The very heavens and planets do witness that there is a Supreme Creator (Alma 30:44).<br><br>Mortal astrophysics confirm the awesome nature of the universe. Astronomers recently indicated they have discovered a collection of galaxies "so extensive that it defies explanation by any present theory." Dubbed "the great wall," these "galaxies form a sheet . . . 3,000 billion billion miles." One scientist said, "We keep being surprised that we keep seeing something bigger as we go out farther" (<i>The Sacramento Union,</i>Sunday, 19 November 1989, p. 22).<br><br><i>And as one earth shall pass away, and the heavens thereof even so shall another come; and there is no end to my works.</i>[Moses 1:38]<br><br>At the Judgment Day, declared Mosiah's successor, everyone at that assemblage will "confess that [God] is God." When one considers history's disbelieving notables who will be there, these lines are subduing:<br><br><i>Then shall they confess, who live without God in the world, that the judgment of an everlasting punishment is just upon them; and they shall quake, and tremble, and shrink beneath the glance of his all-searching eye.</i>[Mosiah 27:31; see also Mosiah 16:1, Alma 12:15]<br><br>This is while the faithful "shall stand before him" and "see his face with pleasure" (Enos 1:27). His piercing eyes will likewise emanate perfect, overwhelming love, a love, which, alas, few will have reciprocated. The sense of undeservingness will be deep and profound! And thus we have a sense of the rendezvous that lies ahead. There is no end to his works.<br><br>Furthermore, Benjamin, Abinadi, Mosiah, and Moroni will be present at the Day of Judgment (see Moroni 10:27), and out of their words we will be judged. At the judgment, we will not only have the prophesied "bright recollection" and "perfect remembrance" of misdeeds, but of happy things as well (see Alma 11:43; 5:18). The joyous things will be preserved, too (see D&amp;amp;C 93:33).<br><br>Most of you are too young to appreciate how those of us who are older feel as the sense of memory slips away. I can safely hide my own Easter eggs now.<br><br>Among "all things . . . restored" will be our memories (see Alma 11:43; 40:23), including eventually our premortal memories. What a flood of feeling and fact will come to us then, as a loving God deems wise, increasing our gratefulness for God's long-suffering love and Jesus' atonement. What joy upon being connected again with the memories of both the first and second estates!<br><br>Meanwhile, during this life, we will continue to experience the unwelcome sense "of having ended a chapter. One more portion of one's self slipping away into the past"<i>(Letters of C. S. Lewis,</i>p. 306).<br><br>Mary Warnock wrote about how "Anything that is<i>over</i>. . . is a lost<i>possession.</i>. . . The past is a paradise from which we are necessarily excluded" (Dan Jacobson, "Of Time and Poetry,"<i>Commentary,</i>November 1989, vol. 88, no. 5, p. 52). And speaking about one writer reflecting on his memories, Warnock said he realized past experiences once shared "are now his alone. . . . The past continually comes to him; but he knows that he can never go back to it" (ibid.). But one day it will all come back!<br><br>The children of Christ know now whose they are, whence they came, why they are here, and what manner of men and women they are to become (see 2 Peter 3:11, 3 Nephi 27:27). Still, the children of Christ, like Alma, will "long to be there" in the royal courts on high (Alma 36:22). It is the only destination that really matters. Resplendent reunion awaits us! What is more natural and more wonderful than children going home? Especially to a home where the past, the present, and the future form an everlasting and eternal now! (See D&amp;amp;C 130:7; 38:2;<i>Teachings,</i>p. 220.)<br><br>Let us do as King Benjamin urged us to:<br><br><i>Believe in God; believe that he is, and that he created all things, both in heaven and in earth; believe that he has all wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth; believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend.</i>[Mosiah 4:9]<br><br>Meanwhile, how can there be refining fires without heat? Or greater patience without some instructive waiting? How can we develop empathy without first bearing one another's burdens? Not only that burdens may be lightened, but that we may thereby be enlightened by developing greater empathy. How can we increase individual faith without some customized uncertainty? How can we learn to live in cheerful security without some insecurity?<br><br>How can there be later magnification without some present deprivation? Except we are thus tutored, how else shall we grow spiritually to become the men and women of Christ? In this brief mortality, therefore, reveries are often rudely elbowed aside by tutoring adversities! Meanwhile, as faithful children, the challenge is: Will we prove ourselves, in King Benjamin's phrase, "willing to submit?" (See Mosiah 3:19.)<br><br>Finally, I should like to leave my own witness. In my life, whichever way I turn, brothers and sisters, there looms Jesus, name of wondrous love. He is our fully atoning and fully comprehending Savior, and in the words of scripture, "There is none like unto him."<br><br>Whether taught in the holy scriptures or in the holy temples, his gospel is remarkable. Whether it concerns the nature of God, the nature of man, the nature of the universe, the nature of this mortal experience, it is remarkable. His gospel is stunning as to its interior consistency. It is breathtaking as to its exterior expansiveness. Rather than existing without the gospel in a mortal maze, instead I stand all amazed at the wonders of that gospel that we should be privileged to be his children.<br><br>Whatever my experiences, the spiritual facts that have emerged from these experiences encompass me. They encompass me and echo the testifying words of King Benjamin as follows, "The goodness of God, and his matchless power, and his wisdom, and his patience, and his long-suffering towards the children of men" (Mosiah 4:6). Everyone of those virtues of God I have counted on, I count on now, I will count on again--whether it is his long-suffering, his matchless power, or his goodness. And so do you! Those are the very virtues that must come in a measure to be ours, my brothers and sisters.<br><br>This constitutes the journey of discipleship. We must, like the prodigal son, arise and go to our father and be prepared for that resplendent reunion. We can hasten the journey only insofar as we hasten the process of becoming like him, as the children of Christ going home of which I testify. For his help in my personal journey I plead and for his help for you.<br><br>You are the leaven for mankind. And all the winds of political freedom that blow intrinsically carry within them the added prospects that the children of Christ will reach out more expeditiously to their brothers and sisters on this planet with this wondrous message. As we "survey the wondrous cross," as his children, may it be so, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Neal A.

<h1>ts: A Still Voice of Perfect Mildness - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
One of the great blessings of my life is to have had the opportunity of working closely with five presidents of the Church--President David O. McKay, Joseph Fielding Smith, Harold B. Lee, Spencer W. Kimball, and Ezra Taft Benson. Among their other great traits, I found them to be humble men--soft-spoken, mild, kind, and gentle in leadership roles and relationships. Intimate experiences with each have helped me to know what I share with you today in firmness and conviction about mild voices.<br><br>Personal calls and associations with these presidents over the years have prompted me to appreciate the contents of Helaman 5:30.<br><br><i>And it came to pass when they heard this voice, and beheld that it was not a voice of thunder, neither was it a voice of a great tumultuous noise, but behold, it was</i>a still voice of perfect mildness,<i>as if it had been a whisper, and it did pierce even to the very soul.</i>[Emphasis added]<br><br>May I suggest to you, my associates of Brigham Young University, that you listen to your leaders who administer with still voices and humble words. Too often we are inclined to be impressed with the loud, noisy, and dramatic. Students and members in general are sometimes led away from the paths of success because they are swayed by the sensational and artificial light. Very often in today's busy world we ignore the quiet promptings of our leaders and those who guide with soft words.<br><br>I am pleased today to have two of my very good friends, basketball coach Roger Reid and Charles Bradley, his assistant, seated near Sister Ashton and me in this devotional setting. Tony Ingle, the other assistant, would have been here, but he is away recruiting. This isn't a pep rally or celebration assembly. I hope that will come another time. For my purposes and theme today, I congratulate these three men for quiet voices and humble words as they have launched and carried on the BYU basketball program this year. From the beginning it has been and still is a voice of oneness that carries the message: "We have no super stars. We are going to quietly work hard without boisterous declarations or predictions." This approach is bringing unusual results. I commend them for their "on the court" and "off the court" leadership.<br><h2><b>He Called Me with a Whisper</b></h2><br>I had the special honor and privilege of being the last General Authority that President David O. McKay called before his death. I recall with fear and trembling the impressions I can never forget as I visited with him in his Hotel Utah apartment by appointment. He was advanced in years and very weak in physical strength. As I sat with him in the privacy of his study, his body was frail, his voice was soft, and words did not come easily. After sitting in uncomfortable silence waiting for him to compose himself enough to advise me as to the purpose of the appointment and visit, he finally said in a still voice of perfect mildness, "I want you to help me." That was my invitation, that was my call to be a General Authority. That was one of my unforgettable quiet experiences with President David O. McKay.<br><br>After leaving his office, I felt I had a better understanding about the Savior's calling of his associates. Whether it be on the shores of Galilee or in the shops or paths of life, I'm certain his invitation could have been nothing more than, "I want you to help me in proclaiming the gospel and being special witnesses to and for me." This experience more than twenty years ago brought a closeness to me to President McKay, a man I had loved, admired, and respected over the years. Before this intimate association I always had the idea that being called to be a General Authority would be a complex procedure.<br><br>Very often today as I prepare for conference talks, I find myself turning to the life and writings of President David O. McKay. He had a beautiful, intelligent capacity to not only say things in a meaningful way but with warmth and spirit. He was a gentle man of high education and lofty principles. He had a way of making me want to do better with each performance and assignment.<br><br>I will always be grateful to him because he quietly called me, expected me, and wanted me to perform special service with him. I left my occupation and former business activities and responsibilities to help him as a prophet. Yes, I tremble today in remembering how he called me with a whisper that pierced my soul.<br><h2><b>He Loved the Lord</b></h2><br>All of my life I had a tremendous respect and high regard for Brother Joseph Fielding Smith as a scriptorian, historian, and writer. He was precise and firm in his living style. What a joy and a blessing it was for me when I came into the Council of the Twelve after two years as an assistant to feel of the sweet love and respect he had not only for God but for his associates. He was kind--at the same time, he led with vision and rigid commitment. He always took the time to express appreciation, not only to his Heavenly Father but to his associates. His kind expressions of encouragement to me under all circumstances will never be forgotten. He loved the Lord, and the Lord loved him. He too called me with a soft, mild voice of deep strength.<br><br>I was ordained an apostle and set apart as a member of the Council of the Twelve under the prophet Joseph Fielding Smith. The charges I received at that time are still indelibly impressed upon my mind, particularly to be a special witness by example, word, and gentleness. Also, it was emphasized I was to listen to the still voice of the Spirit, which would now come in more frequent and powerful sequences in my life.<br><br>Joseph Fielding Smith received his patriarchal blessing from Patriarch Joseph D. Smith in 1913. Included in this sweet and gentle blessing was the promise that he would never be confounded as he defended the divinity of the Prophet Joseph Smith's mission:<br><br><i>You have been blessed with ability to comprehend, to analyze, and defend the principles of truth above many of your fellows, and the time will come when the accumulative evidence that you have gathered will stand as a wall of defense against those who are seeking and will seek to destroy the evidence of the divinity of the mission of the Prophet Joseph; and in this defense you will never be confounded.</i><br><br>Very often over the years of our associations I felt the intense strength of President Joseph Fielding Smith as he served in mildness and with a soft voice.<br><h2><b>"Tune in the Lord"</b></h2><br>On many occasions I have heard President Harold B. Lee share his powerful testimony in perfect mildness. I share this example.<br><br><i>With all my soul and conviction, and knowing the seriousness and import of that testimony, I tell you that I know that He lives. I am conscious of His presence much of the time when I have needed Him most; I have known it out of the</i>whisperings<i>of the night, the</i>impressions<i>of the daytime when there were things for which I was responsible and on which I could receive guidance. So I testify to you and tell you that He is closer to the leaders of this church than you have any idea. Listen to the leaders of this church and follow their footsteps in righteousness, if you would learn not only by study but also by faith, which testimony I bear most humbly and sincerely in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</i>[Elder Harold B. Lee, Council of the Twelve, April 1968; emphasis added]<br><br>President Lee was one of the most spiritual leaders I have ever known. He seemed to have continuous possession of the whisperings of the Spirit. He encouraged me to lead in mildness and quiet patience.<br><br>Very often President Lee shared the following experience he had while serving as president of the Pioneer Stake in Salt Lake City. He felt there was a lesson in it for all. He titled it "Tune in the Lord." I love his soft-spoken yet powerful counseling in this instance. This experience was first shared by President Lee about forty years ago in an address to the Brigham Young University student body.<br><br><i>We had a very grievous case that had to come before the high council and the stake presidency which resulted in the excommunication of a man who had harmed a lovely young girl. After nearly an all-night session which resulted in that action, I went to my office rather weary the next morning to be confronted by a brother of this man whom we had had on trial the night before. This man said, "I want to tell you that my brother wasn't guilty of what you charged him with."</i><br><br><i>"How do you know he wasn't guilty?" I asked.</i><br><br><i>"Because I prayed, and the Lord told me he was innocent," the man answered.</i><br><br><i>I asked him to come into the office and we sat down, and I asked, "Would you mind if I ask you a few personal questions?" He said, "Certainly not."</i><br><br><i>"How old are you?"</i><br><br><i>"Forty-seven. "</i><br><br><i>"What priesthood do you hold?" He said he thought he was a teacher. "Do you keep the Word of Wisdom?" and he said, "Well, no." He used tobacco, which was obvious.</i><br><br><i>"Do you pay your tithing?"</i><br><br><i>He said, "No"--and he didn't intend to as long as that blankety-blank-blank man was bishop of [his ward.]</i><br><br><i>I said, "Do you attend your priesthood meetings?"</i><br><br><i>He replied, "No, sir," and he didn't intend to as long as that man was bishop.</i><br><br><i>"You don't attend your sacrament meetings either?"</i><br><br><i>"No, sir."</i><br><br><i>"Do you have your family prayers?" and he said no.</i><br><br><i>"Do you study the scriptures?" He said well, his eyes were bad and he couldn't read very much.</i><br><br><i>I then said to him: "In my home I have a beautiful instrument called a radio. When everything is in good working order we can dial to a certain station and pick up a speaker or the voice of a singer all the way across the continent.</i>. . .<i>But, after we had used it for a long time, the little delicate instruments or electrical devices on the inside called radio tubes began to wear out.</i>. . .<i>The radio may sit there looking quite like it did before, but because of what has happened on the inside, we can hear nothing."</i><br><br><i>"Now," I said, "you and I have within our souls something like what might be said to be a counterpart of those radio tubes. We might have what we call a "go-to-sacrament-meeting" tube, "keep-the-Word-of-Wisdom" tube, "pay-your-tithing" tube, "have-your-family-prayers" tube, "read-the-Scriptures" tube, and, as one of the most important that might be said to be the master tube of our whole soul, we might call the "keep-yourselves-morally-clean" tube. If one of these becomes worn out by disuse or inactivity--if we fail to keep the commandments of God--it has the same effect upon our spiritual selves that a worn-out tube has in a radio."</i><br><br><i>"Now then," I said, "fifteen of the best-living men in the Pioneer Stake prayed last night. They heard the evidence and every man was united in saying that your brother was guilty. Now, you, who do none of these things, you say you prayed, and you got an opposite answer. How would you explain that?"</i><br><br><i>Then this man gave an answer that I think was a classic. He said, "Well, President Lee, I think I must have gotten my answer from the wrong source." And, you know, that's just as great a truth as we can have.</i>We get our answers from the source of the power we list to obey.<i>If we're following the ways of the Devil, we'll get answers from the Devil. If we're keeping the commandments of God, we'll get our answers from God.</i>[BYU devotional, 15 October 1952; emphasis added]<br><br>President Harold B. Lee served for eighteen months, the shortest period of time of any prophet in our dispensation of time. He had a tremendous impact upon my life. Among other things, by example he encouraged me and others to be quietly fearless in approaching and solving problems and individual behavior. At the same time he pointed the way for me to show a warmth and tenderness in working with all mankind regardless of where they had been or what they had done. Day after day, contacts taught me President Lee could be firm and totally objective. At the same time, he had one of the most tender hearts I have ever witnessed. He charged me to "seek for that spiritual plus which will add to your natural abilities."<br><br>An unforgettable and frightening experience I once had with President Lee was when he invited me to come to his home to participate in giving a blessing to a very sick mutual friend. As we gathered with a few family members, President Lee asked me if I would anoint the brother's head with consecrated oil. This I did humbly and in a spirit of inadequacy. I had never before had the opportunity of having this rich spiritual experience of having a prophet of God seal an anointing that I would pronounce. I recall with vividness even today President Lee's sealing of this ordinance. It seemed to me he was struggling for words, direction, and guidance to give encouragement to this good brother. I had the feeling he wanted to promise him complete recovery and health from a serious malady, but the words didn't come as he pronounced the sealing. It was evident as the seconds passed he was not only troubled but groping for direction that would be positive and rewarding, not only to the recipient but to others in the room who had grave concern over the individual's health. President Lee never did promise health, strength, and recovery to this individual. He gave words of encouragement and touched on the basics of the total gospel plan, but the promise of healing was not forthcoming.<br><br>Immediately following this experience, President Lee took me aside in another room and said softly and in perfect mildness, "Marv, he's not going to get better, is he?"<br><br>I responded to President Lee, "No. I could tell you wanted to promise this type of blessing, but it was apparently not to be." I recall his final comment after we walked away from the family members: "The Lord has other plans, and he determines not only what we promise but what will happen."<br><h2><b>A Prophet of Love</b></h2><br>President Spencer W. Kimball was a prophet of love. He loved God, our Savior Jesus Christ, and all mankind. He was a constant example of warmth and Christlike love. His voice was one of perfect mildness, sometimes even less than a whisper. He was always gentle, firm, and fearless. Many of you will recall at one period in his life he was unable to speak at all because of throat cancer.<br><br>Here are some gentle statements that President Kimball made just after he became President of the Church. All of these seem to be filled with deep love and human maintenance. His voice was never one of thunder, but rather of perfect mildness and love.<br><br><i>Church policy on excommunication:</i>"I think that it will remain in large measure as it has been. President Lee had felt very deeply that there must be some discipline in order to keep the Church clean and free from the sins of the world."<br><br><i>Blacks and the priesthood:</i>"I am not sure that there will be a change, although there could be. We are under the dictates of our Heavenly Father, and this is not my policy or the Church's policy. It is the policy of the Lord who has established it, and I know of no change, although we are subject to revelations of the Lord in case he should ever wish to make a change."<br><br><i>State of affairs in America:</i>"We believe that our people should sustain all the righteous activities and actions of their leaders. We do not feel that there is going to be any total disruption. We have hopes that all may straighten out well and that America might go forward. We are teaching our people to be true and loyal to their respective government."<br><br><i>Message to the members of the Church:</i>"Our message is what it has always been, and our hope is that our people will live the commandments of the Lord. They have been revealed in the holy scriptures and by the living prophets through these many years."<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball was one of the most kind and courageous men I have ever met in my life. His capacity to meet life's issues, life's disappointments, and life's successes with a proper balance and attitude are experiences I shall never forget. How sweet, how humble and sincere was his leadership style. His whispering voice pierced every heart that would listen.<br><br>One morning my office phone rang very early before the secretary had come in. As I picked it up, I recognized the soft voice of President Spencer W. Kimball on the other end of the line. After saying hello, I heard him in his faint voice say, "Marv, I have something I want to talk to you about. Do you mind if I come up to your office and visit?"<br><br>I said, "President Kimball, if you'd like to talk to me, I'll be right down to your office. Would you like me to come?"<br><br>And he gently said, "Would you do that?"<br><br>Courteous, friendly, and willing to be the servant of all, it was his leadership style to never demand or use the influence of his mighty calling to take the lead in what people would do or how they would respond to him. I would have you know that on this occasion he could have said, "Marv, this is President Kimball. Come down to my office right away." Certainly he had the power, authority, and right to ask me to meet with him under any and all circumstances, but instead, as I volunteered to come to his office, he simply said, "Would you be good enough to do that?" He had the kind of approach, humility, mildness, and love that would inspire all of us to sustain and support him and love him under all conditions.<br><br>A few days before he passed away, President Kimball was in the temple on the fourth floor with his associates of the First Presidency and the members of the Twelve. He was so weak and frail that there was every good reason for him to not be there. Before our meeting started, members of the Twelve walked by where he sat to shake his hand and greet him. There was almost no response at all because of the physical drain over the last few months. There was almost no capacity to communicate or respond to the present situation. His hearing was very limited, his eyesight was failing, and his frail body was filled with aches. As I shook his hand privately and felt little or no response, I gave it an extra squeeze. I said, "President Kimball, I'm Marv Ashton." How can I ever forget his last words to me when he looked up just a little and said very softly, "Marv Ashton, I love you."<br><h2><b>A Man of Total Obedience</b></h2><br>President Ezra Taft Benson, our present prophet, is a special friend. I love him and have respect for his life and leadership. He has always conveyed to me a relationship of complete trust and confidence. This sustaining reassurance on his part has made it possible for me when in near or distant places in the Church to make decisions and calls that would be worthy because I knew he expected me to do just that.<br><br>I have admired his constant reminding to all--not only to his associates in high levels of the Church, but to all members--to work with diligence in building not only God's kingdom but in improving our personal lives. He is a man of total obedience. I see him following to the letter those paths of righteousness to which the Lord has given him the responsibility to point, direct, and lead. I have seen him cry with unashamed emotions as he has talked about the wonders, content, and future of the Book of Mormon. Those of us who have been close to him have admired and respected the depth of his comment while we were making decisions of great importance when he would simply say, "Let us do what is best for the kingdom."<br><br>Besides days, weeks, and months of close association, I recall conference sessions with him--including ward, stake, region, and general--where he has always taken the occasion in the beginning to give encouragement and at the conclusion to offer thanks for the contributions that come from us as we make our way. He is a prophet who quietly builds up, delegates, and expects commitments that are unwavering.<br><br>I have always enjoyed his referring to me as one of his brethren. I recall telephoning President Benson while I was away on a stake assignment. A major situation and problem were evident. They were serious enough that I felt the need for his wise counsel. When I finished explaining the facts and developments to him, he said in reassuring mildness and trust, "Do what needs to be done. You have my complete confidence and support."<br><br>President Benson's voice today is reduced almost to a whisper. He leads the First Presidency, the Council of the Twelve, other General Authorities, and the entire Church in a spirit of pure love and perfect mildness.<br><br>Now in his ninety-first year and fifth year as President of the Church, he leads in unwavering faith, using persuasion with a soft voice and penetrating humility. In all my years of experience with him, I have never heard him raise his voice to a shout in moments of hurt or disappointment. I have seen him discipline and direct in mildness, patience, and pure love. How gentle, yet powerful, have been his words and leadership.<br><h2><b>Voices of Perfect Mildness</b></h2><br>These five prophets I have known so well have called and encouraged in a voice and spirit of perfect mildness. I thank God for them. I pray God to help us remember true leaders always lead with mild voices, love, and persuasion.<br><br>Calls and instructions from his prophets are tender and free of condemnation. With all my heart I recommend we accept their leadership of mildness and love as we are invited to serve and improve our daily performances.<br><br>God is our Father. Jesus is the Christ. I hope and pray I will be able to declare these truths in mildness, with conviction, and with great impact all the days of my life. These five wonderful prophets have done their part to try and teach me. Listen to the gentle promptings of the Spirit. Most often our hopes and prayers are best answered by impressions of perfect mildness. I leave you my testimony as to the truthfulness of the Church of Jesus Christ and pray God's blessings to be yours today and in the days to come. May your worthy words of prayer and petitions to God and his leaders be answered in a still voice of perfect mildness, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Marvin J.

<h1>ur Journey - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is such a privilege for me to be with you today. On a day such as this one, I enjoy the ride from Salt Lake to Provo. Don't you love this valley surrounded by the majestic mountains! In a way these "everlasting hills," part of a chain stretching almost unbroken from Alaska to the tip of South America, reflect eternal principles you are learning as you prepare yourselves temporally and spiritually to meet life's challenges.<br><h2><b>The View from the Top</b></h2><br>The Lord has given some of his most meaningful sermons and taught gospel principles on mountains: the Mount of Olives, the Mount of Beatitudes, Mount Sinai. He bestowed his keys of authority to Peter, James, and John on the Mount of Transfiguration.<br><br>Our family has always received inspiration and exhilaration in the nearby mountains. My husband relishes mountain climbing and has taught our family to enjoy it together. He has been the one to cheer us on. There is hardly a peak surrounding Salt Lake Valley that we have not struggled up. We might have even seen some of you on those hills.<br><br>When our children were small, they tired easily and had the normal fears about venturing too far or too high. But, reassuringly, we accompanied them, gave encouraging words and just enough trail mix--our homemade concoction of raisins, nuts, and M&amp;amp;M's--to get us to the summit where we could then enjoy our refreshing oranges and smashed cheese sandwiches. The view from the top is more breathtaking than from below. And the elation of knowing you've made it is even more wonderful! The lingering sore muscles keep that feeling of accomplishment in memory a long time.<br><br>Mark Twain once boasted about "climbing" the Matterhorn in Switzerland. It seems that everyone else in his traveling group had already been to the top, so he hired a professional mountain climber in a bright red coat to hike it for him. There he sat comfortably on the deck of the inn with a hand-held telescope watching the hiker's progress up the snow-covered slopes with ropes, hammer, and pitons in hand. He was amused that he had really put one over on those who followed the traditions of that place. Though he paid for the trip, he did not receive its rewards. He did not feel the shortness of breath, the fatigued muscles, the powerful thirst. Nor did he see the magnificent scenes laid out before the man who conquered the mighty mountain in his place!<br><h2><b>"Climb That Cliff"</b></h2><br>How do<i>we</i>respond when confronted with a seemingly impossible task? All of us face obstacles and challenges and walk paths that lead toward heights we think we cannot ascend. President Rex Lee and Janet have recently shared with us some of the perils of their difficult ascent, which continues to be a steep one.<br><br>Elder Dallin H. Oaks described an experience his great-grandfather Abinadi Olsen had on his mission to the Samoan Islands in 1895. Obedient to the call of the prophet, he left his wife and four small children and traveled by train and ship for twenty-six days to the island of Tutuila.<br><br>After many weeks of living in what he called a grass hut, eating strange food, suffering severe illnesses, and struggling to learn the Samoan language, he seemed to be making no progress in his missionary work. Homesick and discouraged, he seriously considered boarding a boat back to Apia and telling the mission president he didn't want to waste any more time in Samoa. The obstacles seemed insurmountable, and he wished to return to his wife and children, who were struggling to support him in the mission field.<br><br>A friend who heard Abinadi Olsen describe the experience some years after his return, quoted him as follows:<br><br><i>Then one night, as I lay on my mat on the floor of my hut, a strange man entered and in my own language told me to get up and follow him. His manner was such that I had to obey. He led me out through the village and directly up against the face of a perpendicular solid rock cliff. "That's strange," thought I. "I've never seen that here before," and just then the stranger said, "I want you to climb that cliff."</i><br><br><i>I took another look and then in bewilderment said, "I can't. It's impossible!"</i><br><br><i>"How do you know you can't? You haven't tried," said my guide.</i><br><br><i>"But anyone can see"--I started to say in objection. But he cut in with, "Begin climbing. Reach up with your hand--now with your foot."</i><br><br><i>As I reached, under orders that I dared not disobey, a niche seemed to open in the solid rock cliff and I caught hold. Then with my one foot I caught a toe hold.</i><br><br><i>"Now go ahead," he ordered. "Reach with your other hand," and as I did so another place opened up, and to my surprise the cliff began to recede; climbing became easier, and I continued the ascent without difficulty until, suddenly, I found myself lying on my pallet back in my hut. The stranger was gone!</i><br><br><i>"Why has this experience come to me?" I asked myself. The answer came quickly. I had been up against an imaginary cliff for those three months. I had not reached out my hand to begin the climb. I hadn't really made the effort I should have made to learn the language and surmount my other problems.</i><br><br><i>It is hardly necessary to add that Abinadi Olsen did not leave the mission. He labored for three and a half years, until released by appropriate authority. He was an exceptionally effective missionary, and he was a faithful member of the Church for the rest of his life.</i>["Reach Out and Climb!"<i>New Era,</i>August 1985, pp. 4–6]<br><br>Yes, there is pain and hard work involved in the climb, just as you are experiencing in your years in school. No one can travel your journey for you. To hike you need to meet the requirements necessary for the terrain--proper and adequate food, clothing, and equipment. And just as BYU imposes certain requirements, so will others as you continue your upward journey of eternal progression. Some of these requirements are set by society and in the workplace. Some are set by the Lord, and many by you yourselves.<br><br>There will undoubtedly be some "insurmountable cliffs," but generally our challenges consist of continuous peaks and valleys, one hill after another. As Elder Oaks said:<br><br>"Handholds will only be found by hands that are outstretched. Footholds are only for feet that are on the move" (Oaks, "Reach Out and Climb!" p. 6).<br><br>Facing some of life's challenges may require a "leap of faith," where we walk forward with only our faith and trust in the Lord to lead us. It will require all the heart and soul we have to act, to move, to reach out and grasp handholds the Lord will extend to us in times of extremity.<br><br>The Lord has promised to give us no more than we are able to handle. But those who have scaled the highest summit in the world are quick to acknowledge the help of the Sherpa guides without whom they could not have made it. They know that this support system will follow them every step of the way. They have set up base camps at certain distances to provide the necessities for the final assault at the peak. Great preparation, training, and cost have preceded their efforts.<br><br>You too have a never-failing support system. The base camps along the way are filled at various times with parents, family, friends, teachers, leaders, neighbors, or ward members--all cheering you on and providing help whenever needed. Most reliable of all is the companionship of the Holy Ghost, who can be with you at<i>all</i>times, especially when the others cannot.<br><h2><b>Choosing to Build the Kingdom</b></h2><br>This is such a glorious time to be here on earth, witnessing the fulfillment of Daniel's prophecy. He saw a stone cut without hands rolling down a mountain--perhaps one such as these--and filling the whole earth! I was in a meeting just last week with the Brethren. They were so full of the Spirit and excitement of the challenge to establish the Church in lands heretofore prohibited. It seems that almost daily something new occurs that provides more opportunity to take the gospel to other "kindreds, tongues, and people."<br><br>And what has that to do with you here at BYU who are so privileged among the peoples of the world to receive your education and training at a university dedicated to filling the Lord's purposes in these latter days?<br><br>We are not on earth at this time by accident. Because we lived with our Father in Heaven for a long time before we came to earth, he knows everything about us--our strengths and weaknesses, our likes and dislikes, the depth of our faith and testimony, our talents and abilities, the feelings of our hearts. He knows how each of us can use these strengths and characteristics for the building of the kingdom of God in these latter days.<br><br>President Benson said:<br><br><i>All through the ages the prophets have looked down through the corridors of time to our day. Billions of the deceased and those yet to be born have their eyes on us. Make no mistake about it--you are a marked generation. There has never been more expected of the faithful in such a short period of time as there is of us. . . .</i><br><br>. . .<i>Each day we personally make many decisions that show where our support will go. The</i><br><br><i>final outcome is certain--the forces of righteousness will finally win. What remains to be seen is where each of us personally, now and in the future, will stand in this fight--and how tall we will stand. Will we be true to our last-days, foreordained mission?</i>["In His Steps,"<i>BYU Speeches of the Year,</i>1979, pp. 59–60]<br><br>What are the ramifications of the prophet's statement? What meaning can it have for each of us here today?<br><br>In 1974 President Spencer W. Kimball spoke prophetically: "The Lord will open doors when we have done everything in our power" ("When the World Will Be Converted,"<i>Ensign,</i>October 1974, p. 10). He referred to nations and peoples of the world allowing missionaries and members to fulfill their divine missions to bring souls to Christ. Some time afterward I heard a priesthood leader ask a congregation, "How many of you here heard President Kimball say that when we have done all in our power to prepare doors will open?" Many people raised their hands. He then asked those with raised hands, "How many of you have enrolled in a class that matters? Are you taking Mandarin or Russian? If Russian is too hard, start with Spanish." Of course, few, if any, of you students heard President Kimball in 1974. Most of you were small children. But now you have heard it this day. And what are you going to choose to do that really "matters"?<br><br>It has always been a concern to me that as I have shared the anxieties of our children, most of the important decisions upon which our journey of life is based are made between the ages of seventeen and twenty-five, just where most of you students are now. Will I serve a mission? Will I go on to higher education? Where? What will I study? Whom will I marry? Where will I marry? Am I prepared to marry in the Lord's way? What occupation will I select? Do I want to have children? If I am a mother, will I work outside the home? What kind of environment will permeate my future home, whether it is an apartment, condo, or bungalow? Will it invite or repel the Spirit? These and other questions have been or must be answered by both men and women here today. Decisions such as these are not always based on choices of good and evil, but on good judgment, obedience, values, established patterns.<br><br>Life is a journey, not a destination. Elder Boyd K. Packer stated: "Our lives are made up of thousands of everyday choices. Over the years these little choices will be bundled together and show clearly what we value" ("The Choice,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1980, p. 21). During our lifetime each of us will have countless decisions to make. Many of them will have great consequences and impact on our lives both here and in eternity. From the time Adam and Eve exercised their freedom of choice (Moses 3:17), their posterity has been faced, as<i>they</i>were, with choices between good and evil.<br><br>Elder Packer has acknowledged that<br><br><i>the crucial test of life . . . does not center in the choice between fame and obscurity, nor between wealth and poverty. The greatest decision of life is between good and evil. . . .</i><br><br><i>Some are tested by poor health, some by a body that is deformed or homely. Others are tested by handsome and healthy bodies; some by the passion of youth; others by the erosions of age.</i><br><br><i>Some suffer disappointment in marriage,</i><br><br><i>family problems; others live in poverty and obscurity. Some (perhaps this is the hardest test) find ease and luxury.</i>[Packer, "The Choice," p. 21]<br><br>The Book of Mormon emphasizes a recurring theme: the need to choose between being spiritually minded or carnally minded. President Thomas S. Monson has spoken of the importance of choosing between these two kinds of "mindedness" when he said, "We . . . have the responsibility to choose. We cannot be neutral. There is no middle ground. The Lord knows this; Lucifer knows this" ("3R's of Free Agency,"<i>New Era,</i>April 1973, p. 4).<br><br>My brothers and sisters, how essential it is to make decisions anchored in gospel principles! By seeking the guidance of the Spirit, we can be assured of divine help. We need to remember our covenants and live accordingly in whatever walk of life we find ourselves. You are different from the rest of the world! You are a covenanted people! It is important to remember that in our premortal life we accepted and sustained the divine plan presented there. We understood much of what we would be asked to do. As President Spencer W. Kimball said:<br><br><i>We made vows, solemn vows, in the heavens before we came to this mortal life. . . . We have made covenants</i>.<i>We made them before we accepted our position here on the earth. . . . We committed ourselves to our Heavenly Father, that if he would send us to the earth and give us bodies and give to us the priceless opportunities that earth life afforded, we would keep our lives clean and would marry in the holy temple and would rear a family and teach them righteousness. This was a solemn oath, a solemn promise.</i>[From a talk at the University of Utah Institute of Religion, 10 January 1975, p. 2]<br><br>Do not forget that the Lord desires strong marriages and families. These are not easily achieved in today's world where "siren sounds" of materialism, infidelity, and carnal mindedness pull us toward selfishness and pride. The family is in critical condition! Its health is being threatened from many sides. We need not look far for evidence of its deterioration, even within the Church.<br><br>Addressing 2,000 people at the Conservative Women's Conference in London, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher described the family as the "building block of society," saying it "far surpassed the state in the provision of welfare" and "fashioned the beliefs of succeeding generations."<br><br>"Policy must be further directed at strengthening the family," she added. "It encompasses the whole of the society. It fashions our beliefs. It is the preparation for the rest of our life." (See<i>Church News,</i>9 July 1988, p. 5.)<br><br>President Thomas S. Monson commented on her remarks, noting that "perhaps the world, at long last, is recognizing that strong families play a vital role in the stability of a nation and, indeed, the world" (<i>Church News,</i>9 July 1988, p. 5). Referring to the home and family as the most important job of all, C. S. Lewis said it "is the one for which all others exist."<br><br>How desperately we need the training and preparation necessary in these troubled times where marriages and families are disintegrating all around us. It is reassuring that the latest figures from the American Home Economics Association show that BYU has twice as many student members as any other college or university in the state. The rumor that "you can't major in home economics anymore at BYU" can be laid to rest. The home economics (certification) major will continue.<br><br>We simply cannot do too much in this regard. Too much is at stake. President Benson has declared that Satan seeks to destroy an entire generation. Is he working with you? Will he get to your children? The family is in peril! Let us prepare as never before because we face a spiritual life-and-death time in our families' journey.<br><br>The greatest help you will ever have in this life is the Holy Ghost! Cultivate him as a friend and constant companion. We are promised that "God shall give unto you knowledge by his Holy Spirit, yea, by the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost, that has not been revealed since the world was until now" (D&amp;amp;C 121:26).<br><br>Think of it! You who have been baptized have received an "unspeakable" power! A power to help with the multitude of decisions, a power to teach, to warn, to comfort. It helps us love more deeply, serve more unselfishly, live more fully.<br><br>Scriptures, too, will help in the decision-making process. Nephi taught us to "feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do" (2 Nephi 32:3). We are promised that when we read the scriptures, we can testify that we have heard his voice and know his words (see D&amp;amp;C 18:36).<br><br>Someone has said that when we want to talk to the Lord, we pray, and when he wants to talk to us, it is through the scriptures: "For it is my voice which speaketh them unto you; for they are given by my Spirit unto you, and by my power you can read them one to another" (D&amp;amp;C 18:35).<br><br>We need to learn to be obedient, not only to the prophets who lead us today, but to the promptings of the Spirit. Elder Richard G. Scott learned this lesson on a Sunday in Mexico City when he sat listening to a priesthood lesson. The teacher wasn't a great scholar, and his presentation was not polished. But it was obvious that he loved the Lord and his brethren and had a humble desire to share the gospel with them. A sacred feeling enveloped the room.<br><br>As he listened, Elder Scott received a spiritual confirmation of the lesson's message and also some impressions for his personal benefit. He wrote them down and found that he had been given precious truths he greatly needed to be a more effective servant of the Lord. Through the morning, he continued writing the impressions that poured into his mind and heart.<br><br>Then Elder Scott said:<br><br><i>I don't think my experience in receiving promptings is different from others. But I believe we often leave precious personal direction of the Spirit unheard because we do not record and respond to the first promptings that come to us when we are in need or when impressions come in response to urgent prayer.</i>[<i>Tambuli,</i>February 1990, pp. 22–23]<br><h2><b>A Commitment to Serve</b></h2><br>We have talked about prayer, scripture study, and obedience. Of what value are they unless they are accompanied by a commitment to serve others, to build the kingdom of God as Daniel saw it, and to "bring again Zion"? (See D&amp;amp;C 113:8.)<br><br>So many of us say, "I know the gospel's true, but . . ." This is a terrestrial kind of thinking. We place barriers between what we<i>believe</i>and what we are willing to<i>do</i>to apply it. The Lord has made it abundantly clear that we are to do the work we have seen him do. We demonstrate a celestial attitude when we can truly say, "I know the gospel's true. Therefore . . ." You see the difference? It is precisely<i>because</i>of our faith and testimony of our Savior that we are<i>willing</i>to do what he asks us to do, even to do what needs to be done without being asked!<br><br>A commitment to serve may be best expressed within our homes. Don't forget--that apartment or dormitory you live in is your home for now, and your roommates are "family." There are countless opportunities in the sphere of your influence at this time to serve, to selflessly place someone else's needs before your own. Are you home teaching? Visiting teaching? Accepting a calling in your ward? Loving your companion? And for those with children--are you teaching and training them?<br><br>Our service may take us to other places, some far away. We have been told that the first ten missionaries to Czechoslovakia are being processed right now. There isn't even a language training program at the MTC for them yet. What a "leap of faith" for them. May the Lord bless them in their "seemingly insurmountable cliffs." They need only to reach out and take hold with willing hands and place their feet where the Lord will take them.<br><br>President Thomas S. Monson has described such a "leap of faith" with Elder John H. Groberg.<br><br><i>As a lad just twenty, called to the Tongan Mission, he was assigned to an outer island with a native missionary. After eight seasick days and sleepless nights on a storm-tossed sea, they reached their destination. Not one soul on the island spoke English. Here he acquired his gift of the language. Then came a devastating hurricane which struck the isolated island with tropical intensity, destroying the food crop and contaminating the water supply. There was no means of communication with the outside world. The supply boat was not due for almost two months. After four weeks the precious store of food, mainly taro, a native vegetable, was severely rationed. Four additional weeks passed. All food was gone. No help arrived. Bodies became emaciated, hope dwindled, confidence waned, some died. In desperation, John Groberg waded into the swampland where insects covered his face and, with a sweep of his hand, entered his mouth-- his only nourishment.</i><br><br><i>The end drew near. The island's inhabitants sat in an idle stupor. One morning, nine weeks from the time of the hurricane, John Groberg felt a gentle hand upon his shoulder. He turned his head and gazed into the eyes of an elderly Tongan man. Slowly and with meticulous care, the old man unwrapped a precious prize, even his most treasured possession--a small can of berry jam. He spoke: "I am old; I think I may die. You are young; you may live. Accept my gift."</i><br><br><i>What were the words penned by Charles Dickens in a</i>Tale of Two Cities?<i>"It is a far, far better thing that I do than I have ever done; it is a far, far, better rest that I go to than I have ever known." Add to them the declaration of the Savior: "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."</i><br><br><i>Then came the speck on the horizon and a shout of joy as the supply ship came into view.</i>[Thomas S. Monson, "The Miracle of the Friendly Islands,"<i>CR,</i>5 October 1968]<br><br>We learn a lot about Elder Groberg's commitment to serve, but think also of the old Tongan who was willing to give all he had to save another's life. It symbolizes the atonement of one who also was willing to give all for each of us.<br><br>We were given the power to make choices in the premortal existence. The gift of agency followed us into mortality. We not only can control our choices, but we can control our attitudes. While we may not always be in control of all that happens in our lives, we can yet be in control of how we respond to those events.<br><br>Don't let your fears of the unknown cause you to procrastinate and paralyze your efforts. In Don Quixote, Sancho Panza spent the night clinging to a window sill for fear of falling to his death, only to discover the next morning that his feet were only a few inches from the ground.<br><br>Enjoy your journey! Yes, there is a lifetime of mountains to climb, summits to reach. "To miss the joy is to miss it all!" There<i>are</i>valleys as well as peaks, broken bones as well as victory feasts, exhaustion as well as jubilation. And through it all, we can follow our Savior who seems to be saying, "Come, follow me. I am here. The view from where I am is so much better and clearer. I can see the past, present, and future all at the same time and they are continually before me" (see D&amp;amp;C 130:7).<br><br>May you prepare prayerfully, trusting in the Lord who knows each of you by name and who cares so much that you make the right decisions about what matters most. May you help further the work of these latter days in establishing the "mountain that will fill the whole earth that will stand forever," I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Barbara W. Winder was general president of the Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 13 March 1990.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>ere Is No Vision - L. Tom Perry - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
A few years ago on an assignment to Tonga, I was asked to speak to the student body at the Liahona School. As we gathered on the stand, I gazed out over 900 beautiful students seated before me in the school's cultural hall. After the opening exercises and a special musical number, the entire student body entered into a scripture chase. Scriptural questions were introduced, and all the students who could immediately find the answer in the scriptures would turn to it and then stand up signifying their success in locating the correct scripture. After each question, a number were eliminated. Finally, only six students remained. They were brought up to the front of the hall for the final challenge.<br><br>To make everything even, they were invited to place their scriptures on their heads. The instructor would then read the question, and the participants would reach for their scriptures, take them from their heads, find the scriptures, and then hold up their hands signifying success. The first hand in the air was the scripture chase champion.<br><br>The young lady who was the winner was absolutely amazing! She placed the scriptures on her head, listened intently to the question, bowed her head, and her scriptures would fall open in her hands on the page with the correct answer. She was so efficient I thought there must be some trick attached to the game. So I asked the instructor for the list of questions and gave her my set of scriptures. Then I challenged the six students to respond to the question that I would ask, requiring her to use my scriptures to find the answer. She was clearly the winner again, even using my set of scriptures. She was truly a most remarkable young lady.<br><br>Tonight I want to use a scripture chase to demonstrate the theme I want to address this evening. I am going to ask four students to participate with me in a scripture chase. The first will be using a Bible printed in 1842, probably a Bible similar to the one the Prophet was using in his studies. The second will use one I carried with me into the mission field in the early 1940s. The third will use our latest edition, printed in 1979. The fourth student will be using the computerized scriptures program, LDS-View. The 1842 edition has a concordance. My mission field edition has a ready reference. The 1979 edition has a topical guide. The computer has a program. I will present the scripture I will use as my theme this evening and ask each of the students to find the scripture using the helps each one has available to locate the reference.<br><br>The scripture is <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/prov/29.18?lang=eng#17">Proverbs 29:18</a>: "Where there is no vision, the people perish." Of course, it was obvious even before this demonstration was started that the computer would be much more rapid than the scriptures we have used before. Scholarship and technology have opened to us new visions and new opportunities to grow and understand as never before. The demonstration also begs the question, Where do we stand as individuals in using these wonderful, beautiful techniques the world is supplying for us today?<br><br>Are we still scriptorians of the 1842s, the 1940s, the 1979s, or are we so excited about what the world has to offer for us in this age that we're eager to take advantage of each opportunity presented to us?<br><h2><b>Opportunities to Benefit Our Fellowmen</b></h2><br>The key word in the scripture we used in our scripture chase is<i>vision.</i>The dictionary has four specific definitions for the word<i>vision.</i>First, "something seen in a dream, trance, or ecstasy; a supernatural appearance that conveys a revelation." The second, "the act or power of imagination; mode of seeing or conceiving; unusual discernment or foresight." The third meaning, "the act or power of seeing; sight." The last and fourth definition is "something seen; a lovely or charming sight."<br><br>The one I would like to make reference to here tonight is the second definition: "the act or power of imagination; mode of seeing or conceiving; unusual discernment or fore sight."<br><br>We are living in a most remarkable period of change. Look what has happened in just the last few months. A short time ago bold headlines on the front of<i>Time</i>magazine declared, "Freedom! The Wall crumples overnight. Berliners embrace in unbelievable joy, and a stunned world ponders the consequences." The article inside goes on to say,<br><br><i>For twenty-eight years it has stood as a symbol of the division of Europe and the world, the Berlin Wall, that hideous, twenty-eight mile-long scar through the heart of the once-proud European capital--not to mention the souls of the people. And then, poof! It was gone, not physically, at least yet, but gone as an effective barrier between the East and West, opening in one unthinkable, stunning stroke to the people who had been kept apart for more than a generation. It was one of those rare times when history shifts beneath men's feet, and nothing after is quite the same.</i><br><br>Once there was a break in the wall, there was no way of containing the spirit of the people and their desire to have freedom. A little more than a month later, after these two remarkable articles, the Romanians were trying to comprehend their newfound freedom. A news correspondent for the Associated Press on December thirtieth wrote:<br><br><i>In a passion that fueled Romanian revolution, freedom was spoken again and again. But to a people forced to register even their typewriters, the full meaning of the exotic word was difficult to grasp. "What is it to live free, to travel free, to speak free?" said a young medical student. "We have only seen darkness and silence." Over the moans of the wounded in the crowded hospital ward, she and some fellow volunteers considered what the term "freedom" meant. "We cannot realize what freedom is," said another student. "You grow up in freedom, and you do not realize what it means to us." She paused and frowned and apologized for poor English. "I am sorry," she said, "I learn English eleven years, and this is the first time I speak it." We don't know what freedom means. We don't know what to do with freedom. We have no experience, no model, no ideal.</i><br><br>As I have witnessed these exciting events during the last few months, the privilege of living under a system that grants to us the right to live free suddenly has become much more meaningful to me. Maybe it is time for us to listen to their cries and with self-determination make every effort to really understand what this great, God-given blessing means to us here in mortality. Now other nations are anxious for the light of freedom we have enjoyed for over two hundred years. We should become a beacon to lead them to more fulfilling lives. Never has the opportunity and challenge been greater to make our system work the way it was intended than it is today.<br><br>We are assembled here as a body of students seeking a higher education. What talent and innate abilities we have brought together under this Marriott Center roof! Let us sit and reason together for a few minutes on how we can maximize the potential power that is in each of us for the benefit of our fellowmen. The first step would be to take full advantage of the educational opportunities available to us at these institutions in which we are currently enrolled.<br><br>There is a New Testament scripture that reads:<br><br><i>For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?</i><br><br><i>Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,</i><br><br><i>Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/14.28-30?lang=eng#p27">Luke 14:28–30</a>]<br><br>I am afraid there are many of us who have approached our education and life without a vision of what we want or where we want to go. We have not used our power of imagination, or any mode of seeing or conceiving, or any discernment or foresight. Often I meet full-time missionaries in the field who are ready to return to their homes after completing very successful missions. I ask them, "What comes next?"<br><br>Some answer, "I am going to return to school."<br><br>"What are your education objectives?" I ask. The answers come back: doctors, lawyers, merchants, or some other field.<br><br>I meet them some months later after they are enrolled in a university or college, and I inquire how their plans are progressing. Many answer, "Oh, I have changed my mind. I am not going to be a doctor. I didn't like the chemistry requirements."<br><br>The next question, "What are you pursuing now?"<br><br>The answer is all too often, "I am in university studies until I can determine the direction I should take."<br><br>Now there is nothing wrong with university studies if it is a well thought-out objective that will lead to something. If it is just a way of marking time until you determine a career you want to pursue, then you are wasting your own precious time and resources and those of the university you are attending.<br><br>There was an article in the newspaper the other night that said most university students are taking six years to complete a four-year course. The main reason for the extended time was the periodic change of majors. For a number of reasons, some of you are approaching your schooling as if you are going to the grocery store and using your hard-earned money to purchase four sacks of groceries, paying for all four, and then leaving one on the check stand and walking out.<br><br>Not taking advantage of your opportunities in a<i>timely</i>fashion, whether here or in any college or university, creates at least two problems. First, there is a great personal loss to you in both time and resources. Second, you are creating a burden on the Church and/or the state, who carry much of the financial commitment for your education. You are occupying a place and using a resource that someone else could use--one who has not been able to enroll because the schools are filled and, in fact, over their capacities to accept new students. If you are still searching for the direction in which you would like your life to go, maybe time away from school would help you catch the vision you need to give you a direction to pursue.<br><br>It is not my objective here tonight to discourage any of you from earnestly seeking after the best education you are capable of obtaining. Without it, you place yourself in a disadvantaged position in an ever-changing world. What I am trying to say is pray, study, seek, plan, test, discuss, and earnestly strive not for the easy and comfortable way, but for the soul-satisfying, diligent, energetic course that will lead you to the opportunities you are seeking.<br><br>Enrollment at a school of higher learning is not classified under the heading of an "entitlement" as a result of your birthright, but as a privilege to be appreciated and taken advantage of to the best of your abilities.<br><h2><b>Opportunities for Growth</b></h2><br>I want to leave you with a couple of concepts to remind you that setting goals brings growth. Thoreau reminded us that men were born to succeed and not to fail. The line between success and failure may be so fine that we scarcely know when we pass it. Often we throw up our hands at times when a little effort and a little more patience would have achieved success. Persistence can turn what seems to be hopeless failure into joyous success. There is no failure except in no longer trying. Failure is not in falling down, but in staying down. There is a single factor that makes for successful living. It is the ability to draw dividends from defeat.<br><br>I would like to talk about the premise that growth is the only sign of real life. We accept this premise in the plant kingdom, and each spring we look for signs of growth to determine if plants have survived the winter and are indeed alive. I believe this is also true for individuals, for families, for businesses, for the Church. Growth is essential to maintain life and vitality. When we think of growth, most of us think of just adding. Growth really has three dimensions: adding, shedding and, perhaps the most important, leveraging our natural God-given talents and strengths. I believe success in any and all dimensions of our lives comes primarily from leveraging our strengths and gifts. I would define "leveraging" for our purpose tonight as using the power and effectiveness we have within us to organize our strengths to gain greater advantage from them.<br><br>When I am in need of special motivation to leverage myself toward greater accomplishment, I find that events recorded in the scriptures always seem to inspire and never grow old. Let me use as an example the story of Joseph in Egypt.<br><br>Imagine you are Joseph and you find yourself in this situation. In Genesis, chapter 37, we read a remarkable story about a family who had a large number of boys. One of the sons, Joseph, was loved by his father more than his other brothers. To show his love and appreciation for his son, his father made him a coat of many colors. "And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/37.4?lang=eng#p3">Genesis 37:4</a>).<br><br>Joseph didn't help matters much. He dreamed dreams and then would tell them to his brethren, and they hated him even more. Can you imagine how they felt about a dream like this? He said to his brothers:<br><br><i>Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:</i><br><br><i>For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.</i><br><br><i>And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/37.6-8?lang=eng#p5">Genesis 37:6–8</a>]<br><br>To complicate the process, his father allowed Joseph to stay home with him, and sent his brethren out into the fields to tend the flocks. Every now and then he would send Joseph out to check up on his brothers. One day when they saw him coming from afar, they felt as if they could stand him no longer and conspired to slay him. They conceived a plan whereby they would kill him and cast him into a pit, then tell their father some wild beast had devoured Joseph.<br><br>One of them had compassion on Joseph and did not want the blood of his brother on his hands. He persuaded his brothers to just cast him into a pit where they would not be responsible for his death. Another brother saw a caravan coming from a distance on its way to Egypt and said:<br><br><i>What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?</i><br><br><i>Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/37.26-27?lang=eng#p25">Genesis 37:26–27</a>]<br><br>And they took their seventeen-year-old brother and sold him as a slave to a caravan going into Egypt, a strange land where they spoke a strange tongue and had strange customs. But the Lord was with this remarkable young man, and he seemed never to be discouraged. Though a stranger and a slave, his countenance must have radiated a special spirit. When offered for sale, he was purchased by a captain of the king's guard. It was only a short time before Joseph had so distinguished himself to the captain that he was made ruler over the whole house. In authority he was the first servant, and he was made overseer over all the captain had, and the captain put his complete trust, his properties, and his income into the hands of Joseph.<br><br>Joseph was a "goodly person" and achieved a position of prominence through the help of the Lord. But trouble began again. This handsome, young man attracted the eyes of the wife of the captain of the guard. One day when he was working alone in the house, she heard him and came in and put her hand on his coat. Joseph, being a righteous young man, knew that this was no place for him, and he loosed himself from the garment she held and fled. The wife was left holding Joseph's garment in her hand. The scriptures record that he "got him out" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/39.12?lang=eng#p11">Genesis 39:12</a>). Let me point out here that Joseph knew enough to physically remove himself from this situation. He did not stay and permit himself to be tempted when he knew it was wrong.<br><br>When her husband returned home, she told a terrible story about Joseph, and the captain became so angry he had Joseph cast into prison. Once again in his young life, he found himself in great difficulty--this time in prison.<br><br>But Joseph was not easily discouraged. He set about to become the best prisoner in the prison, and he gained favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison--insomuch so that the scriptures record, "And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/39.22?lang=eng#p21">Genesis 39:22</a>).<br><br>You see, Joseph was given the position of the highest prisoner, and all the prisoners were turned over to his charge. Again in difficult circumstances, Joseph became the best--even as a prisoner he chose the course that led to his growth.<br><br>Cast into prison shortly after Joseph were two of the king's officers, the chief butler and the chief baker. Joseph soon became acquainted with them. Both of them had dreams, and they asked him to interpret their dreams. Joseph was able to do this because he was a righteous man. To one he said, "You will not get out of prison, but lose your life here." To the other he said, "You will soon have the opportunity of returning to your position of honor with the pharaoh." Then he asked the one who would soon be restored to his former position to please remember him to the pharaoh so he could be released from prison.<br><br>The chief butler was restored to his position of prominence in the king's service, but forgot all about Joseph in prison for two full years. One day the king had a dream that none of the wise men could interpret. When the chief butler remembered Joseph, he went to the king and said there was a man in prison who could interpret the dream. The pharaoh sent for Joseph. And Joseph, with the inspiration of the Lord, interpreted the king's dream. The king was so impressed with Joseph that he released him from prison and made him one of his servants. Joseph again so distinguished himself that he became chief in all the land, second only to the pharaoh himself. He turned every situation he encountered into an opportunity for growth.<br><br>Because of the service Joseph rendered, the pharaoh said unto his servants, "Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/41.38?lang=eng#p37">Genesis 41:38</a>). The pharaoh recognized that he was, indeed, directed by the Lord when he said unto Joseph, "Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/41.39?lang=eng#p38">Genesis 41:39</a>).<br><br>Do you see what Joseph's response was when he was faced with problems? He leveraged every opportunity to take advantage of his situation, to place himself in a position where he could grow, progress, and achieve. In order to maximize our growth, we must identify and be clear on what our natural gifts and talents are. These can be determined in a number of ways, including patriarchal blessings, keeping a track record of our accomplishments, specific testing, talking to others, etc. In our life's planning, if we want to have optimal opportunities for success, we need to align ourselves with our natural strengths and gifts.<br><h2><b>Struggles Make Us Stronger</b></h2><br>We need to consistently and carefully select a few items to add to our growth, including ways of thinking about things, behavior, specific capabilities, and knowledge of skills. In addition to adding, we also need to identify the one or two items that seem to get in our way, that are barriers to our growth, and then shed them. These might include ways of thinking about things or behavior or habits or lack of decision making or whatever they may be. This approach to growth recognizes individual uniqueness and the distinctiveness God has given each one of us, and then positions us to leverage our uniqueness and distinctiveness for our success. This does not assume the path of least resistance, nor does it presume any particular measure of success. It does not assume an economic measure, but rather focuses on becoming all that we can become.<br><br>Let us look at learning. A. G. Bennett, in his book on transformation (Claremont Publications, 1978), says: The ability to learn is so precious a quality that it cannot disappear from the perfected man. To be able to learn is to be young, and whosoever keeps the joy of learning fresh within him remains young forever. The ignorant man is like a prisoner that languishes in a narrow cell that will become his grave, because he has not learned that the door is not locked.<br><br>Everyone can find within himself or herself inward attitudes of mind and outward habits of behavior that are contrary to their own ideals. Struggle with oneself could also be called self-discipline. Through struggle we become stronger. By ceasing to struggle, we grow weaker. So long as we are dissatisfied and do not know what we really want, we shall probably do plenty of foolish things. Self-knowledge and struggle with oneself go hand in hand.<br><br>Organize your struggles. Choose with what you will struggle. Persistence will do what cannot be achieved by force--persistence is the twin sister of excellence. Do not be afraid of struggle. Remember that what is a present struggle is a key to future happiness. Never stop to regret failures or to excuse them. Paul encouraged us to forget our failures and move on when he told the Philippians, "This one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/philip/3.13?lang=eng#p12">Philippians 3:13</a>).<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball has said that life gives to all a choice.<br><br><i>We can satisfy ourselves with mediocrity. We can be common, ordinary, dull, colorless, or we can so channel our lives to be clean, vibrant, progressive, colorful, and rich.</i>[<i>TSWK,</i>p. 161]<br><h2>Catch the Vision</h2><br>My prayer for all of us here tonight is that with this life of choices we may realize who we are and the potential we have, that we may start today disciplining ourselves to reach for higher goals, to study, to learn, to grow, to determine the course we want to follow as we go through the opportunities of this great mortal experience. We<i>must</i>catch the vision of who we really are, for "Where there is no vision, the people perish" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/prov/29.18?lang=eng#p17">Proverbs 29:18</a>). The Lord will truly bless us mightily with his spirit if we only do our part and utilize the talents and opportunities he has given us, setting our direction on a course that will lead us back to his presence.<br><br>It is always a joy to come to this great place to be with you vibrant, alive students who have so much to offer the world. What a privilege we're having! What an opportunity! What a contribution we can make to the world in which we live if we'll only follow the counsel, study, listen, grow, and realize our potential here. Never be satisfied with where you are. Always be reaching out to make the world a better place, to make your sacrifice for the benefit of your fellowmen. Start tomorrow morning with your roommate. Get up and do something nice for her or him. It might be quite a shock to them the first time you try it. We don't want to have any heart attacks in the morning, so start with something slow and easy. But see what light that brings into your life as you have the opportunity to make that kind of a contribution.<br><br>We leave our blessing on each one of you that you may realize your great potential and opportunity--that you may seize upon it and use this opportunity to do the best you can to bring joy and happiness into a great and troubled world. The Lord lives. Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world. He has led the way, not through an easy life, but through one most difficult, to give us the greatest of all blessings.<br><br>May we follow and be his disciples as we progress through life is my prayer, in the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>L.

<h1>g Christ: A Practical Approach to the Atonement - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The greatest dichotomy, the greatest problem in the entire universe, consists of two facts. The first we can read in Doctrine and Covenants 1:31: "For I the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance." That means he can't stand it, he can't tolerate it, he can't blink, or look the other way, or sweep it under the rug. He can't tolerate sin in the least degree. The other side of the dichotomy is very simply put: I sin, and so do you. If that were all there were to the equation, the conclusion would be inescapable that we, as sinful beings, cannot be tolerated in the presence of God.<br><br>But that is not all there is to the equation. This morning I would like to talk to you about the Atonement of Christ, that glorious plan by which this dichotomy can be resolved. I would like to share with you incidents from my own life that illustrate how the Atonement works in a practical, everyday setting.<br><h2><b>Believing Christ</b></h2><br>First is a story about my son, Michael, who did something wrong when he was six or seven years old. He's my only son, and I'm hard on him. I want him to be better than his dad was, even as a boy, and so I lean on him and expect a great deal. Well, he had done something I thought was incredibly vile, and I let him know how terrible it was. I sent him to his room with the instructions, "Don't you dare come out until I come and get you."<br><br>And then I forgot. It was some hours later, as I was watching television, that I heard his door open and heard the tentative footsteps coming down the hall. I said, "Oh, my gosh," and ran to my end of the hall to see him standing with swollen eyes and tears on his cheeks at the other end. He looked up at me--he wasn't quite sure he should have come out--and said, "Dad, can't we ever be friends again?" Well, I melted, ran to him, and hugged him. He's my boy, and I love him.<br><br>Like Michael, we all do things that disappoint our Father, that separate us from his presence and spirit. There are times when we get sent to our rooms spiritually. There are sins that maim; there are sins that wound our spirits. Some of you know what it is like to do something that makes you feel as if you just drank raw sewage. You can wash, but you can never get clean. When that happens, sometimes we ask the Lord as we lift up our eyes, "O Father, can't we ever be friends again?"<br><br>The answer that can be found in all the scriptures is a resounding "Yes, through the Atonement of Christ." I particularly like the way it is put in Isaiah 1:18.<br><br><i>Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</i><br><br>I like to paraphrase that for my students. What the Lord is saying is "I don't care what you did. It doesn't matter what you did. I can erase it. I can make you pure and worthy and innocent and celestial."<br><br>Brothers and sisters, to have faith in Jesus Christ is not merely to believe that he is who he says he is, to believe in Christ. Sometimes, to have faith in Christ is also to believe Christ. Both as a bishop and as a teacher in the Church, I have learned there are many that believe Jesus is the Son of God and that he is the Savior of the World, but that he cannot save them. They believe in his identity, but not in his power to cleanse and to purify and to save. To have faith in his identity is only half the process. To have faith in his ability, in his power to cleanse and to save, that is the other half. We must not only believe in Christ, we must believe Christ when he says, "I can cleanse you and make you celestial."<br><br>When I was a bishop, I used to hear several variations on a theme. Sometimes it was, "Bishop, I've punched my ticket wrong. I've just made mistakes that have gotten me off on the wrong track, and you can't get there from here." I've heard those who say, "Bishop, I've sinned too horribly. I can't have the full blessings of the gospel because I did this, or I did that. I'll come to Church, and I'll be active, and I'm hoping for a pretty good reward, but I couldn't receive the full blessings of exaltation in the celestial kingdom after what I've done." There are those members who say, "Bishop, I'm just an average Saint. I'm weak and imperfect, and I don't have all the talents that Sister So-and-So does, or Brother So-and-So does. I'll never be in the bishopric, or I'll never be the Relief Society president. I'm just average. I hope for a place a little further down." All of these are variations of the same theme: "I do not believe Christ can do what he claims. I have no faith in his ability to exalt me."<br><br>My favorite is a fellow who said to me once, "Bishop, I'm just not celestial material." Well, I'd had enough, so I said back to him, "Why don't you admit your problem? You're not celestial material? Welcome to the club. None of us are! None of us qualify on the terms of perfection required for the presence of God by ourselves. Why don't you just admit that you don't have faith in the ability of Christ to do what he says he can do?"<br><br>He got angry. He had always believed in Christ. He said, "I have a testimony of Jesus. I believe in Christ."<br><br>I said, "Yes, you believe in Christ. You simply do not believe Christ, because he says even though you are not celestial material, he can<i>make</i>you celestial material."<br><h2><b>Why He Is Called the Savior</b></h2><br>Sometimes the weight of the demand for perfection drives us to despair. Sometimes we fail to believe that most choice portion of the gospel that says he can change us and bring us into his kingdom. Let me share an experience that happened about ten years ago. My wife and I were living in Pennsylvania. Things were going pretty well; I'd been promoted. It was a good year for us, though a trying year for Janet. That year she had our fourth child, graduated from college, passed the CPA exam, and was made Relief Society president. We had temple recommends, we had family home evening. I was in the bishopric. I thought we were headed for "LDS yuppiehood." Then one night the lights went out. Something happened in my wife that I can only describe as "dying spiritually." She wouldn't talk about it; she wouldn't tell me what was wrong. That was the worst part. For a couple of weeks she did not wish to participate in spiritual things. She asked to be released from her callings, and she would not open up and tell me what was wrong.<br><br>Finally, after about two weeks, one night I made her mad and it came out. She said, "All right. You want to know what's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong. I can't do it anymore. I can't lift it. I can't get up at 5:30 in the morning and bake bread and sew clothes and help my kids with their homework and do my own homework and do my Relief Society stuff and get my genealogy done and write the congressman and go to the PTA meetings and write the missionaries . . ." And she just started naming one brick after another that had been laid on her, explaining all the things she could not do. She said, "I don't have the talent that Sister Morrell has. I can't do what Sister Childs does. I try not to yell at the kids, but I lose control, and I do. I'm just not perfect, and I'm not ever going to be perfect. I'm not going to make it to the celestial kingdom, and I've finally admitted that to myself. You and the kids can go, but I can't lift it. I'm not 'Molly Mormon,' and I'm not ever going to be perfect, so I've given up. Why break my back?"<br><br>Well, we started to talk, and it was a long night. I asked her, "Janet, do you have a testimony?"<br><br>She said, "Of course I do! That's what's so terrible. I know it's true. I just can't do it."<br><br>"Have you kept the covenants you made when you were baptized?"<br><br>She said, "I've tried and I've tried, but I cannot keep all the commandments all the time."<br><br>Then I rejoiced because I knew what was wrong, and I could see the light at the end of the tunnel. It wasn't any of those horrible things I thought it might be. Who would have thought after eight years of marriage, after all the lessons we'd given and heard, and after all we had read and done in the Church, who would have thought that Janet did not know the gospel of Jesus Christ? You see, she was trying to save herself. She knew why Jesus is a coach, a cheerleader, an advisor, a teacher. She knew why he is an example, the head of the Church, the Elder Brother, or even God. She knew all of that, but she did not understand why he is called the<i>Savior.</i><br><br>Janet was trying to save herself with Jesus as an advisor. Brothers and sisters, we can't. No one can. No one is perfect--not even the Brethren. Please turn to Ether 3:2. This is about one of the greatest prophets that ever lived, the brother of Jared. His faith is so great that he is about to pierce the veil and see the spiritual body of Christ. As he begins to pray, he says,<br><br><i>Now behold, O Lord, and do not be angry with thy servant because of his weakness before thee;</i>[One of the greatest prophets who ever lived, and he starts his prayer with an apology as an imperfect being for approaching a perfect God.]<i>for we know that thou art holy and dwellest in the heavens, and that we are unworthy before thee; because of the fall our natures have become evil continually; nevertheless, O Lord, thou hast given us a commandment that we must call upon thee, that from thee we may receive according to our desires.</i><br><br>Of course we fail at the celestial level. That's why we need a savior, and we are commanded to approach God and to call upon him so we may receive<i>according to our desires.</i>In the New Testament the Savior says, "Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled" (Matthew 5:6). We misinterpret that frequently. We think that means blessed are the righteous. It does not. When are you hungry? When are you thirsty? When you don't have the object of your desire. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after the righteousness that God has, after the righteousness of the celestial kingdom, because as that is the desire of their heart, they can achieve it--they will be filled. We may receive "according to our desires."<br><h2><b>Becoming One</b></h2><br>Perfection comes through the Atonement of Christ. We become one with him, with a perfect being. And as we become one, there is a merger. Some of my students are studying business, and they understand it better if I talk in business terms. You take a small bankrupt firm that's about ready to go under and merge it with a corporate giant. What happens? Their assets and liabilities flow together, and the new entity that is created is solvent.<br><br>It's like when Janet and I got married. I was overdrawn; Janet had money in the bank. By virtue of making that commitment, of entering into that covenant relationship of marriage with my wife, we became a joint account. No longer was there an I, and no longer a she--now it was<i>we.</i>My liabilities and her assets flowed into each other, and for the first time in months I was in the black.<br><br>Spiritually, this is what happens when we enter into the covenant relationship with our Savior. We have liabilities, he has assets. He proposes to us a covenant relationship. I use the word "propose" on purpose because it is a marriage of a spiritual sort that is being proposed. That is why he is called the Bridegroom. This covenant relationship is so intimate that it can be described as a marriage. I become one with Christ, and as partners we work together for my salvation and my exaltation. My liabilities and his assets flow into each other. I do all that I can do, and he does what I cannot yet do. The two of us together are perfect.<br><br>This is why the Savior says in Matthew 11:28, "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." What heavier load is there than the demand for perfection, that you must do it all, that you must make yourself perfect in this life before you can have any hope in the next? What heavier burden is there than that? That is the yoke of the law.<br><br><i>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</i><br><br><i>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</i><br><br><i>For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</i><br><br>[Matthew 11:28–30]<br><h2><b>"Trust Me"</b></h2><br>Turn, if you will, to 2 Nephi 4:17–19. You know the prophet Nephi. He was one of the great prophets, yet he had a sense of his need for the Savior and his reliance upon the Savior. He says,<br><br><i>O wretched man that I am! Yea, my heart sorroweth because of my flesh; my soul grieveth because of mine iniquities.</i><br><br><i>I am encompassed about, because of the temptations and the sins which do so easily beset me.</i><br><br><i>And when I desire to rejoice, my heart groaneth because of my sins.</i><br><br>Did Nephi have an appreciation for his mortal condition, for his need of the Savior to be saved from his sins? Oh yes, and the key is what comes next, "nevertheless, I know in whom I have trusted." All right, I'm imperfect. My sins bother me. I'm not celestial yet, but I know in whom I have trusted. Nephi trusted in the power of Jesus Christ to cleanse him of his sins and to bring him into the kingdom of God.<br><br>I had a friend who used to say quite frequently, "Well, I figure my life is half over, and I'm halfway to the celestial kingdom, so I'm right on schedule."<br><br>One day I asked her, "Judy, what happens if you die tomorrow?" It was the first time that thought had ever occurred to her.<br><br>"Let's see, halfway to the celestial kingdom is . . . mid-terrestrial! That's not good enough!"<br><br>We need to know that in this covenant relationship we have with the Savior, if we should die tomorrow, we have hope of the celestial kingdom. That hope is one of the promised blessings of the covenant relationship. Yet many of us do not understand it or take advantage of it.<br><br>When our twin daughters were small, we decided to take them to the public pool and teach them how to swim. I remember starting with Rebekah. As I went down into the water with Rebekah, I thought, "I'm going to teach her how to swim." But as we went down into the water, in her mind was the thought, "My dad is going to drown me. I'm going to die!" The water was only three and a half feet deep, but Becky was only three feet deep. She was so petrified that she began to scream and cry and kick and scratch and was unteachable.<br><br>Finally, I just had to grab her. I threw my arms around her, and I just held her, and I said, "Becky, I've got you. I'm your dad. I love you. I'm not going to let anything bad happen to you. Now relax." Bless her heart, she trusted me. She relaxed, and I put my arms under her and said, "Okay, now kick your legs." And we began to learn how to swim.<br><br>Spiritually there are some of us who are similarly petrified by the questions "Am I celestial? Am I going to make it? Was I good enough today?" We're so terrified of whether we're going to live or die, or whether we've made it to the kingdom or not, that we cannot make any progress. It's at those times when the Savior grabs us and throws his arms around us and says, "I've got you. I love you. I'm not going to let you die. Now relax and trust me." If we can relax and trust him and believe him, as well as believe in him, then together we can begin to learn to live the gospel. Then he puts his arms under us and says, "Okay, now pay tithing. Very good. Now pay a<i>full</i>tithing." And so we begin to make progress.<br><br>Turn to Alma 34:14–16.<br><br><i>And behold, this is the whole meaning of the law, every whit pointing to that great and last sacrifice; and that great and last sacrifice will be the Son of God, yea, infinite and eternal.</i><br><br><i>And thus he shall bring salvation to all those who shall believe on his name; this being the intent of this last sacrifice, to bring about the bowels of mercy, which overpowereth justice, and bringeth about means unto men that they may have faith unto repentance.</i><br><br><i>And thus mercy can satisfy the demands of justice, and encircles them in the arms of safety.</i><br><br>"The arms of safety"--that is my favorite phrase from the Book of Mormon.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, do Mormons believe in being saved? If I ask my classes that question with just the right twang in my voice, "Do we believe in being saved?" I can generally get about a third of my students to shake their heads and say, "Oh no, no! Those other guys believe in that." What a tragedy! Brothers and sisters, we believe in being saved. That's why Jesus is called the Savior. What good is it to have a savior if no one is saved? It's like having a lifeguard that won't get out of the chair. "There goes another one down. Try the backstroke! Oh, too bad, he didn't make it." We have a savior who can save us from ourselves, from what we lack, from our imperfections, from the carnal individual within us.<br><br>Turn to Doctrine and Covenants 76:68–69. In Joseph's vision of the celestial kingdom, he describes those who are there in these terms:<br><br><i>These are they whose names are written in heaven, where God and Christ are the judge of all.</i><br><br><i>These are they who are just men made perfect through Jesus the mediator of the new covenant.</i><br><br><i>Just</i>men and women,<i>good</i>men and women, those who hunger and thirst after righteousness,<i>made</i>perfect through Jesus, the mediator of the new covenant.<br><h2><b>Give Him All That We Have</b></h2><br>As my wife and I talked about her feeling of inadequacy and her feeling that she couldn't do it and that she couldn't make it, I had a hard time reaching her until finally I hit upon something that had happened in our family just a couple of months earlier. In our home it is now called the parable of the bicycle.<br><br>After I had come home from school one day, I was sitting in a chair reading the newspaper. My daughter Sarah, who was seven years old, came in and said, "Dad, can I have a bike? I'm the only kid on the block who doesn't have a bike."<br><br>Well, I didn't have enough money to buy her a bike, so I stalled her and said, "Sure, Sarah."<br><br>She said, "How? When?"<br><br>I said, "You save all your pennies, and pretty soon you'll have enough for a bike." And she went away.<br><br>A couple of weeks later as I was sitting in the same chair, I was aware of Sarah doing something for her mother and getting paid. She went into the other room and I heard "clink, clink." I asked, "Sarah, what are you doing?"<br><br>She came out and she had a little jar all cleaned up with a slit cut in the lid and a bunch of pennies in the bottom. She looked at me and said, "You promised me that if I saved all my pennies, pretty soon I'd have enough for a bike. And, Daddy, I've saved every single one of them."<br><br>She's my daughter, and I love her. My heart melted. She was doing everything in her power to follow my instructions. I hadn't actually lied to her. If she saved all of her pennies she would eventually have enough for a bike, but by then she would want a car. But her needs weren't being met. Because I love her, I said, "Let's go downtown and look at bikes."<br><br>We went to every store in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. Finally we found it--the<i>perfect</i>bicycle, the one she knew in the premortal existence. She got up on that bike; she was thrilled. She then saw the price tag, reached down, and turned it over. When she saw how much it cost, her face fell and she started to cry. She said, "Oh Dad, I'll never have enough for a bicycle."<br><br>So I said, "Sarah, how much<i>do</i>you have?"<br><br>She answered, "Sixty-one cents."<br><br>"I'll tell you what. You give me everything you've got and a hug and a kiss, and the bike is yours." Well, she's never been stupid. She gave me a hug and a kiss. She gave me the sixty-one cents. Then I had to drive home very slowly because she wouldn't get off the bike. She rode home on the sidewalk, and as I drove along slowly beside her it occurred to me that this was a parable for the Atonement of Christ.<br><br>We all want something desperately--it isn't a bicycle. We want the celestial kingdom. We want to be with our Father in Heaven. And no matter how hard we try, we come up short. At some point we realize, "I can't do this!" That was the point my wife had reached. It is at that point that the sweetness of the gospel covenant comes to our taste as the Savior proposes, "I'll tell you what. All right, you're not perfect. How much<i>do</i>you have? What<i>can</i>you do? Where are you now? Give me all you've got, and I'll pay the rest. Give me a hug and a kiss; enter into a personal relationship with me, and I will do what remains undone."<br><br>There is good news and bad news here. The bad news is that he still requires our best effort. We must try, we must work--we must do all that we can. But the good news is that having done all we can, it is enough--for now. Together we'll make progress in the eternities, and eventually we will become perfect--but in the meantime, we are perfect only in a partnership, in a covenant relationship with him. Only by tapping<i>his</i>perfection can we hope to qualify.<br><br>When I explained to Janet how it worked, finally I broke through and she understood. She bloomed. I remember her saying through her tears, "I've always believed he is the Son of God. I have always believed that he suffered and died for me. But now I know that he can save me from myself, from my sins, from my weakness, inadequacy, and lack of talent."<br><br>Oh, brothers and sisters, how many of us forget the words of 2 Nephi 2:8:<br><br><i>There is no flesh that can dwell in the presence of God, save it be through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah.</i><br><br>There is no other way. Many of us are trying to save ourselves, holding the Atonement of Jesus Christ at arm's distance and saying, "When I've done it, when I've perfected myself, when I've made myself worthy, then I'll be worthy of the Atonement. Then I will allow him in." We cannot do it. That's like saying, "When I am well, I'll take the medicine. I'll be worthy of it then." That's not how it was designed to work.<br><br>There is a hymn--it is one of my favorites--that says, "Dearly, dearly has he loved! And we must love him too, And trust in his redeeming blood, And try his works to do" ("There Is a Green Hill Far Away,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 194). I think one of the reasons why I love that hymn so much is because it expresses both sides of that covenant relationship. We must try his works to do with all that is in us. We must do all that we can, and having done all, then we must trust in his redeeming blood and in his ability to do for us what we cannot yet do.<br><br>Elder McConkie used to call this being in the gospel harness. When we are in the gospel harness, when we are pulling for the kingdom with our eyes on that goal, although we are not yet there, we can have confidence that just as that is our goal in life, so it will be our goal in eternity. Through the Atonement of Christ we can have hope of achieving and an expectation of receiving that goal.<br><br>I bear testimony to you that this is true. I have learned this lesson in my life. My family has learned this lesson in our collective life. I bear testimony that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, that he is the Savior of the World, that he is our individual Savior, if we will only enter into that glorious covenant relationship with him and give him all that we have. Whether it be sixty-one cents or a dollar and a half or two cents, hold nothing back, give it all, and then have faith and trust in his ability to do for us what we cannot yet accomplish, to make up what we yet lack of perfection.<br><br>I bear testimony of him. I love him. I love his gospel dearly, and I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Stephen E.

<br>
Whenever I approach this campus, there is something special that stirs within my soul. There is always a freshness, an air of growth and of development. A feeling of significant activity is in the air. There is almost an aroma of new beginnings, of goals made and in the process of being attained, of maturing careers, and of powerfully developing spirits. I have not visited Utah Valley Community College, but I imagine one would have similar feelings there.<br><br>I come to you as a friend with a sincere desire to help each of you obtain the greatest benefit from your investment of time and effort at Brigham Young University or Utah Valley Community College. My message results from much thought and prayer over an extended period of time. It has been prepared as if I were talking to a son or daughter or very close friend--communicating what I know will help provide increased, lasting benefit from this critical period of intense preparation for your future. I realize some of you are not currently students, but I feel the principles can be of equal value in your lives.<br><br>I pray that you can understand the intensity of my feeling and conviction regarding the principles I will discuss. May there come promptings to you from the Lord through the Holy Ghost regarding their application in your life. I feel the spirit and environment are right for that to occur.<br><h2><b>To You Who Are Automatic</b></h2><br>In the honest candor I want to characterize the time we spend together, I recognize there is a considerable group of you that will more easily understand what I say because of decisions you have already made. I pray that others who have not made the same personal commitments will be prompted to do so tonight, for my counsel will have limited value until that foundation is established. Let me explain more specifically with an example.<br><br>Some years ago, I received an unexpected high school graduation present. It was a beautiful watch. Each night I carefully wound it and placed it in its case. During the day, I looked at it far more frequently than necessary because of the love I felt it communicated. As the years went by and there were more and more things to do, I often neglected to wind the watch. Consequently, it stopped running, often when I most needed it. Then it was of no value for its prime mission--that of telling time.<br><br>Like many of you today, I wear an automatic watch. It is consistent and helpful. It always tells me the correct time. When I am in a foreign country, it wakes me at the appointed hour and does a lot of other useful things. Most of all, it is totally dependable. I never need to worry whether I can count on it or not.<br><br>I realize that just as there are differences in watches, there are differences in students. Some need winding up, and many others are automatic because of important decisions they have already made.<br><br>Those of you who need continuing guidance and direction and a jump start early in the morning or help late at night I leave in the hands of the marvelous people who are here to help you. They are represented by President Rex Lee and President Kerry Romsberg and their wives, the faculties and staffs of BYU and UVCC, the priesthood brethren represented by these dear friends here on the stand, and other students who will reach out to you to wind you up when you need it. I know you are in good hands.<br><br>My message today is to the other group, those of you who are automatic, who have made those decisions in life to be true and faithful to the teachings of the Lord and to live your lives by faith when you cannot see the end from the beginning. I speak to you who, when faced with alternatives, unwaveringly choose to follow those that are consistent with the teachings of the Savior.<br><br>I speak to you who are automatic, who in your lives have decided that while you will work to obtain enough for the needs of a family, you will not set your hearts on the acquisition of wealth and power but will serve and be led by the Lord in all you do. I know the criticism you sometimes receive. I know of those who would call you fanatical, who cannot understand why you don't do what everyone else in the world seems to do.<br><br>Yours is a future without limit because you have decided to be unwavering in obedience to the Lord. You cannot today fully imagine what you will accomplish in life. Yet your quiet, uncompromising determination to live a righteous life will couple you with inspiration and power beyond your imagination.<br><br>Before I speak of the principles I want to share to help you maximize the benefit of your effort and time as a student, I will point out some of the fruits of obedience that have or will assuredly come to you because of your determination to obey the Lord under all circumstances.<br><br>One is<i>peace,</i>peace in a world where that word is hardly understood, let alone experienced. When all the challenges pour down on you, you will have a quiet inner feeling of support. You will be prompted to know what to do. You can live in a world of turmoil and great challenge and be at peace.<br><br>A second fruit is<i>integrity.</i>Integrity is the hallmark of a righteous man or woman. It is the root of trust. It acts as cement in worthy human relationships and is the foundation of spiritual communication. Oh, how the world suffers today because of dwindling integrity. Within your sphere of influence you can build on the bulwark of your integrity.<br><br><i>Discipline</i>is another fruit you harvest through obedience. To be disciplined is to provide order and consistency to your life. It will permit higher priority matters to rule over those that are of lesser consequence. Righteous discipline is the backbone of noble character. Your discipline will help you to consistently make correct choices in the use of your time and will facilitate the proper use of your agency. Self-discipline negates the need for forced discipline.<br><br>One of the most self-disciplined men I know is Elder Russell M. Nelson of the Council of the Twelve. Recently, during a missionary meeting in Nicaragua, he was asked by one of the elders what were some of the principle messages of the April general conference. Drawing from his meticulously disciplined mind, he began with President Hunter and summarized in order the content of the messages of each member of the Twelve and the counselors in the First Presidency. Would a disciplined mind like that help you as a student? His was not a gift. He has worked conscientiously to discipline his mind.<br><br>Another fruit is the<i>capacity to work</i>and to receive the joy that comes from productive work. President Hinckley once said to a group of missionaries, "The great accomplishments of the world are not reached by extraordinary individuals, but by common souls that work in an extraordinary way."<br><br>I was in a mission president's seminar where one of the Brethren stood to introduce the next speaker. He said, "I can present him with three words<i>--work, work, work."</i>Humbly, Elder Spencer W. Kimball stood and said, "Oh, I know some of the Brethren say I work long hours, but I have to because I'm such a dull blade." His combination of great capacity and devoted, consistent hard work yielded a bounteous harvest of worthwhile results that continue to bless profoundly many lives throughout the world.<br><br>He once shared this precious counsel concerning both<i>discipline</i>and<i>work</i>with a group of missionaries. One missionary had said, "I don't like to work. I don't like to tract." This great leader responded:<br><br><i>Oh, is that so? I thought every missionary just loved to tract. . . . Didn't you know that the worthwhile things of life are not the things . . . you . . . want to do, they are the things you ought to do because they are right. Did you just love to study everything that was assigned at the University? . . . Isn't there anything in the world you do because you ought to do it? . . . My goodness, my boy, you're headed for a total loss if you are only doing things you want to do.</i><br><br>Then Elder Kimball shared an experience from his early life. He said,<br><br><i>I wanted to go on a mission. I was scared to death, a little fellow coming from a country district.</i><br><br><i>I wondered if I could do it. I was quite sure I would have difficulty and yet I began to . . . remember specific friends that had done it. I thought, I can play basketball better than they can, . . . maybe I can do it. At any rate, I decided I wanted to go on a mission as I had been taught all my life.</i><br><br>I pause here to emphasize this great secret in his life so you may use it to bless your own. He made up his mind only once to resolve a particular challenge. From then on he used his energy to keep the resolve, not to reanalyze it repeatedly under every new circumstance. Elder Kimball continued:<br><br><i>So when I got near the end of my high school, I went to Globe, Arizona, to get a job so I could begin to save money, because . . . my father was having a little problem with a large family to support. I had earned money for my school for my last . . . three years, and then I earned it for my mission.</i><br><br>He then described how he raised a black colt to become a handsome stallion. He sold it, putting every penny into his mission account. He then described his work at the dairy.<br><br><i>I found that the work at the dairy wasn't easy. I didn't like it. I would milk the cows and then go in and do the washing of the cans and bottles. We would use scalding water when our fingers would get somewhat used to it. Then when I would go out to milk the cows the next time, my fingers would crack and bleed.</i><br><br><i>I went . . . to the Globe Ward every Sunday night. I would walk about two miles down the railroad to get there. I would hold up my hands above my head as we walked so that the weight of the blood in my fingers wouldn't crucify me. It hurt terribly . . . I guess people thought I was giving up, but . . . I wasn't surrendering, I was just on my way.</i><br><br><i>So my fingers bled every day, but every night I went back and milked . . . somewhere between twenty and twenty-eight cows . . . every night and every morning with my hands, not with machines. In between, we would turn the cows into the field, and we took a square-pointed shovel, and you know what we did with that shovel, we cleaned up after the cows. . . . It was about the filthiest job I ever had, but I had to do it . . . it was part of my job.</i><br><br>So then Elder Kimball said to this boy:<br><br><i>So you don't like to tract. Well, for heaven's sake, what do you like to do that will pay dividends? Think about that . . . If tracting is hard and other visits are hard and teaching the gospel is hard, and study is hard, so what? It pays big dividends.</i><br><br>Hard work is the secret of happiness, as well as of success. Working hard in your studies is important. Serving in the Church and with your friends is vital. Get up early and work hard through the day.<br><br>Another fruit of your resolve to be obedient is to be<i>demanding of yourself</i>and to be<i>charitable to others,</i>to look for personal improvements that are required and be forgiving with those around you. You will develop a<i>love of service,</i>of giving, of reaching out. Your first thought will not be of yourself as is so common in the world today, but of others around you.<br><br>Consider this example of the blessings that flow from giving of yourself. I know of a young man who came to BYU after having skipped his senior year at high school. He was younger than usual. You can understand why his parents were concerned. In the dorm there were returned missionaries and young men who had resolved to go on missions. They spent the early hours of the morning and late hours of the evening talking together, reviewing the teachings of the Savior, singing hymns. They served one in need. His life will never be the same nor will ours, for he is our missionary son.<br><br>Many of you here have made the decision to be missionaries. You will bring back to this campus an influence and power that is most helpful. Others of you-- I hope all of you, men and women alike--will prayerfully consider a mission. It was the turning point of my life. All that I treasure began to mature in the mission field.<br><br>You who have filled worthy missions can help others have that sacred, edifying experience. Explain to those who are undecided some of the harvest of blessings you have tasted because of your mission: the joy of service; an appreciation for integrity, discipline, and hard work; the value of worthy companionships; the strength and peace from prayer; the power of love; the ability to act on faith; a heightened capacity to discern the promptings of the Spirit; and a love for the Savior and appreciation for his atonement.<br><br>Other fruits you will receive when needed are<i>inspiration</i>to know what to do and the power or capacity to do it.<br><br>The Lord has said:<br><br><i>And ye are to be taught from on high. Sanctify yourselves and ye shall be endowed with power.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 43:16]<br><br>Noting President Harold B. Lee's explanation that the phrase "sanctify yourselves" means "keep my commandments," this verse reads: "And ye are to be taught from on high. Keep my commandments and ye shall be endowed with power."<br><br>That is a promise to you. For being consistently and unwaveringly obedient, you will know what to do. Moreover, by obeying the commandments of God, you will have the power and capacity to accomplish what you are impressed to do.<br><br>There will grow within your being the fruit of<i>confidence in self--</i>not pride, but the assurance that as you continue to live worthily and continue to reach out to others, whatever you are asked to do in your life can be done. You will be<i>trustworthy.</i><br><br>Many will say when you are given opportunities that are incredibly rich that you are lucky. Not so--you will have earned those opportunities because you are<i>trustworthy.</i>You will be<i>spiritual.</i>You will be used as an instrument in the hands of the Lord to do his work, beginning now.<br><br>Another fruit will mature through the years because of your consistency, your willingness to set aside the things of the world, and your determination to quietly walk the path marked by the Savior. There will distill in your being<i>noble character.</i>Character is not forged in the heat of battle when you are challenged. It comes quietly from decision after decision made with the proper use of agency. It is used when challenge is upon you.<br><br>One of the best examples I know of noble character is President Ezra Taft Benson. From his earliest memory to this day, he has had the resolve in his heart that you have in yours: to understand the teachings of the Lord and to live them, to be unwavering in that determination. From all of this there has distilled in his being noble character. He is in his ninety-first year, and his body is weakening. He can't do all of the things he used to do, but what he<i>is</i>has remained unchanged, unaffected. That is why he can be trusted as the prophet of the Lord.<br><h2><b>The Lord Shall Lead Thee</b></h2><br>I have been describing some of the precious fruits of a most important process for growth based upon eternal truth. With the foundation we have laid, I now introduce the first principle of learning that I would emphasize today. I will describe how you can preserve and enhance the fruits of obedience we have discussed and show how you can receive more.<br><br>I pray to be understood. If you comprehend and use the principles we now review, they can change the course of your life for increased good.<br><br>This is the first principle:<b>Your life will be led by the Lord as in faith and humility you keep your resolution to be obedient to his commandments, no matter what the consequences.</b><br><br>The Lord said:<br><br><i>Be thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 112:10]<br><br>The process of growth is iterative; that is, it occurs in cycles, each one building upon itself in an ascending spiral of capacity and understanding. Your resolves will take you through periods of testing and growth. They are often not easy, but they are always beneficial. You will discover latent talents and unknown capacities. The whole course of your life may be altered for the Lord's purposes.<br><br>This example will illustrate what I mean. A youth was taught by his uncles that he would be a great basketball player. He had been given a basketball when he was one-year-old. In grade and high school he became extremely good at the sport. He began to form visions of being a professional basketball player--but the Lord had other plans. While he was excited about the sport, he was also quietly making important decisions in his life, probably not realizing in any degree how significant they were. He, like you, had resolved to be obedient, no matter what.<br><br>In college he was not selected to be on the first string and sat on the bench. In the biggest game of the year his team won, and everyone carried the players off on their shoulders. He remained alone in the stadium. Later, as he was walking home, a car drove by with some of the player heroes. They were all members of the Church. They stopped and picked him up, inviting him to celebrate with them. He began to be uneasy as they drove away from town. When he saw them unwrap a package of liquor he said, "You shouldn't do that. Let me out."<br><br>They responded, "Who are you to counsel us? We had pity on you. That's why we brought you along. You're not a man." They laughed and called him vile names as they drove off.<br><br>About the same time, in his favorite English class he received a grade far below what he deserved. He asked why and was told, "You've got greater capacity than this, and if you don't do your best, you will receive a low grade every time." His world seemed to be shrinking,<i>but not his resolve to live righteously.</i>He decided to excel in his English class and discovered powerful latent talents.<br><br>That man has given counsel from this pulpit. He has been a great influence for good throughout the world. Three of those boys who laughed and jeered were excommunicated later in life from the Church. Quietly, consistently, he has worked to bring them back. Two are now in full fellowship.<br><br>I first admired him for his extraordinary power of expression. Then I was lifted by the content of what his gifted mind expresses so eloquently. Now I can observe him more closely. I see that his life is a reflection of his love of the Master in whose footsteps he obediently walks. I strive to emulate that worthy example.<br><br>I've talked about an upward growth process and reviewed some of the results that will come as you continue your effort to be obedient. As you walk the path of righteousness, you will find that this cyclic process will help you become stronger, understand more, and more easily become what you want to be.<br><br>BYU and UVCC are prototypes for life where you can be schooled in a controlled environment. I will illustrate with an example.<br><br>Not far from here are some nuclear facilities that include prototypes for nuclear submarines. A nuclear prototype is a place that looks exactly like the real thing, only it is in a controlled environment so people can be taught without life-threatening danger. In those facilities, the individuals who man the nuclear fleet are trained to respond to emergencies automatically.<br><br>One day during the shakedown cruise of a real submarine, an accident occurred. The testing was almost over, and the ship was at full submergence depth at flank speed, the fastest it could advance in the water. The helmsman noticed they were at a slight up-angle, so he tilted the bow planes down. In that moment, the power went out. The boat locked in a down dive, and everyone knew that shortly they would be at a depth that would crush the hull. There was panic on board. But one engineer began to pull himself along the floor of the engine room to a compartment. He reached in, turned some switches, and reserve power came on. The emergency was over.<br><br>Later he was asked, "How did you know what to do? How did you know how to respond?"<br><br>The simple reply was, "I don't know. I just did it." Can you imagine him scrambling through the manual trying to find out what to do under that kind of pressure? He had learned in a prototype environment like your homes, like this campus with its classes and church environment. When the pressure came, he was ready. You will be ready because of the quiet resolve and determination in your life to live worthily as you learn from this prototype experience.<br><br>How can you keep your resolve? How can you be sure that that determination in your heart will not be eroded by the pressures around you?<br><br>First, choose good friends, those who have made similar decisions in their lives. Choose from among the student body, the faculty, and your priesthood leaders, from those like yourself who are wise enough to keep order and restraint and use time wisely. Students who go astray generally choose the other kind of friends. Be surrounded by those who are true friends, those who accept you the way you are and leave you better because of their association.<br><br>Remember the sound teachings you've gathered thus far in your life. Much of the disappointment and tragedy a young person encounters occurs when he or she experiences a release of all control and has complete freedom to do anything desired. At this time of transition where you have complete control of your life, you will make decisions wisely because of your unwavering determination to obey the Lord.<br><br>As you see, the fruits of your decision to "be automatic" in keeping the commandments of God are many. One of enormous worth is the greatly enhanced probability that you will find an eternal companion who will walk with you along the path you have chosen. I cannot describe what that means. I cannot convey what a blessing that is.<br><h2><b>Three Avenues of Learning</b></h2><br>Now, the second principle of learning I would like to emphasize:<b>Consistently use all three avenues of learning available to you within the classroom and out of it. Those three avenues are: 1. What you hear; 2. What you see; and 3. What you feel through the Holy Spirit.</b><br><br>I will discuss each of these three learning methods. First, learn from<i>what you hear.</i><br><br>Most students concentrate only upon what they hear formally delivered in the classroom and little else. Some students operate like vacuum cleaners. They sweep everything that is said into their consciousness as though it were all of equal worth. That is a mistake.<br><br>I attended a large Eastern university and, at one point, served as president of its honorary scholarship society. All of its members qualified for substantive economic aid by reason of their organized capacity to learn. Often, in our private conversations, we discussed a very real paradox we observed at the university. We recognized that the majority of the scholarship students were not those with the greatest intellectual capacity or natural talent; they were individuals who had learned the techniques of study and had become proficient in their use.<br><br>We observed how others with greater potential had not learned to concentrate on the tasks at hand and, consequently, spent long hours attempting to learn concepts or to memorize information by staring at the page while their mind wandered elsewhere. If you are encountering that difficulty, seek help. You can sharpen your skills and learn to recognize and record the essentially important information, separating it from the supporting examples, explanations, and anecdotes that often accompany it. BYU and UVCC have excellent courses to teach you these skills. It would serve you well to investigate them, unless you are particularly adept at this important aspect of learning from what you hear.<br><br>I will now concentrate on the other avenues of learning that are not generally taught in the classroom--namely,<i>what you see</i>and<i>what you feel.</i>Carefully observe what goes on about you in the classroom and, especially, out of it. It is not likely that the most treasured truths you will carry away from this educational experience will be found at the feet of a master teacher; rather, they will be distilled from many careful observations and crucially important promptings that can pass unperceived or unrecorded in your consciousness unless you watch for them.<br><br>Of necessity, academic instruction is divided into separate categories so there can be a formalized, logical presentation of important concepts and information. Some of the classwork is generalized, some is highly specialized and specific, but all of it is divided into compartmentalized treatments of the subject material.<br><br>Life, on the other hand, is not so conveniently parceled. When you are given a problem in mathematics, physics, or chemistry, discreet boundaries are identified. Generally, only the vital information you need to work toward a solution is presented. The challenges you will encounter the rest of your life are not so thoughtfully focused. Their solutions generally require an integration of capacities and techniques and information acquired from a wide variety of sources. You can enhance your ability to enjoy success in life by consciously trying to distill the experiences from both in and out of the classroom into definable principles or truths. You must separate them carefully and often with great effort from a mass of detail and extraneous backgrounds and input.<br><h2><b>Identify Fundamental Principles</b></h2><br>I now stress the third principle I would share. This to me is the essence of learning:<b>You must integrate information from all different fields of endeavor into a set of principles and standards that will serve you throughout eternity.</b><br><br>The challenges of life are not thoughtfully sliced into discreet subject matter. There are no convenient answers in the back of the book. Don't cheat yourself by taking dishonest shortcuts in any phase of the learning process.<br><br>Anyone who has studied chemistry, physics, and mathematics knows that if a basic principle can be mastered, then the solutions to a full myriad of specific problems are assured. That truth applies to every walk of life. The challenge is to be able to identify fundamental principles. Like diamonds, they are generally buried in a mass of detail and dross that have no significant, lasting value. The successful learner develops the capacity to identify fundamental principles and truths, to record them, and to apply them. The more fundamental they are, the more generally applicable they are to a wide variety of circumstances in life. Pondering and prayer are excellent ways to discover them.<br><br>Your objective is not to get through the university but to<i>absorb</i>and<i>use</i>the experiences that can be acquired here, the knowledge that can be obtained through righteous effort, and the lessons that can be learned from consistently facing and resolving the myriad of challenges you will encounter in your academic, social, and private life.<br><br>In a university or college you not only learn core knowledge essential to your chosen profession, but you can learn how to live life to its fullest. As you augment your learning by<i>what you observe</i>and by<i>what you perceive by the Spirit,</i>you will greatly increase your capacity to be successful in life. You will be led to establish goals and objectives for life that will likely be more enduring, more productive, and more satisfying than what you might otherwise select and achieve. Beyond reading, writing, and arithmetic, or other core fundamentals of your profession, you can discover your real potential.<br><br>Don't be satisfied with memorizing or learning by rote so you can press a mental button and discharge memorized facts to pass an examination. Learn how to think. Learn how to link concepts and how to integrate facts from various disciplines and the everyday experiences of university life. Don't act like a robot. Create an atmosphere of freedom of thought through self-control. That action will allow you to sense the enormous capacity latent within you.<br><br>Through stirrings and promptings of the Spirit, you can live and rise to the great heights others have achieved and even go beyond them. Do you believe that? I know that it is true.<br><br>You can soar as eagles and fly to heights not reached by your parents or grandparents. You can discover truths that will ignite your vision. You can challenge yourself to rise to greater levels of achievement. As you combine academics with eternal doctrinal truths, you will discover what it means to be a divine child of a Father in Heaven with perfect attributes. You will live worthily to overcome the influences of the world. You will be inspired to have power beyond your own--power to do, power to serve, power to give. You can qualify through that divine power to be an instrument in the hands of God and can accomplish what alone would be impossible.<br><br>How we love you. How we need you. You are the instruments the Lord has provided to work miracles that are urgently needed. Please pray about what I have said to gain your own witness until you know that it can happen and, then, as you strive diligently, it will happen.<br><br>Other schools, as well meaning as they are, build on the individual and train his or her capacities. All the students have when they leave is acquired knowledge and trust in themselves. Here we teach that you are divine children of a Father in Heaven, capable in time of acquiring his perfect attributes. Your potential is unlimited through your correct application of true principles and a worthy life that qualifies you for inspiration and divine power.<br><br>Here you will learn how to make into reality your worthy dreams for the future. Here you will gain the capacity to create a vision of your true potential. Then, through the application of correct principles and eternal truths and the consistent, appropriate use of moral agency, you will begin to convert that potential into reality.<br><br>One of the most powerful sources of personal development will come through the urgent prayers you offer in faith for a foundation of righteousness. You will learn much as feelings distill in your mind and heart. Avoid prayers that appear to be a set of instructions to the Lord--do this, bless that, change this, help me with that. Rather, be a compliant student to the Ultimate Teacher. He wants you to succeed even more than you do yourself.<br><br>This is a time to set your course for life, a time to establish fundamental priorities. One of the challenges of your learning experience here is to be able to differentiate among the smorgasbord of good and bad things that can be done and to select those that are righteous and truly essential.<br><br>Here you enjoy a personal freedom that likely you have never had before. That freedom can be a friend or an adversary, depending on how it is used. You will come to find that the restraints provided by the teachings of the Lord actually form a platform to greater freedom. When they are hurriedly dismantled in the euphoria of personal choice, there can result binding chains of transgression.<br><br>This is not an appeal to your emotions--rather, it is an effort to help you recognize the inevitable results of your having made correct choices and establishing the proper priorities in this critical phase of your life.<br><br>Some may be tempted to say, "I have so much to do I can't take on anything more. The struggle I have just to meet minimum academic requirements is almost more than I can handle." I am not suggesting that you work harder, unless you are not tugging at your limits of capacity already. I am encouraging you to work more intelligently.<br><br>Some cut a field of grain with a scythe or a sickle, bind the stalks into sheaves, and carry them to the threshing floor where the chaff and straw are separated from the grain. Others use a threshing machine to produce far greater yield per man hour of invested effort.<br><br>We all, I believe, have noble ideals and objectives. Test your daily thoughts and acts against those objectives. Are you making progress toward them, or have you begun to wander down paths that distract you or deflect you from meaningful purposes? The university is a workshop--both in the classroom and out of it--where you can test the validity of the principles with which you will guide your life. Here is the prototype to set your path and the pattern for the rest of your life.<br><br>Not all lessons will be learned in the classroom. The most important ones will be learned as you are on your knees. Some will distill in your mind and heart as you seek to use this experience as one of establishing the right balance in your life. Here you will set the priorities of life. Will they be primarily material or spiritual? Do they continue to center on service, or are they drifting toward selfishness?<br><br>We all recognize how one who publicly imitates a high standard of performance and privately lives beneath it provides the temptation of justification for others to violate this standard as well. They are like a lightning rod drawing high potential to ground. More important, you must recognize that the reverse is true. As you live a high standard of performance, publicly and privately, and even under great pressure adhere to it, you raise the vision of others. Your example encourages others to realize more of their divine capacity. It generates high potential that lifts and motivates and, like a magnet, seeks out and attracts others to a higher, more noble standard of life.<br><br>The power of your worthy example is enhanced many fold when you reach out in understanding to others caught in the adversary's web of transgression and help them into a harbor of safety where there is parental strength and priesthood leadership and inspiration. There they can repair through repentance the strained and damaged parts of their character. Many yearn to overcome transgressions that bind them to a path they do not want. Although their public actions decry any desire to change, privately they know not how to begin. Be that saving influence in their lives.<br><h2><b>Live in the Light</b></h2><br>And now the last principle. It is simple, but it is extraordinarily important:<b>Happiness comes from what we are, not from what we have.</b><br><br>Real joy comes from noble character, and that is built from a pattern of consistent, righteous decisions. Then the things we acquire are used as tools to help our own families and others. They should not become ends unto themselves. Our righteous decisions determine who we are and what is important to us. It becomes easier to do the right things. For happiness now and throughout your life, resolutely keep your determination to obey the Lord, no matter what pressure you feel to do otherwise.<br><br>I want you to know that I know the principles we have discussed are true. They have been proven in the crucible of my own personal life. With a lovely daughter of Father in Heaven, who surpasses me in every quality that is worthwhile, I have walked the path shared with you today. I know these truths are correct. I pray that somehow there will come a reinforcement through the Spirit to your mind and heart of their validity when you are challenged to disobey them in your life (see D&amp;amp;C 8:2–5).<br><br>I told you about an automatic watch. I would like to use that analogy in closing. The truth is that watches aren't really automatic, always. They either have a battery that has to be replaced periodically or they operate using light through a solar cell that has to be exposed to light continually to function. I had a watch like that, and it was left in a desk drawer for several weeks with no light. When I took it out, it looked like it would never work again. During an assignment in Acapulco, I put it in the brilliant sunlight for three days with no apparent result. Finally, it began to function again.<br><br>We are like that. We operate on light. We need a constant renewal of light. If we lead ourselves into a path where there is darkness, it can be extraordinarily difficult to come back. If you stay in the light, you will not have that challenge. You will be fortified because you will live in light.<br><br>I mentioned some of the blessings that will come from your decision to obey. There is one more. It is by all considerations the most beautiful, but the most difficult to talk about. You will find in your being a love for your Father in Heaven and his son, Jesus Christ, that becomes stronger and stronger until all you truly want to do is determine what they would have you do and, with their help, accomplish it.<br><br>There is much I do not know in life, but I do know that the Father and the Son live. I do know that they know each one of you personally. They know the struggles and the challenges you face. They appreciate that there are some moments of weakness for you. They love you and trust each of you. I know they live. I love them with all my heart. And I love you because of your resolve to follow their teachings and their example. As you continue to be obedient to their teachings, they will help you now, throughout your life, and always.<br><br>I solemnly bear that witness, and I know it is true. The Lord loves you. Jesus gave his life so that you can succeed in this part of your life. I bear that witness in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Richard G.

<h1>e &quot;Y&quot;— What Then? - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Since I am a relative newcomer to BYU and somewhat unfamiliar with its traditions, when I initially received the invitation to give this devotional address, instinctively the thought went through my mind, "Wow, maybe they think that I haven't been working hard enough and this is the punishment!" A few moments reflection, however, convinced me that this invitation was an honor, although I can't help thinking that the punishment is likely to follow the honor if my talk is not satisfactory! In fact, if you will pardon a "pun," on looking behind me, I feel very much like a man in the<i>firing</i>line!<br><br>On a serious note, I do consider it both an honor and a privilege to be asked to speak at this devotional. Maybe it takes a person from outside this institution to really appreciate its uniqueness--a university where secular learning and high moral and spiritual values are taught hand in hand. Some people call it the "Lord's University," others the "Law School's University," but what ever it is called, it is certainly unique! When I show visitors around the campus, they are always impressed by its beauty and cleanliness, and also by the courteous and friendly behavior shown by the students they meet. And several have commented with interest on the motto seen adorning the west entrance: Enter to learn--go forth to serve.<br><h2><b>Building a Sure Foundation</b></h2><br>The subject of my remarks today will be related to this motto, since I'd like to focus on our own individual attitudes and on our relationship with the world we face when we leave the "Y." The great majority of you here today will be familiar with the story of the three little pigs. But for those of you brought up in the electronic age and nourished in Nintendo-based homes, I will briefly summarize the rather sad tale.<br><br>Once upon a time, three young pigs set out from their home together to seek their fortunes and to build themselves nice homes with gardens and so on. The first pig bought a load of hay and built his house very quickly. The second pig purchased a supply of timber and built his house out of wood. This house took a little longer to complete, but they were both well established in their homes by the time the third pig had finished off his house--which he constructed out of bricks and stones. Now the story continues by introducing a rather wily and hungry wolf who fancied a meal of pork. Having failed to entice the first pig out of his house, he proceeded to blow down the building and then to eat the pig. He repeated this procedure with the second pig, but he did have to exert a little more effort in this case. However, the third little pig's house was a different proposition and, try as he would, he could not blow it down. The end of this little tale tends to vary somewhat from version to version, but most have the wolf falling down the chimney into a large pot of boiling water. And the third little pig lived happily ever after--apart, of course, from grieving a little because of the untimely demise of his two brothers.<br><br>Now I suspect it is possible to extract a moral out of every story, and I'm going to attempt to do that for this tale. The three pigs were quite obviously three quite different individuals with different personalities. But they had several features in common.<br><br>1. They all came from the same home or background.<br><br>2. They were all given a similar start in life.<br><br>3. They all had the same overall goals.<br><br>4. They all had their free agency and freedom to choose what they felt was best for them.<br><br>5. They all faced the same challenge in life--namely, the wolf!<br><br>However, only one succeeded--and that was because he built his home with a firm foundation and with strong durable materials.<br><br>Now, before I go any further, I want to say that there is a limit to how far one can relate a fairy story to real life--and I am not implying that BYU students have any characteristics that are commonly associated with any farmyard animals! Far from it--as far as I can see, you are a very good-looking, clean, intelligent group of individuals! However, during your time here at BYU, you will be given very similar opportunities for personal growth, and you will be exposed to a very similar base of moral behavior and teachings. When you leave the "Y," you will have your free agency, enabling you to choose and to make decisions. You will probably have the same overall goals of eternal life and a happy family and an enjoyable career, etc. You will undoubtedly experience many different challenges in life. These can take the form, for example, of temptations involving individual behavior or personal tragedies. The temptations you experience will all probably emanate from the same source, and both they and the personal tragedies invariably come at times when they are least expected. How you will fare or succeed in overcoming these challenges will depend very largely<i>not</i>on the nature of the challenges, but on what foundations you will have used to build your characters, testimonies, personalities, and lives--foundations that you are now building and auspicating here at BYU and that should be firmly in place before the challenges are met. So I urge you to make the most of your time here: attend the firesides and invited lectures, drink deeply from this marvelous spiritual "cup" that never runs dry! The opportunity to sit and hear a General Authority in person is rare indeed in the mission field.<br><br>In the Book of Mormon, Helaman's advice to his sons is quoted in Helaman 5:12:<br><br><i>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.</i><br><br>Remember the last phrase: "they cannot fall."<br><br>This then represents the basic formula for establishing the foundations we need--but what about the day-to-day challenges and practical problems? There will be times when you will feel very alone and insignificant, and the thought of facing the world's millions with their myriad problems will seem just too overwhelming. Thoughts such as "How can I cope with all this when I can't even get dates or good grades in calculus at college?" will appear. I think that mostly everyone feels like that on occasion. The situation reminds me of the<i>Peanuts</i>cartoon where Lucy (the amateur psychologist) is giving Charlie Brown some advice for five cents a sitting.<br><br>Lucy states: "Life, Charlie Brown, is just like an ocean liner, and people behave like passengers on the upper deck. Some sit in deck chairs looking back on the way they have come, whereas others face forward and look to the future. Which way is your deck chair facing, Charlie Brown?"<br><br>Charlie replies, "I don't know--I've never managed to get my deck chair opened!"<br><br>I have a lot of sympathy for Charlie Brown when I feel confused about all the things there are to think about and to do!<br><h2><b>You and the Lord Together</b></h2><br>As a convert LDS scientist living in the mission field, I often felt very much alone and insignificant, but I remember as I read more and more from the Book of Mormon and from books written by Church authorities, my testimony and confidence would strengthen and grow. I also began to relate more to some of the authors and characters of other LDS books. One of my heroes was the late Henry Eyring--whose name is known to virtually all students of chemistry worldwide for his contributions to the theories of chemical reactions. I recall reading in a book written by some of Dr. Eyring's colleagues and past students--and dedicated to the great scientist--a sentence that personally helped me a great deal. It was something to the effect that, to Henry Eyring, his religious principles and beliefs were so vitally important that wherever he went, he would carry them with him--much as one would an umbrella--and everyone who came in contact with him felt the influence of this aura. That is, they came within his umbrella! He had a strong testimony, and he had the courage to declare openly his strong convictions--and this gave him great security and stability in every environment in which he found himself. I think that the simplest way to gain a strong testimony is to live and to enjoy living the commandments and to read and ponder the scriptures.<br><br>Sometimes, however, we may feel fainthearted because of the sheer numbers of the opposition! We are very much a minority church, except of course here in Utah! However, let me remind you of a dramatic story in the Old Testament.<br><br>In Judges, chapter 7, we are told that the Israelites rose against the oppressive yolk of the Midianites under a new leader chosen by God named Gideon. Gideon raised an army of 32,000 and went against the Midianite host of 135,000 soldiers--an enemy with overall numbers of more than four times his own. Then the Lord said to Gideon, "You have too many men. If you win with these numbers you will become proud and conceited in your own abilities."<br><br>So the Lord told Gideon to ask his people the question "Who is afraid and fearful of this coming battle?" All those who answered in the affirmative were told to return to their homes. Now this left Gideon with a total of 10,000 men. The ratio of Midianite numbers to Israelite numbers was now over 13 to 1.<br><br>Then the Lord said to Gideon, "There are still too many people," and he told him to take them down to a source of water and to separate all those who drank like animals on their knees from those who cupped their hands to their lips to drink. Only 300 men passed this particular test! By now, Gideon was having to contemplate facing a 135,000-strong Midianite army with 300 brave Israelites who showed remarkable gentility in their drinking habits! The ratio was now up to 450 to l! However, the Lord was not about to abandon Gideon; instead, he inspired him to use very clever strategies to surround and confuse the large Midianite army by generating enough noise to give the impression of a much larger force. The Midianites fled--pursued by Gideon and his band--and Israel was triumphant. The number ratio was such that no one could doubt they had had divine assistance in their victory.<br><br>Just consider the size of this Church and the population of the world in which we now live. A current estimate of the world's population is about 5,000 million, whereas the LDS population is just over 7 million. Now that is a ratio of about 700 to 1--not very different to the one that Gideon had to work with. In these modern times<i>you</i>are the equivalent of the 300-strong Israelite army. Don't be daunted by numbers; never underestimate the effect for good that you can have. The example of a righteous family played a large part in our own family's conversion to the restored gospel. So as you face the world when you leave BYU, please remember that however lonely you may occasionally feel, you are not alone as long as you are living in such a way that you have the support of the Lord. There is a sentence in my wife's patriarchal blessing that has comforted her many a time: "Remember, you and the Lord together constitute a majority"!<br><br>Alma's advice to his sons is pertinent here:<br><br><i>Now ye may suppose that this is foolishness in me; but behold I say unto you, that by small and simple things are great things brought to pass; and small means in many instances doth confound the wise.</i>[Alma 37:6]<br><br>We can all be part, and in fact we should be part, of the "small" means that can bring about the great things in the overall plan of our Father in Heaven.<br><br>Carol Lynn Pearson has expressed her feelings on our role very beautifully.<br><br><i>Do you know</i><br><i>How many count on you</i><br><i>to steer by this night?</i><br><br><i>Do you know</i><br><i>How dark the sea</i><br><i>and dim the stars</i><br><i>and strong the wind</i><br><i>out there?</i><br><br><i>And you would</i><br><i>hide your lighthouse</i><br><i>under a bushel?</i><br><i>Don't you dare!</i><br><br>Unlike certain chemical reactions that often result in a balanced equilibrium so that the reaction goes one way or another depending on outside forces or influences, our progress through this life is one way only. We are born and we die, and in between we grow and experience life with all its complexities. Since we cannot reverse the passage of time, let's be positive about the journey of life that lies ahead. As regards our own attitudes en route, we only have two real options: our spirituality either grows or diminishes. Merely being static should not be an option, and apathy is a big killer in the Lord's great plan. Remember Jesus was kind to the repentant adulteress. And he had a sympathetic interest in the thief on the cross who wanted to do better. But concerning the man who was not improving himself, the Lord said, "Take the talent from him and give it to him who has ten talents, and cast the unprofitable servant into outer darkness, where there shall be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth." The punishment for neglect is often as severe as it is for opposition or abuse.<br><br>When we don't use our arms, we lose the use of our muscles. So it is with our talents and testimonies in our lives. They need to be nourished and strengthened, and your time here at BYU is a vitally important period in which to do this. The scriptures do not say that our journey and our progress will always be easy. Our Church history is replete with stories that describe in simple and stark detail the sacrifice and suffering the early Saints experienced, and the growth and development of our modern day Church is to a large degree the result of the fact that so many pioneers successfully endured these hardships and benefited from a concomitant spiritual strengthening.<br><h2><b>Preparing for the Trail Ahead</b></h2><br>I would now like to share with you an exciting adventure story of great personal interest to me that was brought to my attention a few years ago. I want to relate it to the theme of my talk today. I was shown an article in a Shropshire magazine (published in England) written by a man who found an old trunk in the attic of a house in the town of Shrewsbury. In the trunk was a handwritten manuscript. The manuscript represented part of the diary of an old clock-mender (Mr. James Hanny) who had lived near the England/ Wales border and whose hobby was to walk the hills of Wales. This manuscript related how in 1874 this elderly man, then age 73, had visited an old friend of his who had a farm in Wales. The story went on to say how his friend's daughter (aged 18) agreed to take him to see the waterfalls near a small village called Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant. Apparently Mr. Hanny had sustained an ambition to visit the falls (called locally Pistill Rhaeadr) for approximately forty years. Now this area is close to where I was brought up, and I have some knowledge of the country and the terrain. The distance they walked would have been approximately eighteen miles round-trip over some quite rugged hills. Here I quote from the manuscript:<br><br><i>My host, Mr. Humphreys, was the very embodiment of Welsh hospitality, nothing was too much for him and his household to make my stay as comfortable as possible; his charming daughter Rosamond was a most beautiful and talented young lady, and she and I became great friends. She had a deep love for Wales in her heart, which became obvious as she described her lonely walks among the wild and legendary hills, amid the wind-swept heather. . . . Rosamond was very keen to be my guide to the falls, and she promised me a wonderful walk back over the mountains; a walk, she said, I would always remember. They were, indeed, prophetic words.</i><br><br>As you can see, the old clock-mender had quite a graphic turn of phrase! Now, back to the narrative:<br><br><i>On the following day, after an early lunch, we started out. It was a long but interesting walk, and at last we arrived at the beautiful falls. I stood there for some time assimilating a sight that had been denied me for so many years. My companion stood by my side, a smile on her lovely face. She understood and appreciated this happy moment of mine.. . .</i><br><br><i>Amid the soothing influence of the tumbling waters, we ate the refreshments that Rosamond had thoughtfully brought, until she said that we had stayed longer than we should, and our walk back over the mountains must not be delayed any longer.</i><br><br>They started their return journey, but the day had been too strenuous for the seventy-three-year-old man. Again I quote:<br><br><i>I had completely underestimated my supply of strength for the arduous task ahead. My companion, bursting with the vitality of the young, and with a supply of seemingly inexhaustible energy, was well equipped for the journey, and like myself, had no conception of my limitations. The young do not understand the meaning of weakness in the old; they have never experienced it themselves and cannot conceive it in others.</i><br><br>His story then relates in some detail the path they took, the magnificent scenery, and the frequent stops for rest. Quoting again:<br><br><i>My companion called to say we must hurry on. I must admit I had been glad of the rest. Again we started off, Rose leading the way. My legs were now beginning to ache and I could feel a tightness in my chest. Once, seeing I was having difficulty in catching up with her, she ran back to me.</i><br><br><i>"Are you all right?" she asked.</i><br><br><i>"Oh yes," I lied as cheerfully as I could. "But a little rest would do me good."</i><br><br><i>A slight troubled frown appeared on her face for a fleeting moment. She smiled. "Of course," she said, "But .. ."She looked up anxiously at the sky where a few black-looking clouds were looming up. "We still have a long way to go. We must not stay long."</i><br><br><i>Once again we started off, and the going became even more rough and arduous. If I had been a young man, supple of limb and muscle, I would have enjoyed the climb to the full, but the acute pain in my legs betokened the opposite. . . . The darkness deepened rapidly, and all around took on a hue of deep purple. The heavens appeared to be closing down on us. Black clouds began to obliterate the remaining light, until it was difficult to see the ground beneath our feet. . . . In a short time we were soaked to the skin. We dare not stop long; we could never hope to survive a night exposed as we were to the elements. We were already soaked to saturation point. With the helping hand of my companion we practically felt our way in the darkness. After what seemed an interminable time, Rose suddenly stopped, and pulled me back a pace or so. In the gloom I peered closely into her rain-streaked face.</i><br><br><i>"Is there anything wrong?" I asked.</i><br><br><i>"I'm not sure," Rose replied, hesitatingly. "But I have a strange feeling we are on the wrong track. Stay here a moment."</i><br><br><i>Carefully she lay on the ground, and as I looked on wonderingly, she crawled forward very slowly. Presently I heard her give a little cry, and following her example, I too, crawled forward until I reached her side. She put out a restraining hand to stop me venturing further. Picking up a stone she gently threw it forward. There was silence for a few moments, and then I heard the stone falling on rocks far below. I could hear it bounding from crag to crag getting fainter and fainter. We were on the edge of a dangerous cliff! We crawled back to comparative safety; I was now shivering as much with shock as with the cold. I found my companion's hand and pressed it with a gesture of despair. Words failed me. Only one thought ran through my fevered mind. Lost! Lost on a mountain with the night in front of us. Soaked with rain; cold, and already weary to the point of complete exhaustion. What hope was there for us?</i><br><br><i>Rose's voice broke through my bitter thoughts, and with it, renewed hope. "I think I know where we are," she said. "In the darkness we have strayed from the right road. We must go back to find our bearings."</i><br><br><i>She led me like a child, and amidst the howling of the wind we carefully retreated from that awful abyss. From that moment I seemed to have lost all sense of direction and time. Numbed with the cold, all my actions were those of an automaton. But for the supporting hand of Rose, I would gladly have been content to lay my weary body on the rocky ground. But somehow that frail figure kept me going. Somehow she managed to support me and we stumbled through the darkness of the night. For what seemed an eternity our passage continued until I fancied I could see little sparks of light that danced in front of my eyes like so many fireflies. My befuddled mind could not comprehend that safety was near at hand. Above the wind I heard Rosamond's voice. "Here," she cried. "We are here. We are coming." The little spots of light came nearer and nearer, and it was with intense relief that at last I realized they were the lights of lanterns. For the rest of the journey we were half-carried to the blessed haven of Brynteg--the home of my friend.</i><br><br>The article then went on to say that as well as the manuscript, there was found in the old trunk a newspaper cutting describing the wedding at a town called Llanfyllin (in 1883), nine years later, of Rosamond Humphreys, youngest daughter of Mr. Humphreys (Brynteg) to Lewis Owen.<br><br>Rosamond Humphreys was my grandmother, whom I never met. She died before I was born, and I suspect my mother never heard about this particular exploit in the hills of Wales, because neither my brother nor I was told anything at all about it!<br><br>Now my purpose in relating this story to you, about 116 years later, apart from sharing with you the great joy that discovering this manuscript gave to me, and the pride and closeness I now feel for one of my ancestors, is to emphasize the fact that in this story, Rosamond Humphreys personified the following attributes: (1) bravery or courage; (2) great kindness and compassion, including leading another to safety; (3) faith, with no indulgence in self-despair; and, most important, (4) knowing her way amidst treacherous paths.<br><br>During the latter part of their adventure, she was obviously concerned about the lateness of the hour and about their slow progress. She was anxious, yet kind and seemingly very patient, and led him by the hand when he was unable to do more than put one foot in front of the other. Because of her knowledge of the mountains, born of practice and experience, she had faith that they would reach their destination, whereas he could not see the end and had started to doubt. She knew the path they had to take and the ones they should avoid.<br><br>Let me now try to relate these characteristics to us in these days. We will undoubtedly experience considerable challenges in our lives, and we will find others in similar predicaments who are close to despair. We may find ourselves in positions when we may need to guide other people to safety, and our standing as leaders will depend on our own personal preparation and knowledge of the gospel. I can think of no better attributes or foundations for anyone to have as they face the world than:<br><br>1.<i>To know where you are and where you are going.</i>To be familiar with the path that needs to be traveled.<br><br>2.<i>To have great faith.</i>To know that God will never abandon you to the adversary.<br><br>3.<i>To show compassion and kindness.</i><br><br>4.<i>To be brave.</i>To be courageous does not exclude fear, but fear is conquered by faith and doing what is right.<br><br>May we all base our lives on principles as fundamental as these. They will serve us well as strong foundations in times of trouble and stress. Let us remember that the third little pig of our fable survived because he chose to use materials that provided a strong foundation. And thus let us strive to place ourselves on that "rock which is our Redeemer" where "none shall fall," I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Noel L.

<h1>Suffering - Dallin H. Oaks - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Sister Oaks and I are glad to be with you this evening. It is always a thrill to return to BYU, where we have some of our happiest memories. For example, half of our six children were born while we were here at BYU. The first two were born while we were students here, and the last was born while I was serving as president. That is what you call coming full circle.<br><h2><b>Repent!</b></h2><br>I begin by describing an event that happened here on campus. About fifteen years ago, a group of newspaper editors from various western states came to Salt Lake City to learn more about the Church. They visited with Church authorities, went to Temple Square, saw the welfare program in action, and then came to BYU.<br><br>At dinner in the Wilkinson Center, I sat with an editor from California. He was immensely impressed with what he had seen. "You Mormons really know how to do it," he said. Then he praised the various things he had seen. I enjoyed his positive reactions to everything.<br><br>Later, he asked the location of the nearest rest room and excused himself. When he returned he had a triumphant smile on his face. "Well, I found out that you Mormons are just like everyone else," he said. In response to my question, he explained.<br><br>"When I go into a rest room in another public place, I find there are things written on the wall. When I went to the rest room here in the Wilkinson Center, I found it was just like other rest rooms. There was something written on the wall."<br><br>Sorry that the man's gleaming impressions had been tarnished, I began to apologize about how difficult it was to keep current on the maintenance in a public place. He smiled and raised his hand to stop me. "Oh, I'm just kidding," he said. "It's true there was something written in there, but I've never seen anything like that written on the wall in a public place. It was just one word:<i>repent."</i><br><br>Whoever wrote that word on a rest room wall in the Wilkinson Center many years ago at least knew the word<i>repent,</i>which is more than can be said for many people in the world today. But I wonder how many of us understand the principle and purpose of repentance, including its relationship to sin and suffering.<br><h2><b>The Subject of Sin</b></h2><br>We are concerned that some young people who are anticipating serving a mission or being married in the temple have a very lax attitude toward sin. "I'll just have a few free ones," they say, "and then I'll repent quickly, and go on my mission (or get married in the temple), and everything will be all right."<br><br>Young people are not the only ones with a lax attitude toward sin. We know of mature members of the Church who commit serious transgressions knowingly and deliberately, relying on their supposed ability later to repent speedily and be "as good as new." Such persons want the present convenience or enjoyment of sin and the future effects of righteousness, in that order. They want to experience the sin, but avoid its effects.<br><br>The Book of Mormon describes such persons:<br><br><i>And there shall also be many which shall say: Eat, drink, and be merry; nevertheless, fear God--he will justify in committing a little sin; yea, lie a little, take the advantage of one because of his words, dig a pit for thy neighbor; there is no harm in this; and do all these things, for tomorrow we die; and if it so be that we are guilty, God will beat us with a few stripes, and at last we shall be saved in the kingdom of God.</i>[2 Nephi 28:8]<br><br>The attitude and position of such persons is exactly the opposite of the Savior, who never experienced sin, but whose atoning sacrifice subjected him to all of its anguish.<br><br>When I was a young man, I accompanied a Protestant friend to his church service. There I heard a minister take on the subject of sin. It was an uneven contest. That minister really beat up on sin. He condemned it. He denounced it. He castigated it. He left no doubt in the mind of anyone that he was against sin. But he didn't give the congregation one word of definition or explanation about what it was.<br><br>To minimize misunderstanding, I will give some illustrations of the kinds of things I mean when I refer to sin or transgression. In its widest application,<i>sin</i>includes every irregularity of behavior, every source of uncleanliness. But many things that are sins under this widest definition are just grains of sand or specks of dirt that come out in the weekly wash and do not block our progress on the path toward eternal life. When I speak of<i>sin</i>in this message, I refer to serious transgressions, the boulder-size obstacles that block the path and cannot be removed without prolonged repentance.<br><br>During one week last month, a knowledgeable observer listed some of the crimes reported in a Utah newspaper and then struck off those where the accused was not a member of this Church. The remaining list provides some illustrations of the kinds of sins in which Latter-day Saints were involved.<br><br>Fraud<br>Sale of illegal drugs<br>Aggravated assault<br>Aggravated kidnapping<br>Sexual abuse by a woman upon a child<br>Sexual abuse by a man upon a child<br>A professional having sexual relations with a client<br><br>Church disciplinary records make us aware of other serious transgressions rarely reported in the press: adultery, fornication, polygamy, and apostasy.<br><br>When the Savior appeared to the people of this continent, he spoke of the final judgment. There, he said, he would "be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages" (3 Nephi 24:5).<br><br>Those are some illustrations of serious transgressions. Others could be given.<br><br>As background, let us review some familiar principles.<br><br>1. One of the principal purposes of this life is to test the children of God, to see whether we will keep his commandments (see Abraham 3:25).<br><br>2. Therefore, this life is "a probationary time," as Alma called it, "a time to repent and serve God" (Alma 42:4).<br><br>3. The breaking of a commandment of God is sin.<br><br>4. For every sin there is "a punishment affixed" (Alma 42:18; also see Amos 3:1–2).<br><br>5. In the final judgment, we will stand before God to be judged according to our works (see Alma 11:41; 3 Nephi 26:4; D&amp;amp;C 19:3).<br><br>6. Those who have broken the commandments of God and have not repented in this life will "stand with shame and awful guilt before the bar of God" (Jacob 6:9). They will have "an awful view of their own guilt and abominations" (Mosiah 3:25). The scriptures describe this as "a lively sense of . . . guilt, and pain, and anguish, which is like an unquenchable fire, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever" (Mosiah 2:38).<br><br>7. The awful demands of justice upon those who have violated the laws of God, the "state of misery and endless torment" (Mosiah 3:25) described in these scriptures, can be mediated and eliminated by the Atonement of Jesus Christ. This is the essence of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>What do these basic principles mean in the case of a lax Latter-day Saint who deliberately commits a serious transgression in the expectation that he or she will enjoy the effects or benefits of the sin now and then make a speedy and relatively painless repentance and soon be as good as new?<br><br>The Book of Mormon teaches that the Savior does not redeem men "in their sins" (Alma 11:34, 36, 37; Helaman 5:10). "The wicked remain as though there had been no redemption made, except it be the loosing of the bands of death" (Alma 11:41). The Savior came to redeem men<i>"from</i>their sins because of repentance" and upon the "conditions of repentance" (Helaman 5:11).<br><br>One of those conditions of repentance is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, including faith in and reliance upon his atoning sacrifice. As Amulek taught:<br><br><i>He that exercises no faith unto repentance is exposed to the whole law of the demands of justice; therefore only unto him that has faith unto repentance is brought about the great and eternal plan of redemption.</i>[Alma 34:16]<br><h2><b>Personal Suffering for Sin</b></h2><br>Another condition of repentance is suffering or punishment for the sin. In the words of Alma, "repentance could not come unto men except there were a punishment" (Alma 42:16). Where there has been sin, there must be suffering.<br><br>Perhaps the greatest statement of this principle in all the scriptures is the revelation the Lord gave to the Prophet Joseph Smith in March 1830, the month the Book of Mormon was published and the month before the Church was organized (D&amp;amp;C 19). Here the Lord reminds us of "the great day of judgment" when all will be judged according to their works. He explains that the "endless" or "eternal torment" or "punishment" that comes from sin is not punishment without end, but it is the punishment of God, who is endless and eternal.<br><br>In this setting, the Savior of the world commands us to repent and keep his commandments. "Repent," he commands, "lest . . . your sufferings be sore --"<br><br><i>how sore you know not, how exquisite you know not, yea, how hard to bear you know not.</i><br><br><i>For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent;</i><br><br><i>But if they would not repent they must suffer even as I;</i><br><br><i>Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit--and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink--</i><br><br><i>Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, I command you again to repent, lest I humble you with my almighty power; and that you confess your sins, lest you suffer these punishments of which I have spoken.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 19:15–20]<br><br>As we consider these sobering words of the Savior, we realize that there is something very peculiar about the state of mind or "heart" of the person who deliberately commits sin in the expectation that he or she will speedily and comfortably repent and continue as a servant of God preaching repentance and asking others to come unto Christ. I will illustrate the peculiarity of this attitude with two analogies.<br><br>Picture a father who labors tirelessly to support a large family. He denies himself many things in order to provide their urgent needs: food, clothing, housing, health care, and education. He works every waking hour, scrapes, saves, and prays that there will be enough to go around. The children see his tireless work and his sacrifices for them. Finally, a day comes when the family gathers for a celebration. They go to a restaurant where the father, with carefully saved resources, plans to treat everyone to a nice meal. Mindful of their financial circumstances and the sacrifices the father has made to bring them to this place, most of the children are very considerate about what they order. But some are heard to say, "We don't have to pay, so we're going to order everything we want, no matter how expensive. We'll enjoy it, and he'll pay for it."<br><br>Second example. The mother of a large family is burdened almost past the point of endurance. Every waking hour is spent serving the needs of her large family: meals, mending, transporting, counseling, caring for those who are sick, comforting those who mourn, and administering to every other need a mother can understand. She has committed herself to do everything within her power to serve the needs of her children.<br><br>She is giving her life for them. The children know she will attempt to carry whatever load is placed upon her. Most of them are considerate and do all that they can to minimize her burden. But some, knowing of her willingness to serve, heedlessly pile more and more tasks on the weary mother. "Don't worry about it," is their attitude, "she'll carry it. She said she would. Drop it on Mom, and we'll just have a good time."<br><br>In these two analogies, I am obviously likening the heedless children to those who sin in the expectation that someone else will bear the burden of suffering. The one who bears the burden is our Savior.<br><br>Am I suggesting that the benefits of the Atonement are not available for the person who heedlessly sins? Of course not. But I am suggesting that there is a relationship between sin and suffering that is not understood by people who knowingly sin in the expectation that all the burden of suffering will be borne by another, that the sin is all theirs, but the suffering is all his. That is not the way. Repentance, which is an assured passage to an eternal destination, is nevertheless not a free ride.<br><br>Let us recall two scriptures quoted earlier: (1) "Repentance could not come unto men except there were a punishment" (Alma 42:16); and (2) the Savior said that he had suffered these things for all, "that they might not suffer if they would repent; But if they would not repent they must suffer even as I" (D&amp;amp;C 19:16–17). Does this mean that a person who repents does not need to suffer at all because the entire punishment or suffering is borne by the Savior? That cannot be the meaning because it would be inconsistent with the Savior's other teachings. What is meant is that the person who repents does not need to suffer "even as" the Savior suffered. Sinners who are repenting will experience some suffering, but, because of their repentance and the Atonement, they will not experience the full "exquisite" extent of eternal torment the Savior suffered.<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball, who gave such comprehensive teachings on repentance and forgiveness, said that personal suffering "is a very important part of repentance."<br><br><i>One has not begun to repent until he has suffered intensely for his sins</i>. [<i>TSWK,</i>p. 88]<br><br><i>If a person hasn't suffered, he hasn't repented. . . . He has got to go through a change in his system whereby he suffers and then forgiveness is a possibility.</i>[p. 99]<br><br>The Savior taught this principle when he said that his atoning sacrifice was for "all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit; and unto none else can the ends of the law be answered" (2 Nephi 2:7; also see Alma 5:48, 11:40). The repentant sinner who comes to Christ with a broken heart and a contrite spirit has been through a process of personal pain and suffering for sin. He understands the meaning of Alma's statement that "none but the truly penitent are saved" (Alma 42:24).<br><br>Bruce C. Hafen has described how some people think that repentance is too easy. They look "for short cuts and easy answers, thinking that quick confessions or breezy apologies alone are enough"<i>(The Broken Heart,</i>1989, p. 150). President Kimball said, "Very frequently people think they have repented and are worthy of forgiveness when all they have done is to express sorrow or regret at the unfortunate happening" (<i>TSWK,</i>p. 87). There is a big difference between the "godly sorrow [that] worketh repentance" (2 Corinthians 7:10), which involves personal suffering, and the easy and relatively painless sorrow for being caught or the misplaced sorrow Mormon described as "the sorrowing of the damned, because the Lord would not always suffer them to take happiness in sin" (Mormon 2:13).<br><br>Alma the Younger certainly understood that easy and painless sorrow was not a sufficient basis for repentance. His experience, related in detail in the Book of Mormon, is our best scriptural illustration of the fact that the process of repentance is filled with personal suffering for sin.<br><br>Alma said after he was stopped in his wicked course, he was "in the darkest abyss" (Mosiah 27:29),<br><br><i>racked with eternal torment, for my soul was harrowed up to the greatest degree and racked with all my sins.</i><br><br><i>Yea, I did remember all my sins and iniquities, for which I was tormented with the pains of hell.</i>[Alma 36:12–13]<br><br>He tells how "the very thought of coming into the presence of my God did rack my soul with inexpressible horror" (verse 14). He speaks of being "harrowed up by the memory of my many sins" (verse 17). After three days and three nights of what he called "the most bitter pain and anguish of soul," he cried out to the Lord Jesus Christ for mercy and received "a remission of [his] sins" (Alma 38:8).<br><br>All of our personal experience confirms the fact that we must endure personal suffering in the process of repentance--and for serious transgressions that suffering can be severe and prolonged. I believe that every one of us who is truly honest with himself recognizes the truth of this principle. We have felt it in our own lives, and we have seen it in the lives of others.<br><br>This month's<i>Ensign</i>(August 1990) contains an anonymous article describing such an experience. Under the title "Yearning to Return," a repenting transgressor who was excommunicated describes his personal feelings: "tearful hours," "misery," "wishing to be covered by a million mountains," "crushed by the shame," "dark blackness," "unbearable pain," and "anguish. . . as wide as eternity" (pp. 22–24).<br><br>Why is it necessary for us to suffer on the way to repentance for serious transgressions? We often think of the results of repentance as simply cleansing us from sin. But that is an incomplete view of the matter. A person who sins is like a tree that bends easily in the wind. On a windy and rainy day the tree bends so deeply against the ground that the leaves become soiled with mud, like sin. If we only focus on cleaning the leaves, the weakness in the tree that allowed it to bend and soil its leaves may remain. Merely cleaning the leaves does not strengthen the tree. Similarly, a person who is merely sorry to be soiled by sin will sin again in the next high wind. The susceptibility to repetition continues until the tree has been strengthened.<br><br>When a person has gone through the process that results in what the scriptures call a broken heart and a contrite spirit, that person is not only eligible to be cleansed from sin. He is also strengthened, and that strengthening is essential for us to realize the purpose of the cleansing, which is to return to our Heavenly Father. To be admitted to his presence we must be more than clean. We must also be changed from a weak person who once transgressed into a strong person with the spiritual stature that qualifies one to dwell in the presence of God. We must, as the scripture says, become "a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord" (Mosiah 3:19; also see Hafen,<i>The Broken Heart,</i>p. 149). This is what is meant by the scriptural explanation that a person who has repented of his sins will "confess them and forsake them" (D&amp;amp;C 58:43). Forsaking sins is more than resolving not to repeat them. It involves a fundamental change in the individual.<br><br>King Benjamin and Alma both speak of "a mighty change of heart." King Benjamin's congregation described that mighty change by saying that they had "no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually" (Mosiah 5:2). Alma illustrated that change of heart when he described a people who "awoke unto God," "put their trust in" him, and were "faithful until the end" (Alma 5:7, 13). He challenged others to "look forward with an eye of faith" to the time when we will "stand before God to be judged" according to our deeds (Alma 5:15). Persons who have had that kind of change in their hearts have been cleansed from their sins and have attained the strength and stature to dwell with God. That is what we call being saved.<br><h2><b>Heed the Warnings</b></h2><br>Some Latter-day Saints who think repentance is easy maintain that a person is better off after he has sinned and repented. "Get a little experience with sin," one argument goes, "and then you will be better able to counsel others and sympathize with others. Anyway, it won't hurt to sin a little."<br><br>I plead with you, my brothers and sisters, my young friends and my older friends, avoid transgression! The idea that one is better off after one has sinned and repented is a devilish lie of the adversary. Does anyone here think that it is better to learn firsthand that a certain blow will break a bone or a certain mixture of chemicals will explode and sear off our skin? Are we better off after we have sustained and then healed such injuries? I believe we all can see that it is better to heed the warnings of wise persons who know the effects on our bodies of certain traumas.<br><br>Just as we can benefit from someone else's experience in matters such as these, we can also benefit from the warnings contained in the commandments of God. We don't have to have personal experience with the effects of serious transgressions to know that they are destructive of our eternal welfare.<br><br>Some years ago one of our sons asked me why it wasn't a good idea to try alcohol or tobacco to see what it was like. He knew about the Word of Wisdom and he also knew the health effects of these substances, but he was questioning why he shouldn't just try them out for himself. I replied that if he wanted to try something he ought to go out in the barnyard and eat a little manure. He recoiled in horror. "Ooh, that's gross," he reacted.<br><br>"I'm glad you think so," I said, "but why don't you just try it out so you will know for yourself? While you're proposing to try one thing that you know is not good for you, why don't you apply that principle to some others?" That illustration of the silliness of "trying it out for yourself' proved persuasive for one sixteen-year-old.<br><br>Here is another experience. A few years ago my wife and I and another General Authority and his wife were on a Church assignment. The other man's wife and I had dated when we were both in high school. I was glad, and I am sure she was glad, that we did not have any bad memories of that date. Both of us could speak of it to our spouses and both of us could speak to a Church audience in the presence of the other without embarrassment.<br><br>When we are young, we sometimes behave as if there were no tomorrow. When we are young it is easy to forget that we will grow up, marry, raise a family, and--note this significant point--continue to associate with some of the same people who are witnesses to or participants in our teenage pranks or transgressions.<br><br>Young men, the girl you are dating may be your wife in a few years, but probably she will not. Possibly she will turn out to be the wife of your bishop or your stake president. Young women, the fellow you are dating may turn out to be your husband, but more likely, he will not. He may turn out to be the husband of your sister or your best friend. He may even be a counselor in your bishopric or an employee you supervise at your place of work. Conduct your life today so your tomorrows are not burdened with bad or embarrassing memories.<br><h2><b>"He Who Has Repented"</b></h2><br>Most of what I have said here has been addressed to persons who think that repentance is too easy. At the opposite extreme are those who think that repentance is too hard. That group of souls are so tenderhearted and conscientious that they see sin everywhere in their own lives, and they despair of ever being able to be clean. The shot of doctrine that is necessary to penetrate the hard shell of the easygoing group is a massive overdose for the conscientious. What is necessary to encourage reformation for the lax can produce paralyzing discouragement for the conscientious. This is a common problem. We address a diverse audience each time we speak, and we are never free from the reality that a doctrinal underdose for some is an overdose for others.<br><br>I will conclude with a message of hope that is true for all, but especially needed for those who think that repentance is too hard.<br><br>Repentance is a continuing process, needed by all because "all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23). Repentance is possible, and then forgiveness is certain.<br><br>Elder Spencer W. Kimball said:<br><br><i>Sometimes . . . when a repentant one looks back and sees the ugliness, the loathsomeness of the transgression, he is almost overwhelmed and wonders, "Can the Lord ever forgive me? Can I ever forgive myself?" But when one reaches the depths of despondency and feels the hopelessness of his position, and when he cries out to God for mercy in helplessness but in faith, there comes a still, small, but penetrating voice whispering to his soul, "Thy sins are forgiven thee."</i>[<i>The Miracle of Forgiveness,</i>1969, p. 344]<br><br>When this happens, how precious the promise that God will take "away the guilt from our hearts, through the merits of his Son" (Alma 24:10).<br><br>How comforting the promise that "though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow" (Isaiah 1:18).<br><br>How glorious God's own promise that "he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more" (D&amp;amp;C 58:42; see also Jeremiah 31:34, Hebrews 8:12).<br><br>These things are true. I testify of Jesus Christ who made it all possible and who gave us the conditions of repentance and the pathway to perfection provided by his atoning sacrifice. And I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Dallin H.

<h1>l Checkups - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
President Lee, platform guests, brothers and sisters, I feel privileged to meet with you this morning. I also feel humble and in desperate need of spiritual assistance as I share with you some personal thoughts that have preoccupied my mind this past summer.<br><br>Some of you may have heard a portion of what I plan to say. Please, however, bear with me, and perhaps the repetition will enhance your learning.<br><br>More than forty years ago, I read these lines:<br><br><i>A thorough physical checkup every now and again,</i><br><i>Is considered a plan of wisdom by most clear thinking men.</i><br><i>So why not the same sort of checkup</i><br><i>In our quest for the ultimate goal?</i><br><i>A checkup, not just of the body</i><br><i>But one as well, for the soul</i><br>[<i>Sunshine</i>]<br><br>There was a time when I felt that I would live forever. I was young, my body was lean and strong, and my energy was almost limitless. I ran when I might have walked, I leaped when I might have lumbered. But as the years have passed, many rivets have come loose in my marvelous machine, and I am reminded almost daily of the need to use wisdom and to take care of myself. Otherwise, I will not be able to "walk and not faint," nor will "the destroying angel" pass by me (see D&amp;amp;C 89:20–21).<br><br>Yes, I receive an annual physical checkup, and I see my dentist at least twice a year. I watch my diet, I try to get the proper amount of rest, and I walk the boulevard almost daily. All of this is done rather religiously so that I might lengthen my days in mortality and enjoy a fulness of life.<br><br>I do subscribe to the philosophy stated by a noted physician: "To keep the body fit is a help in keeping the mind pure, and the sensations of the first few hours of the day are the best test of its normal state. The clean tongue, the clear head, and the bright eye are birthrights of each day" (William Osler, <i>A Way of Life, </i>p. 25).<br><br>However, I wonder whether I am paying sufficient attention to the spiritual aspects or dimensions of my life. I do so because I know that "the spirit and the body [constitute] the soul of man" and that a synergistic relationship should exist between the flesh and the divine spark within all of us (D&amp;amp;C 88:15). I also wonder whether I am conducting frequent and thorough "spiritual checkups" to assess my standing before God and to determine whether I am on the path that leads to eternal life--my "ultimate goal." It would profit me little if I were to close my life on earth with bulging muscles, a full set of teeth, and an anemic or sagging spirit.<br><br>It was the Apostle Paul who wrote, "Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves" (2 Corinthians 13:5). Paul didn't include in his writings a specific checklist or testing instrument that we might use in determining our spiritual fitness. Nonetheless, I believe there are several ways of conducting spiritual checkups whereby we might obtain readings of the spirit comparable to EKGs, blood pressure, temperature, and other readings of the body.<br><br>Permit me to suggest five opportunities for proving our own selves or undergoing regular spiritual checkups. There are others, I am certain, that could be cited; however, these five tests of faith and faithfulness seem to be the most obvious and practical.<br><h2><b>Four of the Five Spiritual Checkup Opportunities</b></h2><br><h3><b><i>1. Attendance at Sacrament Meeting</i></b></h3><br>One spiritual checkup is related to the weekly sacrament service. In this meeting we partake of the sacrament and renew our covenants with the Lord. Moreover, we fast and pray and speak with one another concerning the welfare of our souls (see Moroni 6:5-6, 9). Those who participate in this service properly and worshipfully conduct a quiet self-introspection centered around searching questions:<br><br>• Do I remember the Savior and the Atonement?<br><br>• Do I really love the Lord?<br><br>• Have I taken upon me the name of Christ?<br><br>• Am I keeping all of the commandments?<br><br>• Does the Holy Spirit abide with me?<br><br>• What can I do more to strengthen my faith, increase my devotion, and demonstrate my love and gratitude to deity?<br><br>Answers to these questions provide a reading of our spirituality similar to the physical readings obtained with a thermometer or blood pressure instrument. Each answer ought to reveal needed changes. And, renewal and resolve should be uppermost in our minds as we partake of the sacrament.<br><br>It is said that immediately following a ten-minute presentation the average person remembers only half of what was said. Two days or forty-eight hours later the recall drops to 25 percent.<br><br>In a week's time, the recall drops even more, perhaps to as little as 10 percent or less, depending upon the circumstances under which the instruction was given and our own receptivity. Little wonder God commands us to meet together regularly to renew our covenants with him.<br><br>Do you regard each sacrament service as a time to examine and to prove yourself, whether ye be firmly planted in the faith? Keep in mind these words of Paul, "But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup" (1 Corinthians 11:28), and, I would add, let him do so worthily.<br><h3><b><i>2. Interviews with Priesthood Leaders</i></b></h3><br>The second spiritual checkup occurs when we are interviewed by a priesthood leader and he ascertains our worthiness to serve, to receive a temple recommend, or to enjoy some other privilege in the Church. Each leader represents the Great Physician, even Jesus Christ, and is authorized to ask us certain questions in confidence.<br><br>How often have you been asked:<br><br>• Do you sustain the General Authorities of the Church?<br><br>• Are you honest in your dealings with your fellowmen?<br><br>• Are you morally clean?<br><br>• Do you pay your tithing, etc.?<br><br>How we answer the priesthood leader's questions and how we feel in his presence reveals much concerning our standing before the Lord.<br><br>Recently, a sister-in-law was interviewed by a priesthood leader as she sought the renewal of a temple recommend. He asked:<br><br>"How long has it been since you received your first recommend?"<br><br>"Twenty-five years," she responded.<br><br>The stake president paused for several moments, then asked: "Are you twenty-five times better today than when you first went to the temple?"<br><br>She did some serious soul-searching on that occasion.<br><br>All of us must remember that we do not become automatically saints, in the full sense of the word, through baptism. We are baptized so that we might enter the kingdom of God; but once through that gateway, we must essay or strive to become saints of the living God (see D&amp;amp;C 125:2). Every LDS family should keep in mind the scripture found in Mosiah chapter 3, verse 19. This scripture reminds us that we must become saints through the atonement of Christ by yielding to the enticings of the Holy Spirit and by acquiring Christlike virtues.<br><br>Do you regard each interview with a priesthood leader as a time to examine and to prove yourself, whether ye be firmly planted in the faith?<br><h3><b><i>3. Temple Attendance</i></b></h3><br>A third opportunity to receive a spiritual checkup occurs in the temple. It is recorded that the house of the Lord is a place where we may grow up in God, receive a fulness of the Holy Ghost, be organized according to divine laws, and be prepared to obtain every needful thing (see D&amp;amp;C 109:15).<br><br>However, the realization of these temple blessings is predicated upon our personal worthiness and faithfulness. One who goes to the temple worthily draws closer to the Lord and feels of his holy presence. But one who goes to the temple unworthily and under false pretenses does so with a bothersome conscience and fails to receive the instruction in an edifying manner. Let me illustrate.<br><br>A few years ago, my wife and I attended an afternoon session in the Salt Lake Temple. The company was small, consisting of no more than a dozen men and a dozen women. I scanned the group, casually noting that all were strangers to me except my wife. We were instructed in the first room and then moved to the next. As we took our seats in the second room, there was a slight commotion. I looked about to see what was wrong. In doing so, I saw a woman leave the room. All of us assumed that she was ill or had perhaps forgotten a piece of clothing. The interruption was brief and the instruction resumed. It was a refreshing temple experience for us, and we returned home rejoicing.<br><br>The next day I received a very unusual telephone call. My secretary came to my office door and said: "A woman wants to speak with you, but she won't give me her name."<br><br>I picked up the phone and announced myself. The caller promptly asked, "Elder Asay, what do you know about me?"<br><br>"How can I answer your question," I responded, "when you haven't even given me your name?"<br><br>She continued, "You were in the three o'clock temple session yesterday, weren't you?"<br><br>"Yes," I answered, "I was there."<br><br>She said, "Do you remember someone walking out of the second room?"<br><br>"Yes," I replied.<br><br>"It was I who walked out of the temple yesterday. Elder Asay, what do you know about me?"<br><br>At this point the conversation was becoming a bit tedious, and I said, "My dear, please don't play games with me. Unless you tell me who you are, how can I respond to your query?"<br><br>Almost totally ignoring what I said, the woman confessed: "It was I who left the temple room yesterday before the instruction began. I did so because you looked at me with a searching look, and you made me feel as though I was unworthy to be there." Once again, she asked, "What do you know about me?"<br><br>I said: "Well, if you attended the temple worthily yesterday, I apologize for how I may have looked at you and for how I may have made you feel. However, if you were there unworthily, I make no apology."<br><br>There was a long silence and then soft sobbing over the telephone. Finally, the woman confessed: "I have committed a serious sin, and I attended the temple yesterday under false pretenses. However," she added, "I visited my bishop last night, and I will follow his counsel and advice."<br><br>This unusual experience reminded me of the words of Moroni:<br><br><i>Then will ye longer deny the Christ, or can ye behold the Lamb of God? Do ye suppose that ye shall dwell with him under a consciousness of your guilt? Do ye suppose that ye could be happy to dwell with that holy Being, when your souls are racked with a consciousness of guilt that ye have ever abused his laws?</i><br><br><i>Behold, I say unto you that ye would be more miserable to dwell with a holy and just God, under a consciousness of your filthiness before him, than ye would to dwell with the damned souls in hell.</i><br><br><i>For behold, when ye shall be brought to see your nakedness before God, and also the glory of God, and the holiness of Jesus Christ, it will kindle a flame of unquenchable fire upon you. </i>[Mormon 9:3–5]<br><br>It is most significant that the woman judged herself through my eyes in the house of the Lord. She verified in part the truth that "no unclean thing can dwell with God" or abide his holy presence (1 Nephi 10:21),for "the piercing eye of the Almighty God" sees all (Jacob 2:10). Nothing escapes his view, whether it be done in private or in public. Therefore, we should be consistent in our righteousness and strive to reach that state of goodness whereby we feel comfortable in his holy house--the place where he manifests himself to his people (see D&amp;amp;C 109:5).<br><br>Do you regard each visit to the temple as a time to examine and prove yourself, whether ye be planted firmly in the faith?<br><h3><b><i>4. Reading/Pondering Scriptures</i></b></h3><br>A fourth way of undergoing a spiritual exam or checkup is by reading and pondering selected scriptures. A modern scripture reads:<br><br><i>These words are not of men nor of man, but of me; wherefore, you shall testify they are of me and not of man;</i><br><br><i>For it is my voice which speaketh them unto you; for they are given by my Spirit unto you, and by my power you can read them one to another; and save it were by my power you could not have them;</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, you can testify that you have heard my voice, and know my words. </i>[D&amp;amp;C 18:34–36]<br><br>Please note that the scripture states that we may hear God's voice through the scriptures. That is why I refer to my scripture reading as my daily interview with the Lord. He not only speaks to me as I ponder his holy word but he also holds before me a mirror of standards and principles that reflects my level of performance.<br><br>For example, there is one chapter in the Book of Mormon that I refer to as the "mirror" chapter. I speak of Alma 5. This scripture centers upon more than forty soul-searching questions, according to my count. One who reads those questions and answers them personally and honestly will obtain a fairly accurate reading of his standing before God.<br><br>Permit me to hold this mirror before your faces and ask but eleven questions:<br><br><i>And now behold, I ask of you, my brethren </i>[and sisters] <i>of the church, have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?</i><br><br><i>Do you exercise faith in the redemption of him who created you? Do you look forward with an eye of faith, and view this mortal body raised in immortality, and this corruption raised in incorruption, to stand before God to be judged according to the deeds which have been done in the mortal body?</i><br><br><i>I say unto you, can you imagine to yourselves that ye hear the voice of the Lord, saying unto you, in that day: Come unto me ye blessed, for behold, your works have been the works of righteousness upon the face of the earth?</i><br><br><i>Or do ye imagine to yourselves that ye can lie unto the Lord in that day, and say--Lord, our works have been righteous works upon the face of the earth--and that he will save you?</i><br><br><i>Or otherwise, can ye imagine yourselves brought before the tribunal of God with your souls filled with guilt and remorse, having a remembrance of all your guilt, yea, a perfect remembrance of all your wickedness, yea, a remembrance that ye have set at defiance the commandments of God?</i><br><br><i>I say unto you, can ye look up to God at that day with a pure heart and clean hands? I say</i><br><br><i>unto you, can you look up, having the image of God engraven upon your countenances? </i>[Alma 5:14–19]<br><br>How did you fare? Did you have the proper answers to the questions asked? Did you pass Alma's spiritual examination?<br><br>One who stands before a scriptural mirror and comes up short but who refuses to make needed corrections in his life-style reminds me of these inspired words:<br><br><i>For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:</i><br><br><i>For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was. </i>[James 1:23-24]<br><br>Do you regard the reading and pondering of the holy scriptures as a time to examine and prove yourself, whether ye be planted firmly in the faith?<br><h2><b>Fifth Spiritual Checkup</b></h2><br>A fifth spiritual checkup should take place as you participate in special programs such as BYU Education Week.<br><br>As announced, the theme for this gathering is "Education: Awakening Understanding." The opening paragraph in the class schedule reads as follows:<br><br>"Welcome to Education Week--the sixty-eighth year of this rich tradition. Whether your interests include religious education, family relationships, self-improvement, art, literature, history, or dozens of other topics, Education Week can provide an enlightening and informative view. With a distinguished and distinctively qualified faculty, <i>the dawning of new realms of understanding </i>await you here" (emphasis added).<br><br>I underscore these words, <i>the dawning of new realms of understanding, </i>for they suggest that all of you will be participating in an educational reveille this week--a reveille bugled by 168 teachers and consisting of in excess of 1,000 different formations or classes. Each instructor is expected to sound his or her trumpet in a way that will catch your attention, awaken your senses, and open your eyes of understanding to those things that matter most. Each of you is expected to apply himself or herself to learning and to awake and shake off the chains of ignorance in one way or another.<br><br>Winston Churchill said: "Men occasionally stumble over the truth, but most of them pick themselves up and hurry off as if nothing had happened." Such "stumbling" and "hurrying off" is not in harmony with the purpose and intent of this program. What is sought for here is serious soul-searching, conscious hungering of truth--even a quest for hidden knowledge--and a more consistent application of righteous principles in our daily living; otherwise, we shall not gain understanding nor shall we rid ourselves of the dust that accumulates from our falls.<br><br>Said Lehi to his children:<br><br><i>O that ye would awake; awake from a deep sleep, yea, even from the sleep of hell, and shake off the awful chains by which ye are bound, which are the chains which bind the children of men, that they are carried away captive down to the eternal gulf of misery and woe.</i><br><br><i>Awake! and arise from the dust. </i>[2 Nephi 1:13–14]<br><br>Lehi's appeal to his children may be 2500 years old, but it constitutes a timely call for us today. Many of us are asleep and oblivious to "things as they really are, and of things as they really will be" (Jacob 4:13). We, therefore, see things "through a glass, darkly" and miss the glorious views of life that make all the difference (1 Corinthians 13:12; see also 2 Nephi 1:24). And if we don't wake up, our dozing will have a damning effect upon us forever--perhaps even making us captives of the enemy of our souls.<br><br>As you prepare to receive instructions in one or more of the 1 ,000-plus class offerings of this educational experience or time of spiritual testing, perhaps the words of the prophet Jacob apply: "O my brethren [and sisters], hearken unto my words; <i>arouse the faculties of your souls" </i>(Jacob 3:11; emphasis added).<br><br>Whether you plan to attend one of the more traditional classes such as<br><br>• The Old Testament;<br><br>• Faith unto Life and Salvation;<br><br>• Revelation;<br><br>• The Profile of a Prophet;<br><br>or one of the more exotic titles like<br><br>• Snap, Crackle, Pop, or Soggy Cornflakes;<br><br>• A Juggler's Life for Me;<br><br>• Danger: Burn-out Ahead!;<br><br>• There's No Traffic Jam on the Extra Mile, etc.,<br><br>it is hoped that there will be a full investment of minds, spirits, and willpower. When all of the faculties of one's soul are awakened by light and truth, knowledge is transferred into wisdom, wisdom leads to understanding, understanding provides a fulness of life, and God grants to men according to their wills.<br><br>The reveille or spiritual testing that I feel should be associated with this educational experience is centered in these scripturally based questions:<br><br>• Do you have a knowledge of God's goodness, and do you have a sense of your own nothingness by comparison?<br><br>• Are you aware of God's judgment and holy cause or purposes?<br><br>• Is your soul fully awake and able to fend off all forms of sin?<br><br>• Do you have a full sense of your duty to God, and are you walking blamelessly before him?<br><br>In effect, are you men and women of understanding?<br><h2><b>Sense of Nothingness</b></h2><br>King Benjamin made reference to an awakening, to a "knowledge of the goodness of God at this time" and to "a sense of [our] nothingness" (Mosiah 4:5). Such realization reminds all of us of our puniness before God and fosters feelings of humility--placing us in a teachable frame of mind.<br><br>We frequently sing these inspired words:<br><br><i>O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder</i><br><i>Consider all the worlds thy hands have made,</i><br><i>I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder, </i><br><i>Thy pow'r thru out the universe displayed;</i><br><br><i>Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee,</i><br><i>How great thou art! How great thou art!</i><br><br><i>And when I think that God, his Son not sparing,</i><br><i>Sent him to die, I scarce can take it in,</i><br><i>That on the cross my burden gladly bearing </i><br><i>He bled and died to take away my sin,</i><br><br><i>Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee, </i><br><i>How great thou art! How great thou art! </i><br>["How Great Thou Art," <i>Hymns, </i>1985, no. 86, verses 1 and 3]<br><br>We need not cower before our Maker or engage in denigrating practices, but we must allow his greatness and goodness to bend our knees and to lift our eyes ever Godward. If we don't, our spiritual progress will be stunted and our quest for understanding detoured.<br><br>Do you have a knowledge and understanding of God's goodness? Do you have a sense of your own nothingness? Are you humble and teachable as this Education Week begins?<br><h2><b>God's Cause and Judgment</b></h2><br>The Psalmist wrote: "Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause, my God and my Lord" (Psalms 35:23). Unless we stir within us an awareness of God and his holy purposes, much of what we learn here will be lost and quickly forgotten. We will have no hooks upon which to hang our newfound knowledge. But if we keep uppermost in our minds the Great Planner and his great plan, all that we learn here will be placed in proper perspective and have real meaning.<br><br>Moses did not fully understand the judgment of God until he climbed Mount Nebo. However, once he placed his feet upon that pinnacle and "the Lord shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan, And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea, And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar," then he realized the full consequences of his transgression (see Deuteronomy 32:49–52, 34:1–4).<br><br>It is hoped that you will climb your own Mount Nebo on this campus and attend classes that will not only stir your souls but open to your eyes a panoramic view of the divine scheme of things and your standing before God Almighty.<br><br>Are you fully aware of God's cause, his purposes, his plan, and his judgment and work among men?<br><h2><b>"Righteousness, and Sin Not"</b></h2><br>The Apostle Paul appealed to the Saints in Corinth to "awake to righteousness, and sin not" (1 Corinthians 15:34). In the modern vernacular, we would say, "Wake up and fly right." Nephi said it this way: "Awake, my soul! No longer droop in sin. Rejoice, O my heart, and give place no more for the enemy of my soul" (2 Nephi 4:28).<br><br>Old Scratch, even Satan, specializes in singing the softest, sweetest, and most sinister of all lullabies. He lulls people to sleep by calling evil good, justifying a little sin, ridiculing goodness, and twisting the truth ever so slightly until it becomes false and vain and foolish doctrine (see 2 Nephi 28:7–9).<br><br>One writer referred to understanding as "that faculty whereby we are enabled to apprehend the objects of knowledge, generals as well as particulars, absent things as well as present, <i>and to judge of their truth or falsehood, good or bad" </i>(John Wilkins; emphasis added ).<br><br>Our spiritual well-being depends upon our ability to discern between truth and error and to hold fast to that which is good. The question is asked once again: Is your soul fully awake and able to not only discern but to fend off all forms of sin?<br><h2><b>Sense of Duty</b></h2><br>Said Alma to the people in a city called Gideon: "And now my beloved brethren, I have said these things unto you that I might <i>awaken you to a sense of your duty to God, that ye may walk blameless before him, that ye may walk after the holy order of God, </i>after which ye have been received" (Alma 7:22; emphasis added).<br><br>Two questions follow: What is our duty to God? Are we walking blamelessly before him, after the holy order of God?<br><br>It is written: "Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man" (Ecclesiastes 12:13).<br><br>This statement answers one question, but what about the other? Perhaps it will be answered as you learn more this week about priesthood, ordinances, family, and other saving aspects of the gospel of Christ. And perhaps through this experience your resolve to "pay that that [you] have vowed" (Jonah 2:9) will be strengthened as you participate in classes, especially those similar to "Developing Self-Discipline."<br><br>If this program does nothing else for you, I pray that it will help you understand more clearly your duty to God and bolster your determination to walk the high road that leads to eternal life.<br><h2><b>Spiritual Power</b></h2><br>I fear that we underestimate the potential spiritual power that resides within all of us. Hence we ignore the need for spiritual fitness, and we allow our spirits to become flabby and terribly out of shape. Rather than "put[ting] off the natural man," as we have been told to do, we allow him to gain the upper hand, thus wasting the inner and spiritual powers (Mosiah 3:19).<br><br>Perhaps I can illustrate those powers by sharing a quote from the Defense Strategy Seminar of the National War College in 1972. I quote:<br><br><i>The incredible feats of little Japan during WorId War II cannot be explained in terms of its meager objective resources, but must be attributed above all to the existence of a self-image that has translated into superior national morale. This national morale became an immense storehouse of power. A well-known student of Japan, Ruth Benedict, provides a fascinating illustration of this morale factor in her report of a Japanese radio broadcast describing the behavior of a Japanese pilot during the war:</i><br><br><i>"After the air battles were over, the Japanese planes returned to their base in small formations of three or four. A Captain was in one of the first planes to return. After alighting from his plane, he stood on the ground and gazed into the sky through binoculars. As his men returned, he counted. He looked rather pale, but he was quite steady. After the last plane returned, he made out a report and proceeded to Headquarters. At Headquarters he made his report to the Commanding Officer. As soon as he had finished his report, however, he suddenly dropped to the ground. The officers on the spot rushed to give assistance, but alas! he was dead. On examining his body it was found that it was already cold, and he had a bullet wound in his chest, which had proved fatal. It is impossible for the body of a newly dead person to be cold. Nevertheless, the body of the dead Captain was as cold as ice. The Captain must have been dead long before, and it was his spirit that made the report. Such a miraculous feat must have been achieved by the </i>strict sense of responsibility<i> that the dead Captain possessed."</i><br><br><i>To a non-Japanese, this story might seem like an outrageous yarn. But this writer himself heard the particular broadcast and was able to observe the reaction of Japanese military personnel in occupied Shanghai. The story was believed almost without exception. It was common knowledge that a disciplined spirit was master of the body, that indeed "a composed spirit could last a thousand years." Why should it not be possible that the spirit of a man could outlive his body by a few hours if that man had made duty and responsibility to the Emperor the central tenets of his life? </i>[John G. Stoessinger, "The Nature of Power," reprinted in <i>The Might of Nations: World Politics in Our Time, </i>3rd ed. (New York: Random House, 1969), pp. 15–27]<br><br>Let me read that last sentence once again, substituting some words. "Why should it not be possible that the spirit of a man could outlive his body . . . if that man had made duty and responsibility to <i>God </i>the central tenets of his life?"<br><br>A knowledge of who we are, a self-image that is ennobling, a strict sense of moral responsibility, a disciplined spirit, and a keen sense of duty to God--these are the keys to spiritual power.<br><h2><b>People of Understanding</b></h2><br>Throughout the scriptures we read of people who were spiritually strong and who had understanding--a most coveted character trait. In the book of Ezra, a group was referred to as "men of understanding" (Ezra 8:16). Abigail was mentioned as a "woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance" (1 Samuel 25:3). God gave Daniel and his associates "wisdom and understanding" that was ten times better than that of all the magicians and astrologers in the country (Daniel 1:20). And, of course, there was Solomon, and the sons of Mosiah, and Moroni. Such spiritual giants remind us of the need for real spiritual fitness because "a man [or woman] of understanding" (according to holy writ) is of "an excellent spirit" (Proverbs 17:27).<br><br>I find it interesting that men and women of understanding are described in the Old Testament as people who<br><br>• have wisdom (Proverbs 10:23),<br><br>• hold their peace (Proverbs 11:12, 17:28),<br><br>• follow good leaders (Proverbs 12:11),<br><br>• are slow to wrath (Proverbs 14:29),<br><br>• seek knowledge (Proverbs 15:14),<br><br>• walk uprightly (Proverbs 15:21), and<br><br>• hear reproof (Proverbs 15:32).<br><br>I also find it interesting to note that in holy writ, understanding is acquired by<br><br>• seeking it (Proverbs 4:7),<br><br>• pondering truth (D&amp;amp;C 110:1; 138:11, 29; Psalms 49:3),<br><br>• keeping the commandments (D&amp;amp;C 1:24),<br><br>• searching the scriptures (Alma 17:2; 32:28, 34),<br><br>• studying language (Mosiah 1:2),<br><br>• applying hearts (Mosiah 12:27; Proverbs 2:2),<br><br>• loving God (Mark 12:33),<br><br>• sinning no more (Hosea 13:2; Job 28:28),<br><br>• trusting in God (Proverbs 3:5),<br><br>• receiving counsel of the Lord (Deuteronomy 32:28), and<br><br>• asking for it (1 Kings 3:9).<br><br>Is this not the purpose of your experience here at this university--to seek understanding and wisdom and spiritual strength?<br><br>At a general conference years ago, President Brigham Young expressed concern about the Saints and their degree of understanding. He asked:<br><br><i>what do we understand? how far have we advanced? What do we expect to receive? How are we looking at things pertaining to this world? </i>. . . <i>Do we live our religion so that we improve on all the knowledge that God has given us? Do we live up to the light that the Lord has revealed? </i>[<i>JD</i> 12:258]<br><br>In brief, President Young was asking: Are the members of the Church men and women of understanding? Are they progressing spiritually as they should? These are relevant questions today.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>I have suggested, brothers and sisters, the need for us to conduct spiritual checkups on a regular basis. I have also proposed five occasions when we might assess our spirituality. These occasions are as follows:<br><br>1. When we partake of the sacrament in our worship services.<br><br>2. When we are interviewed by priesthood leaders--those who represent the Lord.<br><br>3. When we attend the temple--the house of God.<br><br>4. When we read "mirror" scriptures such as Alma 5.<br><br>5. When we attend educational conferences such as BYU Education Week.<br><br>All of these "checkups" have their place and are very important so long as we apply ourselves fully. Each should serve to awaken us from the so-called "sleep of hell" and to shake off the chains of ignorance by which we are bound. Each should cause us to desire understanding or a more excellent spirit. And all five occasions should help us understand that spiritual fitness, that of which I have spoken, is more important than gold and silver and the things they can buy (Proverbs 16:16).<br><br>The Apostle Paul must have had this thought in mind when he advised Timothy,<br><br><i>Exercise thyself rather unto godliness.</i><br><br><i>For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. </i>[1 Timothy 4:7–8]<br><br>The children of Issachar were referred to anciently as "men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do" (1 Chronicles 12:32). If there was ever a time when such an understanding group (multiplied a thousandfold over) was needed, it is now.<br><br>God bless you. God bless your instructors this week. And God bless all of us to seek new realms of understanding by awakening the powers within--even the powers of the Spirit. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Carlos E. Asay was a member of the Presidency of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 21 August 1990.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

There is one more award we need to make. A year ago I hinted at my need for help in understanding the term<i>provost</i>. From several suggested definitions, the winner of the 1990 "Define That Provost" sweepstakes is Art Bassett from the College of Humanities, who says that the term obviously means "the person most like Provo."<br><br>Now, whether you like that definition depends, of course, on how you feel about Provo. We could be talking here about the happiest one in Happy Valley, or the one whose food storage room most resembles Storehouse Market. But the most unsettling implication of being the person most like Provo hit me when I read in the 18 August<i>Deseret News</i>that the Provo-Orem area has now achieved the lofty distinction of being named by the EPA to "the dirty ten," that exclusive hit list of the U.S. cities with the dirtiest air.<br><br>On that subject, a young man who had spent his entire life in Provo (he had never left Utah County) decided to attend Ricks College. His roommates came to the Idaho Falls Airport to meet him. As he walked into that clear, pure, mountain air, he began to wheeze and cough. Turning blue, he fell to the ground gasping for breath. Then one of his roommates, being from Los Angeles, sensed what might be wrong. So he signaled the others, and they dragged the boy over to the back of a waiting bus, where he could breathe in air to which his system was more accustomed; then he was alright.<br><br>We have spent much of this last year just trying to know the major issues the university faces in the 1990s. I originally planned to talk about several of those matters here--admissions, gender-related concerns, faculty-student relationships, our emerging internationalism, and so on. But in the interest of time, I will treat only one topic today, and I look forward to a review of other important matters on another day.<br><br>I want to discuss the university's expectations regarding the scholarly and creative work of the faculty. My purpose is not to announce new policies but<i>only</i>to initiate a campus dialogue that will clarify the meaning of faculty scholarship in light of the university's mission. To give context to what follows, I begin by noting two sources of current criticism of higher education, first among the American public and second among members of the LDS Church.<br><br>Universities are criticized increasingly for some effects of the "marketing" of higher education during recent years, when a reduced pool of prospective students led many schools to make glossy sales pitches to governments, students, and the public. Critics question the disproportionate role of financial considerations in athletic policies; they challenge tuition increases by wondering, as the<i>Wall Street Journal</i>did, whether universities "exist mainly for the benefit of the faculty," because too many schools "seem more interested in attracting students than educating them" (<i>Wall Street Journal</i>, 12 March 1990, p. A10).<br><br>Two recent books that typify this critique are Charles Sykes'<i>Profscam</i>and Page Smith's<i>Killing the Spirit</i>. Sykes, a journalist, regards most university-level research as a scam and a racket that abandons undergraduate classrooms to overworked and poorly trained teaching assistants. Smith, a former university professor and administrator, is more moderate, but he still begins from the premise that "the vast majority of the so-called research turned out in the modern university is essentially worthless . . . busywork . . . [that] deprives students of . . . thoughtful and considerate . . . teaching" (Smith, p. 7). Such an extreme conclusion strikes me as an unfortunate exaggeration.<br><br>Henry Rosovsky of Harvard has defended the research university model in his new book,<i>The University</i>. He simply disagrees with the critics about the frequency of faculty abuses in research. Rosovsky also responds that the missions of individual colleges and universities vary greatly, and most of them do not research at all. Moreover, he notes, only 25 percent of all university-level faculty say they are more interested in research than in teaching.<br><br>This national debate is provoking serious talk about reform among responsible voices. Stanford President Donald Kennedy recently asked his faculty to reaffirm "that teaching in all its forms is the primary task" (<i>Los Angeles Times</i>, 6 April 1990). And Ernest Boyer of the respected Carnegie Foundation has announced a forthcoming report that urges a broadened definition of scholarship.<i>The Washington Post</i>sees the Kennedy and Boyer statements as signs that "universities are finally ready to discuss how this long-desired shift [toward greater emphasis on teaching] can be brought about" (17 April 1990). I will return to Boyer's proposal shortly.<br><br>Consider now some attitudes among church members about BYU, some of which echo the public's concerns about other universities. Academic standards have been rising at BYU during a time of rapid Church growth among peoples having lower educational and income levels than are typical among U.S. Church members. As the educational quality of BYU is rising, the education level of the average Church member, worldwide, is falling. As time goes on, these long-term trends will make BYU seem less representative of the Church membership.<br><br>Our enrollment ceiling accounts for most of the unhappiness Church members feel about BYU. No matter what our admission standards are, they will seem unfair to people who are excluded by them. Thus, some say that BYU is elitist, snobbish, and out of touch with the mainstream of the Church; others say that transfer students are unwelcome here, and that full-time professors are too busy with research to spend time with students, especially freshmen and sophomores. A parent of a BYU student recently expressed his concern that we are making the mistake of the apostate Nephites, among whom "the people began to be distinguished by ranks, according to their riches and their chances for learning; yea, some were ignorant because of their poverty, and others did receive great learning because of their riches" (3 Nephi 6:12).<br><br>Another man recently compared what he thinks BYU is doing with King Solomon did--creating a dazzling, gold-plated temple of learning designed primarily to impress the modern equivalents of Pharaoh and the Queen of Sheba. He argues that our seeking credibility with other universities runs the serious risk of replacing our standards of judgment with theirs. Our growing national and international acceptance may brush up against that risk, but it is also true that Pharaoh and the Queen of Sheba are the employers of our graduates, who are increasingly acting as young Josephs in a worldwide Egypt, rendering great service in ways that benefit the work of the Church.<br><br>BYU's emerging strength is one of the Church's greatest assets, and we must find ways to help others know us better. But the challenge of how we are perceived is not trivial. We enjoy a very serious, long-term relationship with the tithe payers of the Church, who understandably feel a special claim to our resources. Without compromising our commitment to educational quality, we must find creative ways to share the blessing of BYU as widely as possible. Our attitudes must leave no doubt in Church members' minds that we are doing all within our power to remain faithful to their trust.<br><br>BYU really doesn't have the same problems Stanford has, because we have generally maintained a strong commitment to teaching. Thus, I feel about the teaching/research debate on our campus the way some writers feel about the grace/works debate in Christian theology. C. S. Lewis wrote that this dispute "does seem to me like asking which blade in a pair of scissors is most necessary" (<i>Mere Christianity</i>, p. 129). And one theologian believes that stressing the dangers of "works" is "inappropriate if the listeners are not even trying!" and most listeners "are not in much danger of working their way to heaven" (Paul Holmer,<i>Theology Today</i>, vol. 10, p. 474). Not many BYU faculty are in danger of researching their way completely out of teaching.<br><br>At the same time, we must not let our twin commitments to scholarship and teaching obscure some complex variables that need to be addressed. We must be sure that the<i>implementation</i>of our scholarly expectations brings out the best our faculty have to give in ways that are consistent with the university's mission.<br><br>Two factors persuade me that we need a modest adjustment in our approach to the issue of faculty scholarship: resource allocation and variations among disciplines. Regarding the allocation of resources, I offer two illustrations to support the general proposition that we may already be stretching the precious resource of faculty time too thin.<br><br>A committee of the BYU Faculty Advisory Council in 1988 concluded, based on campuswide faculty interviews, that "rising expectations for scholarly attainment will increasingly come into serious . . . conflict with the teaching workload of the university unless the size of the student body is reduced, the size of the faculty is increased, or scholarly expectations are moderated." One empirical finding that supports this conclusion is that, according to our faculty load reports, the BYU faculty increased the fraction of its time spent on research by about 35 percent between 1980 and 1989 without a corresponding increase in new teaching resources. Although higher academic expectations are a welcome step in the university's progress, the Faculty Advisory Council committee believes we may be fueling some part of that progress by a form of deficit spending.<br><br>President Lee and I recently asked a national leader in higher education for his view on faculty research at BYU. He immediately asked us, what is your student-faculty ratio? We replied that it is about 21:1. He replied that most major research universities are at about 16 and the better ones are at 12. I have since noted that Stanford's ration is 10. Stated another way, (based on 1988 expenditures) major research universities typically spend about $20,000 annually per student--two and a half times as much as the $8,000 BYU spends annually per student. In this seasoned leaders view, it is impossible for us to compete across the board with graduate research universities without a monumental change in our resource base; and without that change, a large-scale research campaign would lead only to frustration and disappointment.<br><br>And what is true for student-faculty ratios is obviously true for new buildings, research space, equipment, and every other resource-related question. As King Benjamin said, "See that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength" (Mosiah 4:27).<br><br>Our friend then asked us whether the BYU board of trustees is likely to favor massive new infusions of tithing, tuition, or governmental funding--enough to reduce our student-faculty ration substantially. Our answer had to be no, given the effect of the Church's international growth on tithing resources, given the demand for us to accept more students, and given the concern of the trustees about dependence on governmental aid. And even if more funds were available, undergraduate admissions pressures would dictate giving<i>more</i>students per dollar the blessing of a BYU experience, not fewer.<br><br>It is clearly better to be a first-rate teaching institution than a third-rate research institution. But that does not mean we don't care about faculty scholarship. On the contrary, a primary difference between a first-rate and a third-rate<i>teaching</i>university is in the quality of the faculty's scholarly and creative work. Thus I am grateful that our student-faculty ratio is 21 rather than 30, as it is at many teaching-oriented institutions. The fine work already taking place across the campus with our limited resources demonstrates that we are clearly capable of pursuing a broad commitment to faculty scholarship that strengthens--indeed, is absolutely essential to--our teaching mission.<br><br>But we must pursue that goal with realistic expectations about the use of faculty time and research support. Harvard's Henry Rosovsky reports that at major research universities, about two-thirds of the students are graduate students. At BYU, one-tenth are graduate students. He notes that the rough rule of thumb in research universities is that the faculty spend about half their time in teaching-related activity and the other half on research. A 10:1 student-faculty ratio makes that allocation possible. More specifically, Rosovsky says that in research universities, 33 percent of the faculty spend over twenty hours per week on research. By contrast, in what he calls "top" teaching colleges, only 5 percent of the faculty spend over twenty hours per week on research (Rosovsky, p. 81). The fact that the top teaching colleges devote somewhat less time to research does not make the teaching at these schools necessarily inferior. Rosovsky describes the teaching of undergraduates by heavily research-oriented faculty not as better, but only as "intellectually different" from more teaching-oriented instruction (p. 86). Indeed, for teaching undergraduates, he advocates the use of older faculty, rather than fresh, young researchers, because in teaching undergraduates (as distinguished from teaching graduate students), "the latest specialist wrinkles are less important than wisdom" (p. 217).<br><br>I turn now to the fact or differences among academic disciplines as a variable that affects the way we define scholarly expectations. As strong as our current students are, their interests range very widely. In some ways, the most exciting conception of our teaching role here is the preparation of truly promising young men and women for graduate and professional studies at the nation's leading research universities. BYU has fulfilled that role over the years with increasing success. But the fraction of our students who are actually on that track is small. About 55 percent of our 27,000 students eventually complete a bachelor's degree here or elsewhere within twelve years from the time they begin. Of this number, some 30 percent will do postgraduate work, or about 4,500. The remaining 22,500 students are involved in an amazing mix of applied, professional, and vocational programs leading, at best, to terminal undergraduate degrees.<br><br>The faculty strengths required to serve these diverse interests are not likely to come all from the same cookie cutter. In some of our strong theory-oriented disciplines, the faculty devote great time and effort toward the aspiration of publishing in the nation's finest theory-oriented journals. I have spent much of my professional life pursuing that goal. I know firsthand what it requires and I care about it intensely. But I would not impose that goal uniformly and uncritically on such disciplines as nursing, religion, music, art, dance, theatre, and several other disciplines.<br><br>Similarly, I have profound respect for the basic research accomplishments of our faculty in engineering, in the physical and math sciences, and in other quantitative and empirical fields. Their high quality work deserves our strong, continued support. But I note that the statistics listing the top 100 research universities by amounts of federal research grants totally exclude from their computations the humanities, education, business, law, and much of the social sciences. Thus, the amounts in federal grants an academic department receives may or may not tell us about the quality of the department's scholarly work when measured by the standards of the relevant discipline. No wonder William Schaefer, former executive vice chancellor and professor of English at UCLA, would write on behalf of what you might call sanity in the humanities that we must stop "pretending that literary scholarship and criticism are akin to scientific research." This doesn't mean that scholarship in the humanities is less important--just that it is different.<br><br>Not only the nature but the<i>purpose</i>of our scholarly work will vary across disciplines and among individual faculty. Perhaps the highest purpose of university research is the discovery of new knowledge through basic research, which can contribute enormously to society and bring great credit to the university. Many BYU faculty are now capable of and devoted to such research programs, which we can and must support enthusiastically. But by our institutional nature, the ultimate purpose of<i>most</i>faculty scholarship at BYU is to enhance teaching--not because this is necessarily a "better" form of scholarly work, but because it is the form most directly related both to our mission and our resource base. As Dallin Oakes said here in 1975, scholarly and creative work that strengthens our effectiveness as a teaching institution "is the principal justification for all our research and our other creative activities." And as Jeffrey Holland and Jae Ballif wrote in Memorandum 11 to the faculty, "the scholarly work of the University must infuse and inspire university teaching."<br><br>Whether one's scholarly work enhances or detracts from teaching is a question of fact, and that fact can be measured in faculty performance reviews. Frequently, scholarship strengthens teaching in very indirect ways--not by focusing on curriculum material, but simply by bringing a teacher to life. I have taught subjects in which I had done no research, and then I have taught subjects in which I was doing extensive research. As one of my students pointed out to me, I am a totally different teacher in the field of my research. I am excited about recent developments, I try out new ideas on my students, and I simply have a perspective about fundamental issues I can gain in no other way.<br><br>But I have also seen the faculty jet-setters who become so intoxicated with professional travel and ivory tower projects that they utterly lose touch with their teaching and their students. For those people, as Indiana University's Lewis Miller noted, "time devoted to the art of teaching is, with few exceptions, time subtracted from [what they believe is] the more important task of establishing a national reputation in research" (<i>Chronicle of Higher Education,</i>13 September 1989, p. A52). Scholarly work that strengthens teaching will not always build a national reputation in research--although in some disciplines, it can be done.<br><br>These thoughts about resource allocation and variety among disciplines bring me to the point of introducing a new definition of faculty scholarship provided by Ernest Boyer of the Carnegie Foundation's forthcoming report, "The New American Scholar." Responding both to public frustration and to faculty confusion on this subject, Boyer recommends four forms of scholarship that should be accepted for tenure reviews, promotions, and other reward systems: discovering knowledge, integrating knowledge, applying knowledge, and presenting knowledge.<br><br>A word about each category:<br><br>1.<i>Discovered</i>knowledge is basic research that seeks to develop new knowledge. I have already noted the first-place significance of this discovery process.<br><br>2.<i>Integrated</i>knowledge makes connections across disciplines. This form of scholarship suggests the new hyphenated disciplines such as bio-engineering and psycho-linguistics. It also represents the best spirit of general education. Among other things, it suggests the intellectually alive teacher who, as our own Don Fleming has urged, is "as likely to be well read as well published--a teacher with a book under her arm that you know she is reading." One important form of integrated knowledge at BYU is work that integrates religious perspectives with the perspective of one's discipline; however, integration of this kind requires real rigor on both the religious and the disciplinary side, lest the integration appear to devalue both religion and the academic field.<br><br>3.<i>Applied</i>knowledge reflects the best tradition of land-grant colleges, where theory is applied to solve environmental, industrial, or other real-life problems.<br><br>4.<i>Presented</i>knowledge refers to both studying and improving teaching. Such scholarship would include the creative development of curriculum and classroom materials, textbooks, thoughtful essays, or empirical work that improves one's own teaching in form or content, as well as helping others to understand one's discipline. I wonder if we might find a way to include studies of the mentoring of individual students within this category. Mentoring is a critically important form of "life teaching," and our reward system should encourage it. I would also include here scholarship directed toward teaching that reaches beyond purely cognitive processes, when appropriate to the discipline. I am thinking of general education and other learning environments where good teaching can engender a disciplined form of passion, bringing a student to life spiritually and aesthetically as well as intellectually. My heart has always ached for sensitive humanities graduates whose immersion into the coldly analytical process of law has stripped them of their sense of wonder.<br><br>5. For our purposes, I would add to Boyer's list a fifth category called "creative expression," whether written, performed, displayed, or otherwise artistically expressed, and other written work of all kinds, including literary criticism, analytical essays, etc.<br><br>For these five forms of scholarship to satisfy our high standards of quality at BYU, scholarly and creative projects should meet at least five additional criteria. I especially thank Douglas Smoot for these ideas, which I have combined with Ernest Boyer's suggestions.<br><br>1. Clearly articulated purposes and procedures that are consistent with departmental, college, and university missions.<br><br>2. Documentation of the scholarly process, as appropriate.<br><br>3. The scholar's critical evaluation of his or her own results.<br><br>4. Some element of originality.<br><br>5. Peer review, in any one of several ways, on this campus or elsewhere.<br><br>With this definition of scholarship, I would urge that we expect<i>every</i>BYU faculty member to engage continuously in some acceptable level of scholarly and creative work. Toward that end, we should consider the use of low-key but meaningful five-year reviews for each member of the faculty, including full professors with continuing faculty status. The faculty have already adopted such a review process at the Law School, and they regard it as a nonthreatening, positive process of collegial support.<br><br>Each faculty member's expectations should be developed in an individually negotiated understanding in writing with the department chair, and individual performance should be evaluated according to that understanding. Particular approaches will vary among individuals and departments as circumstances, needs, and interests require. Some scholarly projects will be short-term; some will be long-term. Some projects will require more of one's time than others, but<i>all</i>faculty should do scholarly work to some meaningful degree. A faculty member's own mix of teaching, committee, and scholarly time commitments may vary from one period of a career to another. Such variety could prove very healthy. When performed at equal levels of quality, the university should value all assignments equally, whether a heavy research commitment coupled with a low teaching load or a heavy teaching load coupled with less time-consuming scholarly and creative projects. Salaries, promotions, awards, and other incentives should reflect this attitude.<br><br>The cumulative result of this individual assignment process should help to relieve any time pressures that are now actually impinging on our primary teaching mission. Experience may teach us that we also need to clarify certain departmental and college goals in some way that reflects these adjustments.<br><br>I am aware that individualized faculty assignments may seem difficult to manage. But, as Stephen Robinson of Religious Education has suggested, think of each department as a bag of golf clubs. You might be a low-numbered wood or a high-numbered iron--each club plays a unique role in accomplishing the department's mission, whether your department happens to be in the rough or on the fairway. I can hear what many are thinking already: nobody wants to be a sand wedge, much less the department putter. But remember what the real golfers say--drive for show and putt for dough.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, I realize that in many ways we are not as alive intellectually at BYU as we might be, despite great progress in recent years. Not all of us are as alive spiritually as we should be. I worry that some may take my talking about a more flexible definition of scholarship as a signal that less is expected of the faculty, intellectually<i>or</i>spiritually. My purpose is by no means to de-emphasize scholarship; on the contrary, I seek to clarify the<i>nature</i>and<i>meaning</i>of scholarship in order to emphasize it more broadly and more realistically in ways that are consistent with the university's mission and resources. I honestly believe that we can<i>lift</i>our overall level of professional intensity through a conscientious understanding of the resource allocation process, variations among disciplines, and the real purposes of scholarship--and with consistent follow-through on individualized assignments by department chairs.<br><br>I was impressed recently in looking through our new campus publication "New Books," which summarizes about 175 scholarly books published by members of the BYU community in the two and a half years since 1987. These books range from scientific reports and theoretical treatises to leading textbooks and religious works. I thought of how far we have come since 1974, when the faculty produced 26 books. Of course, books represent only a fraction of the faculty's research and creative work, and some books are better than others. But there is something about a book--especially when it captures and represents a sound educational process, for both author and reader. As Groucho Marx said (according to Phil Snyder), "Outside of a dog, man's best friend is a book; inside of a dog, it's too dark to read."<br><br>As I conclude, I am thinking of books as a symbol for all the forms of true scholarly and creative work among our various disciplines.<br><br>I love Emily Dickinson's lines:<br><br><i>She ate and drank the precious words</i><br><i>Her spirit grew robust;</i><br><i>She knew no more that she was poor,</i><br><i>Nor that her frame was dust.</i><br><i>She danced along the dingy days,</i><br><i>And this bequest of wings</i><br><i>Was but a book.</i><br><i>What liberty a loosened spirit brings!</i><br><br>A book gives wings of liberty, not only to a reader, but also to an author--wings for miraculous flights that span both continents and centuries. As Charles Kingsley wrote, "Except a living [person], there is nothing more wonderful than a book!"--a "message to us . . . from human souls we never saw, who lived, perhaps thousands of miles [or thousands of years] away. And yet these [people], in those little sheets of paper, speak to us, arouse us, terrify us, teach us, comfort us, open their hearts to us as brothers."<br><br>You may remember our splendid commencement speaker from last April, Mary Ann Glendon, an internationally known family and comparative law scholar from Harvard University. I first met Mary Ann in a book. She spoke to me and taught me, stretching and enriching my thinking and writing. Only later did I discover how closely she had been reading my own little sheets of printed paper. When she and I finally met in person, we felt like old friends, even valued allies.<br><br>During my years at Ricks College, I spent some of my summer months doing research and writing at the Law School here in Provo. One day a close associate in Idaho asked me what in the world I did all day when I went to Provo. "Do you have to just sit there and read books?" he asked. I replied, "It's not that I<i>have</i>to read books--it's that I<i>get</i>to read books." That is how I view what I have talked about today: it's not that we<i>have</i>to find creative ways to stretch our minds, our souls, and our students through our scholarship--it's that we<i>get</i>to. If a university teacher thinks of this as "I<i>have</i>to be reading and writing," he or she probably should be doing something else for a living.<br><br>There is a grand tradition in the Church about eating and drinking precious printed words from which our spirits grow robust--the words of the scriptures. Just as I first met Mary Ann Glendon in a book, I first met Moroni in a book. I had read through the Book of Mormon before my mission, but Moroni first became real to me the night I finished reading that holy book as a German missionary. I was reading by myself late one evening. As my eyes drank in Moroni's words, an unforgettable chill ran down my spine:<br><br><i>And I exhort you to remember these things; for the time speedily cometh that ye shall know that I lie not, for ye shall see me at the bar of God; and the Lord God will say unto you: Did I not declare my words unto you, which were written by this man, like as one crying from the dead, yea, even as one speaking out of the dust?</i>[Moroni 10:27]<br><br>In some way that bypassed the rational part of my consciousness, I suddenly knew in the core of my being that Moroni was a real person and that I would actually meet him face-to-face some day. I still know that. I brushed away the tears and wrote in the margin of my book by verse 27: "Remember this." From those little sheets of paper, he opened his heart and spoke to me in ways that fixed the course of my life. "And this bequest of wings was but a book."<br><br>When Karl G. Maeser died, his students composed a song for his funeral, a song of such quality that it was included in the LDS hymnbooks for many years. Its first verse begins, "Come lay his books and papers by; he shall not need them more; the ink shall dry upon his pen, so softly close the door . . . the teacher's work is done." The teacher's work, especially here at Karl Maeser's school, is a deeply satisfying labor, with students and books and papers that bless us all the days God lets us live. What a good way to spend our lives.<br><br><i>Bruce C.

<h1>Everest: BYU and Undergraduate Education - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Over the past fourteen months, I have given more official speeches, by a substantial margin, than at any other comparable period in my life. In many respects, this one is in a class by itself, certainly in terms of intrinsic importance to the university. This is the occasion on which we, the stewards of the only four-year university sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, jointly survey our past stewardship and look into our future and that of our school. It is a time when we ask ourselves What should we be doing? How well have we done it? And How can we do it better in the future?<br><br>This has been a good year for us, thanks to the efforts of every one of you. During the course of the year, we have lost some good people and others have joined us. While time does not permit me to acknowledge and welcome all of those, let me select just two as representative of all. First, Paul Thompson. He will be the last president of Weber State College and the first president of Weber State University, and he will be outstanding in both of those jobs. As much as I hate to see him and Carolyn go, I really think he was the ideal choice. We thank him for his service here and look forward to a new colleague relationship with him over the coming years. Second, I think that most of you have met R. J. Snow, the newest member of our president's council, vice president in charge of Student Life. We welcome R. J. and Marilyn, both in their own behalf and also as representatives of all others who have joined us within the last year.<br><br>A year ago I used a self-interview format that I quite enjoyed and may use again. Today, because of the theme that I want to stress, I will use another format, but I will begin by answering a question that I know is on most of your minds. It concerns my health. I am grateful that so many of my friends and colleagues not only care about my physical well-being but also pray for it and have given so much oral encouragement. Your reactions to the announcement that I made last February have been among the most deeply touching and gratifying experiences of my life. They have added a new dimension to Janet's and my lives and a new understanding of how the soul of one of our Heavenly Father's children can be enlarged and enriched by the kindnesses and prayers of others of his children. I am convinced that they have also contributed significantly to my present state of health.<br><br>My earlier cancer, a virulent, fast-acting form of lymphoma whose return would be very dangerous, is still in remission. As most of you know, the type that I now have is a chronic, long-lasting lymphoma that manifests itself principally in the skin. It cannot be cured, but it can be controlled. Since early April, I have been taking injections three times a week of a drug called Interferon, whose use for this type of cancer is comparatively recent. Sometimes Janet gives me the injections, and sometimes I give them to myself; if any of you would like a turn, just come by our house any Monday, Wednesday, or Friday evening.<br><br>It would seem, particularly from what appears on my skin, that the Interferon is having its intended effects on my cancer. It is also having some side effects. My doctors told me at the beginning that the most common side effects are flulike symptoms. Some of those, including fevers and chills, I have not had except in a minor degree for a couple of months, and their absence is welcome. The one symptom that remains with me much of the time--though it varies in intensity and the variations are quite unpredictable--is that I tend to tire more easily.<br><br>I want to discuss with you one consequence of the increased fatigue that can be a cause of concern for the observer. Since many of you may be observers, I want you to know what is happening. On occasion, over the past couple of months, the fatigue has aggravated a facial muscle jerk condition (a condition that I have had for thirty years) to such an extent that for a time, a few hours or so, my speech is affected. If this ever happens, please don't be alarmed nor embarrassed for me. It is always temporary and will pass; indeed, it would appear that there is some medication that can counteract it. In any event, the occasional aggravation of this condition has not really affected the performance of my normal activities. Most important, from your standpoint, it has not impeded my ability to carry out my duties as your president, which I continue to enjoy very much. I like this job, I like working with each one of you, and I want to fill out my normal term, whatever that is. As best as I can determine, it should last at least as long as Ty Detmer and Shawn Bradley are enrolled here.<br><br>The examples I will use in support of my remarks this morning are more sharply focused on the faculty than on those who serve in a support capacity. The reason is that the theme I want to develop lends itself to faculty-related examples. I want to begin, however, by expressing on behalf of myself and all of the faculty how grateful we are for the support services that we receive at this university. One of the things that I am going to talk about today is achieving excellence, being the best. In at least one respect, I can state that we are now the best in the country, and that is in the area of our support services. I have visited a lot of college and university campuses. I have never seen one that is as clean, well kept, and physically attractive as ours. The same is true, I believe, all across the spectrum of our support services and the people who provide them. I would like to ask the members of the faculty to join with me in an expression of appreciation to the nonteaching personnel at our university who make possible the carrying out of our teaching mission.<br><br>It is interesting, and occasionally useful, to ask what changes you or I would make in institutional arrangements if we could start all over and re-do those institutions with the benefit of years, decades, or even centuries of hindsight. For example, if there were no costs involved, would you locate the United State's capital on the eastern seaboard, or would you put it in a more central location, such as St. Louis or Kansas City? Or would you structure representation in the United States Senate in such a way that the votes that some American citizens cast for the people who make their laws count about forty times as much as the votes of others?<br><br>The parallel question for us, of course, is, if you had it all to do over again, given all of the competing demands, financial and other, on the resources of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and if all the Church owned on the site of our present campus were 633 vacant acres, would you sell that land and use the money for other needed Church purposes, or would you (1) invest hundreds of millions of dollars in buildings and equipment necessary for a very large university and (2) effectively commit to additional substantial annual budgetary outputs of money that could be used to build chapels or elementary schools in developing countries or to promote missionary work or other useful and needed purposes?<br><br>A first cousin to that question--whether the Church's involvement in BYU should be discontinued and Church resources used elsewhere--was, incidentally, a question that continued to be seriously debated by our board of trustees until as late as the 1940's. It has not been an issue for the last forty years, and I do not anticipate that it ever will be again. This is one of several respects in which we have arrived and are here to stay.<br><br>But that does not mean that we within the university should not continue asking ourselves that question or something like it, and to ponder the implications of possible answers. Such an exercise is useful for at least two reasons. First, it is a reminder of the enormous resources over which we are stewards; as with any resources, these could be put to other uses, and we need to be conscious of our concomitant obligation to use what we have been given efficiently and in a way that achieves the objectives of those who made them available to us. Second, though BYU's continuing existence is not a serious current question, the very fact that it is a permanent part of our modern Latter-day Saint landscape in turn leads to other questions, equally profound, equally interesting, and equally important. It is to some of those subissues that I want to address my remarks as we gather here for the purpose of rejuvenating our spirits in anticipation of the coming school year and searching for the most important horizons on which we should cast our eyes not only for this year but also beyond.<br><br>I am not sure what the answer would be to the question whether we would build and continue to support a major university if there were not already one here. I hope that the answer would be yes. I think that certainly, given today's economic realities and demands on Church dollars, you would not build more than one institution of our size, quality, and budgetary needs. But if the decision were mine, I would build<i>one</i>. And I would do it notwithstanding the fact that I know of other needs that would be displaced and notwithstanding the fact that within recent years the Church has discontinued its involvement in its other major nonecclesiastical public-interest endeavor, namely, hospitals.<br><br>Why do I reach that conclusion? And how do you distinguish for these purposes a university from a hospital system? Isn't health care just as important a charitable objective as higher education? My answer is that there are things a university can do to advance the restored kingdom of Jesus Christ that cannot be done directly by the Church itself, nor by any other of its components, either those presently in existence or those that could be brought into existence. Let me give you a few examples.<br><br>First, we provide an atmosphere of academic freedom important for LDS scholars, both teachers and students, that by definition cannot be made available at any other institution, no matter how tolerant it may be or how desirous to provide that kind of academic freedom. For those who are really serious about our religious beliefs, few issues are as important as the interrelationships between our faith and our secular knowledge and understandings. Similarly important is the ability to pursue those issues in an environment that not only recognizes them as important and legitimate, but also provides colleagues who may be able to offer some useful insights because the understand the questions and their implications. For the faculty member there is a related component, and it involves academic freedom in its narrowest sense: the freedom to think, to write, and to teach about matters of study and matters of faith and the ties between the two. It is a freedom that carries with it an obligation to see that the freedom itself is exercised in a way that takes into account not only the rewards and satisfactions to the individual, but also the potential costs to the institution.<br><br>Second, for the students we provide an environment in which they are not only academically free in this broader sense, but also in which they can learn values, by precept as well as by example, from their teachers and their fellow students. This is a place where we are still concerned about such things as the Ten Commandments--every one of them, including the fourth and seventh. This is a place where we value the importance of such things as service to our fellow human beings. The reason is, we regard our fellow human beings as true brothers and sisters, sons and daughters of a common Father. This is a place where we are convinced that our lives and what we do with them have a significance beyond the grave. And it is a place where a large majority of our students can find their eternal companions from among others who share their values and their objectives.<br><br>The opportunity to study in that kind of environment really makes a difference. The fact that it makes a difference, I believe, is being established right now in the marketplace, our marketplace, the BYU marketplace, by so many parents--including parents who themselves attended BYU and also those who attended elsewhere--who want their children to have that kind of experience. Moreover, acting under policies set by our board of trustees, they and we working together can choose not only to be a value-anchored school, but we can also select our own particular package of values.<br><br>I am convinced that especially during the undergraduate years, that kind of learning milieu makes a difference in student attitudes and emerging values and the individual student's potential for success and happiness. Over the long run, it also has an effect on the development of leadership within the Church. And this, of course, provides another benefit to the Church as an institution, as well as to its individual members.<br><br>There are other advantages to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in having a Brigham Young University, unique advantages that the Church could not obtain in any other way. Different ones of us would probably complete that list in slightly different ways, but each list would probably include some facet or variation of a common theme: a beacon on a hill, a light shining to the world, or some other metaphor or way of saying that through our students, our alumni, and our scholarly works, we demonstrate for our university and our sponsoring church a standard of excellence and accomplishment. In many parts of the world, and among many people, the Church and its people are known principally, or at least are known better, because of the accomplishments of the faculty and students at this institution.<br><br>However we compile the list of component reasons for having a four-year Church university at this time and in this place, all must agree that those reasons are substantial. My personal opinion is that they are sufficiently substantial to warrant the enormous annual expenditures that we require. But this much is clear: we are an integral part of an inseparable whole, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the restored gospel whose message the Church proclaims. The reason for our being--the justification for our existence--is found, I submit, in that very fact that we are an inseparable, integral facet of building the restored kingdom of Jesus Christ. We do it in a way that is different from those who serve as missionaries or bishops or welfare workers. We are teachers. We are scholars and writers and artists who deal in ideas and things creative. Because we are teachers and scholars, the contribution we make to the building of the kingdom is unique to us.<br><br>I come, then, to this conclusion: because the warrant for our existence is found in the fact that there are things we can do to further the work of the restored kingdom that could not and would not be done by anyone else but for this university, we must regard ourselves as an integral part of the Church itself. Our mission is to carry out in our distinctive way the larger mission of the Church. Everything we do should ultimately be measured by that standard.<br><br>The basic policy choices are, of course, made by our board of trustees, whose members we also sustain as the Lord's anointed. It is they who will define those aspects of that larger mission as they apply to this university. But we are charged with helping to raise and refine those issues--and to implement the decisions once made.<br><br>Now let's explore a few aspects of what it means that our purpose for being is as an integral, inseparable part of the restored kingdom. I would like to start with a corollary of the larger proposition. The corollary is that just as BYU is part of a larger mosaic, so also each constituent unit of this university should see itself principally as part of the larger university wide effort. This is, of course, not a new concept. Paul used two different metaphors to remind the Saints of his day of its importance. To the Corinthians, he spoke of the indispensability and interdependability of different parts of the body. In his epistle to the Ephesians he used a different metaphor, a building. But in each instance, the point was the same: we are interdependent parts of a single whole. And that is true of Brigham Young University in two respects.<br><br>As a university, we are one constituent element of a larger endeavor, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, whose charge is to build the restored kingdom of Jesus Christ. And within our own institution, we also consist of more focused individual parts, colleges, departments, divisions, centers, etc. I would hope that each one of these units would have as the first sentence of its mission statement that it is an integral part of Brigham Young University and its mission is to carry out BYU's mission, which in turn is anchored to that of its sponsoring church.<br><br>Quite frankly, I think the natural tendency is in the other direction. Note the almost universal historical trend of church-sponsored universities to tear themselves away from their original religious foundation stones. I saw the same tendency in myself when I was dean of the Law School, and the longer I was there the more pronounced it became. I came to regard myself less and less as an interdependent part of the university and became more concerned with building up my own domain, the empire over which I presided.<br><br>All of us need to resist that kind of drift. To the extent that it is a natural tendency within us, we should consciously counteract it. The reason that we have a Kennedy Center, a music department, a student housing program, a chemistry department, and a football team is that each of these in its own way makes us a better university, better able to perform our unique mission. We should gauge the way we think about our work and the way we do our work against that fact. Similarly, BYU's reason for being is the fact that it can contribute to the work of the Church in ways that are unique to us. If we did not exist, the contributions that we make to kingdom building would go unmade. And they are important contributions.<br><br>How, then, can we as a university best go about our task of integrating ourselves into the larger Church whole?<br><br>On two separate occasions (the celebration of our centennial in 1975, and then five years later at the inauguration of President Jeffrey Holland), President Kimball expressed the hope that BYU would become an "educational Mt. Everest." It has been a useful metaphor because it has reminded us of the need to strive for excellence, to achieve excellence in fact, and to stand high enough that the world will see us. Not everyone has interpreted that admonition in exactly the same way. Many have inferred that we should measure the height of our mountain using the same devices employed by higher education generally. The Carnegie Foundation System, for example, has devised the following classification scheme or American institutions of higher learning:<br><br>A. Research University I<br>B. Research University II<br>C. Doctorate-Granting University I (BYU's level)<br>D. Doctorate-Granting University II<br>E. Comprehensive University/College I<br>F. Comprehensive University/College II<br>G. Liberal Arts College I<br>H. Liberal Arts College II<br>I. Two-Year College<br>J. Professional School/College<br><br>Within this scheme BYU would be classified in the third group down, Doctorate-Granting University I. We do not qualify as a major research university either I or II because the measuring rod for those two is the amount of federal research money received each year, $33 million to qualify in the first category, and $13 million in the second.<br><br>Within our category, we are something of an anomaly. We are classified as Doctorate-Granting University I because we have more doctoral programs and grant more doctoral degrees than the category requires (the requirements are forty Ph.D. degrees in more than five disciplines, and our numbers for the past year were seventy-seven Ph.D.s in seventeen disciplines). But it is highly unusual for a school of our size and quality to be a predominantly undergraduate institution. Thus, only 10 percent of our students are pursuing graduate degrees, and of these 10 percent, over three-fifths are practice-related fields such as law, business, engineering, and education, with only about two-fifths enrolled in traditional master's and Ph.D. programs.<br><br>There is a premise--sometimes unspoken and sometimes spoken--among our higher education colleagues across the country that what any given school ought to be doing is moving its way up through these various classifications. That is, most vocational schools would like to have a general education offering; most two-year schools would like to become four-year, and at any point along the ladder, most people would like to move up one or more rungs. After all, it's a ladder--and what are ladders for but climbing? There are a few exceptions to that view. They exist mostly among the small, high-quality liberal arts schools (1,500-3,000 students), who are quite content with their category and are making no effort to move out of it.<br><br>What about us? Should we regard this categorization system as a ladder that we ought to be climbing? Here we are in the number three echelon. Where is our Mt. Everest? Should our long-range objective be to move out of category three and into number two or number one?<br><br>I think that virtually any other university of our size or quality would probably answer those questions in the affirmative. That is how you measure progress, they would say. Not so with us. And the reason is the precise one that we discussed a few minutes ago: the lodestar by which we fix our direction is not the Carnegie classification system. It is, rather, that we exist as an integral part of the Church's larger mission, and we exist to make our unique contribution that only we can make to the achievement of that mission. Accordingly, our progress must be gauged not by how many rungs of the higher education ladder we can manage to climb during any given period of time, but rather by a very different standard: How can we spend our total resources--tithing dollars and our own time and efforts--in ways that are beneficial to things eternal, to individual sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father, to their family units, and to the Church as an institution?<br><br>Against the background of that standard, I conclude that, though research and graduate programs are clearly mountains we must climb, our Mt. Everest is to be found in undergraduate teaching. For reasons on which I will elaborate in just a moment, this does not mean any de-emphasis on either the importance of research or our commitment to existing graduate programs or perhaps even others. But these are not our principal ultimate mission. Our comparative advantage, our highest and best use, our greatest potential to make a worthwhile contribution to the people whose contributions support us and to society as a whole is to be found in teaching young men and women during that period of time in their lives between their graduation from high school and graduation from college.<br><br>I realize that this is not some great new intellectual breakthrough for a BYU president. Virtually all of my predecessors have reached the same conclusion. But over the last year and a quarter, I have reached it for myself. I have gained my own testimony, which I bear to you today, and I would like to give you some specific reasons why I think it is correct.<br><br>The first is as compelling as it is simple. The teaching that we do here consists of an amalgamation of spiritual and secular truths, offered in an atmosphere that recognizes the reality of the Restoration. Our educational objective is to prepare the whole person for the complete life. That kind of education includes learning that one could obtain at any other good university couples with a value system anchored to restored truth. It would be quite misleading to try to identify which part of that combination is more important. For us, the two are inseparable. The genius of BYU--and also its heart and soul--is that we are the only four-year university that is attempting to join the two, and we do so because of the effect that the combination has on individual minds, attitudes, and souls.<br><br>That task can be accomplished much more effectively and efficiently with undergraduate students than with graduates for two separate reasons. First, undergraduate education is less expensive. The dollar goes farther because the student-teacher ratio is larger, space and other administrative support demands are not as high, and undergraduate students do not require as much expensive equipment to support their studies. The second consideration is even more important. I am convinced that the undergraduate student body is measurably and significantly more susceptible to the kind of total educational effort we make at BYU. It is much easier to instill values among eighteen-year-olds just out of high school than among their brothers and sisters who are eight years older and are in the middle of a graduate program. Indeed, I believe that our ability to do the kind of total-spectrum teaching for which we strive here is inversely proportional to how long our students have been here. BYU, I freely confess, had a profound impact on my own life. It is one that endures to this day and will continue to endure. Over 50 percent of that impact occurred during my first year.<br><br>In short, it is at the undergraduate level that we can do the most of what we want to do at the least cost, and for me that reason alone is sufficient to make the case in light of our mission as inseparably linked to larger Church objectives.<br><br>There are, however, other reasons. One is tied simply to our historical performance. For at least as long as I have been affiliated with this institution, our strong suit has been the preparation of our students to enter directly into a chosen employment or to do graduate work, most of them at someone else's university, but a few of them at our own. At least over the last half of the twentieth century, and I suspect reaching back even further than that, we have performed that task well, indeed, among the best. Those of you who attended our graduation ceremony last April heard Professor Mary Ann Glendon's evaluation of those of our graduates who attended the University of Chicago Law School during her era. She was doubtless engaging in a slight bit of exaggeration in order to lay the role of the gracious guest. But during her era and subsequently, not only at Chicago but throughout the graduate school world, we have acquired a reputation among the very best of our nation's graduate training centers that Provo, Utah, is a place where undergraduate preparation is taken seriously and done right.<br><br>We did it well when I was a student here, and today we do it better. We can still improve, and I am confident we will. There are things that you can do in this respect, and there are things that we in the administration can do. We have been striving for ways to more adequately recognize and reward undergraduate teaching. We have made some progress, and we are determined to make more. Undergraduate teaching is our historical strength; it is one on which we should build, and we want to recognize and reward it.<br><br>Third, one not unimportant aspect of our serving the interest of the larger Church has to do with the public's perception of what we as a people are all about. That public perception is also important to us as professionals who take pride in ourselves. Once again, BYU can make a contribution in this respect that is different from what any other Church entity can do. Now, how does this relate to the issue of our undergraduate-graduate mix? Let's assume that we were to negotiate successfully our entry into the category of graduate research universities. What would we then be? How would we be known? And how distinctive would we be? At the very best, we would be another of many--perhaps scores--of larger graduate research universities. Aside from our religious values, it would be quite difficult to discern any real distinction between us and a long list of others.<br><br>By contrast, our opportunity to distinguish ourselves as one of America's premier undergraduate institutions, perhaps even the best of our size--and therefore in a class by ourselves--is not only realistic but even probable. One advantage is our tradition, already noted; graduate programs around the country are already aware of our reputation, and most are anxious to have our graduates. A second advantage is our sheer size. I am unaware of any other private institution as large as we are whose clearly articulated objective is to remain predominantly an undergraduate teaching institution. A third advantage is the quality of our students. The entering class for last fall ranked sixteenth nationally among the number of National Merit scholars who attended here, and among private universities we rank fifth in the number of our graduates who go on to earn Ph.D. degrees. It is not yet clear what adjustments the board of trustees may ultimately choose to make in our admission standards, but almost inevitably our enrollment ceiling will have a continuing upward impact on the quality of our undergraduate student body.<br><br>Doest his mean, then, that we will be closing the J. Reuben Clark Law School? Or that we will no longer be training MBAs and will be phasing out our Ph.D. programs? Certainly not. Neither does it mean that we are going to be de-emphasizing research. Anyone who would draw either of those conclusions does not understand two of the essential requirements for good undergraduate teaching. They are: (1) minimum critical mass of graduate programs and (2) continuing high-quality research efforts, particularly if we define research as broadly as our provost has articulated this morning.<br><br>Graduate programs contribute to a university whose primary focus is undergraduate education in several indispensable ways. Perhaps the most important contribution concerns the quality of the faculty. Good undergraduate teaching occurs when you put good teachers in a classroom with good students. In the great majority of instances, the best teachers are those who also have a scholarly agenda and want assurances that they will be given reasonable time and resources to pursue their scholarly interests.<br><br>The closely related point is the simple fact that you cannot be a good teacher--a really good teacher of the type that we want at this university, and that students of the quality of our students deserve--unless you keep yourself intellectually alive: aware of and interested in what is going on in your field, abreast of current thinking and its implications, and, best of all, an actual contributor to that current thinking, one who is actively engaged in testing and pushing out the frontiers of knowledge. Unless you are doing at least most of those things, you are, quite simply, not a good teacher, because you are permitting that part of the real world concerning which you are hired to teach to pass you by. Your curriculum will not be current, and you will not be current.<br><br>My own experience is that the very best way to maintain this intellectual vivacity is to do a combination of two things. The first, as noted, is to keep yourself current in your field, aware of what is being done by others, and to develop your own views concerning the implications of those emerging frontiers of knowledge. The second is to put your own thoughts in writing and then to submit those written views to critical review by your peers. It can be a devastating process, shattering to the ego. It can also be exhilarating. But it is essential to the maintenance of the intellectual acuity and sophistication that we need among those who hold the noble title<i>BYU faculty member.</i><br><br>For me, and I suspect for most of you, the devotion of time and resources as an expected part of my employment was one of two reasons that made teaching so attractive. The other is the association with students. In my pre-BYU faculty days, while I was in the private practice of law, I not infrequently had ideas that I wanted to develop more thoroughly in writing and submit for peer review in the journals, and on a few occasions I did that. But it was not an expected part of my employment, and those efforts came out of my time. Here, it was an expected part of my employment, which I regarded then and still do as a large plus. The people we want to bring here are those people who not only show promise as scholars, but who also regard the opportunity, time, and resources for scholarly work as one of the great advantages offered by academic life.<br><br>This is not to say that every person who stands before a classroom on this campus must achieve national prominence as a scholar, performer, or the like. Our criteria for promotion and continuing faculty status include three requirements--citizenship, teaching, and scholarship--and we are serious about the importance of each of the three. All are required for the complete faculty member. But we are continuing to search for the best way to recognize what to me seems so obvious, and once again is borne out by scripture, that not all of us have the same comparative strengths. Whereas I reject the proposition that a non-scholar can be a good teacher at the kind of university we want to have, or that anyone should join this faculty expecting to do no teaching or no peer-reviewed writing or other creative work, it seems equally obvious that, just as some are better at running and others at swimming, the work of a large university requires the performance of a variety of tasks, and our faculty members enjoy a variety of talents. We can and will find ways to match our talents with our tasks and then reward all faculty effort according to its quality.<br><br>I hope that we can also devise means to recognize and reward the importance of individual teacher/student mentoring. In my view, it ought to be considered a part of teaching and taken into account in our teacher evaluations. It may not be as easy to measure, but I know it when I see it. And I've seen it on this campus. Some of my most memorable experiences involved the personal attention that was shown to me during my student days by such teachers as Stewart Grow, Reed Bradford, Robert Thomas, Jay Smith, and others. I'm sure that each of you had parallel experiences during your own student days. They are the heart of the teaching and learning experience.<br><br>I realize, of course, that far more influential on the future course of our university than what I have said today will be the things that we as a university community actually do on a day-to-day basis. Quite clearly, the most important decisions in this respect will be the ones that we make with respect to new faculty hires, and, as most of you are aware, we anticipate about a 35 percent turnover in our faculty over the decade of the nineties. That important task--first in importance among all that we face--will necessarily involve the cooperative effort of the departments and colleges affected, as well as the university administration. The primary jurisdiction will be vested in the departments and colleges, who are in a better position than we to assess the best candidates and evaluate their potential as scholars and teachers. But we will play a role as well, not only to assure a minimum uniformity across colleges and assure that these scarcest of all university resources called FTE's are used in the most efficient way, but also to assure that some of these principles I have discussed today do not get lost between university conferences and implementing decisions.<br><br>In conclusion, let me tell you how honored I am to be involved with you in the exciting process of university building and kingdom building that will occur on these 633 acres over the coming years. The history of our school has been one of steady evolution from a struggling Utah County academy to a college to a genuine university and then to our present crossroads, where we have the opportunity to become one of the very best in our business. That evolutionary process has occupied eleven full decades plus five years. Any one of those decades--the 1880s, the 1920s, the 1950s, or any other--was characterized by remarkable change and, in each instance, remarkable progress. The only constant across the entire time period has been our commitment to our unique combination of things spiritual with things secular.<br><br>I am convinced that the most exciting and interesting decade in our history will be the decade of the 1990s. I am also convinced that we can make it the period of greatest growth and greatest progress. Everything points in that direction. We have the best faculty we have ever had, the most qualified student body we have ever had, and the most able and dedicated support group. It is up to us to continue to build on the momentum we now have. That each of us may do his and her part toward that end is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Rex E.

<h1>the Challenges of the Nineties: A New Decade - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
June and I are glad to be with you this evening. During our nine years at BYU, we always looked on these preschool dinners as a special treat, and we still have that feeling ten years after our departure.<br><br>A lot can happen in a decade. A lot<i>has</i>happened in the ten years since we left BYU.<br><br>In 1980 only a million Americans were using computers. Today it is over 50 million.<br><br>Ten years ago hardly any if us had heard of a compact disc, a fax machine, or a VCR. Today their presence and influence are pervasive.<br><br>In 1980 the savings and loan industry was thriving and there was talk abut deregulation. Today that industry is in a shambles, and government officials are arguing about whether the cure will cost the government $100 billion or $200 billion.<br><br>In 1980 there were just over 4 1/2 million members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Ten years later, we have grown by 57 percent to 7 1/3 million members in over 11,000 wards and more thousands of branches throughout the world.<br><h2><b>Viewing BYU from 1980</b></h2><br>Just ten years ago this month, I was the BYU commencement speaker. Having just concluded my nine years as president of BYU, I used that occasion to look ahead to the next decade. I titled my talk "Challenges to BYU in the Eighties" (15 August 1980).<br><br>By coincidence, I have this pulpit again, just ten years later. The temptation to quote some of my predictions and compare them with the actual experience of the eighties is irresistible.<br><br>I began my 1980 remarks with this status report, which we can now compare with BYU's current standing:<br><br><i>After emerging from its educational adolescence, BYU has now achieved the status of a young adult in the world society of universities. We are mature in the range of our activities, but not yet fully mature in the quality of most of our programs in the scholarly standing of a majority of our faculty. . . .</i><br><br><i>It will take an accumulation of accomplishments before we have attained the standing prophesied by the First Presidency nine years ago: "Because of its unique combination of revealed and secular learning, Brigham Young University is destined to become a leader among the great universities of the world."</i><br><br>I continued with this challenge. You can judge whether it still applies ten years later:<br><br><i>One of the greatest obstacles on the way to our destiny is complacency, the thought that we have already arrived or that accomplishment or standing will come as an effortless handout to a worthy few who take no thought except to rely on Divine intervention.</i><br><br>The greater part of that 1980 commencement address reviewed what I then called "Problems in the Eighties." I predicted that the principal problems for higher education in the decade of the eighties would be enrollment and money.<br><br><i>For the past several years BYU's income has not kept pace with inflation. Although both its tuition revenues and its Church appropriations have been increased from 8 to 10 percent annually, the University's costs have increased at an even higher rate. . . .</i><br><br><i>The cumulative effect of this cost-price squeeze over the past several years and into the foreseeable future is to reduce the standard of living of the University and its personnel. In fact, that is the outlook for the next decade for most Americans. We will have to accept a reduced standard of living as a consequence of increased international prices for energy, our unfavorable balance of payments, and the diminished rate of increase in our nation's total productivity.</i><br><br><i>In this financial climate, Brigham Young University must get along on less, and so must the persons it employs. If we are to have sufficient funds for what is essential, we must forego some things that are not.</i><br><br>Departing from that text for a moment, I will observe that many residents of Utah--presumably including some members of the BYU community--have not accepted and acted upon the need for a reduced standard of living. The relatively poor national ranking of Utah on bankruptcy filings, payment of telephone bills, and delinquency rates in bank, credit union, and consumer loans all suggest that the predominantly Latter-day Saint people of this state are borrowing and living beyond their means. I might add that our national government's huge and persistent annual deficits show that this is a national rather than a local affliction.<br><br>In terms of living within a diminished income, local Church leaders who have had to fit their programs within the stringent limits of the Church's new local unit budget program are providing a worth example for all of us.<br><br>I continue to quote from the 1980 commencement address:<br><br><i>Fortunately, . . . BYU is approaching the time when the numbers and financial position of its alumni can provide very significant revenues from annual giving. . . . In creased private support is vital if the University is to preserve its commitment to excellence in a decade of unusual fiscal challenge.</i><br><br><i>The most difficult financial problem of the eighties could be faculty compensation. BYU cannot reach its destiny without a faculty whose credentials and accomplishments are world-class.</i><br><br>Here I talked about the need to be competitive versus the importance of retaining the spirit of sacrifice. I concluded that subject as follows:<br><br><i>I wish I had a formula for balancing the countervailing pressures of market and sacrifice. We must not lose the spirit of sacrifice in employment at Brigham Young University, but neither must that sacrifice be exploited or become an excuse for unrealistic compensation policies in the Universities. After nine years or worrying over this problem, I have now left it behind for President Holland as one of the problems I have bee unable to solve or ameliorate. I suspect that the only feasible solution is to be explicit about the issue, but to leave it to be balanced and resolved in the hearts and minds of individual faculty members and administrators.</i><br><br>I suppose President Holland grappled with that problems and then left it to President Lee, who will do the same. Those of us who are impatient with the time it takes to solve really difficult problems confirm the observation that "Nothing is impossible for the man who doesn't have to do it himself" (Arthur Block,<i>Murphy's Law</i>, p. 80).<br><br>My suggestion that the other major problems in the eighties would be enrollment was both obvious and accurate. In a few minutes I will comment further on that perennial.<br><br>Here is what I said on another subject:<br><br><i>I have not listed government regulation as a major challenge of the eighties because I do not expect the regulatory growth rate of the seventies to continue in the next decade. There may be a few new initiatives, but the decade of the 1980s is likely to be a decade of refinement, consolidation, and perhaps some temporary rollbacks in the regulatory tide. Extensive new thrusts in government regulation are likely to be aimed at churches during this period, but probably not at higher education.</i><br><h2><b>Continuity</b></h2><br>Some things don't change. Last week President Rex E. Lee let me read a copy of the talk he had prepared for the first day of this conference. All of what he said sounded right to me.<br><br>It also sounded familiar. I am well acquainted with BYU presidents' preschool talks for two decades, and their prominent themes have been pretty much the same for that entire period. President Lee's included:<br><br>1. The mission of BYU.<br><br>2. BYU's relationship to its board of trustees, to the Church, and to the mission of the Church.<br><br>3. BYU's stewardship over huge resources provided by the Church--both capital assets and annual support.<br><br>4. The relationship between undergraduate and graduate programs at BYU.<br><br>5. The preeminence of teaching at BYU.<br><br>6. The essential but supportive role of research and scholarly work at BYU.<br><br>7. The vital and highly valued work of the BYU staff.<br><br>8. The need for each constituent unit of the university and for each member of the faculty, staff, and administration to subordinate personal interests to the overall missions of the university and the Church.<br><br>In developing these major themes, President Lee made the following statements, which seem so right to me that in my view the opposite or even a significant qualification is unthinkable:<br><br>[Brigham Young University is]<i>an integral part of an inseparable whole, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the restored gospel whose message the Church proclaims.</i>[p. 11]<br><br><i>Each constituent unit of this university should see itself principally as part of the larger university-wide effort. . . . the natural tendency</i>[however]<i>is in the other direction . . .</i>[in which each individual unit comes to be]<i>more concerned with building up</i>[its]<i>own domain</i>. [p. 12]<br><br>[Brigham Young University's]<i>Mount Everest is to be found in undergraduate teaching</i>[p. 13 . . . because]<i>it is at the undergraduate level that we can do the most of what we want to do at the least cost.</i>[p. 14]<br><br>In explaining BYU's position as a predominantly undergraduate liberal arts institution with selected graduate and professional programs, President Lee said that BYU does not aspire to climb the rungs of the educational ladder to attain the Carnegie Foundation's higher classifications of Doctorate-Granting or Research University (pp. 11–13). Although he did not mention this, President Lee would also have been correct in saying that there is absolutely no sentiment or support in the board of trustees to move BYU out of its current and unique position as a large predominantly undergraduate university. Consequently, at BYU research and scholarly work are essential, supportive, and subordinate to the teaching mission of the university.<br><br>The fact that BYU is an integral part of the church and the proclaiming of the restored gospel explains the anomalous fact that BYU is the largest single center of church expenditure in the entire world. So far as I am aware, no other church gives a comparable proportion of its financial resources or the trustee time of its top leaders to support and make policy for the postsecondary education.<br><br>But financial and leadership support are not the only visible evidence of BYU's importance to the Church. The Church has positioned BYU to have an enormous impact on the youth of the Church, its future leaders.<br><br>In view of BYU's great importance, the leaders of this Church have a vital, continuing concern with its direction, its accomplishments, and its faculty, staff, and students. These leaders simply will not appropriate the kind of Church resources that are spent here or allow the kind of Church influence that is wielded through the Brigham Young University name and prestige unless those resources and that influence are exerted in support of the mission of the Church. To assure that result, the board of trustees of BYU consists of the First Presidency and other leaders of the Church. And the board of trustees appoints and releases the president, the deans, and other officers of the university and makes the policies they are responsible to execute, including fundamental strategic decisions about emphasis and directions.<br><h2><b>Challenges</b></h2><br>President J. Reuben Clark outlined a fundamental principle of Church-sponsored higher education over fifty years ago. Speaking for the First Presidency, he reminded an audience of Church Educational System teachers that the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is not a system of ethics to be rationalized according to secular truth, but a system of eternal truths revealed by our Creator and transcending human reason. He affirmed<br><br><i>that the things of the natural world will not explain the things of the spiritual world; that the things of the spiritual world cannot be understood or comprehended by the things of the natural world; that you cannot rationalize the things of the spirit.</i>["The Charted Course of the Church in Education,"<i>J. Reuben Clark Selected Papers,</i>p. 248, D. Yarn, ed., 1984]<br><br>In this teaching President Clark echoed the Apostle Paul, who said: "But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned" (1 Corinthians 2:14).<br><br>President Clark pleaded for teachers in all the Church's schools to use the power of testimony to help their students, who seek strengthened faith as well as increased knowledge.<br><br><i>These students hunger and thirst . . . for a testimony of the things of the spirit and of the hereafter, and knowing that you cannot rationalize eternity, they seek faith, and the knowledge which follows faith. They sense by the spirit they have, that . . . one living, burning, honest testimony of a righteous God-fearing man that Jesus is the Christ and that Joseph was God's prophet, is worth a thousand books and lectures aimed at debasing the Gospel to a system of ethics or seeking to rationalize infinity.</i>[Ibid.]<br><br>That kind of testimonied teaching has always taken place at BYU, but it does not happen effortlessly. The teacher who testifies must move against the natural academic tide that runs in universities. I mention this as a challenge for each of us to strengthen our collective resolve to move against that tide.<br><br>The pervasive method of teaching gospel principles and values--by example as well as by precept--requires constant and conscious effort. The visible example of faculty leaders is essential and appreciated. I was pleased to witness two conspicuous examples during the remarks at the graduation exercises earlier this month.<br><br>In his commencement address this year, Dean Martin B. Hickman expressed appreciation for the collegiality at BYU, observing that collegiality "is most rewarding when it embraces a fellowship of faith as well as a fellowship of mind." Affirming this duality to the graduates, he expressed the hope that they had experienced what he called "both aspects of BYU, so that, when BYU is only a memory, spiritual experiences as well as learning moments will be reflected in the mosaic of your recollections." In his closing remarks, he reminded the graduates, newly certified and anxious to begin their working lives or further studies, that "in the end, if you have not cultivated family, faith and friends, nothing else will matter."<br><br>To cite another example, in his talk at the graduation banquet, Associate Academic Vice President Dennis L. Thompson reminded the graduates of BYU's unique perspective: "We teach here that value should be the test of desire rather than desire being the test of value; and that spirit adds a dimension to life which makes the difference."<br><br>In order to accomplish its unique mission and further its unique perspective, BYU must be wisely selective in which university practices it accepts and implements and which it does not. For example, since BYU is not a Doctoral-Granting or a Research University according to Carnegie Foundation criteria (though it does important research and grants significant numbers of doctoral degrees), BYU should take care that its criteria for faculty scholarship are not dictated by classifications that are inapplicable to its unique category. BYU should be particularly receptive to the proposals in a 1990 Carnegie Foundation report recently shared with our board of trustees. Universities were urged to broaden their definition of acceptable faculty scholarship beyond the traditional standard of "advancing knowledge" to include "integrating knowledge," "applying knowledge," and "supporting teaching."<br><br>BYU's unique mission also requires that it's policies and personnel dignify and promote the religious teaching that is vital to that mission. The board of trustees has given particular emphasis to the formal teaching of religion and to the weekend work of the campus stakes and wards. I have no doubt that each member of the university community will pursue his or her conventional university tasks, but experience teaches that from time to time each of us is prone to forget that at BYU it is not enough to be just another university, even the best university according to conventional criteria. BYU has its own mission and standards, and all of us must make extraordinary efforts to promote them.<br><h2><b>Admissions</b></h2><br>In my commencement address ten years ago, I described BYU's unique admissions challenge:<br><br><i>If missionary baptisms continue at their current rate . . . the cumulative effect of current populations and conversions will increase BYU's total applications by about 40–50 percent by the early 1990s. . . .</i><br><br><i>Many who are desirous of attending BYU in the 1990s will be turned away. The designation of those who will not be admitted will be extremely painful since most of these young men and women, like those who are admitted, will also be worthy and qualified for college study.</i><br><br>As we enter the decade of the nineties, BYU's admissions policies are, in fact, among the most difficult problems facing the university. During the past year President Lee and his colleagues have had long discussions with the board of trustees on those policies. Those discussions have not yet concluded, and when they do, any new policy directions will be made known under the direction of the board, and all of us will be bound by them.<br><br>In the meantime, I believe I can venture to add something to the public discussion of this subject by stating my own views, which will, of course, be superseded by whatever the board decides on this matter. These are the views of one who has had a unique opportunity to view BYU admissions policies from the standpoint of an educator and parent who has worked and lived in both Utah and in the Midwest, a university president who has had experience administering these admissions policies, and a BYU trustee and Church official who has heard the pleas of parents and students in many parts of the world.<br><br>I begin by sharing one of many letters received at Church headquarters in support of the idea that BYU should admit as many young Latter-day Saints as possible. This letter came from a teacher at a university outside the Intermountain West. He was not writing a brief to advocate the admission of his own son or daughter--he was arguing for the young people in his stake.<br><br>He described a boy who was skeptical about a mission but decide to serve during a freshman year at BYU. Thousands of freshmen have had that experience at BYU. He reminded "that many young people may be deprived of the possibility of such experiences, simply because they are not students at a Church-related college." He quoted his stake president's statement that "the experience of Church schools has a profound impact on the lives of our young people," and the president's further observation that "those who have spent most of their lives in the intermountain west or who have raised their children in the security of high-density Mormondom do not fully appreciate the magnitude of this issue."<br><br>President Lee's own experience, related to you yesterday, is an important second witness. Drawing on his personal experience, he said:<br><br><i>I am convinced that especially during the undergraduate years,</i>[the opportunity to study in the kind of environment where students learn values by precept as well as by example]<i>makes a difference in student attitudes and emerging values and the individual student's potential for success and happiness. Over the long run, it also has an effect on the development of leadership within the Church.</i><br><br>That reality is important to parents and tithe payers, and it is important to our Church leaders as well.<br><br>That reality leads me to believe that the unique faculty and facilities and surroundings of BYU should be made available to serve the maximum number of Latter-day Saint youth who are qualified for rigorous academic work. For example, I believe that two years of BYU experience for 40,000 LDS students is better than four years of BYU experience for 20,000.<br><br>Being of that view, I obviously advocate admissions policies that will accommodate large numbers of transfer students. I was glad to notice in the recent graduation exercise that 60 percent of the graduates who received degrees had attended other institutions of higher learning.<br><br>I also advocate policies that will encourage all students, four-year and transfer, to accelerate their graduation and departure in order to make spaces for others to enjoy the experiences of BYU. The average age of the bachelor's degree recipients in the recent graduation was 25 1/2 years of age. If that figure results from a significant number of older students in the student body, I welcome it. If it is a signal that our curriculum policies, graduation requirements, counseling, and the like are acquiescing to students taking 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 years to get a bachelor's degree, then we have a situation which, in my judgment, cries for correction at a time when we are turning away too many qualified applicants because we have no space for them. If the average graduation time is prolonged by students who take light loads because they have to work extra hours to support themselves and their young families, then we need to take a hard look at our student assistance policies.<br><br>My reference to students qualified for rigorous academic work does not imply a belief that we should simply choose that segment of the applicants who have the highest grades and test scores. Because that kind of admissions criteria produces an elitist atmosphere that would not serve the interests of the Church or the student body, we are already giving weight to the quality of the applicant's preparation, measured by the type of courses taken. We must continue to develop ways to measure and give weight to some other qualities like faith, heart, wisdom, and motivation, which, in combination with more numerical criteria, qualify young men and women for the leadership and accomplishments we seek to serve in this university.<br><br>Perhaps a personal experience will help explain why I believe it is so important not to rely solely on grades and test scores. Many in this audience will be familiar with the Law School Admissions Test. It is supposed to measure aptitude for law study. Most law schools attach heavy weight to the LSAT score in their admissions decisions. I was privileged to go to a good law school because I had a good LSAT score. It ranked me, as I recall, at about the 95th percentile. I was very comfortable with the LSAT, and as a faculty member I participated in many admissions decisions based upon it. Then, during the course of my ten years in law teaching, there came a time when the<i>average</i>student in my class at the University of Chicago Law School had a higher LSAT score than I. I used to think about that as I stood before a class: "The average student out there has a better score than I." That was when I began to think that there were other things as important as the LSAT score.<br><br>In a period of sharply increasing applications, BYU admissions policies admittedly pose a difficult challenge. But is this challenge any more difficult, and more insurmountable, than the challenge we face in sending nineteen- to twenty-one-year-olds, essentially unsupervised, to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people to preach the message of the restored gospel? With the inspiration of God we have found how to do that task tolerably well, and I suggest that by that same method we can identify the needed refinements in the BYU admissions criteria to serve our youth and support the mission of the Church.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>Two of the problems I listed in my 1980 commencement address were really challenges. They are as important today as they were then. I will use them to conclude. One was titled "Effective Use of Resources":<br><br><i>When we look at what our best predecessors accomplished with their scarce facilities, I wonder whether we as current teachers and researchers at BYU accomplish as much in relation to the splendid physical resources with which we operate? When we see what our best predecessors did in addition to their numerous teaching loads of 15 to 25 hours per week, are we accounting convincingly and productively for the greater time remaining after our much smaller teaching loads? When we see what our predecessors did with their scant opportunities to travel for professional development, I wonder if we are giving an adequate return in professional standing, scholarly output, and teaching excellence for the vastly increased professional development resources at our command.</i><br><br>The second challenge was titled "Boldness in Goals":<br><br><i>Another challenge of the eighties--ironic in view of the constraints I have already summarized--is for us to be as bold as our predecessors. One of the remarkable things about our Mormon tradition is the boldness--even the audacity--of our pioneer grandfathers and grandmothers. They accomplished the impossible because they attempted the unthinkable. . . .</i><br><br><i>Our pioneer predecessors did not succeed in all they attempted, but their aspirations and their attempts were magnificent, and we have been blessed by the results. . . .</i><br><br><i>When we compare our opportunities and resources to those of our forebears, and when we compare what they undertook with what we undertake, I wonder if we set our sights high enough. In these terms there is surely nothing far-fetched about our stated goal of becoming a leader among the great universities of the world.</i><br><br>I appreciate the introduction that my good friend President Lee gave me. I appreciate the feeling that I have when I return to the campus.<br><br>None of us should say that all is well in Zion, and none of us should say that all is well at Brigham Young University. We have problems in 1990 like those we had in 1980. We'll have problems in the year 2000, and we'll continue to work with them. But what we must never do is lose sight of the purpose of the work we're doing or the essential tie that we have to the Church in an institutional way and to our Heavenly Father in an individual way. If we lose that tie, we are trying to gain the whole world at the expense of losing our whole soul.<br><br>I don't think that very many of us would advocate that, but I think it's possible that some of us in our zeal to accomplish the things that we want to do in the university, which are good in and of themselves, will lose sight of the fact that in this university, with its unique governance and funding and stated mission, we must do things in a particular way. Part of that particular way is institutional, and part of it is individual in the way we approach our own tasks. I hope each of us will bear that in mind in the coming year and in all the years to come.<br><br>What each of us has as a testimony of our divine parentage and our eternal destiny is more important than any degrees that can be conferred from this podium or any honors that can be earned in this community. That is a profound eternal truth. This gospel, which gives us the purpose of life and the assurance of a Savior and compensates for the inevitable pains and transgressions and inadequacies of life, is the most precious thing that any of us have.<br><br>I testify to you of Jesus Christ, our Savior. I testify to you of his prophet, Joseph Smith, and of those in the line of succession that have led this Church and do lead this Church today. I assure you of the love of our Heavenly Father. He is mindful of every sacrifice and of every prayer. I give you this assurance and ask for the blessings of our Heavenly Father to be upon each of us in our separate responsibilities, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Dallin H.

<h1>in the Church: &quot;No Less Serviceable&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a delight to be with you tonight in the first eighteen-stake fireside of the new academic year. I am aware that in the audience are many Brigham Young University students, Utah Valley Community College students, and young adults from other schools and locations in the valley. Thank you for your attendance and for letting me visit with you tonight.<br><br>I want you to know that my own children--and now my grandchildren--have attended Brigham Young University. From time to time I have spoken with them about some of the challenges that come at this time in a young person's life, and this is what I would like to do with you tonight. If you are willing, please allow me to speak to you as my "family." I love you as if you were all mine, and there may be someone here tonight with a need for fatherly--or grandfatherly--advice. I want to encourage you and hope you will receive what I have to say in that spirit.<br><h2><b>Part of God's Army</b></h2><br>Let me begin with a well-known verse from the Book of Mormon about the young and valiant Captain Moroni. It was said of him:<br><br><i>If all men had been, and were, and ever would be, like unto Moroni, behold, the very powers of hell would have been shaken forever; yea, the devil would never have power over the hearts of the children of men.</i>[Alma 48:17]<br><br>What a compliment to a famous and powerful man. I can't imagine a finer tribute from one man to another. Two verses later is a statement about Helaman and his brethren, who played a less conspicuous role than Moroni, that reads:<br><br><i>Now behold, Helaman and his brethren were no less serviceable unto the people than was Moroni.</i>[Alma 48:19]<br><br>In other words, even though Helaman was not as noticeable or conspicuous as Moroni, he was as serviceable; that is, he was as helpful or useful as Moroni.<br><br>Obviously we could profit greatly by studying the life of Captain Moroni. He is an example of faith, service, dedication, commitment, and many other godly attributes. I could spend all of the brief time we have tonight speaking of this magnificent man, but instead I have chosen to focus on those who are not seen in the limelight or do not receive the attention of the world, yet are "no less serviceable," as the scripture phrased it.<br><br>Unless I miss my guess, some of you are going to feel a little lost this coming year, perhaps a little lonely and forgotten. That may be especially true of the freshmen or maybe those just back from missions or those facing other changes in their patterns of life. Not everyone at school is going to be the student body president or the Relief Society president or the teacher of the elders quorum. Not all of you are going to be like Moroni, catching the acclaim of your colleagues all day every day. No, most will be quiet, relatively unknown folks who come and go and do their work without fanfare. To those of you who may find that lonely or frightening or just unspectacular, I say you are "no less serviceable" than the most spectacular of your associates. You, too, are part of God's army.<br><br>I know none of you thinks about such things as you eagerly lock yourself in the library for solid study, but I am told the football season is upon us. Furthermore, I am told that we have a talented young quarterback. I said I was going to be your grandfather tonight, but that doesn't mean I don't read the sports page! However, in light of tonight's message, I am reminded of the contribution of each and every player to the success of any team.<br><br>Understandably enough, the quarterback is often given more attention and media coverage than the other players, but his skill, learning, and efforts would be of little value if the other players did not do their share and play their part. Imagine what would happen if, on each play of the game, the guard, or one of the other offensive linemen, walked off the field or laid down on the job or gave up his effort to protect the quarterback. What if the rest of the team decided not to put forth their very best effort? The answer of course is obvious. The quarterback could contribute nothing to the success of the team.<br><br>Like the offensive linemen and other unsung heroes on the football team, most of us, including most of you, may spend much of our life in giving service in relative obscurity. Consider the profound service of a mother or father--what they give in the quiet anonymity of a worthy Latter-day Saint home. Think of the gospel doctrine teachers and Primary choristers and Scoutmasters and Relief Society visiting teachers who serve and bless millions but whose names will never be publicly applauded or featured in the nation's media.<br><br>Think of the staff of the Marriott Center tonight who prepared this building, set up the podium, and control the lights and the temperature and the microphone. It is a massive undertaking by scores of people whose names you don't even know and who get little public praise. The same thing is true of the policemen who will direct the traffic as we leave here and the custodians who are preparing your classrooms for the new year. Tens of thousands of unseen people make possible our opportunities and happiness every day. As the scriptures state, they too are "no less serviceable" than those whose lives are on the front page of life's newspapers.<br><h2><b>Unsung Heroes</b></h2><br>The limelight of history and contemporary attention so often focus on the "one" rather than the many. Individuals are frequently singled out from their peers and elevated as heroes. I acknowledge that this kind of attention is one way to identify that which the people admire or hold to be of some value. But sometimes that recognition is not deserved or may even celebrate the wrong values. This presents us with the challenge of choosing our heroes and examples wisely, while also giving thanks for those legions of friends and citizens who are not so famous but who are "no less serviceable" than the Moronis of our lives.<br><br>Perhaps you could consider with me some interesting people from the scriptures who did not receive the limelight of attention but who, through the long lens of history, have proven themselves to be truly heroic.<br><br>Many who read the story of the great prophet Nephi almost completely miss another valiant son of Lehi whose name was Sam. Nephi is one of the most famous figures in the entire Book of Mormon. But Sam? Sam's name is mentioned only ten times in the scriptures. When Lehi counseled and blessed his posterity, he said to Sam:<br><br><i>Blessed art thou</i>[Sam],<i>and thy seed; for thou shalt inherit the land like unto thy brother Nephi. And thy seed shall be numbered with his seed; and thou shalt be even like unto thy brother, and thy seed like unto his seed; and thou shalt be blessed in all thy days.</i>[2 Nephi 4:11]<br><br>Sam's role was basically one of supporting and assisting his more acclaimed younger brother, and he ultimately received all the blessings promised to Nephi and his posterity. Nothing promised to Nephi was withheld from the faithful Sam, yet we know very little of the details of his service and contribution. He was almost an unknown in life, but he is obviously a triumphant leader and victor in the annals of eternity.<br><br>Many make their contributions in unsung ways. Ishmael traveled with the family of Nephi at great personal sacrifice, suffering "much affliction, hunger, thirst, and fatigue" (1 Nephi 16:35). Then, in the midst of all of these afflictions, he perished in the wilderness. Few of us can even begin to understand the sacrifice of such a man in those primitive times and conditions. Perhaps if we were more perceptive and understanding, we too would mourn as his daughters did in the wilderness for what a man like this gave--and gave up!--so that we could have the Book of Mormon today.<br><br>The names and memories of such men and women who were "no less serviceable" are legion in the Book of Mormon. Whether it be Mother Sariah or the simple maid, Abish, servant to the Lamanite queen, each made contributions that were unacknowledged by the eyes of men, but not unseen by the eyes of God.<br><br>Mosiah, king over the land of Zarahemla and father of the famous king Benjamin, has only twelve verses of scripture dealing with his life. Yet his service to the people was indispensable. He led the people "by many preachings and prophesyings" and "admonished [them] continually by the word of God" (Omni 1:13). Limhi, Amulek, and Pahoran--the latter of whom who had the nobility of soul not to condemn when he was very unjustly accused--are other examples of people who served selflessly in the shadow of another's limelight. The soldier Teancum, who sacrificed his own life, or Lachoneus, the chief judge who taught people to repent during the challenge of the Gadiantons, or the virtually unmentioned missionaries, Omner and Himni, were all "no less serviceable" than their companions, yet received very little scriptural attention.<br><br>We don't know much about Shiblon, the faithful son of Alma who is sandwiched between Helaman, the future leader, and Corianton, the transgressor; but it is significant that he is described as a "just man, and he did walk uprightly before God" (Alma 63:2). The great prophet Nephi, mentioned in the Book of Helaman, had a brother named Lehi, who is seemingly mentioned only in passing but is noted as being "not a whit behind him [Nephi] as to things pertaining to righteousness" (see Helaman 11:18-19).<br><br>Of course there are examples of these serviceable individuals in our dispensation as well. Oliver Granger is the kind of quiet, supportive individual in the latter days that the Lord remembered in section 117 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Oliver's name may be unfamiliar to many, so I will take the liberty to acquaint you with this early stalwart.<br><br>Oliver Granger was eleven years older than Joseph Smith and, like the Prophet, was from upstate New York. Because of severe cold and exposure when he was thirty-three years old, Oliver lost much of his eyesight. Notwithstanding his limited vision, he served three full-time missions. He also worked on the Kirtland Temple and served on the Kirtland high council.<br><br>When most of the Saints were driven from Kirtland, Ohio, the Church left some debts unsatisfied. Oliver was appointed to represent Joseph Smith and the First Presidency and return to Kirtland to settle the Church's business. Of this task, the Doctrine and Covenants records: "Therefore, let him contend earnestly for the redemption of the First Presidency of my Church, saith the Lord" (D&amp;amp;C 117:13). He performed this assignment with such satisfaction to the creditors involved that one of them wrote:<br><br><i>Oliver Granger's management in the arrangement of the unfinished business of people that have moved to the Far West, in redeeming their pledges and thereby sustaining their integrity, has been truly praiseworthy, and has entitled him to my highest esteem, and every grateful recollection.</i>[Horace Kingsbury, Painesville, 26 October 1838]<br><br>During Oliver's time in Kirtland, some people, including disaffected members of the Church, were endeavoring to discredit the First Presidency and bring their integrity into question by spreading false accusations. Oliver Granger, indeed, "redeemed the First Presidency" through his faithful service. In response, the Lord said of Oliver Granger: "His name shall be had in sacred remembrance from generation to generation, forever and ever" (D&amp;amp;C 117:12). "I will lift up my servant Oliver, and beget for him a great name on the earth, and among my people, because of the integrity of his soul" (<i>HC</i>3:350).<br><br>When he died in 1841, even though there were but few Saints remaining in the Kirtland area and even fewer friends of the Saints, Oliver Granger's funeral was attended by a vast concourse of people from neighboring towns.<br><br>Though Oliver Granger is not as well known today as other early leaders of the Church, he was nevertheless a great and important man in the service he rendered to the kingdom. Of course, if no one but the Lord had his name in remembrance, that would be a sufficient blessing for any of us.<br><h2><b>Why Do We Serve?</b></h2><br>I think we should be aware that there can be a spiritual danger to those who misunderstand the singularity of always being in the spotlight. They may come to covet the notoriety and thus forget the significance of the service being rendered. As students, you are at a crucial juncture in your lives when life-shaping judgments are made and future courses set. You must not allow yourselves to focus on the fleeting light of popularity or substitute that attractive glow for the substance of true, but often anonymous labor that brings the attention of God even if it does not get coverage on the six o'clock news. In fact, applause and attention can become the spiritual Achilles' heel of even the most gifted among us.<br><br>If the limelight of popularity should fall on you during some time in your life, it might be well for you to follow the example of those in the scriptures who received notoriety and fame. Nephi is one of the great examples. After all he accomplished traveling in the wilderness with his family, his attitude was still fixed on the things that matter most. This is what he said:<br><br><i>And when I desire to rejoice, my heart groaneth because of my sins; nevertheless, I know in whom I have trusted.</i><br><br><i>My God hath been my support; he hath led me through mine afflictions in the wilderness; and he hath preserved me upon the waters of the great deep.</i><br><br><i>He hath filled me with his love, even unto the consuming of my flesh.</i><br><br><i>He hath confounded mine enemies, unto the causing of them to quake before me.</i>[2 Nephi 4:19–22]<br><br>The limelight never blinded Nephi to the source of his strength and his blessings.<br><br>At times of attention and visibility it might also be profitable for us to answer the question Why do we serve? When we understand why, we won't be concerned about where we serve.<br><br>President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., taught this vital principle in his own life. At general conference in April 1951, President David O. McKay was sustained as President of the Church after the passing of President George Albert Smith. Up to that time President Clark had served as the First Counselor to President Heber J. Grant and President George Albert Smith. President McKay had been the Second Counselor to both men. During the final session of conference, when the business of the Church was transacted, Brother Stephen L Richards was called to the First Presidency and sustained as First Counselor. President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., was then sustained as the Second Counselor. After the sustaining of the officers of the Church, President McKay explained why he had chosen his counselors in that order. He said:<br><br><i>I felt that one guiding principle in this choice would be to follow the seniority in the Council</i>[of the Twelve Apostles].<i>These two men were sitting in their places in that presiding body in the Church, and I felt impressed that it would be advisable to continue that same seniority in the new quorum of the First Presidency.</i>[<i>CR,</i>9 April 1951, p. 151]<br><br>President Clark was then asked to speak following President McKay. His remarks on this occasion were brief, but taught a powerful lesson:<br><br><i>In the service of the Lord, it is not where you serve but how. In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, one takes the place to which one is duly called, which place one neither seeks nor declines. I pledge to President McKay and to President Richards the full loyal devoted service to the tasks that may come to me to the full measure of my strength and my abilities, and so far as they will enable me to perform them, however inadequate I may be.</i>[<i>CR,</i>9 April 1951, p. 154]<br><br>The lesson that President Clark taught is expressed in another way in this poem by Meade McGuire:<br><br><i>Father, where shall I work today?</i><br><i>And my love flowed warm and free.</i><br><i>Then He pointed out a tiny spot</i><br><i>And said, "Tend that for me."</i><br><br><i>I answered quickly, "Oh no, not that!</i><br><i>Why, no one would ever see,</i><br><i>No matter how well my work was done;</i><br><i>Not that little place for me."</i><br><br><i>And the word He spoke, it was not stern;</i><br><i>He answered me tenderly:</i><br><i>"Ah, little one, search that heart of thine.</i><br><i>Art thou working for them or for me?</i><br><i>Nazareth was a little place,</i><br><i>And so was Galilee."</i><br><br>King Benjamin declared:<br><br><i>Behold, I say unto you that because I said unto you that I had spent my days in your service, I do not desire to boast, for I have only been in the service of God.</i><br><br><i>And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.</i>[Mosiah 2:16–17]<br><br>President Ezra Taft Benson said recently in conference:<br><br><i>Christlike service exalts. ... The Lord has promised that those who lose their lives serving others will find themselves. The Prophet Joseph Smith told us that we should "wear out our lives" in bringing to pass His purposes. (D&amp;amp;C 123:13.)</i>[<i>CR,</i>30 September 1989, p. 5; or<i>Ensign,</i>November 1989, pp. 5–6]<br><br>If you feel that much of what you do this year or in the years to come does not make you very famous, take heart. Most of the best people who ever lived weren't very famous either. Serve and grow, faithfully and quietly. Be on guard regarding the praise of men. Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount:<br><br><i>Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.</i><br><br><i>Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</i><br><br><i>But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:</i><br><br><i>That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.</i>[Matthew 6:1–4]<br><br>May our Father in Heaven so reward you this new school year and always in your lives, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Howard W. Hunter was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 2 September 1990.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>Upon the Lord: the Power of Heaven - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I'm grateful to be with you this evening and for the kind things that have been said. I am grateful also to be with you at the beginning of the year as the stakes and the wards are being organized. You are in a time, I hope, of at least a little uncertainty and some feelings of being in assignments that are beyond you.<br><h2><strong>Bringing Down the Powers of Heaven</strong></h2><br>I would like to talk with you about something that matters to you now and that, in the months and not many years ahead, will matter to you more. You will be in situations where you will want to know how to bring down the powers of heaven. I will suggest how you might do that by waiting upon the Lord. I pray that we may be blessed to learn together because I need to understand better how to get help, too.<br><br>You and I struggle to bring down the powers of heaven. Oh, you may not think about it much, but sometimes you do. You go along on your own and then, suddenly, that's not enough. Something dramatic may happen, like having a friend or family member who needs a blessing. Or perhaps something dramatic doesn't happen; you realize that you've been teaching your class or visiting the people who have been assigned to your care with no visible effect. That may make you doubt yourself or the person who called you or even whether you have the power to reach God.<br><br>Now, my worry is not about your testimony. You have all had spiritual experiences, and most of you have recognized them. Some of you have had remarkable spiritual experiences. If I called you up here to bear your testimony, you could do it by citing spiritual manifestations in your own experience.<br><br>But what I'm worried about, and at least unconsciously you are, too, is a fact put bluntly by a President of the Church once. His name was Heber J. Grant, and this is what he said. It was true when he said it, and it still is.<br><br>Here are his words. Listen carefully.<br><br><i>There is but one path of safety to the Latter-day Saints, and that is the path of duty. It is not testimony, it is not marvelous manifestations, it is not knowing that the Gospel of Jesus Christ is true,</i>...<i>it is not actually knowing that the Savior is the Redeemer, and that Joseph Smith was His prophet, that will save you and me, but it is the keeping of the commandments of God, the living the life of a Latter-day Saint.</i>[Heber J. Grant,<i>Improvement Era,</i>November 1936, p. 659]<br><br>Now you and I know that the path of duty and living the life of a Latter-day Saint require our bringing down the powers of heaven. Think about the duties that really matter to a Latter-day Saint: rearing children in a world of wickedness; caring for the poor when you have trouble just caring for yourselves; being a witness for the Savior wherever we may be, in whatever circumstances. You remember how Alma described the covenant you and I made at the waters of baptism:<br><br><i>As ye are desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be called his people, and are willing to bear one another's burdens, that they may be light;</i><br><br><i>Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even until death, that ye may be redeemed of God, and be numbered with those of the first resurrection, that ye may have eternal life--</i><br><br><i>Now I say unto you, if this be the desire of your hearts, what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord, as a witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments, that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you?</i>[Mosiah 18:8–10]<br><br>In more thoughtful times, like tonight, you and I realize that the promise of serving so that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon us is more than a nice reward; it is a necessity. For what matters, our own power is not enough. You know that getting help won't be easy or automatic.<br><br>Let me tell you a true story, from my life, that will likely strike a chord in your memories of your own spiritual life.<br><br>Years ago I was asked to chair a committee of faculty from this university and others with this question to study: What should be the future of higher education in the Church?<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell was then the commissioner of education. I told him I didn't think I could do it without the help of heaven. He asked if I would like a blessing. I've forgotten how it was arranged that I would see Elder Alvin R. Dyer. That was especially pleasant for me, since I had been a priest once in a ward where he was the bishop, the president of my quorum. He listened sympathetically to my story, put his hands on my head, and gave me a blessing that included words like this as a promise: "In this assignment, and in many others which will come to you, your mind will be guided in channels toward the truth." That blessing gave me confidence, maybe too much confidence. The committee began its work. And after months of what seemed to me futile effort, I felt some desperation, much as you do when heaven seems to withhold its help in a task you know matters and is beyond you.<br><br>I somehow managed to arrange another interview. This one was with President Harold B. Lee. He received me in a kindly way. In my anxiety, I soon blurted out my question: "President Lee, how do I get revelation?"<br><br>He smiled. I am glad he didn't laugh, since it was an odd question to ask. But he answered my question with a story. It was essentially this. He said that during World War II he had been part of a group studying the question "What should the Church be doing for its members in the military service?" He said they conducted interviews at bases up and down the country. They had data gathered. They had the data analyzed. They went back for more interviews. But still, no plan emerged.<br><br>Then he gave me the lesson, which I now give to you, in about these words: "Hal, when we had done all we knew how to do, when we had our backs to the wall, then God gave us the revelation. Hal, if you want to get revelation, do your homework."<br><br>I suppose I should have been embarrassed to take his time to learn what the Lord told us all long ago. You remember the rebuke to Oliver Cowdery and to you and me and to all of our Father's children who are called to duties that take the powers of heaven. You remember the words. I am always impressed at how kindly they really were.<br><br><i>Be patient, my son, for it is wisdom in me, and it is not expedient that you should translate at this present time.</i><br><br><i>Behold, the work which you are called to do is to write for my servant Joseph.</i><br><br><i>And, behold, it is because that you did not continue as you commenced, when you began to translate, that I have taken away this privilege from you.</i><br><br><i>Do not murmur, my son, for it is wisdom in me that I have dealt with you after this manner.</i><br><br><i>Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me.</i><br><br><i>But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</i><br><br><i>But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of thought that shall cause you to forget the thing which is wrong; therefore, you cannot write that which is sacred save it be given you from me.</i><br><br><i>Now, if you had known this you could have translated; nevertheless, it is not expedient that you should translate now.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 9:3–10]<br><br>Now, in fairness to Oliver Cowdery, he had some reason to be confused. The Prophet Joseph seemed to have the windows of heaven opened to him. The words of revelation came to him, both to translate the Book of Mormon and to give us the revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants, at a speed that could easily have misled Oliver.<br><br>I bear you my solemn testimony that the Lord opens the heavens to his servants today. He will answer your prayers for help beyond your human understanding. But I also bear you my testimony that the words<i>study it out</i>mean a degree of patience, of labor, of persistence commensurate with the value of what you seek.<br><h2><strong>A Promise</strong></h2><br>Alma gave his son advice that is good for us. He said:<br><br><i>Preach unto them repentance, and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ; teach them to humble themselves and to be meek and lowly in heart; teach them to withstand every temptation of the devil, with their faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.</i><br><br><i>Teach them to never be weary of good works, but to be meek and lowly in heart; for such shall find rest to their souls.</i>[Alma 37:33–34]<br><br>The good works that really matter require the help of heaven. And the help of heaven requires working past the point of fatigue so far that only the meek and lowly will keep going long enough.<br><br>The Lord doesn't put us through this test just to give us a grade; he does it because the process will change us.<br><br>President Harold B. Lee described that once in general conference. He said:<br><br><i>To become converted, according to the scriptures, meant having a change of heart and the moral character of a person turned from the controlled power of sin into a righteous life. It meant to "wait patiently on the Lord" until one's prayers can be answered</i>. [<i>CR,</i>April 1971, p. 92]<br><br>If we are going to do our duty, we are going to need the powers of heaven. And if we are going to be given access to the powers of heaven, we are going to have to learn to wait upon the Lord.<br><br>The word<i>wait</i>in scripture language means to hope for or anticipate. Surely the great prophet Isaiah meant that, and I think he meant more, when he made us a glorious promise. It's a promise I carved for my oldest son, Henry, a graduate of this university, when he had just turned twelve.<br><br>I carved this board. I got better as the boys came along, by the way, if you don't admire my carving. It was a height board. The idea was that we would put the board on a wall for my son, and when certain things happened in his life, we would carve that event. I carved it after he was twelve. He had just received his Eagle badge, so the word<i>deacon</i>is not carved there. It begins with<i>teacher.</i>This plaque goes through<i>teacher, priest, elder, mission,</i>and<i>marriage.</i>When it started, it was empty. So I knew it needed something nice at the top; it needed a crest and a motto. Since he had just won his Eagle Scout badge, I carved an eagle at the top with this legend from Isaiah as his motto. It reads: "On Eagles' Wings."<br><br>Oh, but I wish there had been more room on the board so that I could have carved there the whole lesson. I would like to give it to you tonight. How would he be lifted as on eagles' wings? Here's the lesson from the great prophet, whose words the Lord commended to us.<br><br><i>But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.</i>[Isaiah 40:31]<br><br>If I were to try to help you, or my son, have that glorious blessing--that you not be weary in doing your duty, I would tell you the little I know about waiting upon the Lord.<br><br>The scriptures, what I see around me, and my own experience tell me that this scripture has a key in it. Listen carefully to this scripture. It is one Alma teaches us:<br><br><i>And now I would that ye should be humble, and be submissive and gentle; easy to be entreated; full of patience and long-suffering; being temperate in all things; being diligent in keeping the commandments of God at all times; asking for whatsoever things ye stand in need, both spiritual and temporal; always returning thanks unto God for whatsoever things ye do receive.</i><br><br><i>And see that ye have faith, hope, and charity, and then ye will always abound in good works.</i><br><br><i>And may the Lord bless you, and keep your garments spotless.</i>[Alma 7:23–25]<br><br>Being submissive, gentle, easy to be entreated, and patient are all attributes. But the actions Alma commends to us are to ask for what we need and to return thanks. Please don't think of that as a routine command to say your prayers. Oh, it is much more than that. If you pray, if you talk to God, and if you plead for the help you need, and if you thank him not only for help but for the patience and gentleness that come from not receiving all you desire right away or perhaps ever, then I promise you that you will draw closer to him. And then you will become diligent and longsuffering.<br><h2><strong>Live on the Lord's Side of the Line</strong></h2><br>Let me tell you another way you can make a simple choice that will surely bring down on you the powers of heaven. Just as you sometimes feel the great need to have heaven's help in your service, you must often sense a need for help to resist evil. Just as prayer is a simple choice, there is a simple choice you can make to bring the powers of heaven to you that you might live clean in a wicked world.<br><br>President George Albert Smith made you a promise. It seemed so powerful that I wondered if the quotation when I found it was taken out of context. So I looked it up. I checked the original source and found that context is no problem since this statement was printed alone in a box by itself. It has no context. He said:<br><br><i>There are two influences ever present in the world. One is constructive and elevating and comes from our Heavenly Father; the other is destructive and debasing and comes from Lucifer. We have our agency and make our own choice in life subject to these unseen powers. There is a division line well defined that separates the Lord's territory from Lucifer's. If we live on the Lord's side of the line Lucifer cannot come there to influence us, but if we cross the line into his territory we are in his power. By keeping the commandments of the Lord we are safe on His side of the line, but if we disobey His teachings we voluntarily cross into the zone of temptation and invite the destruction that is ever present there. Knowing this, how anxious we should always be to live on the Lord's side of the line.</i>[George Albert Smith,<i>Improvement Era,</i>May 1935, p. 278]<br><br>You can make a simple choice: you can decide to move toward the Savior, toward his side. You can do it tonight when you decide what to do with the time that's left before you sleep. Each of you will have different alternatives, but the choice will be clear. President Smith said the line was clear. And you remember Mormon told his son, Moroni, exactly what marked the line and why it was so clear. Think about this when you decide what video you might watch, what magazine you might pick up, or whatever you might do. Mormon said to his son:<br><br><i>For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God.</i><br><br><i>But whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do evil, and believe not in Christ, and deny him, and serve not God, then ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of the devil; for after this manner doth the devil work, for he persuadeth no man to do good, no, not one; neither do his angels; neither do they who subject themselves unto him.</i>[Moroni 7:16–17]<br><br>Now I plead with you to take that seriously. The world will become more wicked. You will need the help of heaven to keep the commandments. You will need it more and more as the days go on. Satan will expand the space that is not safe. He will try every way he can to persuade you that there is no danger in trying to come as close as you can to that dividing line. At the same time he is trying to persuade people that there really is no line at all. Because he knows you know it is there, he will say to you, "Come closer to the line."<br><br>But you can bring the protective powers of heaven down on you by simply deciding to go toward the Savior, to wait on him. Satan will tell you, as he has done regularly for ages, that you will not be happy in safety, that you must come near his ground to live the happy life. Well, that is a clear choice, too. Here it is, put about as plainly as you will get it by Nephi:<br><br><i>Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.</i>[2 Nephi 2:27]<br><br>I hope you will remember that when you see some beautifully packaged, cleverly advertised invitation to go to Satan's territory. It will be funny or pleasant or charming or glamorous; but remember, he wants you as miserable as he is himself. He lies to you to tell you that you must go toward him to find happiness.<br><h2><strong>Listen for the Voice of the Lord</strong></h2><br>As long as we are being plain about choices, there is another way you can decide to wait upon the Lord. Again, it is a choice to move to safety by doing your duty. It takes a decision both about how to use your time and where to put your ego. And you can use it in the next week. Here it is again from that plain speaker, President Harold B. Lee:<br><br><i>Now the only safety we have as members of this church is to do exactly what the Lord said to the Church in that day when the Church was organized. We must learn to give heed to the words and commandments that the Lord shall give through his prophet, "as he receiveth them, walking in all holiness before me;</i>...<i>as if from mine own mouth, in all patience and faith" (D&amp;amp;C 21:4–5). There will be some things that take patience and faith. You may not like what comes from the authority of the Church. It may contradict your political views.</i>...<i>It may interfere with some of your social life. But if you listen to these things, as if from the mouth of the Lord himself, with patience and faith, the promise is that "the gates of hell shall not prevail against you; yea, and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before you, and cause the heavens to shake for your good, and his name's glory" (D&amp;amp;C 21:6).</i>[<i>CR,</i>October 1970, p. 152]<br><br>I'll add a promise to you of my own. If you will wait upon the Lord while you listen to this next general conference, if you will listen for his voice, you will recognize it in the words spoken by his servants. Forget about them as human personalities, and when the conference is over, I promise you that you will have a quiet assurance that those human beings are called of God and that God honors their calls.<br><br>I will make you that same promise the next time your bishop speaks to you. I was in my ward this afternoon, and our bishop spoke. As my wife and I left, we said, "You could feel, couldn't you, when the Holy Ghost came." He bore testimony, and I knew that bishop, who is my neighbor, was as called of God as I have ever known that any human being was called of God.<br><br>Now you try it with your bishop. He might sometime soon decide to talk to you. Listen. Wait upon the Lord as he speaks. Don't worry about him as a human being. You just listen and see if you can hear the voice of the Lord. I will promise you not only that you will hear what you should hear, but that you will see his call is a call from God, and you will find it far easier to be the faithful servant in your ward.<br><br>You might even try it with your home teachers or your visiting teachers. While they are there, wait upon the Lord, listen and see if you can know what it is God would have you do. It may not even be in their words. It may be things that will come to you while they speak, but you will know. And you will know that it is coming to you because you are waiting upon the Lord by honoring his servants. And when you see that God can honor the callings of such ordinary people, you will find your faith increased that he may magnify what you are doing in your own service. You won't always see the miracles that come from your work, which is probably a blessing. If you did, you would get proud. But you can often underestimate what God is doing as he honors your calling.<br><h2><strong>You Came for the Savior</strong></h2><br>You've surely noticed how much we've talked about meekness, about service, about waiting, and about submission. That ought to raise a question something like this: Aren't we trying to get a first-class education at this university that produces independence, critical thinking, and, even as we do in the scientific method, the proper use of skepticism? Those attitudes have been used by many people, and they have produced the secular miracles of our age. How in the world, you might ask, do you expect us to excel in using our intellects and yet wait so patiently upon the Lord?<br><br>Let me encourage you by telling you a story. It was told to me by my father. He told it with the intent to chuckle at himself. It was a story about his trying to do his duty, just the way you try to do your duty.<br><br>Now you have to know a little bit about my father. His name was Henry Eyring, like mine. He had done some of the things students of this university are preparing to be able to do. His work in chemistry was substantial enough to bring the honors some of you will someday have, but he was still a member of a ward of the Church with his duty to do. To appreciate this story, you have to realize that it occurred when he was nearly eighty and had bone cancer. He had bone cancer so badly in his hips that he could hardly move. The pain was great.<br><br>Dad was the senior high councilor in his stake with the responsibility for the welfare farm. An assignment was given to weed a field of onions, so Dad assigned himself to go work on the farm.<br><br>Dad never told me how hard it was, but I have met several people who were with him that day. I talked to one of them on the phone the other night to check the story. The one I talked to said that he was weeding in the row next to Dad through much of the day. He told me the same thing that others who were there that day have told me. He said that the pain was so great that Dad was pulling himself along on his stomach with his elbows. He couldn't kneel. The pain was too great for him to kneel. Everyone who has talked to me has remarked how Dad smiled, and laughed, and talked happily with them as they worked in that field of onions.<br><br>Now, this is the joke Dad told me on himself, afterward. He said he was there at the end of the day. After all the work was finished and the onions were all weeded, someone asked him, "Henry, good heavens! You didn't pull<i>those</i>weeds, did you? Those weeds were sprayed two days ago, and they were going to die anyway."<br><br>Dad just roared. He thought that was the funniest thing. He thought it was a great joke on himself. He had worked through the day in the wrong weeds. They had been sprayed and would have died anyway.<br><br>When Dad told me this story, I knew how tough it was. So I said to him, "Dad, how could you make a joke out of that? How could you take it so pleasantly?"<br><br>He said something to me that I will never forget, and I hope you won't. He said, "Hal, I wasn't there for the weeds."<br><br>Now, you'll be in an onion patch much of your life. So will I. It will be hard to see the powers of heaven magnifying us or our efforts. It may even be hard to see our work being of any value at all. And sometimes our work won't go well.<br><br>But you didn't come for the weeds. You came for the Savior. And if you pray, and if you choose to be clean, and if you choose to follow God's servants, you will be able to work and wait long enough to bring down the powers of heaven.<br><br>Don't worry too much about the apparent conflict between your scholarly ambitions and doing your duty to God as a humble Latter-day Saint. Both take diligence and enough humility to endure not having things go your way. But the rewards are far different, far greater.<br><br>I was with Dad in the White House in Washington, D.C., the morning he got the National Medal of Science from the president of the United States. I missed the days when he got all the other medals and prizes. But, oh, how I'd like to be with him on the morning he gets the prize he won for his days in the onion patches. He was there to wait on the Lord. And you and I can do that, too. We could wait on the Lord tonight.<br><br>I pray that we will, tonight, tomorrow, and on and on. Then maybe we can hear this said of us:<br><br><i>And now, my son, I trust that I shall have great joy in you, because of your steadiness and your faithfulness unto God; for as you have commenced in your youth to look to the Lord your God, even so I hope that you will continue in keeping his commandments; for blessed is he that endureth to the end.</i>[Alma 38:2]<br><br>My brothers and sisters, tonight I have talked about the little I know about waiting upon the Lord. I have given some examples of prayer, of choosing to be as far on the Lord's side as you can get, of listening to the Brethren and trying to hear in their voices the voice of the Lord. If you will think about it, you will realize that for me to tell you too many details of what you ought to do is itself not wise, because you should wait upon the Lord to find out for yourself.<br><br>Now I would like to tell you what I plan to do. You will each make your own application plan. I have some little cards. I am going to carry with me 2 Nephi 32:9. And the next time I get asked by a bishop or my quorum leader to do something, here is what I am going to try to remember. Could you remember this?<br><br><i>But behold, I say unto you that ye must pray always, and not faint; that ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of Christ, that he will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul.</i>[2 Nephi 32:9]<br><br>Now here is my plan. Next time I decide to do something, I think I will ask in prayer, "Heavenly Father, is this what the Lord would have me do?" And I think I will wait upon the Lord until I know. Then I might say, "Please, while I am working at it, can I remember that I am doing it for the Lord?" I promise you that if you will be patient and diligent, you will have a blessing come to you that you will know that you are doing what the Lord would have you do. And you can be blessed to remember that while you are in that onion patch, you are not there for the weeds. That will be important sometimes when the weeds don't come out easily. You can feel the approval of God.<br><br><i>But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.</i>[Isaiah 40:31]<br><br>Dad never got better. He just got worse. So you might say, "Well, he waited upon the Lord, but he couldn't run and he couldn't walk." But that was true only in this life. There will be a day for you and me when, whatever difficulties and limitations we have here, we will have that promise fulfilled for us. We will be lifted up as on eagles' wings, and it will be those who have waited upon the Lord.<br><br>I pray you might know that this is the Church of Jesus Christ. He is the head of it. He is our master. We serve him. We wait upon him. I bear you my testimony that there is a prophet called of God. Those who lead you in the kingdom are called of God.<br><br>You can by faithful service wait upon the Lord. I pray that you will do your duty. I promise you that is the path of safety. I pray that God will give you the power that you might do it always, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Henry B. Eyring was the first counselor in the Presiding Bishopric of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 30 September 1990.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>our Experience Here - Gordon B. Hinckley - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a wonderful opportunity to be with you this beautiful autumn morning. It is a tremendous challenge to say something that will be helpful to you as you begin, for some of you, a new school year at this institution. For others, as freshman, welcome.<br><br>First, I bring you the love and blessing of President Ezra Taft Benson, who serves as chairman of the board of trustees.<br><br>As all of you know, he has been seriously ill in the hospital for some time. He is much better than he has been, and it is anticipated that he may come home tomorrow. That will be good news for all of us. He loves this school, which he attended at one time. He has so indicated on many occasions. We pray that the Lord will continue to bless him, that he will be comforted and strengthened and experience a renewal of vitality.<br><h2><b>A Great Privilege and Blessing</b></h2><br>For more than twenty-five years I have served as a member of the board of trustees of this university. I have served as vice chairman of the board for almost a decade. I have served as chairman of the executive committee of the board for longer than I can remember.<br><br>I say this only to indicate that I feel a great appreciation for this university. What a wonderful place it is. This beautiful campus is the envy of administrators across the nation and across the world. I remind each of you that it is a precious experience to walk through the beauty of these grounds and to live a very important part of your life in the excellent facilities that have been provided for you.<br><br>It is a wonderful thing to be on a campus where there are winners. I congratulate the football team and every other achiever on this campus.<br><br>You study under a great faculty, a unique and different faculty. They are people who are academically qualified. And beyond this they have a quality that I think is unmatched in any other university in the world, a quality of the Spirit.<br><br>You have here the opportunity for a wonderful social life. Each of you is one of a great congregation of friends. What an exhilarating thing to be involved every day with bright and personable and good associates.<br><br>BYU is wonderful because of its sponsoring institution. It is becoming increasingly unique among large universities in the strength and loyalty and generosity of its sponsor. It enjoys a security because of this, relying not upon tax monies that are mandated by politicians, but on tithing funds that come from the consecrations of good people and are administered by men and women who feel a direct responsibility to the Lord.<br><br>I compliment you, each of you, on the great privilege and blessing you have in being here. I am grateful for the opportunity to be associated, in some measure at least, with this remarkable institution.<br><br>But this responsibility is not without worries and concerns. I remember many years ago, when Ernest L. Wilkinson was president, we had an important discussion in our board meeting. For some years prior to that, the university had vigorously recruited students, with General Authorities at stake conferences being a part of that effort. Then, suddenly, there were more applicants than could be accommodated, and there was much discussion concerning enrollment ceilings. There was talk about who should be eligible to come and what should be the qualifying factors. That meeting was conducted by President Harold B. Lee, who was then serving as a counselor in the First Presidency. As the discussion went on, I remember saying, "The basic question we face now and will continue to face is simply this, 'Who will the Church educate, and who will it turn away?'"<br><br>The question was faced then, and it has troubled us ever since. We discussed it during the administration of President Wilkinson. We repeated that discussion during the administration of President Oaks. It was a recurring subject during the administration of President Holland. Now, in past months, during the administration of President Lee, we have spent hours talking about this same question.<br><br>The problem will continue, and I fear a clear-cut answer will elude us in the future as it has in the past. In fact, the problem grows more serious through the years simply because the Church is growing. There is an ever-increasing number of young people who desire to come to this great and unique university. In terms of character and in terms of faithfulness in the Church, they are qualified. Their parents and ecclesiastical leaders are confident that they have the ability to handle the work. They may not have done exceptionally well in high school, but this does not necessarily mean that they do not have the potential to make it at the university level.<br><br>Many and pathetic are the letters we receive. A stake president recently wrote concerning a young man who had been denied admission. He had done reasonably well in high school, but apparently not well enough. His parents have been faithful and active in the Church. They have been full-tithe payers throughout their lives. They have sent their children on missions. They have done everything the Church has asked them to do. If the major portion of the costs of operating BYU come from the tithing funds of the Church, then why are not the children of longtime faithful tithe payers eligible to attend as long as they meet reasonable qualifications?<br><br>In his letter, the stake president continued, "Is it our objective to turn out of this school an elitist group, snobbish about their intellectual superiority?"<br><br>These are difficult questions to answer. There<i>is</i>an injustice. This is the single most expensive entity funded by the tithes of the Church. Should not all who are honest and generous in their tithing be eligible for its benefits?<br><br>As the Church continues to grow, there will be an increasingly smaller percentage of its young people who will have the opportunity of attending this university.<br><br>Somehow, each of you who is here today has that remarkable opportunity. I need not remind you that you are a highly favored group. I do not dispute your assertion that you earned the right to be here through very diligent study and hard work. In your high school years you met certain stringent requirements that many of your associates did not work to achieve. You kept yourselves morally clean and met other criteria. But the fact remains that there are thousands of others across this world who would enjoy this privilege but are denied primarily because a way had to be found to deny them.<br><br>I submit, therefore, that there has been placed in each of you, as a privileged beneficiary, a great and sacred trust. You and we have entered into a covenant. Those of us who are responsible for the expenditure of the tithing funds of the Church have said to you in effect, "We are trustees of the funds of the Lord. We are willing to make a substantial portion of these funds available to you for your blessing provided you in return pledge certain efforts in your studies and meet certain requirements in your deportment." We will feel happy if you meet that trust. We will feel disappointed and embarrassed if you do otherwise.<br><br>I think there is not a student here, I hope there is not a student here, who does not know, in a general way at least, what is expected of him or her.<br><h2><b>What Will You Take with You?</b></h2><br>Presumably you have come here to follow a course that leads to graduation so that you may be the better qualified to take your place in the society of which you will become a part. For some of you graduation is relatively near, just a few months away. For most of you it seems far away and an almost unattainable goal. I assure you, notwithstanding your fears, that it will come faster than you may think.<br><br>And so, as I speak to you in October, I would like to project your thinking forward to a future April or August commencement day, your own graduation day. I should like to ask, at this early day,<i>What will you take with you when you finally leave BYU?</i><br><br>When that hoped-for commencement day comes, when you walk into this hall with a rented mortarboard on your head and a rented robe on your back to receive a diploma, and then, as you leave through these doors with that diploma in hand, I hope you will go forth with, in addition to your academic maturity, three acquired qualities, each of which I consider to be rooted in the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br><i>First is intellectual discipline.</i>I hope that while you are here you will develop a degree of mental acuity that finds its expression in a mind that is alert, that is orderly in its processes, that is hungry for more of the kind of thing it has been fed while here. Already you have shown a marked disposition in this direction. Otherwise, you would not be here. As you moved through high school you saw many of your associates drop away, unwilling to pay the price of effort needed to finish the course. I congratulate you.<br><br>We are constantly reminded that there is cause for alarm in our nation. It is shocking to read, for instance, that illiteracy is on the rise. Firms that employ large numbers of workers are alarmed over the qualifications of some of those they hire. The Conference Board recently surveyed 163 large companies in a variety of industries. And now I quote,<br><br><i>Nearly 20% of surveyed firms say they are having problems finding workers who read well enough for entry-level jobs. Almost 50% say that between 15% and 35% of their current employees are not capable of handling more complex tasks, and 10% say that up to half of their current workers do not have the skills needed for promotion. ... Nearly a quarter of students currently entering high school will not graduate, and those who do will be less literate than their counterparts a decade ago.</i><br><br>That appraisal comes from a recent issue of the<i>Wall Street Journal</i>(9 October 1990, p. A2). Similar findings are reported in other business journals. One of the reasons for this condition lies in the way in which so many spend much of their time.<br><br>I deplore the terrible waste of the intellectual resources of so many people of this nation who devote countless hours watching mindless drivel. What a wonderful thing it is, on the other hand, to be found submersed, as you are, in a world of books wherein you can walk with the great minds of all time. Again, in the<i>Wall Street Journal</i>was a column written by the former editor of the<i>Chicago Tribune.</i>He wrote of certain aspects of television and then asked:<br><br><i>What is the mystery ... about a society that has the manners of a rock band, the morals of a soap opera, the decision-making ability of the Simpsons and wants to pay for government with Visa and American Express? Why should we be surprised that our underlying culture is constructed from the ratings-based, give-them-what-they-want, remote-controlled, quick-zap world of commercial television?</i>[Jim Squires, "Television's Civil War,"<i>Wall Street Journal,</i>8 October 1990, p. A10]<br><br>This old world needs straightening up. It needs leadership. If you doubt that, witness the fiasco we are seeing in Congress and the administration, where politics so obviously come ahead of principle.<br><br>Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel once made a statement to the effect that those who do not read history will have to repeat it. The decay we witness seeping into our society becomes a repetition of the same decay that took down earlier civilizations.<br><br>My brethren and sisters, this is the greatest season of your lives to develop a familiarity with good books and great minds, the kind of familiarity that will lead to mental acuity and intellectual strength.<br><br>I had a delightful experience only last Saturday evening. I attended a dinner celebrating eighty-five years of the presence in Utah of immigrants from Greece. Seated at the small table next to me was a professor of cardiology at the University of Utah Medical School. He was born in Athens and educated at the University of Athens. Next to him was his wife, a professor in pediatric cardiology, also born and educated in Greece. Next to her was a professor of engineering born in Salonika. It was a stimulating experience to talk with these individuals whose minds had been stretched while they were students and who have never lost an opportunity for learning.<br><br>To you I say, don't be a couch potato. Be a man or a woman with a mind and a will and a bit of discipline, with a zest for learning that will be cultivated in this institution while you are here and that will be expanded through all the years to come.<br><br>I have been fascinated with reclamation projects, the great dams and canals built in many parts of America and across the world to take water from where there is plenty of it and put it where there is not enough. Men have learned to transfer resources, thereby preventing waste and adding to the comfort and blessing of uncounted numbers who otherwise might be denied.<br><br>So it must be with you who have come to learn in this great institution. You must pick up knowledge now available to you and at the same time cultivate a continuing thirst for knowledge to be added to throughout your lives and to be shared with others for their blessing and benefit. Such is the opportunity and the responsibility you have as a student at Brigham Young University. What will you take with you when you leave here? I hope it will be an intellectual hunger, a mental sharpness, a mental discipline, a substantial body of knowledge to which you will wish to add all the days of your lives.<br><br><i>Second, I hope you will develop a spirit of fellowship, a social ease, the capacity to mix and mingle with people wherever you meet them, of low caste or high caste, recognizing their strengths and powers and capacities and goodness.</i><br><br>That facility can be developed on this campus. It can come of the pro and con discussions you have in your classes and that you have as you sit together in small groups talking with one another, even arguing over matters. This is one of the great blessings of university life, to learn to speak together and think together in a kind of challenging environment.<br><br>A vibrant personality that comes of the capacity to listen and learn, that comes of the ability to contribute without boring, that comes of a talent for mingling and mixing with people in a constructive way is something very precious, indeed, that can come as a part of your life on this campus. The cultivation of such will keep you from the moral traps that catch so many.<br><br>I wish to emphasize that I hope you are so busy studying good books that lead to productive thinking and so pleased with the opportunity that you have to mix with others of your kind and to perhaps verbally scrap and argue together over public issues and matters of broad interest that you have no time to waste on the filth and rot we call pornography, the production and peddling of which has become a multimillion-dollar industry where a few get rich and multitudes become enslaved and debauched.<br><br>I submit that you have no time for such. I submit that you will never in all your life have time for such. I submit that it is neither necessary nor desirable. I submit that you must live above it. You can switch stations on the television set. You need not rent or buy the videotapes. You can stay away from the shows that peddle this rubbish. You can avoid all of this kind of filth, and you will be so much the stronger for it. If you do it now, you can establish habits of avoidance that will carry you throughout your lives. You can establish habits of doing the better thing for as long as you live.<br><br>If you have been touched by this, put it behind you. Develop the social ease that gives you the capacity to mingle with others and talk with others in a stimulating and uplifting manner. Social grace is so important a quality--it can be developed on campus and will bless you throughout your life.<br><br><i>Third,</i>when you walk out of this hall, with your diploma in hand,<i>I hope you will take with you an unassailable spiritual strength.</i>I repeat that this is a unique and remarkable university. It is an institution where you may learn the secular things of the world as well as you might learn them anywhere else on earth. And then there is a spiritual value that undergirds all that is done here. How marvelous a thing in the human character is a certain and solid assurance that God our Eternal Father lives. How richly blessed is that young man or woman who knows that he or she can approach the Almighty in quiet and humble prayer. How enriched is the individual who, as he or she goes out into the world, knows that all men and women are sons and daughters of God, each endowed with a divine birthright. How beneficial to come to the realization that, since we are all children of God, we all are brothers and sisters in a very real sense.<br><br>There is too much intolerance in the world. There is too much of it in our own society.<br><br>I listened to a beautiful prayer the other evening, offered by a Greek-American in the manner in which he had been taught to pray. It was an expression of gratitude to the Almighty and a plea for his favor. It was concluded in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost. His phrasing was not as my phrasing might have been, but I recognized his sincerity and told him of my appreciation.<br><br>I sat one evening at the table of a Jewish friend. The prayer he uttered upon his guests and upon the table at which we sat was beautiful and moving. I was grateful for what I heard.<br><br>We can be appreciative in a very sincere way. We must not only be tolerant, but we must cultivate a spirit of affirmative gratitude for those who do not see things quite as we see them. We do not in any way have to compromise our theology, our convictions, our knowledge of eternal truth as it has been revealed by the God of Heaven. We can offer our own witness of the truth, quietly, sincerely, honestly, but never in a manner that will give offense to others.<br><br>The strength of our position as we understand it will become clearer and more precious as we allow others the same privilege of conscience that we so highly prize. We must learn to accord appreciation and respect for others who are as sincere in their beliefs and practices as are we.<br><br>This great institution of which each of you is now a part is maintained by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on the premise that out of your experience here will come a love for God, our Eternal Father, and his Only Begotten Son, the Savior and the Redeemer of the World.<br><br>His is the matchless life we have been taught to emulate. He gave that life for each of us. He is our Redeemer and our Lord. These two, the Father and the Son, revealed themselves in these latter days to the boy who became prophet, seer, and revelator and president of this Church. The ancient priesthood is upon the earth with all of its powers and glories. It is all here, not to be boasted of, but to be quietly acknowledged with gratitude, to be shared where there is a desire to know, never to be forced but to be spoken of with conviction and love and gratitude.<br><br>None of these things that I have spoken of will be mentioned on the diplomas you carry from this institution on graduation day. But they are all implicit in the purposes and design of this university. If you carry them with you, your lives will be blessed. Your experiences will be challenging, but they will be sweet and enriching, and you will become the means of bringing good to all whose lives you touch. To this end I humbly pray, as I invoke the blessing of the Lord upon you and express my love and appreciation and good wishes in the great experiences that lie ahead of you, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Gordon B. Hinckley was First Counselor in the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 16 October 1990.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>of Many - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
We are all alike, and yet so very different. This truth reflects one of the most unusual aspects of the Creation, that there should be such wide diversity in the midst of apparent uniformity. For example, as I look out over this vast audience, it is impossible for me to differentiate among the sea of faces. It reminds me somewhat of the jest of one of our Japanese friends who said, "The trouble with you Occidentals is that you all look alike."<br><br>But if I were to dismount the stand and walk toward the back of the building, as I drew near, the differences would be readily apparent in the quantity, the shade, and the texture of the hair; differences in the depth and color of the eye; in the shape of the face and the figure. But these and many other physical differences readily apparent to the naked eye do not begin to tell the story of the special distinction each of us has.<br><br>We learn, for example, that there are no two sets of fingerprints exactly alike. Thus, of the billions of people who have lived, who now live, or who may yet live, each has a special identifying mark at the tips of his fingers; wherever one goes without gloves, he leaves a trail that can be readily followed by another with the requisite skill and patience. The burglar, for instance, who enters my home under the cloak of night, believing his presence there will never be detected, is surprised to learn we have placed him inside the house because of a thumbprint he carelessly left on a piece of furniture.<br><br>And, we are told, each of us who writes has a different style from all others. Our voices are different, too. The differences in timbre, in tone, in volume, in inflection, in cadence, all make it possible for us to identify someone on the telephone without ever having heard the name mentioned. But again, these and other physical differences not visible to the eye still do not tell the full story, for there is within each of us a spirit that preexisted earth life, that stands apart from all others.<br><br>Abraham was shown the spirits that existed before the world was, and he was identified as being one of them. There were, therefore, special qualities in his character, appearance, and demeanor that made him stand out from all others. As it was with Abraham in the pre-mortal existence, so it was with each of us. Each was a standout. Each was different. And these differences in spiritual attributes exist today and are reflected in our attitudes and conduct. So, you sisters, the next time your sweetheart says there is no one like you in the whole world, believe him, because it is true.<br><h2><b>An Interesting Cycle</b></h2><br>In mortality, most of us pass through an interesting cycle, oscillating from individuality to uniformity and back to individuality again. The newborn baby is highly individualistic. Ordinarily, he is set up in a special room, the nursery, from which he controls and directs the activities of the household. Eating and sleeping schedules are arranged around the whims or the needs of the baby. You must curry his favor. He will not seek yours. Occasionally he may bestow upon you a passing glance or a fleeting smile, the last as often as not arising from his gastritis as from any special interest in you. So, the king reigns supreme.<br><br>But the time comes when His Majesty is toppled from his throne. With an oldest child, this usually happens when number two makes an appearance. It does not take long to discover that this unwanted stranger who has begun to monopolize the time of his court is not merely a visitor, but a permanent resident. Later, his status and influence are further diluted when he begins to attend church and school. Then follows a period when the child's individuality is submerged and he yearns to look, to act, and to talk just like his peers.<br><br>How well I remember in the first grade in St. Johns, Arizona, that just as regularly as my mother sent me to school with combed hair, just as regularly would I mess it up when I was out of her sight. It was not an act of rebellion, nor of disrespect. It was an act of survival. For you see, at that time and that place, the accepted grooming standard for boys was disheveled hair; you cannot begin to imagine the burden that would have been laid upon me had I gone to school with combed hair and the name Francis Marion.<br><br>Later, in high school in Phoenix, combed hair was in, and so were saddle oxfords and argyle socks and corduroys. It was only on rare occasions that we ventured out of this uniform. I have observed the same phenomenon in my own children and their friends. Indeed, we wondered a few years ago whether the clothiers had discontinued manufacturing any kind of jacket except the blue Windbreaker And then, for a while, quilted jackets were very much in vogue.<br><br>But there comes a time when the maturing adult wishes to set his own individual tastes and preferences. Parents may know their daughter has reached or is fast approaching this stage when she announces one day that she will never again wear her new dress, for she has seen someone else wearing one exactly like it. She will insist that the dress be returned, or passed on as a hand-me-down, or given to the D.I. And if, as a last resort, it is to be kept, then it surely must be altered or dyed.<br><br>One of the finest things that came out of the decade of the sixties was the trend toward and the emphasis upon individuality. This was reflected in the catchphrase "Do your own thing" and in Paul Anka's lyrics, "I did it my way." But that generation did not originate this idea. It is as old as the human race, even much older. At other times, it was expressed in other, perhaps more eloquent language.<br><br>It was precisely this idea that worked such a change in the attitudes and accomplishments of President David O. McKay. You will remember that at one point during his mission in the British Isles as a young man, he reached a point of discouragement when he felt inept and unproductive. In the midst of this despondency, he saw, one day, inscribed on a stone over the entryway of a building, the phrase, "What e'er thou art, act well thy part." This short statement brought home to him a great truth he had not previously understood: It matters little where we serve or in what capacity. What does matter is how we serve.<br><h2><b>Individuality and Unity</b></h2><br>I am always intrigued by the examples of men and women who, in their conduct, manifest that they have made peace with themselves, have accepted themselves for what they are, have ceased trying to be someone they are not, and whose object and purpose in life is to be the best of what they are or what they may become. Especially intriguing to me is the character reflected in the encounter (perhaps legendary) between the philosopher Diogenes and young Alexander the Great. According to the report that has come down to us, Alexander saw Diogenes one day at the roadside talking to a group of disciples. Impressed by his demeanor and the careful attention of his audience, Alexander stopped to listen and, listening, became a disciple himself. At length he mustered enough courage to ask the philosopher, "Is there any way I can serve you?" The answer that has come down through the centuries was quite unexpected. Said Diogenes, "Yes. You can stand out of my sunshine." While we may wish that the answer had been a little more kindly and a little less arrogant, we cannot help but admire the sense of independence and self-confidence it imparted.<br><br>Another example closer to our time and place of another philosopher, from an entirely different mold, is that of Eric Hoffer. By choice this man earned a livelihood all his adult life as a day laborer, usually as a longshoreman. He said this mode of employment gave him more time to think and reflect and did not divert his attention unduly from the thing that meant the most to him. In submitting his first manuscript to a publisher, he mailed his only copy, written in his own handwriting. When a friend expressed shock at this, he explained that the original was recorded upon his mind, verbatim; he had reflected so long on the subject he knew it by heart. His character and methods are clearly revealed by an incident that occurred as he worked setting out tomato plants. He became so intrigued with the question "Why do the roots of the plant grow down and the branches shoot up?" that he quit immediately, demanded his pay, and went directly to a library, where he began an exhaustive study of botany and biology. He learned sentence structure and writing style by reading and rereading the works of Montaigne. While his methods and lifestyle were unorthodox, we must admire and should emulate his example of self-confidence and individuality.<br><br>Still another example, closer to home, is that of Elder Richard L. Evans, deceased, formerly of the Twelve, who for many years was the voice of the Spoken Word on Temple Square. Several years ago, in attending a conference in the Salt Lake Bonneville Stake, he brought with him detailed instructions about a new program. Realizing his words on administrative matters would carry little weight because of his sketchy experience in that field, he reviewed the material in the most brief way and explained that the handout he intended to leave behind would provide the details. He then made this comment, which I have never forgotten: "I know what I am. I am a microphonist and a pulpiteer."<br><br>There comes a time in each life when one must accept himself for what he is, must accept the role that time and circumstance have imposed upon him, and must begin to work and to grow in the place where he has been planted. There comes a time when one must realize that imitation is suicide and that the failure to develop innate talents and abilities is, in truth, a rejection both of the god who made him and of the earthly parents who gave him birth and nourished him.<br><br>A fundamental objective in the premortal existence, in the creation of the U.S. Constitution, and in the teachings of the Church is to nourish and encourage our innate capacities and abilities. The rejection of Satan's plan of compulsion in the premortal existence once and for all affirmed the right of freedom of choice, the right of self-determination, the right to follow wherever our talents and inclination might lead us. The assertion in the Declaration of Independence that we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights--life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness--reaffirms that concept. And that affirmation is seen again in the modern revelation that we ought not to be commanded in all things, that we should bring to pass much righteousness by the acts of our own free will because "The power is in us" (see D&amp;amp;C 58:28). So, the mandate of God in the premortal existence, through earthly prophets and through wise men raised up for that purpose, is that we should be individuals, that we should develop our God-given talents, and that we should follow the path indicated by our own special qualities and talents.<br><br>But while in one breath we admonish our people to develop their individuality, while we urge them toward an endless diversity, in the very next breath we enjoin upon them the need for unity, the need to be one. We remind them of the heavenly mandate "If ye are not one ye are not mine" (D&amp;amp;C 38:27). And by way of confirmation, we cite the injunctions of our leaders like Brigham Young and J. Reuben Clark. The essence of this unity is found in Christ's admonition to his disciples that they should be one, even as he and his father are one. It is found also in the motto to be found on our paper currency:<i>E Pluribus Unum--</i>"one out of many." Thus, this mandate does not envision any loss of individuality or separate identity. It merely contemplates a unity in purpose, a unity in objective, a unity in observing those principles that lead to perfection and that insure freedom that protects the rights of individuality.<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball gave emphasis to these two different yet complementary principles. His first public statement after becoming President of the Church enjoined its members to a unity, a unity in observing the principles of the gospel. Later, in the<i>Ensign,</i>he enjoined the members of the Church to seek diversity, to develop individual talents. Said the prophet:<br><br><i>In our world, there have risen brilliant stars in drama, music, literature, sculpture, painting, science and all the graces. For long years I have had a vision of</i>[members of the Church]<i>greatly increasing</i>[their]<i>already strong position of excellence till the eyes of all the world will be upon us.</i><br><br><i>President John Taylor so prophesied, as he emphasized his words with this directive: "You mark my words, and write them down and see if they do not come to pass. You will see the day that Zion will be far ahead of the outside world in everything pertaining to learning of every kind as we are today in regard to religious matters. God expects Zion to become the praise and glory of the whole earth, so that kings hearing of her fame</i>w<i>ill come and gaze upon her glory."</i>[<i>Education for Eternity,</i>Brigham Young University Speeches of the Year (Provo: 12 September 1967), pp. 12–13; this talk was excerpted in "The Gospel Vision of the Arts,"<i>Ensign,</i>July 1977, pp. 2–5]<br><h2><b>A Pearl Without Price</b></h2><br>As we contemplate the vision of these prophets, each of us must ask, "How can I develop to the fullest extent the inherent talents and abilities I possess?" In answering, we must recognize that everything begins within ourselves, within our own minds, for in earth life it is in the mind that all things originate.<br><br>I never cease to marvel at the complexities and the power of the human mind. I was reminded of this recently when, in a restaurant, I heard a voice from behind call my name and say, "Hello." I turned to look upon a man who, at first glance, appeared to be a stranger, but who in a moment I recognized as an old friend from long ago almost hidden behind the mask of his advancing years. With that recognition, his name came to mind, along with mental images of the circumstances under which we had first met and of incidents that had passed between us thereafter. This whole episode did not take more than a few seconds and was triggered by the visual image that passed from the eye to the brain--all else was automatic. But the marvelous retrieval system of the human mind is actuated not only by visual impulses, but also by sounds and by smells, by tastes and by touch.<br><br>I never, for example, smell a certain brand of hand soap but that there appears on the screen of memory the picture of a washstand just off my grandmother's kitchen, where she always kept a bar of the same kind of soap. Nor do I ever smell the intermixed odors of a fruit and vegetable stand but I see in my mind's eye a grocery store in Phoenix, Arizona, where I worked as a teenager. And I never smell or hear a UTA bus but that I envision a ship in the Pacific on whose decks were stacked numerous small craft whose motors emitted sounds and smells exactly like Salt Lake's buses.<br><br>Scientists tell us that the human brain comprises billions of microscopic cells interconnected by an elaborate nervous system; it is here that the numberless facts, figures, and images of a lifetime are stored efficiently, waiting to be called forth by an experience of the kind I have just described. As far as we know, there is no limit to the storage capacity of a normal, healthy, vigorous brain.<br><br>But its use as an incomparable memory bank is not the only function of the mind. The cognitive part of it also has the power to analyze, to compare, to differentiate, to make predictions based upon known facts--almost the power to create new facts. If, for example, I were to see my neighbor at a commencement exercise and were to note the name of his son on the list of graduates, my mind would automatically conclude that my neighbor was there to see his son graduate. Beginning with elementary operations of this kind, the mind moves on to evermore complex and sophisticated operations to produce marvelous results.<br><br>All we see about us, except those things that are part of God's natural creation, sprang from the human mind. The beautiful and functional building in which we are sitting, all of its furnishings, the clothing we wear, the jewelry that adorns our bodies, all these originated in a human mind. Outside stand our automobiles, and at home the garages that house them. Huge, floating cities ply the sea-lanes, and beneath them cruise sophisticated atomic-powered submarines. Overhead fly ponderous airplanes that almost seem to defy the law of gravity. And beyond them are our satellites and spaceships. All these similarly had their origin in someone's brain.<br><br>And this is not to mention our literary, our musical, and our artistic productions. Nor, again, the special speculations of our scientists and philosophers, all of which came from that same prolific source: the human mind.<br><br>In light of all this, we are led to exclaim that the human brain is not merely a pearl of great price: It is a pearl without price, for there is no amount of wealth, no human intelligence, or ingenuity that can replace or restore the mind once it has been destroyed or seriously damaged. And against this background, is it not strange that so little careful attention is given to the maintenance, the cultivation, and the use of the human brain?<br><br>We take so much for granted. Anyone seriously interested in the proper maintenance of the mind must of necessity begin with the body in which it is housed. Generally speaking, it is not possible for a mind to function above the level of the health and vigor of the body that houses it. They are too intermingled to differentiate. Thus, the mind partakes of both the strengths and the weaknesses of the body housing it.<br><br>Blessed are the Latter-day Saints who have revelations direct from God about the maintenance of the body. The Word of Wisdom, for example, gives us the do's and don'ts of proper diet. We are enjoined to eat fruits and vegetables freely in season; to use the whole grains; to be sparing in our use of meat; to abstain from the use of tea, coffee, tobacco, and narcotics, or, in fact, of anything else deemed detrimental to health. It has always been a mystery to me that otherwise intelligent and rational people persist in taking into their bodies substances that weaken and debilitate them and that, in turn, blunt the delicate and irreplaceable instrument of the mind.<br><br>Some of you may have read of the report of an interview with a health specialist who said that if a man owned a million-dollar horse and regularly gave it a cup of coffee, a doughnut, and a cigarette for breakfast, he would probably be reported to the Humane Society.<br><br>While it is doubtful that few if any in this audience eat breakfasts of this kind, it is likely that many eat breakfasts with little more nutritional value and regularly starve their bodies.<br><br>But a perfectly healthy mind in a vigorous, healthy body can be disabled by factors originating within the mind itself, or within the spirit the body houses. These are usually rooted in feelings of fear or guilt that can be of such intensity as to almost paralyze the mind in its natural operations. I am acquainted with a professional man who, without any apparent physical defect, became listless, remote, and abstracted, and almost wholly incapable of carrying on his thriving practice. It was learned later that this paralysis was caused by guilt feelings growing out of a serious moral transgression he had committed. It was not until he recognized the root cause and had done what was necessary to remedy it that he found relief. Most of us are aware of circumstances where a person has been rendered almost completely immobile because of fear. It is significant to Latter-day Saints that the antidotes for these two disabling emotions are to be found in the first principles of the gospel--faith and repentance. We conquer fear with faith and guilt with repentance.<br><br>A healthy mind in a vigorous body, released from the shackles of fear and guilt, is ready to be cultivated; and that term is used with precision here because of the analogy to the cultivation of land. We must never forget that the law of the harvest applies to our minds as it does to our farm. If we sow deadly nightshade on the farm, we will reap nightshade, not onions or tomatoes. If we sow our minds with vulgarity, pornography, and evil thoughts, so will the harvest be of such. President J. Reuben Clark, who has provided us with an excellent criterion for what we ought or ought not to read, said he did not intend to read anything he did not wish to remember through eternity.<br><br>Since most people spend the lion's share of their lives in the search for bread-- that is, in getting the means necessary to maintain life--it behooves us to fill our minds with all available knowledge about our businesses and professions so as to enable us to do our work in less time and with greater skill and profit, thereby leaving us more leisure.<br><br>But life not only should be habitable, it should be enjoyable. Our leisure should be spent, in part, filling our minds with ideas and concepts that will enable us to develop our latent artistic, literary, musical, athletic, and other talents for our enjoyment and benefit and for the blessing of others. If we use it correctly, the mind can be a great resource against boredom and loneliness in old age or in times of illness or isolation. I have been impressed by the statement of Elder LeGrand Richards, who told his bedridden wife, "Mama, the Lord gave us memory so we can smell the roses in December."<br><br>The mind can also serve as a shield against danger or transgression in the future. If we will think of the possible dangers or temptations we may face in the future and will now devise steps to be taken at that time best calculated to guard us, our minds, programmed as it were for that purpose, will come to our rescue and help provide needed protection.<br><br>But the highest and most important use of the mind is to lead us to peace in this life and exaltation in the world to come. We may hope to attain these goals by filling our minds with the holy scriptures, by living according to their precepts, and by having the Spirit of the Lord with us.<br><br>Meanwhile, we should use our minds and our wills to live lives of joy and achievement. There are many in the audience who have vast, untapped talents and abilities. We urge you not to delay in taking positive steps to develop them.<br><br>Let me share with you more of the vision of President Spencer W. Kimball about your future. He said:<br><br><i>With regard to masters, surely there must be many Wagners</i>...<i>in the</i>[Church],<i>approaching him or yet to come in the tomorrows--young people with love of art, talent supreme, and eagerness to create. I hope we ... may produce men greater than this German composer, Wagner, but less eccentric, more spiritual.</i>... [p. 13]<br><br><i>If we strive for perfection, the best and greatest, and are never satisfied with mediocrity, we can excel. In the field of both composition and performance, why cannot</i>[someone]<i>write a greater oratorio than Handel's "Messiah?"</i>... [p. 14]<br><br><i>Oh, how our world needs statesmen! And we ask again with George Bernard Shaw, "Why not?" We have the raw material, we have the facilities, we can excel in training. We have the spiritual climate. We must train statesmen, not demagogues; men of integrity, not weaklings who for a mess of pottage will sell their birthright.</i>...<br><br><i>For years I have been waiting for someone to do justice in recording in song and story and painting and sculpture the story of the restoration, ... the struggles ... and inner revolutions and counterrevolutions of those first decades.</i>[<i>Education for Eternity</i>, p. 18]<br><br>I personally have the feeling that some of those whom President Kimball saw are seated here before me, and to you, especially, I would address this final admonition in the words of the writer, Thomas Carlyle:<br><br><i>Produce! Produce! Were it but the pitifullest, infinitesimal fraction of a product, produce it in God's name. It is the utmost thou hast in thee. Out with it then. Up, up. Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy whole might</i>.<i>Work while it is called today, for the night cometh when no man can work.</i><br><br>I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Francis M. Gibbons was a member of the Second Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 4 November 1990.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>l You Make Room for in Your Wagon? - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I'm grateful, brothers and sisters, for the privilege of being on this campus and participating in any way in the mission of this university and your part in it as you accept the opportunity to learn and prepare to go forth and serve. The thoughts I would like to share with you today I believe fit under the title "What Will You Make Room for in Your Wagon?" It might be considered a self-talk message for my benefit as well as for yours.<br><br>A number of years ago, when I was a beginning teacher in elementary school, I had the superintendent's daughter in my fourth-grade class. She had some learning difficulties. I was anxious for her to learn as quickly as possible. After many attempts with only a blank stare in response to my efforts to teach her long division, at one moment she jumped up and excitedly announced, "Finally you said it right. I've got it. I've got it." I pray that the Spirit of the Lord will bless us so that the things I have prepared will be of help to you.<br><h2><b>Drawing from Our Time Bank</b></h2><br>Some time ago, one of the students on this campus called my home to report what sounded to me like a condition of epidemic proportions. It was just before finals. Shelly, who happens to be my niece, explained that she and her roommates were stressed out and needed a place to escape for the weekend. I, of course, was delighted to provide the place. They said there had hardly been a weekend or even a day when they had not been completely overloaded. "So much to do and so little time" was their comment as they talked of schedules, commitments, expectations, pressures, and even some anxieties about dates, deadlines, decisions, finances, future obligations, and unlimited opportunities.<br><br>With so many wonderful opportunities, maybe you could take advantage of it all if you could stay up long enough, get up early enough, run fast enough, and live long enough. It has been said that if you're willing to burn the candle at both ends, you might get by, but only if the candle is long enough.<br><br>We all seem to be looking for ways to do more faster. Nowadays we can watch one TV show while we tape another and fast forward to eliminate the commercials. We read condensed books and eat fast foods. Some would have us believe that the more appointments we have in our day planner, the more successful we are. The plague of our day is the thought repeating in our minds like the steady ticking of a clock: "I do not have time. I do not have time." And yet we have all there is.<br><br>Today we read of stress management, the Epstein-Barr Syndrome, overload, and over-exhaustion. In an effort to escape some of the pressures of our day, we see an increased consumption of alcohol, the improper use of prescription drugs, other related social ills, immorality, and even suicide. And yet never before has there been such evidence of increased knowledge and expanding opportunities. It has been said that "We have exploded into a free-wheeling multiple-option society" (John Naisbitt,<i>Megatrends</i>(New York: Warner Books, 1982), introduction, p. xxiii). We are faced with the burden of too many choices. I have discovered that even the purchase of a simple tube of toothpaste poses many options considering brand, flavor, size, cost, ingredients, and promises. We speak of high tech and high touch, hardware and software, and find we need increasing self-reliance as the options multiply at an accelerated pace.<br><br>William James, the noted American psychologist and philosopher, states:<br><br><i>Neither the nature nor the amount of our work is accountable for the frequency and severity of our breakdowns, but their cause lies rather in those absurd feelings of hurry and having no time, in that breathlessness and tension; that anxiety . . . , that lack of inner harmony and ease.</i>[Quoted by William Osler in<i>A Way of Life</i>(New York: P. B. Hoeber, 1937), p. 30]<br><br>Too often we allow ourselves to be driven from one deadline, activity, or opportunity to the next. We check events off our calendar and think, "After this week things will let up" or "After this semester" or "After graduation, then the pressure will ease." We live with false expectations. Unless we learn to take control of the present, we will always live in anticipation of better days in the future. And when those days arrive, we shall still be looking ahead, making it difficult to enjoy the here and now. The beautiful fall leaves come and go, and in our busyness we miss them. "Give another season, we'll do better," we say.<br><br>We live in a time when we can do more, have more, see more, accumulate more, and want more than in any time ever known. The adversary would keep us busily engaged in a multitude of trivial things in an effort to keep us distracted from the few vital things that make all of the difference.<br><br>When we take control of our lives, we refuse to give up what we want most, even if it means giving up some of what we want now. Former president Jeffrey R. Holland reminded students to "postpone your gratification so you don't have to postpone your graduation" (Jeffrey R. Holland, "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/jeffrey-r-and-patricia-t-holland_inconvenient-messiah/">The Inconvenient Messiah</a>," in<i>BYU Speeches, 1981–82</i>, p. 82). And how is this to be accomplished?<br><br>I believe the most destructive threat of our day is not nuclear war, not famine, not economic disaster, but rather the despair, the discouragement, the despondency, the defeat caused by the discrepancy between what we believe to be right and how we live our lives. Much of the emotional and social illness of our day is caused when people think one way and act another. The turmoil inside is destructive to the Spirit and to the emotional well-being of one who tries to live without clearly defined principles, values, standards, and goals.<br><br>Principles are mingled with a sense of values. They magnify each other. Striving to live the good life is dependent upon values to measure our progress as we learn to like and dislike what we ought to. We learn to be honest by habit, as a matter of course. The question shouldn't be "What will people think?" but "What will I think of myself?" We must have our own clearly defined values burning brightly within. Values provide an inner court to which we can appeal for judgment of our performance and our choices.<br><br>We live in a time when too often success is determined by the things we gather, accumulate, collect, measure, and even compare in relation to what others gather, accumulate, collect, measure, and compare. This pattern of living invites its own consequences and built-in stress. Maybe you heard of the woman who received a call from her banker explaining that she was overdrawn, to which she promptly replied, "No, sir, I am not overdrawn. My husband may have under-deposited, but I am not overdrawn."<br><br>It is possible that we try to overdraw from our time bank and suffer the nagging and debilitating stress of bankruptcy. The difference, however, is more significant than our money bank. Only twenty-four hours a day is deposited for an indefinite period of time. No more and no less.<br><br>It is as we learn to simplify and reduce, prioritize and cut back on the excesses that we have enough time and money for the essentials, for all that we ultimately want in the end and even more.<br><h2><b>The Value of Careful Pruning</b></h2><br>This fall some friends came to our home with their children and brought with them a case of the most beautiful, large peaches I have ever seen. They were almost unbelievable in their size, their beauty, and their flavor. Brother Pitt explained that they had just won first prize at the county fair for their peaches, and they had an orchard full of them. I asked how you produce such remarkable fruit, and the family was eager to explain. "We learned how to prune the peach trees and thin the weak fruit," they said. "It's hard work and must be done regularly."<br><br>"We also learned what happens when you don't prune," said one of the children. Their father had wisely suggested that three trees in the orchard be left to grow without the harsh results of the pruning knife. They explained to me that the fruit from these trees was not only very small in size but did not have the sweet taste of the other fruit. The lesson was obvious. There was no question in their minds about the far-reaching value of careful pruning.<br><br>In an article in<i>BYU Today</i>entitled "Misplaced Pride" by McKinley Tabor, speaking at an ethics conference for the Marriott School of Management, he shared his feelings. Reflecting back regretfully on some misplaced priorities, he said,<br><br><i>I was aggressive in wanting to own things, in wanting to make a lot of money, in wanting to be the big duck in a little pond. Now I focus on things like my children, on my family life in general, on experiencing things instead of owning things. I like to go places and see new things and meet new people where before I liked to own cars and have big bank accounts. The things that are important to me now are things that stay with you a lot longer than a dollar bill.</i>[McKinley Tabor, "Misplaced Pride,"<i>BYU Today,</i>July 1989, pp. 17–19]<br><br>In the book<i>The Star Thrower,</i>Loren Eiseley writes of the beaches of Costabel and tells how the tourists and professional shell collectors, with a kind of greedy madness, begin early in the morning in their attempts to outrun their less-aggressive neighbors as they gather, collect, and compete. After a storm, people are seen hurrying along with bundles, gathering starfish in their sacks. Following one such episode, the writer says:<br><br><i>I met the star thrower. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . He was gazing fixedly at something in the sand.</i><br><br><i>Eventually he stooped and flung the object beyond the breaking surf. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . "Do you collect?"</i>[I asked.]<br><br><i>"Only like this," he said softly. . . . "And only for the living." He stooped again, oblivious of my curiosity, and skipped another star neatly across the water.</i><br><br><i>"The stars," he said, "throw well. One can help them." . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . For a moment, in the changing light, the sower appeared magnified, as though casting larger stars upon some greater sea. He had, at any rate, the posture of a god. . . .</i><br><br><i>I picked</i>[up]<i>and flung</i>[a]<i>star. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . I could have thrown in a frenzy of joy, but I set my shoulders and cast, as the thrower in the rainbow cast, slowly, deliberately, and well. The task was not to be assumed lightly, for it was men as well as starfish that we sought to save.</i>[Loren Eiseley,<i>The Star Thrower</i>(New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1978), pp. 171–72, 184]<br><br>While gatherers carry bags weighed down with the accumulation of their possessions, star throwers find their joy in picking up those who would otherwise die on the sandy beach.<br><br>Like the Star Thrower, often those who have nothing visible to show for their labors are those individuals who are filled, rewarded, and energized by a labor that invigorates, motivates, inspires, and has a purpose of such far-reaching significance that they are driven by a power beyond themselves. This power is most often felt when we are in the service of our fellow beings, for in that service, as King Benjamin taught, we are in the service of our God (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.17?lang=eng#16">Mosiah 2:17</a>).<br><br>We read about the pioneers who, in the early history of the Church, left their possessions, "their things," and headed west. Those who were with the handcart company who would push or pull their carts into the wilderness would give much thought to what they would make room for in their wagons and what they would be willing to leave behind. Even after the journey began, some things had to be unloaded along the way for people to reach their destination.<br><br>In our season of abundance and excess, even while we are counseled to reduce and simplify, there will be a high level of frustration until we understand the value of pruning. When someone asks the question, "How do you do it all?" our answer should be, "We don't." We must be willing to let go of many things but defend with our lives the essentials.<br><br>Now I believe it would be very easy for an inexperienced gardener to approach the task of reducing and cutting back with such vigor that he might take a saw and cut the tree down the center, through the trunk, and into the roots. Surely it would be cut back, but what of the hope for the fruit? Wise pruning, like good gardening, takes careful thought. It is only when you are clear in your mind concerning your values that you are free to simplify and reduce without putting at risk what matters most. Until we determine what is of greatest worth, we are caught up in the unrealistic idea that everything is possible.<br><br>Thomas Griffith, a contributing editor for<i>Time</i>magazine, once summarized the problem this way. Describing himself as a young man, he said,<br><br><i>I thought myself happy at the time, my head full of every popular song that came along, the future before me. I could be an artist, a great novelist, an architect, a senator, a singer; having no demonstrable capacity for any of these pursuits made them all appear equally possible to me. All that mattered, I felt, was my inclination; I saw life as a set of free choices. Only later did it occur to me that every road taken is another untaken</i>,<i>every choice a narrowing. A sadder maturity convinces me that, as in a chess game, every move helps commit one to the next, and each person's situation at a given moment is the sum of the moves he has made before.</i>[Thomas Griffith,<i>The Waist-High Culture</i>(New York: Harper and Brothers, 1949), p. 17]<br><h2><b>Focusing on the Real Essentials</b></h2><br>When we decide what is essential, we are released from the gripping position of doubtful indecision and confusion. It is while a person stands undecided, uncommitted, uncovenanted, with choices waiting to be made, that the vulnerability of every wind that blows becomes life threatening. Uncertainty, the thief of time and commitment, breeds vacillation and confusion.<br><br>When our choices and decisions are focused on the accumulation of visible possessions and valuable materials, we may find that the acquisition of these things feeds an insatiable appetite and leaves us increasingly hungry. In 2 Nephi the Lord warns us:<br><br><i>Wherefore, do not spend money for that which is of no worth, nor your labor for that which cannot satisfy. Hearken diligently unto me, and remember the words which I have spoken; and come unto the Holy One of Israel, and feast upon that which perisheth not, neither can be corrupted, and let your soul delight in fatness.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.51?lang=eng#p50">2 Nephi 9:51</a>]<br><br>When our time is spent in the accumulation of experiences that nourish the spirit, we see with different glasses things that others do not see and cannot understand.<br><br>In the book<i>The Little Prince,</i>by Antoine de Saint-Exupery, we read about the importance of values and relationships. The fox says to the Little Prince, "It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye" (Antoine de Saint-Exupery,<i>The Little Prince</i>[New York: Harcourt, Brace and World, 1943], p. 70).<br><br>One of the great examples of acquiring invisible possessions of priceless value comes from the dramatic story told of Zion's Camp. The Missouri Saints were expelled from Jackson County in late November 1833. Four months and twelve days later, 24 February 1834, Joseph Smith was instructed to organize an army to restore the Saints to their rightful ownership of land in Jackson County. The group would march 1,000 miles in four months. They would suffer sickness, deprivation, and severe testing of every physical kind.<br><br>Heber C. Kimball said, "I took leave of my wife and children and friends, not knowing whether I would see them again in the flesh." It was not unusual for them to march thirty-five miles a day, despite blistered feet, oppressive heat, heavy rains, high humidity, hunger, and thirst. Armed guards were posted around the camp at night. At 4:00 a.m. the trumpeter roused the weary men with reveille on an old, battered French horn. Zion's Camp failed to help the Missouri Saints regain their lands and was marred by some dissension, apostasy, and unfavorable publicity, but a number of positive results came from the journey. Zion's Camp chastened, polished, and spiritually refined many of the Lord's servants. When a skeptic asked what he had gained from his journey, Brigham Young promptly replied, "I would not exchange the knowledge I have received this season for the whole of Geauga County" ("Church History in the Fulness of Times," prepared by the Church Educational System, Salt Lake City, Utah, pp. 143–51).<br><br>From among the members of Zion's Camp the Lord selected those who would lead his church during the next five decades. From the viewpoint of preparation, the Zion's Camp experiences proved to be of infinite value during the formative years of the Church. Those Saints were tried and tested. They learned what they stood for, what they were willing to live and die for, and what was of highest value.<br><br>Today our tests are different. We are not called to load our wagons and head west. Our frontier and wilderness are of a different nature, but we too must decide what we will make room for in our wagons and what is of highest value.<br><br>In recent months the Museum of Church History and Art has opened a new exhibit entitled "A Covenant Restored." As you enter, you begin to remember in a new way the price paid by those who came before us. Standing at the edge of a very rough-hewn log cabin, you feel something of the commitment and sacrifice those early Saints made. Erected immediately next to this very humble dwelling, where life was sustained by men and women with values, commitments, and covenants, we see a replica in actual size of the beautiful window of the historic Kirtland Temple.<br><br>As you move along the path through the museum, you are emotionally drawn from Kirtland on through the experiences that finally brought the Saints to the valley of the Great Salt Lake. At one point you see the temple as the center of everything that drove them through these incredible circumstances, and something happens inside. I pondered in ways that I haven't before the significance of the temple in their lives and ours.<br><br>I stood at the side of a handcart and wondered, "How did the family decide what they would make room for in their wagons?" And what will we make room for in our wagons? What is of greatest importance in life?<br><br>One year as I was driving myself and my niece Shelly, who was then seven years old, back from a trip to Vernon, British Columbia, I had an experience that has helped me as I try to improve my ability to prune wisely and to load or unload my wagon, as the case may be.<br><br>During the trip when we were not playing the tape "Winnie the Pooh" for the hundredth time, Shelly would be asleep in the backseat of the car, and I had many hours and many miles to weigh, compare, and wonder. I had gone to Canada to take care of my sister's family of nine children while she was in the hospital with her tenth baby. After a week of doing laundry, matching socks, tending to paper routes, meals, lessons, car pooling, bedtime stories, lunch money, settling disputes over time spent in the bathroom, finding shoes, and planning for family home evening, I felt overwhelmed to say the least. At the appointed time my sister returned with a babe in arms. I stood in awe and reverence as I watched her step back into that routine with the ease and harmony of a conductor leading a well-trained orchestra with each player coming in on cue. It was a miracle to me.<br><br>As I thought of her life and mine, I began measuring what I was not doing in comparison to what she was doing. We do that, you know. I began wondering and feeling discouraged, despondent, even depressed.<br><br>At that moment, somewhere between the Canadian border and Spokane, my father's voice came into my mind. He had passed away two years before, but his voice was as clear as though he were sitting by my side. "My dear," he said, "don't worry about the little things. The big things you agreed to before you came." And for the rest of the journey, between moments of listening to "Winnie the Pooh," I asked myself over and over again, "What are the big things in life? What is essential? What is the purpose of life?" I share this experience with you, my brothers and sisters, because I believe there are times when these same questions weigh heavily on your mind.<br><br>The years have passed since that experience, and Shelly has traded Winnie the Pooh for the more important things. She has just recently received her mission call to New Zealand. She is now willing to leave important things behind, including ballroom dancing, which for Shelly borders on being essential, to go forth and teach the real essentials, the gospel of Jesus Christ. Elder John A. Widtsoe wrote:<br><br><i>In our pre-existent state, in the day of the great council, we made a certain agreement with the Almighty. The Lord proposed a plan, conceived by him. We accepted it. Since the plan is intended for all men, we become parties to the salvation of every person under that plan. We agreed, right then and there, to be not only saviors for ourselves, but measurably saviors for the whole human family. We went into a partnership with the Lord.</i><br><br><i>The working out of the plan became then not merely the Father's work, and the Savior's work, but also our work. The least of us, the humblest, is in partnership with the Almighty in achieving the purpose of the eternal plan of salvation. That places us in a very responsible attitude towards the human race.</i><br><br>Like the Star Thrower, it is in helping to save others that we find our pleasure and joy, our labor, and ultimately our glory. Elder Widtsoe further states:<br><br><i>If the Lord's concern is chiefly to bring happiness and joy, salvation, to the whole human family, we cannot become like the Father unless we too engage in that work. There is no chance for the narrow, selfish, introspective man in the kingdom of God. He may survive in the world of men; he may win fame, fortune and power before men, but he will not stand high before the Lord unless he learns to do the works of God, which always points toward the salvation of the whole human family.</i>[<i>Utah Genealogical and Historical Magazine,</i>October 1943, p. 289]<br><br>Our understanding of and commitment to the covenants we have made with God are the essentials. Our day-to-day interactions, our integrity, our moral conduct, our willingness to "bear one another's burdens, that they may be light; . . . to mourn with those that mourn; . . . and comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.8-9?lang=eng#p7">Mosiah 18:8–9</a>) are at the very heart of our earth-life experience. Every decision should be made with that goal in mind, and we should expect it to be difficult, very difficult. We are to be tried and tested in all things (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/136.31?lang=eng#p30">D&amp;amp;C 136:31</a>).<br><h2><b>Seeing Things from an Eternal Perspective</b></h2><br>Some time ago, my husband and I visited the Mormon cemetery at Winter Quarters, a monument to family members young and old buried in graves along the trail as their families continued westward toward the Rocky Mountains. Of those people who had vision and faith in God, we read,<br><br><i>There are times and places in the life of every individual, every people, and every nation when great spiritual heights are reached, when courage becomes a living thing . . . when faith in God stands as the granite mountain wall, firm and immovable. . . . Winter Quarters was such a time and place for the Mormon people.</i>[Heber J. Grant, remarks at the dedication of the Winter Quarters Monument, 1936]<br><br>A person who only looks for the visible may draw from this pioneer experience what appears to be an obvious conclusion--families perished. But in the eternal perspective, they did not. It was their willingness to sacrifice everything, even life if necessary, that would ensure the eternal lives of these families.<br><br>And what of our Winter Quarters and Zion's Camp experiences? Times of difficulty try the faith of all who profess to be Latter-day Saints and follow the prophets. We are walking in the well-worn paths of those who preceded us in the quest for Zion. Help and comfort are available to us through sources beyond our own immediate strength, just as they were for those who have gone before us.<br><br>It has been said that trials are at the core of saintliness. Through our covenant relationship with Jesus Christ, we do all that we can do, and by the grace of God he does the rest.<br><br>The Lord has promised us,<br><br><i>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</i><br><br><i>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</i><br><br><i>For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/11.28-30?lang=eng#p27">Matthew 11:28–30</a>]<br><br>One of the early pioneers testified,<br><br><i>I have pulled my handcart when I was so weak and weary from illness and lack of food that I could hardly put one foot ahead of the other. I have looked ahead and seen a patch of sand or a hillslope, and I have said, "I can go only that far and there I must give up for I cannot pull the load through it." . . . I have gone on to that sand and when I reached it, the cart began pushing me. I have looked back many times to see who was pushing my cart, but my eyes saw no one. I knew then that the angels of God were there.</i>[<i>Relief Society Magazine,</i>January 1948, p. 8, as quoted in James E. Faust, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1979/04/the-refiners-fire?lang=eng">The Refiner's Fire</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1979, p. 53]<br><br>It is with faith in God that we must condition ourselves to let go of everything if necessary. For some of us it may require unloading bad habits, attitudes, disobedience, arrogance, selfishness, and pride.<br><br>Just this summer our family came in possession of the first letter written to my grandmother by her mother when my grandmother left her home in England as a young immigrant. She left everything behind because someone taught her of the gospel of Jesus Christ. She joined the Saints in America and eventually moved to Canada. For fear of being persuaded to remain in England, she did not tell her family of her conversion to the Church or her plans to leave until after. That first letter received from her mother reads in part:<br><br><i>My dearest daughter. . . whatever on earth has caused you to go out of your own country and away from all your friends, I cannot imagine. You say, "Don't fret." How do you think I can help it when such a blow as that come to struck me all up in a heap? You say you are happy, but I can't think it, for I am sure I could not have been happy to have gone into a foreign country and left you behind. You say you will come again, but I don't think you will hesitate your life over the deep waters again. When I think about it, I feel wretched. You had a good place and a good home to come to whenever you liked. And I must say that I loved the very ground you walked upon, and now I am left to fret in this world. But still, all the same for that, I wish you good luck and hope the Lord will prosper you in every way. I remain, your loving Mother.</i>[Personal Files]<br><br>They never saw each other again in this earth life. And none of her family joined the Church. However, their temple work has been done for them.<br><br>What is it that drives a people to sacrifice all if necessary to receive the blessings available only in the temple? It is their faith and a spiritual witness of the importance of our covenants with God and our immense possibilities. It is in the temple, the house of the Lord, that we participate in ordinances and covenants that span the distance between heaven and earth and prepare us to return to God's presence and enjoy the blessings of eternal families and eternal life.<br><br>A few weeks after my visit to the Kirtland Temple, I was standing at the water's edge of the baptismal font in the small Manila Temple in the Philippines. Many of those dear Saints had traveled for three days in the heat and humidity by boat to come and participate in sacred ordinances available only in the temple. On one of these islands in a small, primitive nipa hut, I visited with a family of Latter-day Saints. A beautiful young fourteen year old in this humble setting listened intently while her father explained that in 1991, by saving all they could, the family would have enough to go to the Manila Temple, where they could be sealed as a family forever.<br><br>When we understand that our covenants with God are essential to our eternal life, these sacred promises become the driving force that helps us lighten our load, prioritize our activities, eliminate the excesses, accelerate our progress, and reduce the distractions that could, if not guarded, get us mired down in mud while other wagons move on. If any of you are burdened with sin and sorrow, transgression and guilt, then unload your wagon and fill it with obedience, faith, and hope, and a regular renewal of your covenants with God.<br><br>President Kimball reminded us, "Since immortality and eternal life constitute the sole purpose of life, all other interests and activities are but incidental thereto" (Spencer W. Kimball,<i>The Miracle of Forgiveness</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1969], p. 2).<br><br>Does that suggest that there should be no football, fashion, fancy food, or fun? Of course not. But these things are incidental to the real purpose of our earth life. Our purpose in life provides the compass and keeps us on course while we enjoy the journey. If we are found to be long faced, sober, and sanctimonious, we will be guilty of portraying a false image of the joys of the gospel. As the pioneers traveled, there was singing and dancing. In their camaraderie, a covenant people built a community with a strong sense of brotherhood and sisterhood. People with common values and goals strengthened one another in joy and sorrow, in sickness and health. They sustained one another as they prepared to make and keep sacred covenants.<br><br>There is a unique strength that comes when a group of faithful Saints, however large or small, band together and encourage each other in righteousness.<br><br>As we take an inventory of the things we are carrying in our wagons and make decisions about what we will be willing to leave behind and what we will cling to, we have guidance. The Lord has given us a great promise to which I bear my testimony. He has said,<br><br><i>Therefore, if you will ask of me you shall receive; if you will knock it shall be opened unto you.</i><br><br><i>Seek to bring forth and establish my Zion. Keep my commandments in all things.</i><br><br><i>And, if you keep my commandments and endure to the end you shall have eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/14.5,6,7?lang=eng#4">D&amp;amp;C 14:5–7</a>]<br><br>We live in a time when the things of the world would, if possible, press in upon us and close out the things of God. May we turn our attention from the glitter of the world as we give thanks for the glory of the gospel, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Ardeth G.
