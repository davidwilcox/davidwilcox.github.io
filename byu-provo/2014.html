<h1>Do Some of the Things We Do” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<b>SGS:</b>Good morning! We add our voice of welcome to all of you at the beginning of a new year and new winter semester. While it is chilly outside, you exude a warmth that is both pleasant and encouraging. We join you in looking forward to an exciting and productive experience as we push forward to make 2014 one of our best years ever.<br><br>Two years ago, in the devotional that began the 2012 winter semester, we spoke to the theme of things that we appreciate most about BYU. Some may recall that we mentioned our Mission and Aims statements, our Honor Code, and our opportunities to attend devotionals and to speak freely about our faith and testimonies. We do not plan to repeat that message today but have chosen to discuss a similar, but different, topic: the reason we do some of the things we do at BYU. We intend our focus to reach far beyond the local culture and environment that we on campus experience and enjoy.<br><br><b>COS:</b>In the October 1999 general conference priesthood session, President Gordon B. Hinckley, then our prophet and chairman of the BYU Board of Trustees, gave an interesting address concerning some of the things our sponsoring Church does and why they are done. At that time Sharon and I were not at BYU and had absolutely no inkling that I would have the assignment that has occupied us these last several years. Because he was the president of the Church and also because I occasionally wondered about some of these things myself, I was particularly interested in the matters he might choose to address in the limited time remaining in that great priesthood gathering.<br><br>Before speaking to any specific topics, President Hinckley's prefatory comments included the following:<br><br><i>Our great mission is to testify of</i>[Jesus Christ's]<i>living reality. We should not be involved with anything not in harmony with this major objective. We should be involved with whatever is in harmony with this objective.</i>["Why We Do Some of the Things We Do,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1999, 52]<br><br>He then went on to address this question: Why does the Church sponsor BYU? (See "Why We Do," 52.)<br><br>We wish our time this morning would allow us to repeat all he said on that occasion. His impressive message is widely available electronically and in print, and I commend its careful reading and study to all who have an interest in this great institution of BYU specifically and in Church education generally.<br><br>President Hinckley began by declaring that the Church's support for education has a doctrinal root in the Doctrine and Covenants.<br><br><b>SGS:</b>Then he quoted these important verses from Doctrine and Covenants 88:78–80:<br><br><i>Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand;</i><br><br><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms--</i><br><br><i>That ye may be prepared in all things when I shall send you again to magnify the calling whereunto I have called you, and the mission with which I have commissioned you.</i><br><br><b>COS:</b>President Hinckley lamented that because of the great expense related to BYU and other Church educational efforts, it is not possible to serve all those who would like and deserve this great learning experience. He said the Church would try to make it available to as many as possible through BYU, our other schools, institutes of religion, and seminaries. He mentioned how grateful all who are here should be as well as his disappointment with the occasional person who complains or does not seem to appreciate the unique opportunity to be at BYU.<br><br><b>SGS:</b>President Hinckley then went on to say the following:<br><br><i>Moreover, the university has brought much favorable notice to the Church. Its sponsoring organization, the Church, is widely recognized. It has become known for standards and ideals which have been written about and talked about and which have let the world know of those things in which we believe. Its academic programs and its athletic programs have both brought honor to the university and the Church. And as generations of students move through its halls and on to graduation and then out across the world, they will bring honor to their alma mater and its sponsor, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</i>["Why We Do," 52–53]<br><br><b>COS:</b>President Hinckley made further comments and assurances about BYU and Church education generally before moving on to other important topics, but it is very clear how our prophet leaders think about BYU. We feel it appropriate that we should express some pleasure and comfort about this remarkable support and reassurance, but we also hope all at BYU feel the tremendous responsibility this entails for everyone so associated with Brigham Young University. With that heavy but blessed burden in mind, let us now delve into a few of the reasons that we at BYU do some of the things we do.<br><br><b>SGS:</b>First, let us mention you students. After all, it would be a very difficult proposition to make the case for having a university without students. We are aware that at some places and at some times, it may seem to those studying that they are viewed as a necessary nuisance rather than a fundamental reason for the establishment of a university. Should that ever be the case, please read and carefully consider those verses from section 88 that President Hinckley quoted and that we have repeated today. For BYU to be the best it can be, the students who study here and represent the university in so many ways must also strive to be the best they can be.<br><br><b>COS:</b>All of you students have been very carefully selected. Your excellence in academic achievement and potential are widely understood--and at least as important in our admissions considerations is your "fit" for BYU, meaning your willingness and capacity to meet and follow the mission and aims of a BYU education. Our Honor Code, our commitment to service to others, and striving to be spiritually strengthened go hand in hand--all being essential for successful students at BYU. It is this inspired combination of values and attributes that reflect the now widely recognized ability of BYU graduates to serve their families, churches, communities, and nations with such effectiveness and remarkable contributions. You who come here are not perfect, nor is the admissions process perfect, nor anyone or anything else at BYU, but hopefully you and others will understand the breadth of prayerful consideration that goes into our admissions decisions and also the sadness we feel that we cannot accommodate more who would like to come and who could grow and contribute.<br><br>Second, we work very hard at continually striving to improve the quality of the university in both broad and narrow ways. In many respects, the measure of a great university is found in the caliber and attributes of its faculty. BYU has always been blessed with a devoted and committed faculty. Over our history from humble beginnings, we have had a gradual but significant strengthening of our faculty in all of its dimensions. In virtually every discipline in which we are engaged, we now have professors and colleagues who have achieved broad distinction in their endeavors while keeping their primary focus on our tremendous students. Our mentoring efforts and successes, for example, have led to national leadership among universities in placing our graduates in the most outstanding graduate and professional education programs in the United States and abroad.<br><br><b>SGS:</b>Third, we have the responsibility to become a light unto the world wherever we can. President Hinckley mentioned both our academics and athletics. In each of these areas, and in others as well, we have continued to advance, and, had we time today, we could list for you many successes and much recognition that have continued to bring acclaim to both BYU and our sponsoring Church.<br><br>By now I am sure that some of you wonder if we think our primary responsibility at BYU is to brag. Let us defend ourselves a little by sharing just two bits of homespun philosophy you may or may not recognize. First, someone once said, "If you done it, it ain't bragging." Second, Ann Landers, the former queen of etiquette, in a newspaper column said, "Bragging is not an attractive trait, but let us be honest. A man who catches a big fish does not go home through an alley" (Ann Landers nugget of the day, 20 January 1989).<br><br><b>COS:</b>We fully realize the potential conflict or confusion between what Jesus said about "let[ting] your light so shine" (Matthew 5:16) and keeping your "candle ... under a bushel" (Matthew 5:15). Our purpose today is to be clear about why we do some of the things we do at BYU and the potential impact for good that these things have not only for the Church but also for the university and for others as well.<br><br>Although there are many examples supporting the premise that we must share what we do at BYU as well as render service broadly, time allows us only a brief glimpse at a few matters. Most would be aware that we have frequent visits to campus from people of prominence who represent the best of many cultures, professions, and peoples. We invite them because of what they can teach us and help us better understand about the world around us, but we also are anxious to host them on campus because of what it is they may learn and better understand about who and what we are. Our students have the regular privilege of hearing these distinguished visitors in addresses and classroom discussions.<br><br>We also host conferences that have gained wide recognition and appeal. Just one example would be the Law and Religion Symposium that is jointly sponsored by the J. Reuben Clark Law School and our supporting Church. Here we bring distinguished legal scholars and governmental leaders who share our concerns about the importance of religious liberty throughout the world. As with many of our impressive visitors, a number of them might find it awkward to respond to an invitation to visit our Church leaders alone but feel it quite natural to come to a renowned university of quality to participate in significant learning, teaching, and sharing. This would not be possible if Brigham Young University did not have a reputation as a fine and serious academic institution.<br><br><b>SGS:</b>BYU also has a tradition of solid outreach throughout the world. For many years we have had the opportunity to send volunteer teachers to China, for example, to teach English and increase appreciation for Western thought and cooperation. Our nursing students and faculty, our engineering students and faculty, and several of our outstanding performing groups have increased friendships and cooperation all around the globe. All of these things are expensive, and all are opportunities that bring friendship, gratitude, and recognition to and an understanding of BYU and our sponsoring Church.<br><br>Likewise, we regularly have some remarkable events on campus that have a major impact locally and afar. Currently the BYU Museum of Art is hosting the<i>Sacred Gifts</i>exhibit, which displays some of the finest religious artwork of Carl Bloch, Heinrich Hofmann, and Frans Schwartz. Most of these pieces are on loan to BYU from Denmark, Sweden, and the Riverside Church in New York City. Our friends in Europe have allowed them to come because of the respect and trust enjoyed there by BYU and its museum of art. These paintings have never left Denmark before and likely never will again. We hope you will take the opportunity to see these wonderful masterpieces.<br><br><b>COS:</b>Over the decade we have been at BYU, both at home and as we have traveled, we have had many personal experiences that emphasize and clarify the point Sharon has just made. My dear, why don't you tell our friends about the remarkable trip we took to Rome, Italy, with Noel and Sydney Reynolds and Christian Heal soon after we arrived at BYU in 2003?<br><br><b>SGS:</b>Although we had been to Rome a couple of times before, we were very excited to have a unique experience with these colleagues because we had been invited to the Vatican Library by Catholic leaders to discuss a cooperative venture regarding the preservation and translation of ancient Syriac texts that the Vatican Library possesses. We were treated cordially and respectfully as details of our continued cooperation with the library were discussed. Never before had we understood to this degree how important the substantial and serious scholarship going on at BYU is in making friends and having a positive influence for the university and the Church throughout the world. We are pleased that this special project continues and also several others that could equally be mentioned. Even though most of our students might not be fully aware of such activities, they are extremely important and valuable in the broader work and initiatives of Brigham Young University.<br><br><b>COS:</b>For many years the Division of Continuing Education at BYU has blessed thousands of lives by providing courses and instruction, increasingly online, for those living far from campus.<br><br>As another example, an increasingly significant part of our educational outreach activities is found in the various venues of BYU Broadcasting. Through the combined efforts of BYUtv, KBYU, BYU Radio, BYUtv International, and our 24/7 Internet streaming around the world, we are reaching millions of people. In the United States alone BYUtv is now in about 50 million households. In 2009 BYUtv was found in only one Nielsen rating measurable market. In 2013 that figure had risen to forty-six of the major markets in the USA.<br><br>Before we say more about what we are doing with BYU Broadcasting, let us return to the words of President Hinckley in the 1999 address we mentioned at the beginning of our remarks today. As he spoke of our sponsoring Church, President Hinckley reminded us that "it is concerned primarily with worship of the Lord Jesus Christ" ("Why We Do," 52). Therefore, all that we do ultimately must be in harmony with that key objective and responsibility. That is why in 2009 our BYU Broadcasting efforts adopted the slogan of "Seeing the Good in the World." When you read the words of the Savior in Matthew 5, you will see the roots of that phrasing.<br><br><b>SGS:</b>Now, how is that to be accomplished? Many of you know that I am an avid BYU sports fan. While we both attend as many sporting events, lectures, and musical and dramatic presentations as we can, we are extremely grateful that we can follow many of these events on BYUtv when we cannot personally be in attendance. In this we are not unique. We know of those who have tuned into one of our television or radio stations to watch or listen to a sporting event and have stayed tuned to other programming because they really do want to "see the good in the world."<br><br>Programs like<i>Granite Flats, Studio C, American Ride, The Story Trek,</i>and others have a large following among our BYU and Church communities, but they have also attracted many not of our faith because of the wholesome quality of these programs. Let's listen to what a few have had to say about their BYUtv experiences.<br><br><b>[Some short video clips were shown.]</b><br><br><b>COS:</b>Several years ago the Church Missionary Department developed a strategy that we have borrowed and refined at BYUtv. While surveys of various kinds have demonstrated that people describe their desire for the increased availability of wholesome and educational television programming, it is clear from viewing patterns that the primary motivation for choosing a particular program or event is to be entertained. Thus you see in our programming that we do seek to have high-quality entertainment that is uplifting and clean but also that tends first to engage and then enlighten the viewers. It is common for people to become aware of our devotionals, general conference sessions, and Mormon Tabernacle Choir broadcasts, as well as scripture roundtables and other Church-sponsored events, while simply, at least initially, seeking just to be entertained.<br><br><b>SGS:</b>Likewise, many good people have been introduced to wonderful, uplifting programming attractive to people of many faiths by shows such as<i>Fires of Faith, Silent Night,</i>and the upcoming production on Handel's<i>Messiah</i>that will premiere later this year. Let's view just a couple of brief clips from these programs that have gained national acclaim and attention.<br><br><b>[Some short video clips were shown.]</b><br><br><b>COS:</b>Hopefully this brief account of why we do some of the things we do at BYU will increase both understanding of and appreciation for the opportunities and responsibilities we have as members of the Brigham Young University community. We wish we could share many more examples, and we encourage you to think of those you have observed that have contributed so broadly.<br><br>BYU is a great institution established by the Lord's prophets to fulfill sacred purposes. It is prospered under the hand of heaven. We can never adequately express our appreciation for being associated with BYU and hope you sense the same feeling.<br><br>We know God lives and that Jesus is the Christ. We, like you, feel honored and blessed to have the privilege of being involved in this great work. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O. Samuelson was president of Brigham Young University when he and his wife, Sharon G. Samuelson, gave this devotional on 7 January 2014.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>an Not unto Thine Own Understanding&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I couldn't be more thrilled to have received this assignment to come to Provo--to Brigham Young University to speak at your weekly devotional. As you have just heard, I am Bishop Stevenson. It was just about twenty months ago in general conference that I was sustained with Bishop Gérald Caussé and Bishop Dean M. Davies as the Presiding Bishopric. For several years previous to that our family lived in Japan, where we presided over the Nagoya Mission, followed by service in the Asia North Area Presidency.<br><br>Since we were sustained, a question that is often asked of me is "What does the Presiding Bishopric do?" I too had the same question. Charles W. Nibley was the Presiding Bishop of the Church from 1907 to 1925. He later became a member of the First Presidency. He described the Presiding Bishopric duties as follows: The Presiding Bishop helps take care of the business and administration of the Church so that the First Presidency can focus on more important spiritual matters. I think this is a good description of what we do. Under the direction of the First Presidency we look over the construction and care of meetinghouses and facilities throughout the world and oversee the Welfare Department--which includes bishops' storehouses, Deseret Industries, and LDS Family Services. We also participate in the administration of humanitarian funds, which bless many of our Heavenly Father's children around the world afflicted by natural disasters or catastrophes.<br><br>As the First Presidency announces new temples, they look to us to oversee the construction of them. We also see that scriptures and other materials are translated properly and distributed throughout the world. One of our great blessings is to meet with the First Presidency each Friday morning--a meeting that has been held for over one hundred years, I am told. I can bear a personal witness to each of you that President Thomas S. Monson, President Henry B. Eyring, and President Dieter F. Uchtdorf love each one of you. I testify that they are living prophets and that President Monson possesses and is authorized to exercise all priesthood keys.<br><br>BYU--what a beautiful place to receive an education. One of the most unforgettable and stunning sights seen on national TV comes each time network television cameras covering Cougar football games pan from Cougar Stadium to the majestic backdrop to the east--to the Wasatch Mountains and to Mount Timpanogos. Not only is this a beautiful place, but BYU has special meaning to my family as well, as my parents met, courted, and married while they were students here.<br><br>What remarkable circumstances led to the establishment of this historic institution. The pedigree of institutional leadership is very impressive. I personally recall the tenure of past presidents beginning in the seventies: President Ernest L. Wilkinson, Elder Dallin H. Oaks, Elder Jeffrey R. Holland, President Rex E. Lee, Elder Merrill J. Bateman, and now President Cecil O. Samuelson.<sup>1</sup> I am deeply impressed with the leadership and vision of President Samuelson and his very capable team, and I treasure my association with him, which started many years ago.<br><br>Late nights, early mornings, in between classes and work--my memory informs me that much of my life as a university student revolved around the library. Even now it evokes a plethora of memories--some fond, others not so fond. For me it was the library at Utah State University. Each time I entered, I was greeted by a sign over the entry that read, "And with all thy getting get understanding."<sup>2</sup> We all know that recall follows repetition. I therefore have this scripture from the book of Proverbs engraved indelibly in my mind, having read it each time I entered the library during my four years of undergraduate work.<br><br>This morning I offer the same exhortation to each of you: "And with all thy getting get understanding." I also invite you to think about its meaning and how it might benefit you. I have done so. I have turned this over in my mind time and time again, and my interpretation of the meaning has evolved considerably. Perhaps you can benefit from my observations.<br><br>As a young missionary in Japan struggling to learn a very difficult language, I heard some vocabulary words early and often. Greetings such as <i>ohayo gozaimasu</i> or <i>konnichiwa</i> were two of these. Another was <i>wakarimasen,</i> which means, "I don't understand." This word, along with a side-to-side hand expression, seems to be a favorite response from Japanese contacts, directed to young missionaries as they attempt to strike up conversations. Initially, as I reflected on the meaning of "and with all thy getting get understanding," I thought of understanding more in terms of this type of comprehension--what I might hear with my ears and understand in my mind. I thought of the Japanese saying, "Wakarimasen": Do I understand or not understand? "And with all thy getting get understanding"--or make certain to obtain a higher level of comprehension. However, as I have studied and observed the use of the word <i>understanding</i> in the scriptures or from the words of living prophets, I have come to realize a deeper meaning. Consider these words from Elder Robert D. Hales when he was the Presiding Bishop:<br><br><i>First, we start with the intelligence with which we were born. To our intelligence we add knowledge as we search for answers, study, and educate ourselves. To our knowledge we add experience, which should lead us to a level of wisdom. In addition to our wisdom, we add the help of the Holy Ghost through our prayers of faith, asking for spiritual guidance and strength. Then, and only then, do we reach an <b>understanding</b> in our hearts--which motivates us to "do what is right; let the consequence follow. </i>" (Hymns, <i>1985, no. 237.) The feelings of an <b>understanding</b> heart give us the sweet spirit of assurance of not only knowing but doing what is right no matter what the circumstances. The <b>understanding</b> in our hearts comes from a close interdependence of study and prayer.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>Now consider again: "And with all thy getting get understanding." Understanding in this context follows intelligence, knowledge, experience, wisdom, and promptings from the Holy Ghost--all of which lead us to understanding or to know and do what is right.<br><br>Most of you seated here today are approaching or have entered a critical intersection or crossroads in your life. You are becoming more independent with each year of your life that passes, and you are moving deeper into the "and with all thy getting" phase of your life. What is it that you are going to be getting? It may be getting a husband or a wife, your own family, a car, a job, a salary, a house, and a mortgage, to name a few. In order to manage these very important things that we "get," one must also obtain "understanding," as the scripture teaches. This understanding comes through <i>an interdependence of study and prayer.</i> Said another way, one must have trust or reliance upon the Lord. Alma described this when he likened the word unto a seed. As he stated, "It beginneth to enlighten my <i>understanding,</i> yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me."<sup>4</sup><br><br>President Monson often quotes a scripture from Proverbs that adds another dimension about this understanding: "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding."<sup>5</sup><br><br>As we trust and rely on the Lord, a greater measure of understanding comes from Him into our heart--rather than our own understanding, which comes to our head.<br><br>Let me offer an example of a powerful woman who played a key role in the Restoration, who trusted in the Lord, and who leaned not unto her own understanding.<br><br>Shortly after the Church was organized in Palmyra, New York, Lucy Mack Smith remained in Waterloo, New York, with a large group of Saints while her husband, Joseph Sr., and sons, including Joseph Jr., departed before her to Kirtland, Ohio. Her responsibility was to bring this group to Ohio when she received word from Joseph.<br><br>Well, word came in early spring 1831. Lucy, with the help of some of the brethren, began to move the group to Buffalo, New York, with the intention of making passage to Ohio by ship on Lake Erie. In her words:<br><br><i>When the brethren considered the spring sufficiently open for traveling on the water, we all began to prepare for our removal to Kirtland. We hired a boat . . . ; and . . . we numbered eighty souls.</i><br><br>And then, as they pushed off into the Erie Canal, headed to Buffalo:<br><br><i>I then called the brethren and sisters together, and reminded them that we were traveling by the commandment of the Lord, as much as Father Lehi was, when he left Jerusalem; and, if faithful, we had the same reasons to expect the blessings of God. I then desired them to be solemn, <b>and to lift their hearts to God continually in prayer,</b> that we might be prospered.</i><br><br>About halfway to Buffalo from Waterloo, passage along the canal became impossible. Conditions for the eighty Saints were uncomfortable, and murmuring began almost immediately. Lucy, relying on the Lord, had to unite their faith:<br><br><i>No, no, . . . you will not starve, brethren, nor anything of that sort; only do be patient and stop your murmuring. I have no doubt but the hand of the Lord is over us.</i><br><br>When they arrived in Buffalo on the fifth day after leaving Waterloo, the harbor leading to Lake Erie was apparently frozen solid. They took passage on a ship with Captain Blake, a man acquainted with Lucy Smith and her family. After a couple of days, although conditions on the ship were not conducive for all of them to stay while awaiting notice of departure, Lucy reported:<br><br><i>Captain Blake requested the passengers to remain on board, as he wished, from that time, to be ready to start at a moment's warning; at the same time he sent out a man to measure the depth of the ice, who, when he returned, reported that it was piled up to the height of twenty feet, and that it was his opinion that we would remain in the harbor at least two weeks longer. </i><br><br>This was devastating news to the group, as supplies were low and conditions were difficult. Lucy Mack Smith further recorded her admonition to the Saints:<br><br><i>You profess to put your trust in God, then how can you feel to murmur and complain as you do! You are even more unreasonable than the children of Israel were; for here are my sisters pining for their rocking chairs, and brethren from whom I expected firmness and energy, declare that they positively believe they shall starve to death before they get to the end of their journey. And why is it so? Have any of you lacked? . . . Where is your faith? Where is your confidence in God? Can you not realize that all things were made by him, and that he rules over the works of his own hands? And suppose that all the Saints here should lift their hearts in prayer to God, that the way might be opened before us, how easy it would be for him to cause the ice to break away, so that in a moment we could be on our journey!</i><br><br>Now, please observe here the great faith of Mother Smith--how she chose to trust in the Lord and how she asked that the Saints with her not lean unto their own understanding:<br><br><i>"Now, brethren and sisters, if you will all of you raise your desires to heaven, that the ice may be broken up, and we be set at liberty, as sure as the Lord lives, it will be done." At that instant a noise was heard, like bursting thunder. The captain cried, "Every man to his post." The ice parted, leaving barely a passage for the boat, and so narrow that as the boat passed through, the buckets of the waterwheel were torn off with a crash, which, joined to the word of command from the captain, the hoarse answering of the sailors, the noise of the ice, and the cries and confusion of the spectators, presented a scene truly terrible. We had barely passed through the avenue when the ice closed together again, and the Colesville brethren were left in Buffalo, unable to follow us.</i><br><br>As we were leaving the harbor, one of the bystanders exclaimed, "There goes the 'Mormon' company! That boat is sunk in the water nine inches deeper than ever it was before, and, mark it, she will sink--there is nothing surer." In fact, they were so sure of it that they went straight to the [news] <i>office and had it published that we were sunk, so that when we arrived at Fairport we read in the papers the news of our own death.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>"And with all thy getting get understanding," or, said another way, "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding."<sup>7</sup><br><br>I have personally observed the heartbreak and personal havoc wrought upon those whose focus is on the worldly "getting" and not on the Lord's "understanding." It seems that those who lean unto their own understanding or rely on the arm of the flesh are more likely to develop a disproportionate focus or obsession for material gain, prestige, power, and position. Keeping the "getting" in accordance with this scriptural guidance of "understanding" will temper your temporal appetite. This will allow the proper context for your activities as a student and as a productive member of society and of the Lord's kingdom.<br><br>As a young student full of aspiration, I remember listening to a respected and successful mentor suggest that one appropriately manage ambitions by following an order of "Learn, Earn, Serve." President Gordon B. Hinckley taught a pattern that leads to trusting the Lord and relying on Him rather than on ourselves. He taught:<br><br><i>Each of us has a fourfold responsibility. First, we have a responsibility to our families. Second, we have a responsibility to our employers. Third, we have a responsibility to the Lord's work. Fourth, we have a responsibility to ourselves.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>We must have a balance, if you will. President Hinckley suggested that we fulfill this fourfold responsibility through family prayer, family home evening, family scripture study, honesty and loyalty to your employer, fulfilling your Church responsibilities, personal scripture study, rest, recreation, and exercise.<br><br>Ralph Waldo Emerson said, "This time, like all times, is a very good one, if we but know what to do with it."<sup>9</sup> Fortunately, Latter-day Saints never have to look very far to know what to do. This is now your time. With your knowledge of a loving Heavenly Father and the great plan of happiness, you all have rudders deep in the water. Now, put your oars in deeply as well and pull hard and even.<br><br>In a recent talk President Monson quoted from Proverbs, as he had done before: "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths." He then said, "That has been the story of my life."<sup>10</sup> What a great life to emulate.<br><br>I have great expectations for each of you, as does the Lord. I finish where I began with the exhortation found in Proverbs: "And with all thy getting get understanding." Get real understanding. This will come to you as you realize the interdependence of study and prayer, as you maintain a commitment to serve while learning and earning, and as you lean not unto yourself but rely or trust in the Lord.<br><br>I offer my testimony of the divinity of this, the Lord's work; of Jesus Christ; and of His role as our Savior and Redeemer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Gary E. Stevenson was the Presiding Bishop of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given on 14 January 2014.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

I should start by confessing I will likely cry. I am a therapist. I can't help it; emotion is what I do. But in my defense, I bet no one on this campus looks more like Bronco Mendenhall than I do, and we all know he is very manly. Wait for the hat and the super-serious stare. Do you see what I mean? When we first moved to Utah, two of our children were walking around campus, and they saw Bronco. Our then thirteen-year-old daughter said, "Dad, you do look just like him--minus the muscles."<br><br>Notwithstanding my emotional or physical condition during this talk, please remember as I speak today that it is never about the messenger; it is about the message. I pray I can remember what Martin Luther King Jr. said to himself before his first speech at the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church: "Keep Martin Luther King in the background and God in the foreground and everything will be all right. Remember you are a channel of the gospel and not the source."<sup>1</sup><br><br>On that note, I want you to know how much I am humbled by this opportunity. I have tremendous respect for the BYU devotional experience. I have for years read, listened to, and benefited from BYU devotionals. I keep a long list of talks in a file that I give out to clients, family members, friends, and young adults like you. I have seen many times that healing, hope, and peace can come through the word of God, or, as Jacob said, "the pleasing word of God, . . . which healeth the wounded soul" (Jacob 2:8).<br><br>For that reason I felt perhaps the most helpful thing I can do is simply provide a list of resources in the endnotes of this talk. I hope these references will help you, your family, your friends, bishops, and therapists as we all try to deal with the adversities of life and find healing. I have organized the references by topic (for example, adversity, depression, anxiety, pornography, and same-gender attraction) and have listed the talks (most often BYU devotionals) that might be helpful to some reader in the future. Throughout this talk I will reference many different authors and highlight additional reading that may be helpful for those who are interested. Please take the time to read through the endnotes. I know that healing can be found as we listen to and read words of wisdom and apply the true principles found therein.<br><h2><strong>A Formula for Healing</strong></h2><br>That brings me to today's topic: healing. We all need healing. For some of us that need is great today. There are likely among us those who are brokenhearted because a relationship has ended badly. Others are in pain because their parents have decided to divorce or a loved one has renounced the Church. Some have learned recently that they have a chronic illness, and others have just relapsed into addictive behavior for what seems like the hundredth time. I would guess that there are some today who have wondered if depression or anxiety will always be a suffocating influence in their lives, while other students are going through a loss that seems both unfair and unrelenting. Others are drowning in loneliness and isolation while still others are constantly placed on the margins, even here at BYU.<br><br>Perhaps these folks look or talk or feel different from what may be considered "the norm." This group is broader than we may think and often includes new converts; those who experience same-gender attraction; those who are fortunate enough to have diversity in their ethnic, racial, or cultural background (please see the topic section "Diversity--Its Value and Worth to BYU and the Church" at the end of the talk); or those who do not like to sing songs about eternal and happy families because that has not been their experience. Even the greatest among us, Jesus Christ, experienced betrayal, mocking, abandonment, loss of loved ones, and physical pain as part of His mortal experience.<br><br>My hope today is to encourage you that healing is possible if you apply the principles that lead to healing. I will try to explain clearly--and I ask for your prayers that we can understand one another by the Spirit--three principles that can lead to healing and to knowing that all healing is a gift from Jesus Christ, for, as Isaiah said, "with his stripes we are healed" (Isaiah 53:5).<br><br>My talk is entitled "Healing = Courage + Action + Grace." And in honor of Martin Luther King Jr., who was recently listed in Ted Stewart's<i>The Mark of a Giant</i><sup>2</sup>as one of seven people who changed the world, I start with an example from his life that so clearly highlights these principles. Look for courage, action, and grace as I read his words:<br><br><i>Almost immediately after the</i>[bus boycott]<i>started we had begun to receive threatening telephone calls and letters. They increased as time went on. . . .</i><br><br><i>One night . . . I couldn't sleep. It seemed that all of my fears had come down on me at once. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . I had heard these things before, but for some reason that night it got to me. . . . I went to the kitchen and . . . I sat there and thought about a beautiful little daughter who had just been born. . . . I started thinking about a dedicated and loyal wife, who was over there asleep. And she could be taken from me, or I could be taken from her. And I got to the point that I couldn't take it any longer. . . . With my head in my hands, I bowed over the kitchen table and prayed aloud . . . : "Lord, I'm down here trying to do what's right. I think I'm right. I am here taking a stand for what I believe is right. But Lord, I must confess that I'm weak now, I'm faltering. I'm losing my courage. Now, I am afraid. . . . I have nothing left. I've come to the point where I can't face it alone."</i><br><br><i>It seemed as though I could hear the quiet assurance of an inner voice saying: "Martin Luther, stand up for righteousness. Stand up for justice. Stand up for truth. And lo, I will be with you. Even until the end of the world."</i><br><br><i>I tell you . . . I heard the voice of Jesus saying still to fight on. He promised never to leave me alone. At that moment I experienced the presence of the Divine as I had never experienced Him before. Almost at once my fears began to go. My uncertainty disappeared. I was ready to face anything.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>Can you see in this example the pathway to healing? Courage to face a difficult situation and stand for truth, acting in faith by turning to God in prayer, and peace and strength from the Lord through His grace--courage, action, grace.<br><h2><strong>Healing</strong></h2><br>What then is healing, and why should we seek it? My favorite talk on the subject of healing is a BYU devotional given by Elaine S. Marshall in 2002 entitled "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/elaine-s-marshall_learning-healers-art/">Learning the Healer's Art</a>." I strongly recommend you study it. I assign it in every class I teach, from undergraduate to doctoral level. I suggest you read it more than once. Listen closely to her definition of healing:<br><br><i>On</i>[my]<i>first day as a nurse, I assumed cure, care, and healing to be synonymous. I have learned they are not the same. Healing is not cure. Cure is clean, quick, and done--often under anesthesia. . . . Healing, however, is often a lifelong process of recovery and growth in spite of,<b>maybe because of,</b>enduring physical, emotional, or spiritual assault. It requires time. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . It requires all the energy of your entire being. You have to be there, fully awake, aware, and participating when it happens.</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/elaine-s-marshall_learning-healers-art/"><sup>4</sup></a><br><br>Healing is much more than "getting better" or "having our problems go away." Healing is growth, development, and maturation. In a word, healing is change. It takes time and energy and struggle, but healing teaches us. As Marshall said:<br><br><i>Healing can help us to become more sensitive and more awake to life. . . . Healing invites gifts of humility and faith. It opens our hearts to . . . truth, beauty, . . . and grace.</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/elaine-s-marshall_learning-healers-art/"><sup>5</sup></a><br><br>But remember, even with all that beauty and growth and grace, healing does hurt.<br><br>Some people I have had the privilege of working with over the years have had a hard time reconciling the fact that healing requires suffering and yet is a gift from our Savior. How is it that a loving God would allow us to suffer? I have come to realize that my Savior cares more about my growth than He does about my comfort. One evidence of His love is that He does not spare me from the suffering I need for my development and progression, even when I get mad at Him. As a client once told me, "I used to feel guilty for getting mad at God. Then I realized He can handle it."<br><br>And, unlike other humans, He does not punish me when I am mad or hold a grudge or remind me of it the next time my heart is right and I ask for His help.<br><br>I love how Elder Dallin H. Oaks, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, described healing:<br><br><i>Healing blessings come in many ways, each suited to our individual needs, as known to Him who loves us best. Sometimes a "healing" . . . lifts our burden. But sometimes we are "healed" by being given strength or understanding or patience to bear the burdens placed upon us.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2006/10/he-heals-the-heavy-laden?lang=eng"><sup>6</sup></a><br><br>As we consider the key components for healing, let us remember that, in the end, healing is a gift from our Savior that will likely require effort and suffering on our part so that we can grow and develop through our struggles. The gift is often the refinement we experience in the process.<br><br>Let me give you one example from one of my heroes. When the relatively young Nelson Mandela first entered prison, he was described by his peers as too "emotional" (meaning he lacked self-control), "passionate" (meaning he had a temper), and "quickly stung" (easily offended), but when he left prison twenty-seven years later, the words he would use to describe himself were "balanced," "measured," and "controlled."<sup>7</sup>As Richard Stengel noted in his excellent book on lessons learned from Mandela, "Nelson Mandela had many teachers in his life, but the greatest of them all was prison."<sup>8</sup>When he was pestered about how prison had changed him, Mandela simply said, "I came out mature."<sup>9</sup><br><br>Was prison a healing experience for Mandela? It depends on how you describe healing. As described in Elder Oaks' words, Mandela developed in prison the strength, understanding, and patience necessary to bear the burdens that were placed on him. What were those burdens? In the midst of decades of violent and hate-filled conflict, Mandela left prison to lead two groups into the miraculously peaceful development of a democracy, preventing the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives in a bloody civil war. Is that healing? I would say yes. Mandela's personal healing fostered nationwide healing. His life is an example of how courage, action, and grace lead to healing.<br><h2><strong>Courage</strong></h2><br>Let's shift our focus for a moment to courage. Simply defined, true "courage is not the absence of fear; it is the making of action in spite of fear."<sup>10</sup>In order for healing to occur, we have to be courageous enough to move forward when we are afraid. I have chosen three examples in which courage is needed for healing to occur.<br><br>First, we have to be courageous to face the truth regarding what needs to change in our lives. This type of intense introspection requires tremendous honesty with ourselves. As Jesus said, "Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free" (John 8:32; see also 2 Nephi 28:28), but that is usually only after it hurts us first. Most of what I know about the courage to heal I have learned from clients. I have noticed among those who do find healing a real commitment to learning the truth about themselves, which is never easy.<br><br>I once asked a client if he really wanted to change--if he wanted to change badly enough to hear the truth about his role in his marriage. He said yes, so I told him I thought he was a diva who interacted with his wife from a selfish and entitled place. I was impressed with his response to me. After a chuckle he said, "You are probably right, and I do not want to be a diva anymore. I want someone to call me out on my stuff, and I want to change." He was back the next week ready to work. I appreciated his courage. It takes courage to be honest with ourselves.<br><br>Second, it takes tremendous courage to be congruent--to live a life in which our public and private priorities are in sync and in which what we experience on the inside is consistent with what we show on the outside. I like what marriage and family therapist William J. Doherty said about integrity. He stated, "Integrity is harmony between our moral beliefs and our actions."<sup>11</sup><br><br>I learned this lesson the hard way when a colleague at Syracuse University gave me some pointed and painful feedback. After one faculty meeting he said to me, "It must be exhausting being you, living a two-faced life."<br><br>When I asked him what he meant, he explained, "I cannot believe that the guy I see at work, who seems to say anything that will help him fit into the group he is with, is the same guy who attends church on Sunday."<br><br>A little context may help with this story. I was hired at Syracuse as a twenty-eight-year-old recent graduate who was a white male conservative Christian working in a liberal, social activist program.<br><br>Unfortunately my colleague was correct. I desperately wanted to fit in and was unsure about what I really thought and felt regarding socially and politically intense topics like same-gender marriage. I was posing and pretending to try to fit in. As James in the New Testament said, "A double minded man is unstable in all his ways" (James 1:8).<br><br>My colleague's feedback became more personal, for both him and for me, as he went on to say, "Look, as a black man, if the Ku Klux Klan came to town, I know you would hide me in your basement, but as soon as they came to your door, you would turn me over to save yourself."<br><br>In essence, my colleague was saying, "I do not trust you because you do not have the courage to be congruent in all settings."<br><br>It took time to internalize that feedback and realize he was right. I had to figure out what I believed--not what my parents had said was right or the Church or my employer, but what I believed was right. I had to get right between God and me. Then I had to learn to live congruently so that my actions were in harmony with my moral beliefs--which took courage.<br><br>But oh, how refreshing it is to live a life of integrity! Healing requires the courage to find out that what we believe is true and live according to that truth. As the therapist Brené Brown has astutely observed:<br><br><i>Trying to co-opt or win over someone . . . is always a mistake, because it means trading in your authenticity for approval. You stop believing in your worthiness and start hustling for it.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>I have learned over the years that posturing, posing, peacocking, and pretending are exhausting and bring unhappiness. Having the courage to be congruent brings a settled and peaceful feeling. I like what Elijah in the Old Testament said about congruence: "How long halt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow him" (1 Kings 18:21).<br><br>Third, we have to develop the courage to live counter to the world's dominant culture. You know what I am talking about--the culture in which money, sex, material possessions, fame, violent behavior, and carnal exploits are the currency for success. We live in a world in which appearance and approval are the keys to social status and power.<sup>13</sup>In order to find healing, we have to develop the courage to say no to this dominant culture. I love what Morrie Schwartz said to Mitch Albom about living counter to the culture in the book<i>Tuesdays with Morrie:</i><br><br><i>The culture we have does not make people feel good about themselves. We're teaching the wrong things. And you have to be strong enough to say if the culture doesn't work, don't buy it. Create your own.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>A number of wonderful BYU devotionals have described the unhealthy culture of perceived perfectionism and how we have to fight against it. In two devotionals given last year, both <a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/tyler-j-jarvis_thats-light-gets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tyler J. Jarvis</a> and <a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/kristin-l-matthews_worth-souls-great/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kristin L. Matthews</a> encouraged us to be more accepting of our imperfections and to be more pleased with our best approximations, our bodies, our gifts, and our differences. I encourage you to reread their talks.<sup>15</sup><br><br>Listen to what President Thomas S. Monson said about having the courage to live by truth and to avoid the unhealthy dominant culture:<br><br><i>Let us have the courage to defy the consensus, the courage to stand for principle. Courage, not compromise, brings the smile of God's approval. . . . A moral coward is one who is afraid to do what he thinks is right because others will disapprove or laugh.</i><sup>16</sup><br><br>In her delightful way, author and devoted mother and grandmother Marjorie Pay Hinckley described the peace that comes when we refuse to compare and despair, as the dominant culture teaches:<br><br><i>Fifty was my favorite age. It takes about that long to learn to quit competing--to be yourself and settle down to living. It is the age I would like to be through all eternity!</i><sup>17</sup><br><br>In order to find healing, we have to develop the courage to avoid the culture that says there is only one acceptable way (i.e., a specific size, hair color, or ACT score) to be a good person or even a good Christian. There are many, many ways to be a righteous, positive influence in the world. If enough of us say no to the dominant culture, it will lose its power (see Joshua 1:9).<sup>18</sup><br><h2><strong>Action</strong></h2><br>This brings us to the next part of the equation of courage + action + grace = healing.<br><br>Action is essential to healing. To act instead of merely being acted upon was a key issue in the War in Heaven before we came to this earth (see Revelation 12:7–11). According to the scriptures, "God gave unto man [and woman] that [they] should act for [themselves]" (2 Nephi 2:16), but Satan "sought to destroy the agency of man" (Moses 4:3). When pondering these scriptures, I realized that when I choose to be inactive or place myself in a state of being acted upon, I give Satan greater power in my life.<br><br>A number of scriptures describe clearly the need to act and not be acted upon (see 2 Nephi 2:26; D&amp;amp;C 43:8–9),<sup>19</sup>but how is action related to healing? I have come to see that action is the point at which belief turns into faith. When we act in faith, moving ahead on a good path, we open the door to grace. Having the courage to act opens the door to grace, which is the key to healing. Learning to act in faith is one of the great challenges of mortality.<sup>20</sup><br><br>What then are the major roadblocks to acting in faith? I would suggest that procrastination and fear are two of Satan's greatest tools to keep us in the "acted upon" position. If Satan can convince us that our fear is too great to be able to act or that to act is a great idea but we should do it later, he can prevent us from opening the door to grace.<br><br>Think about how he does this. Maybe you tell yourself, "I totally plan on getting married. It is a great idea and I am pro-marriage, but I have to do these other things first."<br><br>Or, "My life is in a holding pattern right now. I am not sure where I should go or what I should do until I get married. I am stuck."<sup>21</sup><br><br>Or, "I know this problem I have [insert pornography,<sup>22</sup>eating patterns, or anxiety] needs to be fixed, but I have too much to do right now to put the time and energy into addressing it."<br><br>Or, "I cannot go to my bishop to resolve this sin because I am afraid he will see how far I have fallen and he will not want or will not be able to help me."<br><br>Can you see how effective procrastination and fear are in meeting Satan's objectives in our lives?<br><br>Remember, the longer we remain in an inactive state, the farther we drift from the Lord and His Spirit. As C. S. Lewis astutely described, "The more often [a person] feels without acting, the less he will be able ever to act, and, in the long run, the less he will be able to feel."<sup>23</sup><br><br>How then can we overcome the tendency to procrastinate or shut down in fear? Let me propose that prayer is the simplest form of action.<sup>24</sup>Remember the truth in this hymn: "Prayer will change the night to day. So, when life gets dark and dreary, Don't forget to pray."<sup>25</sup><br><br>When you pray, you act in faith and open the door to "blessings that God is already willing to grant, but that are made conditional on our asking for them."<sup>26</sup><br><br>In your prayers, be sure to speak openly, sincerely, and directly to Him who is your loving Father. Sometimes I fear our prayers are too vague and too passive to bring about the spiritual support we need.<sup>27</sup><br><br>We need to learn how to offer mighty prayer. For example, you might fervently plead, "Heavenly Father, I am procrastinating again. I am getting stuck in that old pattern. Please help me to break free. Please give me the strength to just get started and then the stamina to stick with the task."<br><br>Or, "Heavenly Father, I am totally shut down in fear. I need to move forward and act, but this prayer is all I can muster up right now. Please help me find the courage to act."<br><br>I promise those prayers will be heard and help will come. We call that help grace.<br><br>And remember, you can still act, even if you are afraid or feel like procrastinating. My favorite example of this type of action is Mother Teresa. I love this quote about her from writer Marcus Goodyear:<br><br><i>Mother Teresa doubted. Her spirit wavered. . . . Some days she questioned herself. Some days she questioned God.</i><br><br><i>And this is the biggest encouragement of all. Even Mother Teresa had doubts. . . . Her doubt gives me hope; not that my own doubt will go away but that feelings of doubt are not as powerful as<b>a faithful decision to act.</b></i><br><br><i>I may doubt, but I still pray. I still go to church. I still worship. . . .</i><br><br><i>Doubt is a feeling, but faith chooses to act no matter our feelings.</i><sup>28</sup><br><br>Another great example of acting in the face of understandable fear is Rosa Parks.<sup>29</sup>Over the last three years I have had the privilege of coteaching a civil rights course and visiting historical sites central to the civil rights movement. One of my favorite sites to visit is the Rosa Parks Museum. Mrs. Parks is known for her courageous stand on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, when she refused to give up her seat. Until visiting her museum and reading more about her life, I did not realize that numerous African Americans had been beaten, arrested, raped, or shot in Montgomery during the decade before her refusal to give up her seat--all for taking a similar stance to Mrs. Parks' action.<br><br>In my study of her, I have learned that Mrs. Parks was courageously acting long before that winter day in 1955. For example, she served as secretary in the local chapter of the NAACP and was a vigorous advocate for justice for black women who had been brutally raped in the South. However, as will be our experience, most of her courageous acts were unknown and unheralded. In the case of the bus boycott, she was in the right place at the right time, willing to do the right thing, which helped bring needed change to our country.<br><br>I have since asked myself, "Am I in the right place doing the right thing, willing to act as God prompts so I can do the work He has given me?" Listen to how one biographer described Mrs. Parks' courage to act: "Parks made an active choice in that instance. . . . In a moment designed to frighten and degrade, she was able to see herself as an agent and claim a space of choice."<sup>30</sup>I love that phrase "see herself as an agent and claim a space of choice." When we have the courage to act, we open the door to healing. Mrs. Parks' courageous act opened the door to the civil rights movement, a movement that brought a large measure of needed healing to this country.<br><h2><strong>Grace</strong></h2><br>That brings us to the final part of the equation--healing = courage + action + grace. What is grace? I love the definition provided by David A. Bednar in a devotional given while he was president of BYU–Idaho. He quoted the Bible Dictionary, which states that grace can be defined as<br><br><i><b>divine means of help or strength,</b>given through the bounteous mercy and love of Jesus Christ.</i><br><br><i>. . .<b>It is likewise through the grace of the Lord that individuals . . . receive strength and assistance to do good works that they otherwise would not be able to maintain if left to their own means. This grace is an enabling power.</b></i><sup>31</sup><br><br>After reading this definition, President Bednar then added, "Thus the enabling power of the Atonement strengthens us to do and be good and serve beyond our own individual desire and natural capacity."<sup>32</sup><br><br>The scriptures are full of examples of the grace of Jesus Christ as He ministered to people struggling to do and be good but coming up short. The scriptures teach of Him reaching out to His people at their breaking point and providing strength, patience, joy, comfort, assurances, peace, faith, hope, courage, and determination and even wiping away the tears from their eyes (see Mosiah 24:13–16; Alma 31:31–38, 58:9–12; Revelation 21:4). The grace of Jesus Christ, His bounteous mercy and love, is available to us if we but have the courage to reach out to Him.<sup>33</sup><br><br>Sometimes that grace comes directly through the Holy Ghost, and we can feel His clear and specific love for us. Sometimes that grace comes as Christ touches another person's heart and prompts her or him to share, bless, and uplift another. In other words, grace is often made manifest through the courage and action of a person who reaches out to serve another. Let me give you an example of the principle of reaching out from the childhood of Thomas S. Monson, the president of the Church:<br><br><i>Again Christmastime had come. We were preparing for the oven a gigantic turkey and anticipating the savory feast that awaited. A neighborhood pal of mine asked a startling question: "What does turkey taste like?"</i><br><br><i>I responded, "Oh, about like chicken tastes."</i><br><br><i>Again a question: "What does chicken taste like?"</i><br><br><i>It was then that I realized my friend had never eaten chicken or turkey. I asked what his family was going to have for Christmas dinner. There was no prompt response, just a downcast glance and the comment, "I dunno. There's nothing in the house."</i><br><br><i>I pondered a solution. There was none. I had no turkeys, no chickens, no money. Then I remembered I did have two pet rabbits. Immediately I took them to my friend and handed the box to him with the comment, "Here, take these two rabbits. They're good to eat--just like chicken."</i><br><br><i>He took the box, climbed the fence, and headed for home--a Christmas dinner safely assured. Tears came easily to me as I closed the door to the empty rabbit hutch. But I was not sad. A warmth, a feeling of indescribable joy, filled my heart. It was a memorable Christmas.</i><sup>34</sup><br><br>President Monson was a minister of grace (see 1 Peter 4:10), and we can be one too.<br><br>Grace is the power by which healing occurs. In every aspect of His mortal and postmortal ministry, Christ went about healing all manner of afflictions (see Matthew 9:18–25; 3 Nephi 17:9). His part is to be our atoning Savior, and our part is to be courageous enough to act. He then provides the grace and healing. However, sometimes we may not appreciate the manifestations of His grace because healing blessings do not always come in the form we ask.<i>Sometimes His grace is made manifest by letting us sit and struggle with an issue.</i>Again, our Heavenly Father and Savior are more interested in our growth and progression than in our comfort and convenience.<sup>35</sup>Moments of struggle often bring the greatest growth.<sup>36</sup><br><br>Permit me to illustrate this point with an example from the life of my sweetheart and best friend, Sharon. In April 2002, Sharon's fifty-six-year-old father, Mike, suffered a major heart attack one day at work. As a result of a lack of oxygen to the brain, he was in a coma for a week. Many friends and family members prayed and fasted, he received multiple blessings, and his name was placed on the prayer roll at multiple temples, but, regardless of these efforts, it was his time to die (see D&amp;amp;C 42:43–48). As the months passed, we came to some measure of peace regarding his early and unexpected death.<br><br>At the time, Sharon was working with the young children at church as the Primary president. It was her turn to teach the children, and the topic was "God Hears and Answers My Prayers." We talked a lot about that lesson and the dilemma it presented for her, and Doctrine and Covenants 18:18 and 88:64 were particularly helpful at the time.<br><br>My wife said, "I know God hears and answers our prayers, but if in the end He is going to do what is His will, why should I pray for what I want and need? My dad died anyway because it was God's will. My prayers have not been the same since he died."<br><br>If you have not yet experienced that kind of despair in your prayers, you likely will.<sup>37</sup>For some of you that moment is now.<br><br>So what did Sharon teach the children? Up until the night before she was not sure what to say. When the day came, she simply taught, through her tears, "I know that God hears and answers every prayer. He does not always give us the answer we want, and that really hurts. But I believe you will do better in your life by praying than by not praying. That is why I pray every day."<br><br>Acting on true principles, even when your heart says otherwise, takes true courage. And as a result, Sharon received a measure of healing that day through the grace of Jesus Christ. One of my favorite parts about being married to Sharon--and there are many--is to listen to her pray in faith for our children, extended family, and others in need. She knows how to talk to Heavenly Father.<br><br>As my friend Ty Mansfield has described in one of the stories profiled on the Church's website mormonsandgays.org, if we can just stay with God, trust Him, and keep doing the things that bring the Spirit into our lives, then light and healing can enter, even though at the moment things look dark and gloomy.<sup>38</sup>Whether the struggle is same-gender attraction, a crisis of faith, an addiction, or a deep sense of loneliness, just stay with God. Trust Him. There is light and love ahead (see D&amp;amp;C 50:23–25).<sup>39</sup>Again, if we can muster up the courage and take action, Christ provides the grace: courage + action + grace = healing.<br><br>By way of conclusion and testimony, I know that Jesus Christ is the great Healer. Over many years, in numerous settings, I have seen wounds of horrific abuse, long-standing addiction, loss that has shattered the soul, and heartache beyond description be addressed, overcome, and resolved through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. I know He is a real, living, loving God. I love and honor Him. I know His grace is sufficient--meaning big or powerful enough--to help us with all our problems. I know His promises to us are real and true. He can and will cleanse and heal us as He has said (see Ezekiel 36:25–28). In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Jonathan G.

Mitch Albom,<i>Tuesdays with Morrie: An Old Man, a Young Man, and Life's Greatest Lesson</i>(New York: Doubleday, 1997), 35–36. This beautiful little book is a must-read that I have assigned in many classes. I would also recommend the movie by the same title, starring Jack Lemmon and Hank Azaria and produced by Oprah Winfrey. It is wonderful. A quote from page 43 is also instructive:<br><br><i>So many people walk around with a meaningless life. They seem half-asleep, even when they're busy doing things they think are important. This is because they're chasing the wrong things. The way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning.</i><br><br>15.

See David A. Bednar, "Watching with All Perseverance,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2010, 40–43. Elder David A. Bednar, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, taught on page 42 this principle (the importance of acting) repeatedly and with power:<br><br><i>In the grand division of all of God's creations, there are "things to act and things to be acted upon" (2 Nephi 2:14). As children of our Heavenly Father, we have been blessed with the gift of moral agency, the capacity and power of independent action. Endowed with agency, we are agents, and we primarily are to act and not merely be acted upon.</i><br><br>20. See Boyd K. Packer, "The Edge of the Light,"<i>BYU Today,</i>March 1991, 22–24, 38–43; see also Boyd K. Packer,<i>The Holy Temple</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1980), 184.<br><br>In his great BYU fireside address "The Edge of the Light," given on March 4, 1990, President Boyd K. Packer of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles described a moment (on pages 22–23) in which he learned the importance of acting in faith:<br><br><i>Shortly after I was called as a General Authority, I went to Elder Harold B. Lee for counsel. He listened very carefully to my problem and suggested that I see President David O. McKay. President McKay counseled me as to the direction I should go. I was very willing to be obedient but saw no way possible for me to do as he counseled me to do.</i><br><br><i>I returned to Elder Lee and told him that I saw no way to move in the direction I was counseled to go. He said, "The trouble with you is you want to see the end from the beginning." I replied that I would like to see at least a step or two ahead. Then came the lesson of a lifetime: "You must learn to walk to the edge of the light, and then a few steps into the darkness; then the light will appear and show the way before you."</i><br><br>That, in essence, is the definition of acting in faith.<br><br>21. For an excellent book on the need to keep living and acting, the need to develop a wonderful life while living a single life, read Kristen McMain Oaks,<i>A Single Voice: The Unexpected Life Is No Less a Life</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2008). This book has been very helpful for a number of young single adult sisters.<br><br>22. Over many years clients have told me again and again that the most helpful talk they have seen about pornography is James M. Harper, "Secret Shame: Isolation from Self," a talk given at a BYU Cyber Secrets conference, Cyber Secrets: The Problem of Pornography, 18 February 2003, youtube.com/watch?v=kzNKTOPVKZM. This talk helps us understand that pornography is used as an escape from difficult or unpleasant emotional experiences. Most often pornography use is not an issue of hypersexuality, per se, but an issue of ineffective coping strategies for the difficulties of life. Most men I have worked with who look at pornography do it to cope because they do not have other healthy coping skills. Unfortunately, the use turns into a cycle of shame and acting out, as described by Dr. Harper. Please listen to the talk if you want to understand more and begin to heal. Also, there are a number of very helpful Book of Mormon scriptures that describe the process of deliverance in which the Lord delivers His people from bondage. Pay close attention to your part in the process of deliverance (see Mosiah 7:33; Mosiah 29:19–20; 3 Nephi 4:30–33). You may wish to also look up all the scriptures in the Topical Guide under "deliver, deliverance."<br><br>23. C. S. Lewis,<i>The Screwtape Letters</i>(New York: Macmillan, 1977), 61 (end of chapter 13).<br><br>24. For a wonderful BYU devotional address on prayer, see Bruce D. Porter, "<a href="http://speeches.byu.edu/speakers/albert-e-bowen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Did You Think to Pray</a>?" 4 December 2012.<br><br>25.

I have found Mary Jane Woodger's article on mighty prayer to be very helpful in teaching me how to pray with more sincerity, directness, and power.

Mother Teresa was also listed as one of seven giants in chapter 7 of Ted Stewart,<i>The Mark of a Giant.</i>Stewart's chapter on Mother Teresa (pages 206–39) is an excellent description of her life.<br><br>29. When I was a sophomore at BYU in the early 1990s, Mrs. Rosa Parks visited campus to give a talk. I can tell you this: even as a young man with no real understanding of her place in history, I was overpowered by her presence and the greatness of her character. There was something electric in the air when she spoke. She was a small woman, advanced in age at the time, but she was powerful. It was a wonderful moment to be in her presence and to know that BYU had brought her to campus to share a message. I had no idea at that time how she would come to influence my life.<br><br>30.

Bednar, "In the Strength of the Lord," BYU–Idaho devotional address, 8 January 2002.<br><br>33. I love this quote by Martin Luther King Jr. about the closeness we can feel to the Lord in the midst of struggles:<br><br><i>In recent months I have also become more and more convinced of the reality of a personal God. . . . Perhaps the suffering, frustration and agonizing moments which I have had to undergo occasionally as a result of my involvement in a difficult struggle have drawn me closer to God. Whatever the cause, God has been profoundly real to me in recent months. In the midst of outer dangers I have felt an inner calm and known resources of strength that only God could give. In many instances I have felt the power of God transforming the fatigue of despair into the buoyancy of hope.</i>["Pilgrimage to Nonviolence" (1960), in<i>I Have a Dream: Writings and Speeches That Changed the World,</i>ed. James Melvin Washington (San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco, 1992), 61; see also chapter 6 on Martin Luther King Jr. in Stewart,<i>Mark of a Giant,</i>157–205]<br><br>34. Thomas S. Monson, "First Presidency Message: Christmas Gifts, Christmas Blessings,"<i>Ensign,</i>December 1995, 4.<br><br>35. This principle was beautifully illustrated in C. Shane Reese, "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/c-shane-reese_measurements-make-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On the Measurements We Make in Life</a>," BYU devotional address, 12 November 2013. In his talk Shane Reese described a difficult decision that weighed on the Reese family. Should he continue to teach at BYU or take his dream job as a statistician for an NFL football team? After much pondering, discussion, and prayer, Brother and Sister Reese decided to flip a coin. After the flip, the coin came to rest against a wall, directly on its side! He went on to describe:<br><br><i>We laughed (and cried) together</i>[and realized]<i>we had work left to do, and the Lord was not going to allow us to miss out on a growth opportunity. We . . . had one of the most powerful weeks of our married lives together as a trip to the temple and additional fervent prayer and fasting helped us. . . . We had a sweet and precious learning experience that the Lord had in store for us--on His timescale.</i><br><br>Can you see the Lord's grace made manifest in allowing the Reese family to struggle a bit longer with a key decision? They found courage to act in faith, even amidst uncertainty, and the Lord's grace was made manifest.<br><br>I have also found S. Michael Wilcox's little book<i>When Your Prayers Seem Unanswered</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2006) to be very helpful in explaining why the Lord sometimes waits until "the fourth watch" (Matthew 14:25) to come to us.<br><br>36. For a beautiful and touching example of faith, perseverance, and love during hard times, please take the time to read Dallan R. Moody, "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/dallan-r-moody_what-happens-when-life-gets-one-degree-colder/">What Happens When Life Gets One Degree Colder</a>?" BYU devotional address, 6 March 2012.<br><br>In a similar way,<i>sometimes Christ's grace is made manifest through trimming.</i>I have long been inspired, and troubled, by this verse in the New Testament: "Every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit" (John 15:2). Even if we are growing and doing well, the Lord will trim and prune us so we can bear even more fruit. Like it or not, this is a manifestation of His grace and love. We worship a God who is involved in the details of our lives. My favorite story regarding the importance of God trimming and pruning in our lives comes from President Hugh B. Brown's currant bush story in "God Is the Gardener," BYU commencement address, 31 May 1968, 6–7, and in Hugh B. Brown, "The Currant Bush,"<i>New Era,</i>January 1973, 14–15. In the midst of tremendous confusion, disappointment, and sadness, Hugh B. Brown turned toward God rather than away. This is a story in which there is clear evidence of the Savior's grace. The courage to act--in a way that moves us toward God and not away from Him--is a sure way to open the door to grace and subsequent healing.<br><br>37. A few thoughts on feeling abandoned: On the list of questions I have for the Lord, if and when I make it to heaven, is why experiencing a sense of abandonment is so important to our spiritual growth. Our Savior (see Matthew 27:46; D&amp;amp;C 133:50), Joseph Smith (see D&amp;amp;C 121 and 122), Mother Teresa (see Marcus Goodyear quote), and other good souls have described times in their lives when they felt abandoned by Heavenly Father. At least in Joseph Smith's case, he was pretty angry about it (see D&amp;amp;C 121:1–3). I am not sure what the answer will be, but I do know this: if the Savior and other great and honorable people have gone through it, I can expect to as well.<br><br>As I have wrestled in and through my own moments of feeling forsaken, I have learned that my desire to live by true principles must be stronger than my particular emotional or spiritual state of the moment. As a client once told me in describing her childhood trauma of physical and sexual abuse, "I used to see myself as a victim, but I didn't like that. I then saw myself as a survivor, but survivors have only made it through. I wanted more than that. I now see myself as a veteran, and I would like a monument placed in my honor." Somewhere on the road from victim (things happen to us outside of our control and against our will) to victor (we honorably struggled through a trial to emerge as better people) lies the thorny road of forsakenness.<br><br>I really like the insight provided by Elder David A. Bednar in "A Reservoir of Living Water," CES fireside address, 4 February 2007, 5–6. This talk can bring understanding and peace in those moments when we feel abandoned. And the Richard G. Scott talk "Using the Supernal Gift of Prayer" also speaks powerfully to this point.<br><br>38. The divine communication from the Lord saying "Stay with me" is described beautifully in "A Personal Experience: Ty's Story" at mormonsandgays.org. I recommend this story because it powerfully describes a path of courage, action, and healing. I thank Ty for his ongoing strength and courage.<br><br>39.

<h1>eless I Went Forth” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My wife, Christy, and I are so thrilled to be with you. When we were young and skinny BYU undergraduates, if someone had suggested we would return in thirty years to speak to students in the Marriott Center due to my calling in the Seventy, we would have laughed uncontrollably. Yet I suppose our visit today illustrates the marvelous wonder of the gospel of Jesus Christ. When we seek to be led by the Spirit and go forth in faith, often not knowing precisely what course to pursue, life can curiously turn out to be more abundant than we might ever have imagined.<br><br>You young adults are now living in what Elder Robert D. Hales of the Twelve Apostles has called "the decade of decision." Many of the most important choices of your life will be made in your late teens and twenties, such as "going to the temple, serving a mission, getting an education, selecting an occupation, and choosing a companion and being sealed for time and for all eternity in the holy temple."<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2007/04/to-the-aaronic-priesthood-preparing-for-the-decade-of-decision?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>1</sup></a><br><br>Today I speak particularly to those persons who are struggling with one of these important decisions--some perhaps almost paralyzed from fear of making the wrong decision and some maybe needing only a little reinforcement to remain confident in a decision made previously.<br><br>Four lessons of inspired decision making by Nephi in the well-known opening chapters of the Book of Mormon, if applied, can reduce your fears and increase your confidence to go forward.<br><h2><strong>Lesson 1: Qualify for the Spirit by Obeying Commandments</strong></h2><br>The last sentence of Nephi's sacred record encapsulates his life: "For thus hath the Lord commanded me, and I must obey."<sup>2</sup>Nephi's faith in and love for the Savior is exemplified in his actions to obey God's commandments. He prayed, crying unto the Lord in his youth until he obtained a testimony.<sup>3</sup>He served as a missionary, teaching and inviting Ishmael's family even without an "Elder Nephi" name tag.<sup>4</sup>He read the scriptures, searching the brass plates until he understood them and could teach from them.<sup>5</sup>He sought after and followed the direction of a living prophet, which blessed him spiritually and temporally.<sup>6</sup>Such obedience permitted the Holy Ghost to powerfully accompany Nephi throughout his life and yielded ongoing personal revelation.<br><br>As young adults who have been taught gospel truths and have accepted sacred covenants, you too must stay close to the Lord by keeping God's commandments. I testify that consistent obedience to small things such as reading the scriptures and praying daily, attending Church meetings, heeding the counsel of living prophets, and serving others will qualify you for the Spirit--and the revelation He brings.<br><br>Now, as obedient as Nephi was in life, he was not perfect. I repeat, Nephi was not perfect. He lamented his shortcomings with phrases such as this:<br><br><i>O wretched man that I am! Yea, my heart sorroweth because of my flesh; my soul grieveth because of mine iniquities.</i><br><br><i>I am encompassed about, because of the temptations and the sins which do so easily beset me.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br><i>But Nephi understood the doctrine of the Atonement, exercised faith in Jesus Christ unto repentance, and thus remained sufficiently worthy for the companionship of the Holy Ghost.</i><br><br>You too are not perfect, yet perfection is not a prerequisite to personal revelation. The prerequisite is daily repentance, because "all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God."<sup>8</sup>When Satan whispers that you are unworthy of personal revelation, as he always will, remember the Savior's teaching: "As often as my people repent will I forgive them their trespasses against me."<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2013/04/the-savior-wants-to-forgive?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>9</sup></a>If your repentance has been sincere and thorough,<sup>10</sup>and even though temptation may persist for a season, be assured that the cleansing power of the Atonement will bring the Spirit to guide you in the weighty decisions of life.<br><h2><strong>Lesson 2: Move Forward in Faith, Even Without Perfect Knowledge</strong></h2><br>Put yourself in Nephi's sandals for a moment. Your father comes home to tell you about a great spiritual experience whereby the Lord has commanded your family to leave behind all your wealth and travel through uncharted wilderness to a promised land. Wouldn't you like to know something about your journey and ultimate destination?<br><br>I suppose Nephi would have been thrilled if the Lord had clearly revealed his future: "You will leave Jerusalem but come back for brass plates and Ishmael's family, marry one of Ishmael's daughters and have children, travel southeast across the Arabian peninsula for many years, almost become a murder victim at the hands of your brothers (multiple times), build a ship, sail across an ocean, start building a village but then abandon it to escape persecution, and finally build a temple in your promised land." But that degree of clarity is not how God worked with Nephi--even though Nephi was fully worthy of the Spirit and personal revelation--and that is<i>not</i>how He will work with you.<br><br>Perhaps seeing a Blu-ray–quality trailer of his entire life and its trials would have been so daunting that Nephi might have been too frightened to even leave Jerusalem. Instead, as his family traveled through the wilderness, new instructions only came to Nephi "from time to time."<sup>11</sup>Even when he was building the ship, the Lord provided specific guidance only "from time to time."<sup>12</sup>These glimpses "from time to time" turned out to be a great blessing to Nephi. Viewing his life journey with certainty up front would not have provided Nephi the soul-stretching and faith-forming experiences that helped him become a more Christlike man.<br><br>If you are waiting for God to unmistakably reveal to you what academic major to pursue, whom to marry, what job offer to accept, where to live, whether to go to graduate school or not, and how many children to bear, then you will likely never leave your apartment. Christy and I can testify that such personal revelation will come to you only "from time to time."<br><br>Our Heavenly Father wants us to grow in every way while on this earth, and that includes developing our ability to weigh facts, render judgments, and make decisions. But He also invites us to bring our decisions to Him in prayer.<sup>13</sup>Answers to our prayers are personal revelation and come to us, as taught by Elder Richard G. Scott of the Twelve Apostles, "in one of<i>three</i>ways."<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2007/04/using-the-supernal-gift-of-prayer?lang=eng"><sup>14</sup></a><br><h3><strong><i>Confirming Assurance</i></strong></h3><br>"First," Elder Scott says, "you can feel the peace, comfort, and assurance that confirm that your decision is right."<sup>15</sup>In our married life, Christy and I have found that assurance for critical life-impacting decisions can be communicated through the scriptures, often after temple worship.<br><br>For example, after much pondering and prayer, we decided to abandon our new dream home in Dallas, accept a job transfer, and move with six young children to Beijing. But we desperately desired spiritual confirmation for such a momentous move. Divine assurance did come to us, in the temple, as we read these words in the Doctrine and Covenants: "It is my will that you should ... tarry not many days in this place; ... think not of thy property. Go unto the eastern lands."<sup>16</sup>The voice of Jesus Christ in the scriptures, accompanied by powerful feelings from the Holy Ghost, unquestionably confirmed that our decision to move to China was right.<br><br>Nephi had similar experiences while building his ship. He said, "I ... did go into the mount oft ...; wherefore the Lord showed unto me great things."<sup>17</sup>When you need to confirm important decisions, spend time with the scriptures and at the temple so God can speak to you.<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2006/10/holy-scriptures-the-power-of-god-unto-our-salvation?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>18</sup></a>I emphasize<i>can</i>speak to you, because sometimes the Lord withholds confirming assurance.<br><h3><strong><i>Unsettled Feeling</i></strong></h3><br>The second way Heavenly Father answers prayers, Elder Scott says, is when "you can sense that unsettled feeling, the stupor of thought, indicating that your choice is wrong."<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2007/04/using-the-supernal-gift-of-prayer?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>19</sup></a>While newlywed undergraduates at BYU, Christy and I learned valuable lessons about recognizing this type of prompting.<br><br>After my mission to Taiwan, I thought international law would be a good career choice. As Christy and I considered that possible future, we understood that five more years of expensive education lay ahead. The United States economy was in a deep recession and our funds were limited, so we reasoned that joining the air force ROTC would be a wise choice to pay for my schooling. But as I took the required tests and filled out the paperwork, we just could not get comfortable about making that commitment. No stupor of thought or dark feelings came--only an absence of peace. While joining the air force is a great option for some, we determined this was not the right course for us. Looking back, that seemingly illogical financial decision was inspired, in part, because I would have been a horrible lawyer!<br><br>While at BYU we learned another lesson about wrong choices that was painful in the short-term but a blessing in the long run. Christy and I found a used Mazda car that fit our small budget and prayed about purchasing it. An unsettled feeling came that I foolishly disregarded because the car's interior looked cool and the car had a great sound system. I rationalized that the bad feeling would depart if the high-mileage engine were replaced. After the seller agreed and put a Toyota engine in that Mazda, the dark feeling remained, but we once again pushed it aside and handed over our meager funds. This car, which we cleverly named "Toyazda," turned out to be a pile of junk. But we learned to recognize the "Toyazda feeling" that warns of a wrong choice.<br><h3><strong><i>Divine Trust</i></strong></h3><br>Elder Scott said God answers prayers in a third way: "And this is the difficult one--you can feel no response." Elder Scott continued:<br><br><i>You may want to express thanks when that occurs, for it is an evidence of His trust. When you are living worthily and your choice is consistent with the Savior's teachings and you need to act, proceed with trust.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2007/04/using-the-supernal-gift-of-prayer?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>20</sup></a><br><br>Nephi's third attempt to enter Jerusalem and obtain the brass plates illustrates how we should proceed with divine trust. Nephi recorded, "I was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which I should do. Nevertheless I went forth."<sup>21</sup>What a great statement of faith: "Nevertheless I went forth!" Nephi had received no specific answer on how to accomplish his objective, but the time to act had arrived and could not be postponed. So he moved forward, knowing the Spirit would direct him when needed.<br><br>Moments will arrive during your decade of decision when you cannot procrastinate any longer and must act. A few months ago our family went out to see the latest<i>Star Trek</i>movie. At one point Spock questions the course of action that Captain Kirk has determined to pursue. Kirk responds, "You're right! What I am about to do, it doesn't make sense, it's not logical, it is a gut feeling! I have no idea what I'm supposed to do. I only know what I can do."<sup>22</sup><br><br>Looking back at my life, what Captain Kirk calls a "gut feeling" has guided many important decisions: marriage to Christy, my BYU major, my first job, and graduate school. I had studied each decision out in my mind and prayed for confirmation, but I had to act on what felt right because no unmistakably divine assurance had yet come. Confirmation came only later.<br><br>I learned what Elder Dallin H. Oaks of the Twelve Apostles taught:<br><br><i>We will get promptings of the Spirit when we have done everything we can, when we are out in the sun working rather than sitting back in the shade praying for direction on the first step to take. Revelation comes when the children of God are on the move.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2013/08/in-his-own-time-in-his-own-way?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>23</sup></a><br><br>Some of you may be nervous about acting when heavenly assurance has not yet come. Take courage. Elder Scott promised, "When you are living righteously and are acting with trust, God will not let you proceed too far without a warning impression if you have made the wrong decision."<sup>24</sup><br><br>Our daughter Jenni uses a humorous example from the movie<i>Home Alone</i>to illustrate this concept. You might recall the scene where Kevin is surprised to be in an empty house but still yells out to his absent parents, "Guys, I'm eating junk and watching rubbish! You better come out and stop me!"<sup>25</sup>Jenni says her prayers sometimes feel similar: "I'm moving ahead to major in psychology, so if that is not right, please let me know!"<br><br>I testify that you are sons and daughters of loving heavenly parents who trust you to make decisions and move forward in faith without a perfect knowledge of what the future holds. And, as with Nephi, the Spirit will in due time confirm or warn of your chosen path.<br><h2><strong>Lesson 3: Commit Fully to Inspired Decisions and Live in the Present</strong></h2><br>Nephi's commitment on the journey to the promised land stands in stark contrast to that of his brothers Laman and Lemuel. Like Nephi, they made the decision to go, but their hearts never left Jerusalem. Nephi was fixing his broken bow to hunt for food and mining ore to build a ship while his brothers seem to have been lounging in a tent.<br><br>Today the world has too many Lamans and Lemuels. Schoolwork is undertaken half-heartedly because Halo 4, Angry Birds, or Facebook beckon us back into the tent; employment is perfunctorily accepted while looking for the next, hopefully better job; a ward is moved into but never really joined because of a possible future relocation; and even marriage can be exited if inconvenient.<br><br>Jesus Christ's church needs committed men and women who are like Nephi. You will experience greater progress in life when you wholly commit to your decisions and strive to excel in your current circumstances even while you have an eye open to the future. Doors usually open to the fully committed.<br><br>Nephi exemplifies the wise counsel of President Thomas S. Monson:<br><br><i>Sometimes we let our thoughts of tomorrow take up too much of today. Daydreaming of the past and longing for the future may provide comfort but will not take the place of living in the present. This is the day of our opportunity, and we must grasp it. ...</i><br><br><i>... Learn from the past, prepare for the future, live in the present.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2003/04/in-search-of-treasure?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>26</sup></a><br><h2><strong>Lesson 4: Draw on the Strength of Trusted Loved Ones to Sustain the Journey</strong></h2><br>Even after we have sought the Spirit, moved forward with our decision, and are wholly committed to it, doubts may still arise and cause us to re-question our decision. In such circumstances a trusted family member or friend can provide counsel and strength to stay the course. When Lehi's family left Jerusalem, Nephi probably relied on his father, mother, and his brother Sam for this support. But I suggest that along the journey his new bride became that trusted anchor.<br><br>A comprehension of Nephi's wife did not come to me until I was in my late thirties. While vacationing in Utah from our home in Beijing, we visited the Church History Museum to view the Churchwide art competition. I was transfixed by a painting of Nephi lashed to the mast of a ship, soaked to the skin in a driving storm, and absolutely exhausted.<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2000/08/the-book-of-mormon-a-worldwide-view?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>27</sup></a>At that time I felt I could relate to Nephi--I was bearing the burden of establishing my firm's position in China, striving to be a good father to six young children, and magnifying my Church calling. I felt pretty overwhelmed. I wondered whether we should remain in China as we had been directed by the Spirit to do.<br><br>But in the painting I also observed that at Nephi's side were his wife and one of his children. She was experiencing the same storm and challenges as Nephi, but her eyes were defiant and her strong arms were protectively wrapped around his shoulders. In that moment I realized that I too was blessed to have a loyal spouse offering her strength in my times of trial. And I hoped that I was a similar strength to her when she felt lashed to a mast raising six kids in the storm of a foreign land. Together we recommitted to our decision of living in China.<br><br>Since that museum visit I have spent time looking for Nephi's wife amidst the opening pages of the Book of Mormon. My studies have caused me to ponder their courtship and life together.<br><br>What did she see in Nephi? He wrote that he was "large in stature."<sup>28</sup>Does that imply she was enthralled by Thor-like ripped abs? I believe it was his spiritual strength that drew her heart to him. When Nephi came to the home of Ishmael, she observed a powerful missionary. On the trip to Lehi's camp she heard him raise his voice in faith and forgive his attackers. Brethren, preserving and enhancing the spiritual strength you developed (or will yet develop) as a missionary or in other righteous service is your best asset in becoming a desirable husband and father.<br><br>What did Nephi see in her? At Ishmael's home he was likely impressed by this young woman whose heart was softened by the word of God.<sup>29</sup>On the journey out of Jerusalem he observed a woman unwilling to rebel and prepared to move forward in faith, and we might assume she was the courageous daughter of Ishmael who pleaded with Nephi's brothers to not harm him.<sup>30</sup>Sisters, being able to develop spiritual sensitivity, faith, and courage to follow Jesus Christ is among your best qualities in becoming an incredible wife and mother.<br><br>I invite each of you to become the type of person that your current or future spouse can draw on for wise counsel and strength. Drifting aimlessly without spiritual or temporal purpose will not enhance your prospects for a successful marriage. Do not retreat into an impenetrable shell because of prior relationship rejections and pains. Invest yourself in finding a mutually compatible companion and be willing to move forward in faith when you feel you have found the right person. Do not let fears of repeating the broken marriage of your parents or your friends keep you from that crowning covenant.<br><br>I am confident that Nephi's wife strengthened his resolve to do the many hard things the Lord commanded him to do. I testify that in our day, a virtuous man and a worthy woman, sealed for time and all eternity in the temple, can likewise do difficult things as equal partners.<br><br>To stick with our decisions in times of doubt, each of us needs to draw on the strength of a trusted friend, family member, or spouse. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Twelve Apostles shared an experience that happened at BYU not long after his 1963 marriage. Elder Holland related:<br><br><i>I turned to Pat and said something like this: "Honey, should we give up? I can get a good job and carve out a good living for us. I can do some things. I'll be okay without a degree. Should we stop trying to tackle what right now seems so difficult to face?" ...</i><br><br><i>Then my beloved little bride did what she has done for 45 years since then. She grabbed me by the lapels and said, "We are not going back. We are not going home. The future holds<b>everything</b>for us."</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/jeffrey-r-holland_remember-lots-wife/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>31</sup></a><br><h2><strong>"I Will Lead You Along"</strong></h2><br>The future did hold everything for Jeff and Pat Holland, for Nephi and his wife, and for Tony and Christy Perkins--and it does for you. Jesus Christ promises:<br><br><i>Ye are little children, and ye have not as yet understood how great blessings the Father hath in his own hands and prepared for you;</i><br><br><i>And ye cannot bear all things now; nevertheless, be of good cheer, for I will lead you along.</i><sup>32</sup><br><br>I promise that if you will apply the lessons learned from Nephi and modern prophets about making decisions, you will be led along with personal revelation from time to time and your life will be "of curious workmanship,"<sup>33</sup>uniquely pleasing to the Lord. I invite you to do the following:<br><br>1. Qualify for the Spirit by obeying commandments.<br><br>2. Move forward in faith, even without perfect knowledge.<br><br>3. Commit fully to inspired decisions and live in the present.<br><br>4. Draw on the strength of trusted loved ones to sustain the journey.<br><br>As you progress through your decade of decision, may you have the faith to say, as did Nephi, "I was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which I should do. Nevertheless I went forth."<sup>34</sup><br><br>I know that Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, are the source of all our blessings in mortality and in the eternities. Jesus taught, "I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly."<sup>35</sup>Be confident that the Savior will fulfill His promise to lead you along to an abundant life, even when the immediate path sometimes seems uncertain. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Anthony D.

<h1>he Spirit - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
One of the first devotionals I attended at BYU was in 1979, when Elder Dallin H. Oaks was president of the university. He focused on the attitudes and commitments a student needed to succeed at BYU. President Oaks said:<br><br><i>At Brigham Young University you are privileged to take a guided tour with the best thinkers and through the best information available in the world today. Most of you will be eager and alert, stimulated by ideas, struggling with the exciting process of learning. Most BYU students are busy preparing themselves for the important responsibilities that they will bear. Do so. Do not be one of that smaller but painfully visible group of students who are still struggling up the far slopes of "fools' hill," chasing butterflies, giggling on the fringes, and pursuing the frivolous things of life while the sands of their study time at the University fall through the hourglass at their inexorable rate. These will finally leave--perhaps with a degree, hopefully with some kind of a job, but almost certainly without the education and learning that is the purpose of our mission here.</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/dallin-h-oaks_formula-success-byu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>1</sup></a><br><br>At times I was one of those students who chased butterflies. However, I did develop important skills as I attended my classes and did the required assignments. Some of the classes that I took while here at BYU--and had not considered relevant to my professional life--had a direct impact on my success as a librarian.<br><br>For example, I was required to take a philosophy class as one of my general education requirements. I enjoyed the class but could not see any direct connection to my future plans. I remember a series of class sessions in which the professor carefully instructed us about the logic outlined in a Venn diagram. I understood the concept and found it interesting, but I tucked it away in my memory and did not think about it again until years later when I began teaching students how to do research using electronic databases. One of the skills students needed to learn was how to create a search statement for an online database using the concepts found in a Venn diagram. The<i>and, or,</i>and<i>not</i>used to limit or expand a search can be illustrated with what I was taught in philosophy. From that experience, and from others, I have learned that sometimes I will be directed to knowledge or experiences that do not fit my current life plan.<br><br>Elder Oaks gave a general conference talk in April 2001 called "Focus and Priorities" in which he emphasized the inspired use of information as the key to our growth in this life. He said:<br><br><i>Because of modern technology, the contents of huge libraries and other data resources are at the fingertips of many of us. . . .</i><br><br><i>Available information wisely used is far more valuable than multiplied information allowed to lie fallow. . . .</i><br><br><i>Overarching all of this is the importance of what the Spirit whispered to us last night or this morning about our own specific needs. Each of us should be careful that the current flood of information does not occupy our time so completely that we cannot focus on and hear and heed the still, small voice that is available to guide each of us with our own challenges today.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2001/04/focus-and-priorities?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>2</sup></a><br><br>Sometimes we do not recognize the importance of the learning opportunities we encounter. President Henry B. Eyring gave two examples of learning opportunities he missed because he did not realize their importance. President Eyring described growing up in a home with a father who was born in Mexico and spoke Spanish and who was a chemist and a great teacher. Those skills provided opportunities for President Eyring to learn from his father. However, he never asked his father to teach him Spanish, and he did not take advantage of times when his father wanted to show him how to solve a math problem related to his physics homework.<br><br>President Eyring said, "He pled with me to think more often about those things that then seemed so uninteresting and so unimportant."<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2002/10/education-for-real-life?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>3</sup></a>Only later, when President Eyring was called to the Presiding Bishopric of the Church, did he realize that those missed opportunities to learn from his father would have been a blessing to help him in his current Church assignments.<sup>4</sup><br><br>He counseled:<br><br><i>Your life is carefully watched over, as was mine. The Lord knows both what He will need you to do and what you will need to know. He is kind and He is all-knowing. So you can with confidence expect that He has prepared opportunities for you to learn in preparation for the service you will give. You will not recognize those opportunities perfectly, as I did not. But when you put the spiritual things first in your life, you will be blessed to feel directed toward certain learning, and you will be motivated to work harder. You will recognize later that your power to serve was increased, and you will be grateful.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>Nephi told us that he "was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which [he] should do" (1 Nephi 4:6). When he said this, he was trying to fulfill the commandment he had received to retrieve the plates of brass from Laban and return with them to his family. After Nephi successfully delivered the plates to his father, Lehi rejoiced and thanked the Lord for them. He read them and found that they contained the commandments, genealogy, and stories his family needed to know in order to stay strong during their trials. Nephi wrote:<br><br><i>And we had obtained the records which the Lord had commanded us, and searched them and found that they were desirable; yea, even of great worth unto us, insomuch that we could preserve the commandments of the Lord unto our children.</i>[1 Nephi 5:21]<br><br>Retrieving the records was not easy, and Nephi and his brothers failed twice. On the third attempt to retrieve the records, Nephi had no idea how he was going to get them, but he willingly followed where the Spirit led him, even when he was asked to do hard things to accomplish the commandment.<br><br>Can you see the pattern here? We have so much information around us, and it is our responsibility to seek the companionship of the Spirit so that we know what information is most important. Once we receive the guidance, we obey in faith, knowing that even if we cannot see its importance now, the Lord has a purpose for the direction we receive. Nephi promised, "I say unto you that if ye will enter in by the way, and receive the Holy Ghost, it will show unto you all things what ye should do" (2 Nephi 32:5). With this scripture in mind, I would like to contrast two stories of Latter-day Saint soldiers during World War II.<br><br>Karl was born in 1907. He lived with his parents and a brother in a small town near Berlin, Germany. As a teenager Karl became interested in languages and wanted to study English and French. At fifteen years old he went to work as an apprentice in a factory that made eyeglasses. When he was seventeen he met two Mormon missionaries. His interest in the English language led him to take the English classes offered by the missionaries. In exchange for them teaching him English, Karl had to listen to the missionaries preach the gospel.<br><br>Karl and his mother joined the Church on July 30, 1924. His father joined in August of that year, but his brother never joined the Church. In 1928 Karl received a mission call to the German-Austrian Mission. While serving in Basel, Switzerland, he met a young woman, Alma, and after his mission he returned to that area to work. They fell in love, but jobs were scarce, so Karl returned to his hometown to start a farm with his father. Alma followed, and in December 1930 they were married. In 1940 Karl was drafted into the German army, leaving behind his wife and young daughter.<sup>6</sup><br><br>In contrast, Reynolds was born in the United States on July 3, 1922. He lived in Provo and Salt Lake City, Utah, and eventually graduated from East High School. His father died in 1935, when Reynolds was only thirteen. As the only son and brother to two sisters, Reynolds felt great love and concern for his widowed mother and sisters. After high school Reynolds enlisted in the military and was sent to the Philippines. Prior to leaving Utah he received his patriarchal blessing. One of the promises in his blessing stated that he would "grow strong in the face of trial and temptation, growing strong in resisting temptation and thereby becoming an example of righteousness."<br><br>By November 1941 Reynolds was sailing toward the Philippines. In January 1942 Reynolds was writing home to his mother from Mindanao about the heavy fighting. His letters contain counsel to his family to be faithful and to pray for him. Every letter his mother received expressed his love and concern for his family, including his desire to be with them. He talked about his future, especially about what he wanted to eat when he got home and what he wanted to pursue as a profession.<sup>7</sup><br><br>Both of these men faced life circumstances that were challenging and overwhelming, but both held strong to their faith and found comfort in the gospel.<br><br>Back in Europe Karl's faith and prayers helped him endure hardships during the war. His constant prayer was that he would not kill anyone or be killed but be permitted to return to his family. He described his ordeal as experiencing all the plagues. He told of having so many lice in his uniform that when he had the chance to be near a fire, he put his coat in it to kill the pests. One of his colleagues tried that same method, but it did not go as well for him. Instead of killing the lice, the heat acted as an incubator, and the lice multiplied to an unbearable level.<br><br>In May 1945 Karl learned that the war was over, but while he was trying to reach his home, he was captured by Russian soldiers. They sent him to a prison camp in Siberia. Lack of food, demanding work, illness, and harsh treatment by the guards took their toll on Karl's health. After eight weeks he was so sick that his heart started to fail. He was sent to see the camp doctor, who used a dirty needle to give him a shot. Within a short time Karl had a serious infection.<br><br>During his captivity he pled with the Lord to keep him alive and strong enough to return to his family. Karl promised the Lord he would serve him for the rest of his life to the best of his ability.<br><br>In October 1945 a rumor went around the camp that most of the sick inmates in the prison camp would be sent back to their countries. In November the medical staff made a list of all the men who were to be sent home immediately. Karl's name was not on that list. He called on the Lord, asking for His help. He was desperate to go home because he knew he would not live much longer in the prison camp. He asked the doctor to look through the list again. It still was not there. The doctor started looking through the lists for other countries and finally found Karl's name on the Hungarian list. The doctor corrected the error, and Karl was put on a train for home.<br><br>The trip took two weeks. There were train cars full of prisoners returning to their homes. The prisoners were not given much food, so the strongest men would hunt for food when the train stopped. If the guards caught them, they were shot. Besides the limited food supply, it was cold. Every morning the guards would come to each train car and ask if there were any dead. Every morning there would be ten to twelve men who had died during the night.<br><br>Eventually Karl returned home, ill and emaciated. His wife and his mother nursed him back to health. Karl survived the war but faced additional struggles as a Church member in East Germany. Through guidance by the Spirit and protection from the Lord, he and his family escaped East Germany and eventually were led to Utah. Karl kept his promise to the Lord. He dedicated his life to the gospel and professionally spent many years working in various employment opportunities in the Church.<br><br>Meanwhile, Reynolds was listed as a prisoner of war by the Japanese government in May 1943. His mother received two messages through the Red Cross that indicated he was alive and healthy. The few words he was allowed to write told his mother that they were holding religious services in the prison camp and that he was working in the rice fields.<br><br>In a<i>Deseret News</i>article dated January 20, 1945, a reporter described how a Latter-day Saint group in a Japanese prison camp in the Philippines continued to live the gospel during their captivity. They held regular Church meetings and cared for each other. There were about twenty-five Mormon soldiers in the prison camp. They took comfort from their religion and had scriptures and songbooks. One former prisoner recounted a story of a sick young man being healed by two other prisoners. A Lieutenant Brown and an Officer Parry were the soldiers who administered to him. The Officer Parry mentioned in the article was Reynolds.<sup>8</sup><br><br>In September 1944 Reynolds was put on a Japanese prison ship bound for Japan. However, just off of the west coast of Mindanao, in the Philippine Islands, the Japanese freighter carrying the prisoners was torpedoed and sunk. In February 1945 his mother was officially notified that Reynolds had been on board the ship. His body was never recovered, but eyewitness reports say that those on the ship did not survive.<br><br>When his mother received the news, she wrote the following poem:<br><h3><i><b>My Service Flag</b></i></h3><br><i>My service flag, so brilliant,<br>With its silver, red, and blue,<br>Tells of the service of my son,<br>So young, so strong and true.</i><br><br><i>He went away all smiling<br>In his uniform so trim,<br>With never a sign of sorrow<br>But knowing war is grim.</i><br><br><i>He wrote such cheerful letters!<br>Wishing he could hear from home,<br>Telling of islands far away,<br>Of the ocean, blue, with its foam.</i><br><br><i>"O Father," I prayed, "have mercy<br>On all boys of tender age,<br>Who answer the call of country<br>To write across history's page."</i><br><br><i>The story of war--its sorrows,<br>Its shocking atrocities, too.<br>How many died of starvation!<br>How many the enemy slew!</i><br><br><i>Today there came a letter.<br>The gist of its message is old.<br>As I looked up for solace, I saw<br>My blue star had turned to gold.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>Both of these men were faithful to the gospel. They prayed in faith, and they desired righteous goals. One story ends with a miraculous survival and the other story ends with a young man who gave his life for his country.<br><br>Their lives and actions match the hymn "I'll Go Where You Want Me to Go" when it says:<br><br><i>But if, by a still, small voice he calls<br>To paths that I do not know,<br>I'll answer, dear Lord, with my hand in thine:<br>I'll go where you want me to go.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>Karl is my grandfather and Reynolds is my great-uncle. Through a written history that my grandfather kept, along with stories of Reynolds from my grandmother, our family has been blessed by their examples of faith.<br><br>One of the concluding paragraphs in Reynolds' patriarchal blessing sums up the power these men's stories have had on my life. It says:<br><br><i>Be humble and prayerful before the Lord and He will never desert you, for the promise given to the faithful shall be yours, that your yoke shall be made easy and your burden light. You shall have influence with the young, for they shall watch your course in life, thereby gaining courage and hope because of the things you have accomplished and will accomplish in the future.</i><br><br>Others have been led by the Spirit when it was not easy. For example, Moses was eighty years old when he was called to lead the children of Israel. Dr. Terry B. Ball, professor of ancient scripture here at BYU, gave a talk at the 2012 BYU Women's Conference entitled "I Can Do Hard Things." In this talk he described the fears and inadequacies Moses felt after his call. Dr. Ball then said:<br><br><i>Moses learned that our Heavenly Father is more concerned about our availability than our capabilities. As President Thomas S. Monson frequently reminds us, "Whom the Lord calls, the Lord qualifies." If we will make ourselves available to do God's work, he will make us capable.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1988/05/you-make-a-difference?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>11</sup></a><br><br>Each of us will have experiences in which we will be prompted to follow a path that is challenging and that may not make sense at first. I have met students at this university and at others who have shared their testimonies with me of being in comfortable circumstances and having an unexpected prompting to go back to school to pursue a degree. They have sacrificed good jobs and comfortable homes and have uprooted their families to follow the guidance they received. They did not hesitate to obey the promptings they received, even when others questioned the wisdom of their decisions.<br><br>Last year I too was led on an unexpected path. During Christmas break, just before the winter 2013 semester began, a colleague and I were talking in the hallway about an interesting project someone was working on. I commented that when I retired I would love to work on a project like that. After a few follow-up questions and some offhand remarks in answer to his questions, my colleague informed me that there was a possible project that matched my interests.<br><br>I did not recognize this as an inspired opportunity until a few months later when a leave had been approved and I was scheduled to go to Vienna, Austria, for six weeks to work on the project. I knew I was being led by the Spirit because I kept waiting for the feeling of terror that usually accompanies an idea that is not correct. However, I felt peace and the prompting to continue forward with the project.<br><br>That whispering of the Spirit led me to Vienna, where my work strengthened my testimony and helped me recognize the guiding hand of the Lord. I was invited to enter the home of a wonderful family: Johann and Ursula Wondra. Through their inspired service and leadership they have been instrumental in the growth of the Church in Central and Eastern Europe. They have kept personal and Church records since 1958. My role was to index the records they had so carefully preserved so that their records could be digitized.<br><br>There were many obstacles to this project, but the Lord placed people at the appropriate places and times to help me succeed. First, I lacked experience. I had never done a project like this before and did not have the professional skills needed to complete my part of the project. Through the expert teaching and mentorship of Matt Heiss at the Church History Library, I was able to learn enough to do the work.<br><br>The second challenge was that I did not speak German. I had a mother and grandparents who spoke German, and I had taken classes in high school and college, but I had forgotten everything. However, there were many kind people who spoke English when I needed help.<br><br>The final obstacle, and the one that turned my heart to complete trust in the Lord, was that I was going alone to a country I did not know and would need to take care of my living arrangements such as housing, food, and transportation. In preparing for the trip I found an apartment on the Internet that turned out to be in a safe location and near grocery stores and public transportation. I can testify that when the Spirit prompts us and we are obedient, the Lord provides the blessings we need.<br><br>I spent six miraculous weeks working on this project with the Wondra family. They opened their records, their home, and their hearts to me. They taught me about faith and commitment to the gospel no matter what the struggles and challenges. Their example and instruction sustained me through my own struggles and my feelings of inadequacy.<br><br>Prior to leaving for Vienna I was prompted to extend my stay in Europe by one week and fly to Berlin, Germany, to help my mother with some family history work. She was seeking out Karl's grandparents. She had faithfully searched for many years with the hope of extending her family connections.<br><br>Before I left for Berlin I knew that I would be facing impossible odds in helping my mother find records of her ancestors. I again faced what I thought were insurmountable odds for success: I did not speak German, many of her ancestors came from small villages where records would not be easily accessible, and I had absolutely no idea where to go to find the records.<br><br>As I prayed and fasted, I told the Lord that He had chosen the weakest person possible to accomplish such a great task and that if anything came of it, it would be because of Him and not because of me.<br><br>After a few days of trying to figure out the public transportation system, I located a Family History Center in Berlin. A wonderful consultant in the center rescued me. She did not speak English, and my horrible German led us to some amusing charades as we tried to create a shared understanding of my need. In the end, she and a colleague directed me to an archive of records that was available in Berlin.<br><br>By the time I was able to access the records in the Berlin archive, I only had two days before I had to leave the country to return home. Again the Lord provided me with the knowledge and people I needed to accomplish the work. When I was lost, someone or something would guide me to the correct spot, and when I located the archive, I was blessed to have a librarian who spoke English and who was kind enough to allow me to enter the library without an appointment. His kindness and help were exactly what I needed at that time.<br><br>After locating the microfiche for the town in which my ancestors had lived, I had about six hours before the archive closed. As I scanned the records, I felt an indescribable joy the first time I recognized the family name. Still, it was not the exact record I needed. I left the archive that Monday discouraged because although I had found interesting information, I did not find the vital records we needed.<br><br>Getting into the archives for a second day seemed like an impossibility. I had already asked the librarian if I could make an appointment to come the next day, but he told me there were not any seats available. I prayed fervently, and even though there was technically no room for me in the archives, the librarian found an opening and let me into the archive to work on my last day in Berlin. That day I found the grandfather my mother had been searching for. I left with the knowledge that the Lord recognized my mother's hard work and faith in trying to serve her ancestors. I was humbled when I realized that the Lord had taken the weakest person He could find and made me strong enough to accomplish His work.<br><br>Just as I was successful in accomplishing a hard task through the guidance of the Spirit and people who were placed in my path to help me, I know that you too can succeed with the seemingly impossible tasks you are given. If we are obedient to the promptings of the Spirit, we will be led to the knowledge we need to succeed and to accomplish hard things.<br><br>In the last general conference President Dieter F. Uchtdorf taught:<br><br><i>We acknowledge that your path will at times be difficult. But I give you this promise in the name of the Lord: rise up and follow in the footsteps of our Redeemer and Savior, and one day you will look back and be filled with eternal gratitude that you chose to trust the Atonement and its power to lift you up and give you strength.</i><br><br><i>. . . No matter how many times you have slipped or fallen, rise up! Your destiny is a glorious one! Stand tall and walk in the light of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ! You are stronger than you realize. You are more capable than you can imagine.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/liahona/2013/11/priesthood-session/you-can-do-it-now?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>12</sup></a><br><br>Others may not understand the struggles you are going through or may try to discourage you from a path you are inspired to take, but I bear testimony that we are not left alone, and even when the path is challenging and difficult, the Lord will guide and bless us. Our faith and His love will help us succeed when the hard things we are asked to do seem impossible. I testify that Jesus is the Christ and that this is His Church. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Suzanne Julian was the instruction coordinator for the BYU Harold B.

<h1>, Guide Me, Walk Beside Me”: Life Lessons with the Holy Ghost - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
When I was asked to give this devotional address and choose my own topic, I felt completely overwhelmed. I ran to the office of my dear friend Peggy Anderson, who gave a devotional address last fall, and she assured me the topic would come. That very evening, after I said my prayers, the music and words to the familiar children's hymn "I Am a Child of God" came to my mind. I have always treasured this song for its elegant and inspired simplicity.<br><br>I had always considered the chorus words "lead me, guide me, walk beside me, help me find the way" ("I Am a Child of God,"<i>Hymns,</i>2002, no. 301) to be a child's pleading for help from parents and teachers, but that evening I realized these words could also be the feelings of our prayerful hearts as we ask the Lord to lead, guide, and walk beside us through the guidance of the Holy Ghost. The connection between the words of the chorus and Doctrine and Covenants 112:10 is apparent: "Be thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers." I truly felt humbled by this insight and assured that I should talk today on the lessons I have learned about following the promptings of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>What a wonderful thought that we can be guided, taught, and protected by Deity in our mortal journeys on earth. Many people think it sounds like science fiction that God and His Son love us and watch over us and communicate teachings and warnings directly to us through the promptings of the Holy Ghost. It seems so amazing that it is almost beyond imagination, but I testify that it is a divine truth. I want to share some of the lessons I have learned about receiving, recognizing, and responding to promptings from the Holy Ghost and suggest some ways in which we can all better develop these spiritual skills.<br><h2><strong>Patrick's Lesson with Elder Kimball</strong></h2><br>I grew up in a home with amazing, faithful, and inspired parents. My father worked as the executive vice president of Upland Industries, the real estate arm of the Union Pacific Railroad. How appropriate it is that I was the caboose baby--the fifth of five children, arriving some ten years after the sibling closest to me in age. For those of you who don't know, a caboose is traditionally the last car on a train, and, notably, it is always the cutest part of the train.<br><br>My brothers married before I was old enough to remember their weddings, and my oldest sister married when I was only six years old. I did not like the idea of my sister getting married, so I gave my new brother-in-law quite a hard time. However, I learned to accept him, love him, and appreciate his role in my life. In fact, he taught me one of the first lessons I can remember about being led and guided by the Holy Ghost.<br><br>My late brother-in-law, Patrick Clarke, served a mission in Chile in the mid-1960s. One of his most memorable mission experiences happened during a two-week period when he and his companion traveled with the mission president and his wife and Elder Spencer W. Kimball and his wife, Camilla, on a 3,000-mile tour of Chile, holding branch and district conferences as they traveled.<br><br>They rode in a '61 Chevrolet station wagon with three rows of seats along the Pan‑American Highway, which was then a narrow cement road with no shoulder or painted lines to identify lanes. Many rivers and deep canyons crisscrossed the path of the highway, necessitating bridges to span them. Most of these bridges were very narrow.<br><br>Late one afternoon, after holding a conference in the most southern branch of the Church in Chile, they headed north along the Pan-American Highway. Patrick was driving. His companion was in the front passenger seat. The mission president and his wife were seated in the back row, and Elder and Sister Kimball were in the middle row.<br><br>As they drove along they approached a narrow bridge that crossed a deep canyon with a river gushing below. Elder Kimball suggested they pull over and stop.<br><br>Patrick questioned him, saying, "Do you want to stop here where there is no shoulder, or do you want to drive a ways and find a better place to stop?"<br><br>Elder Kimball repeated, "Stop here."<br><br>Without further hesitation, Patrick pulled the car over and stopped. Then he realized a semitruck was approaching the opposite end of the bridge in front of them. As the truck moved onto the bridge, the front wheel came off, causing the truck to roll over. Patrick and his companion jumped out of their car and assisted the driver out of the wrecked semitruck.<br><br>After the truck was removed from the middle of the bridge and things settled down, they continued across the bridge and up the road. As they reflected on what had happened, it became obvious that if Elder Kimball had not told them to pull over, they would have arrived on the bridge at the same time the semitruck lost its wheel and rolled. They would have had nowhere to turn and would very likely have been killed in a collision.<br><br>Patrick asked Elder Kimball how he knew they were in harm's way. Elder Kimball explained that the Holy Ghost had whispered to him, "Pull over. Pull over." The young elders were impressed with his inspiration but also wondered why they had not been warned; after all, they were missionaries living close to the Lord. Elder Kimball explained to them that the Holy Ghost had not overlooked them but that they were not listening. They had not trained themselves to hear the still, small voice. Elder Kimball encouraged them to hone their senses to the promptings of the Holy Ghost.<br><h2><strong>My Experience in Tonga in 2010</strong></h2><br>Now come with me to another part of the world, forty-four year later, when I was in Tonga with another nursing faculty member, Shelly Reed, and eight nursing students. We were there to learn about Tongan culture so that we could learn how to provide nursing care in culturally mindful ways. On these beautiful islands I learned the importance of acting on promptings when I receive them.<br><br>While we were in Tonga, one of the few small interisland planes crashed, and the other interisland planes were grounded, pending an investigation. This meant that any travel between the islands had to be by ferry. We had already traveled by ferry once, from Vava'u to Tongatapu, and had planned to make one more interisland trip to 'Eua.<br><br>As the day for this trip grew closer, it became apparent that the planes would still be grounded and we would need to go by ferry--this time on a much smaller ferry than we had used for our first interisland trip. I began to feel uneasy about the trip; in fact, it became pretty clear to me that I should not go. I did not know why, and the prompting seemed to be for me personally--not for the whole group. In addition, I felt a responsibility to be with the group, and staying back would mean I'd be alone in Nuku'alofa for my birthday. That did not sound like fun to me. Nevertheless, the promptings persisted. Finally, and foolishly, I decided I would go to 'Eua and be<i>really careful.</i><br><br>We completed the two-hour ferry ride to 'Eua without incident or seasickness, which was a blessing. We visited the small health clinic on the island and toured the island a bit that evening. Consider for a moment how isolated Tonga is--and the island of 'Eua is isolated in Tonga. It truly feels like it is a million miles from anywhere, and there are no lights along the roads. The night darkness is deeper there than I have experienced anywhere else. We only stayed one night, but I was ready to return to Nuku'alofa. As you can imagine, I was nervous, feeling I was there against heavenly advice.<br><br>The ferry left very early in the morning, well before sunrise, and we had to travel to the dock in two groups because there was only one vehicle available to transport us that morning. I offered to go with the first group of students. When we arrived at the dock, the only light around came from inside the ferry. Looking into the ferry, I could see quite a few people had already boarded, and I felt concerned about securing enough seats so that no one in our group would have to stand for the long ride back to Nuku'alofa. I thanked the driver, jumped out of the vehicle, and scurried across the dock ahead of the students, hoping to secure seats for our group.<br><br>Unbeknownst to me, there was no plank to provide a walkway between the dock and the ferry, and my eyes were fixed on the seats inside. As I stepped where I thought a plank would surely be, I felt the dreadful sensation of falling. My arms instinctively reached out, trying to grasp the side of the ferry so I would not fall to the ocean below. I did not succeed in preventing my fall, but I did manage to badly scrape my arms and legs on the side of the ferry.<br><br>As I hit the water, I<i>knew</i>this was why I had been warned not to go to 'Eua. I continued my descent a long way down in the water. Even in the watery deep I immediately began to pray and apologize for my disobedience while also pleading for help. I struggled mightily in the disorienting watery darkness but somehow managed to find my way to the narrow passage between the side of the ferry and the wall of the dock. Eventually I was able to reach the surface of the water. Illuminated by the light from the ferry, as I looked up I could see the horrified expressions on my students' faces melting into looks of relief. I was so grateful to breathe air again. I thanked my Heavenly Father that I had survived--so far.<br><br>But my troubles were not yet over. I was still in the water, and it was dark in that narrow, watery space between the dock wall and the ferry. I could not figure out where to go, so I treaded water until I felt I no longer could. Then I looked up, and a Tongan man had lain down on his stomach on the dock and leaned far over the edge, extending his arm to me. Braced by a large rubber tire attached to the dock wall, I could reach up and just barely grasp his hand. How comforting the grasp of his hand was! Symbolically, how important it is for us to look up when we are in need of help! My students shouted encouragement, but I soon began to lose strength in my arthritic hand.<br><br>Just then a young Tongan man was at my side. I do not know how he got in the water, but I remember the overwhelming gratitude I felt for him and his bravery. He did not speak English, but he managed to guide me toward the front of the ferry, where the dock surface was closer to the water. Two large Tongan men reached down, each grasping one of my arms, and quickly pulled me to the safety of the dock.<br><br>The Tongan women quickly gathered around me to comfort me and tell me more about what I had just experienced. They told me it was a miracle I had survived. They explained that the ocean was unusually calm that morning. If there had been the slightest movement in the ocean, I would have been crushed between the rocking ferry and the dock. My knees went weak as I realized the tender mercies I had experienced, and I felt the love of my Heavenly Father, despite my disobedience to the promptings I had been given. Angels, seen and unseen, helped me through the peril I had created by my disobedience and taught me a lesson I hope to never forget.<br><br>Interestingly, from this experience I am left with a constant, gentle reminder that I need to obey the Holy Ghost's promptings. You see, when two large Tongan men pull you out of the ocean, you come out in a<i>big</i>hurry. The strain of the pull on my right shoulder wrenched it enough so that to this day, nearly four years later, I continue to experience varying amounts of shoulder discomfort. I let this pain serve as a reminder that I not only need to listen to the still, small voice but that I need to obey so that I can have the Holy Ghost lead and guide me through my mortal journey.<br><h2><strong>Not Always a Matter of Life and Death</strong></h2><br>The lessons I have shared thus far have been about inspiration warning of great peril. Fortunately such situations are rare, but promptings from the Holy Ghost are not rare. Our Father in Heaven and His Son Jesus Christ care deeply about the details of our lives. If it matters to us, it matters to Them. As I share this next story, I hope it brings to mind memories of times when you have been blessed by our Heavenly Father's watchful care and by promptings from the Holy Ghost.<br><br>My parents moved to St. George a few years after they retired. I loved to visit them and escape from the cold and the smog of the Wasatch Front. After one visit with them, my daughter Laura and I left to drive home. We had just passed the fourteen-mile marker on I-15, north of St. George, when we got a flat tire. I pulled over to the shoulder and quickly reached for my cell phone to call my dad and ask for his help. He was at the neighbors', but my mom went over to tell him of our plight.<br><br>In the meantime, a couple of nice men stopped and began to change our flat tire. They were just finishing when my dad pulled up behind us. He got out of his car and thanked the men for helping me. My dad and I visited briefly and then said our good-byes once more.<br><br>I got in my car, started it, and tried to pull forward but could not. Something was wrong. My dad was behind us, so he had not yet moved. We got out of our cars, and he took a quick look at my tire. He went to his trunk and removed a two-by-four piece of wood and a hammer. Something was hanging underneath my car in the wheel well against the tire, preventing it from rotating. He placed the two-by-four along the top of the tire and hit the other end of the board with his hammer, moving the dangling piece out of the way so the tire could rotate freely.<br><br>When I looked at my dad, I noticed he was a bit teary. I thanked him, and he said, "There is something you need to know. When I entered the garage to get in the car and come to you, I felt prompted to take a two-by-four and a hammer. Although I wondered why in the world I would need a two-by-four and a hammer to change a tire, I gathered them and put them in the trunk. They were exactly what I needed to fix your car."<br><br>I became teary too. A loving, watchful Heavenly Father had communicated to my dad through the Holy Ghost to help me with a need that neither my dad nor I knew I had when the prompting was given. My heart filled with gratitude for my Heavenly Father, for my wonderful earthly father, and for the Holy Ghost. I felt so loved, so protected, and so safe. Our Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost care about the details of our lives.<br><h2><strong>Some Thoughts on Promptings</strong></h2><br>How do we learn to be better in tune with promptings from the Holy Ghost? It is sometimes difficult to differentiate between a spiritual prompting and our own deep emotional desires. Elder Boyd K. Packer explained: "The spiritual part of us and the emotional part of us are so closely linked that it is possible to mistake an emotional impulse for something spiritual" ("The Candle of the Lord,"<i>Ensign,</i>January 1983, 56). As we strive to be in tune and act upon the promptings we are given, we will begin to better differentiate a prompting from an emotional impulse.<br><br>Promptings come in various ways to different people and at different times in our lives. Just as we have various learning styles in college classrooms, we have unique needs for learning about spiritual guidance, so our Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost customize our learning experiences with spiritual promptings. For me, promptings often come as sudden thoughts or feelings, such as when I suddenly understood the chorus of "I Am a Child of God" in what was a new way for me. These sudden impressions are often things I have never thought of before and produce something of an aha moment. Promptings from the Holy Ghost are<i>always</i>consistent with the gospel and<i>always</i>edify as we are taught, reminded, warned, or encouraged to provide a service for someone else.<br><br>Promptings from the Holy Ghost are often described as still and small. Sometimes with the noise and chaos around us, our busy lives are anything but still and quiet. As I was preparing for this devotional, I felt the temptations of Satan to be angry and irritated by the minor inconveniences of life, preventing me from being still so that I could receive promptings I felt I needed.<br><br>As I studied and prayed, I read about Joseph Smith's experience when he was unable to translate one morning because he had argued with Emma. Only after he had taken time to pray, calm himself, and ask Emma for forgiveness was he able to continue the work of translating. I believe it is similar for us; we need to avoid contention and anger so that we can be still and ready for the quiet promptings we yearn for.<br><br>Since reading about Joseph Smith's experience, I have tried to be less irritable so that contentious feelings are less likely to interrupt my ability to receive and recognize spiritual promptings. And since then, when I feel irritation surging through me, I shake my head and say to myself, "Cancel, cancel," to help me remember the high cost of contention, let it go, and move on. This might seem like a silly signal, but it helps me--even on this past Saturday when I discovered my water heater had burst, sprayed water all over my furnace room, and flooded part of my basement.<br><br>We need to find times and places in which we can be still and quiet to help us sense promptings. For all of us these times should include at least daily prayer in which we<i>ask</i>for the guidance and companionship of the Holy Ghost and for help in recognizing His promptings. Scripture study helps our minds dwell on spiritual things and provides a medium for revelation as the Holy Ghost verifies the truths in the scriptures and teaches us how they apply to our lives. Additionally, temples are places in which we can ponder the things of eternity, pray, and listen intently. In Doctrine and Covenants 97:16 the Lord referred to temples when He promised, "Yea, and my presence shall be there, for I will come into it." Temples are ideal places for us to commune with Deity.<br><br>Each Sunday when we partake of the sacrament, we renew our baptismal covenant to take upon ourselves the name of Christ, to always remember Him, and to keep His commandments. Remember the promise we are given in return? It is a very significant promise: to have His spirit to be with us. Imagine the blessing of having the constant companionship of a member of the Godhead. As we strive to do our best to keep our baptismal and other covenants and listen for promptings, we will increase our sensitivity to the still, small voice.<br><br>Finally, remember that promptings are often very subtle, coming in ways that might make it difficult for us to<i>know</i>when we have received inspiration. Most often promptings come as gentle nudges that suggest a particular course of action. Rarely does the Holy Ghost pester us until we finally submit to His promptings. Because inspiration so often comes in these quiet, unobtrusive ways, we should not sit and wait in a state of paralysis for inspiration to direct us. Nephi said, "I was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which I should do. Nevertheless I went forth" (1 Nephi 4:6–7). Nephi did not wait until the way forward was clear and certain.<br><br>The sacred hymn "Lead, Kindly Light" also suggests our need to "go and do" as Nephi did (1Nephi 3:7):<br><br><i>Lead, kindly Light, amid th'encircling gloom;<br>Lead thou me on!<br>The night is dark, and I am far from home;<br>Lead thou me on!<br>Keep thou my feet; I do not ask to see<br>The distant scene--one step enough for me.</i><br>[<i>Hymns,</i>2002, no. 97]<br><br>I hope you will reflect on your own life lessons with the Holy Ghost and ponder ways in which you might increase your sensitivity to His promptings. Remember, you are a spiritual being having a mortal experience. As you provide the proper context, your<i>spirit</i>can understand the Holy Ghost as He leads, guides, and walks beside you on your mortal journey. Live your life in a way that invites His presence and helps you sense His tender whispers.<br><br>I bear my testimony that our Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost know and love each one of us, and They are intimately acquainted with the challenges we face. How grateful I am to be one small part of this unique university where we can freely discuss matters of eternal consequence. In closing, I express my love and gratitude to each member of the Godhead and bear testimony of the truthfulness of the gospel. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Jane H.

<h1>g Heavenly Father’s Plan - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning, my brothers and sisters. Thank you for being here today. I pray that we may share some insights that will lift and encourage our spirits and help us in our pursuit of excellence. My message is based on a statement made by Elder Jeffrey R. Holland back in the fall of 1981, when he stated: "The opportunity of a lifetime has to be taken in the lifetime of the opportunity" ("Virtus et Veritas," in<i>BYU 1981–82 Fireside and Devotional Speeches</i>[Provo: Brigham Young University, 1982], p. 12). This morning let us look at opportunity in light of faith, opposition, and friendly support.<br><br>My wonderful brothers and sisters, I consider it a sacred privilege to be with you. Please know that since receiving this invitation you have been in my thoughts and prayers. I pray now that the Spirit will edify us and touch each heart.<br><br>I love this university. I studied here, was married while here, taught here, and served as a bishop here. Before my granddaughter left on her mission, she marked the fifth generation of Gibsons attending Brigham Young University, beginning with my grandfather, Robert Orson Gibson. Exactly 115 years ago, at the age of eighteen, he wrote the following for a BYU class:<br><br><i>Some people want to become noble, others want to become wealthy, still others wise, and there are those who wish to become good. It would be very well to be any of these, but I would prefer, most of all, being known as good.</i><br><br>This was the foundation for his plan for life. He truly was "known as good," as he always strove to fulfill the will of Heavenly Father and treasured his family.<br><h2><strong>The Plan</strong></h2><br>Some of us may not have a "life plan" as my grandfather did, or we might make plans that differ from Heavenly Father's plan. To paraphrase Isaiah, "My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your [plans] my [plans for you], saith the Lord" (Isaiah 55:8).<br><br>Heavenly Father believes in plans. He has a plan for the salvation of His children--a specific plan just for you. It is referred to as the plan of happiness because it is designed to bring us happiness in this life and a fulness of joy in the life to come. It includes<br><br>1. The creation of a world on which we would live and be united as husband and wife in marriage.<br><br>2. A fall that would allow Heavenly Father's spirit children to come into mortal families.<br><br>3. A Savior who, in addition to breaking the bands of death, would atone for all sin, allowing us to partake of the gift of repentance.<br><br>4. Immortality for all of God's children through the miracle of the Resurrection.<br><br>5. The opportunity for us and for our families to return to our heavenly parents, prepared for exaltation and eternal life.<br><br>This plan was presented to us while we lived as spirit children with our heavenly parents, who are the consummate examples of a perfect husband and wife, father and mother. Oh, how we must have loved Them and wanted to be just like Them! Their perfect love for each other and for us is eternal, and They want us to have<i>all</i>that They have. We must have rejoiced when we heard of the plan that would open the way for us to become as They are, even though it meant leaving Their presence.<br><br>In her inspiring and tender hymn, Eliza R. Snow reflected on our heavenly parents:<br><br><i>In the heav'ns are parents single?</i><br><i>No, the thought makes reason stare!</i><br><i>Truth is reason</i>[and]<i>truth eternal</i><br><i>Tells me</i>[I have]<i>a mother there.</i><br>["O My Father,"<i>Hymns,</i>2002, no. 292; emphasis added]<br><br>Regarding our mother in heaven, President Spencer W. Kimball shared this thought:<br><br><i>We get a sense of the ultimate in maternal modesty, of the restrained, queenly elegance of our Heavenly Mother, and knowing how profoundly our mortal mothers have shaped us here, do we suppose her influence on us as individuals to be less if we live so as to return there?</i>["The True Way of Life and Salvation,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1978, 6]<br><br>Continuing, Sister Snow expressed the profound desire we all feel to one day return to the loving embraces of our heavenly parents:<br><br><i>When I leave this frail existence,</i><br><i>When I lay this mortal by,</i><br><i>Father, Mother, may I meet you</i><br><i>In your royal courts on high?</i><br><br><i>Then, at length, when I've completed</i><br><i>All you sent me</i>[here]<i>to do,</i><br><i>With your<b>mutual</b></i>[approval]<br><i>Let me come and dwell with you.</i><br><br>Do you understand why "marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and . . . family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children" ("The Family: A Proclamation to the World,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, 102)?<br><br>We are here to experience in a mortal and imperfect way what we desired to receive in an immortal and perfect home! Family life as husbands and wives, mothers and fathers, is preparing us for eternal life.<br><br>Our beloved Father is not just interested in you returning home--His desire is that you return prepared to be exalted and eternal. He knows that you cannot achieve this supreme goal on your own, and He knows that it is not good for us to be alone (see Genesis 2:18; 1 Corinthians 11:11). Today I would like to highlight two companions that Father's plan provides to help you fulfill your eternal destiny: the eternal companionship of a loving spouse and the divine companionship of the Holy Ghost.<br><h2><strong>A Companion to Help Us Become Divine</strong></h2><br>I was here at BYU when I married my eternal companion, Shirley, who was already well on her way to divinity. She was pure and a light to all whom she met. I vividly remember the night she proposed to me! She might remember the conversation differently, but as I recall, she asked me this question: "Larry, do you know why I love you?"<br><br>She had never used that term before, so to me it was a proposal. I knew I must answer carefully: "No, why do you love me?"<br><br>"I love you because I know you love the Lord more than you love me. And with that love we can make it back to our heavenly home."<br><br>That answer struck my heart. I could not imagine a young girl of nineteen wanting her future husband to love anything more than her. But she had a deep spiritual maturity.<br><br>I did not fully comprehend what she said that evening, but I wanted her to always feel that I loved the Lord above all else. She saw in me the person I could become rather than who I was. I remember going home that night and pleading with the Lord to allow me to stand at her side as her eternal companion and promising that I would always strive to be the kind of man she hoped I was. What a marvelous companion she is. I love her.<br><br>Do you remember the verse in Job that says, "The morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy" (Job 38:7)? I know why we sons shouted for joy. We knew that if we lived according to God's plan, we would have the miraculous blessing of journeying through mortality--and eternity--with one of the choicest daughters of God.<br><br>It does not specifically say that the daughters of God cheered, but I am confident they did, knowing who you sons of God really are.<br><br>I believe that as we both faithfully keep our sacred covenants as husband and wife, one day we will stand in awe of the great man or woman our eternal companion really is.<br><br>When I was growing up, my parents often traveled from our home in southern Nevada to Salt Lake City to attend general conference. On one occasion my mother brought me a small copper cast of the Salt Lake Temple. It sat on my nightstand throughout my youth, serving as a visual reminder of my goal for an eternal marriage.<br><br>It's no wonder that I always wanted to be sealed in the Salt Lake Temple, even though our closest temple was in St. George, Utah, where Shirley wanted to be married. Can you guess where we were sealed? The Manti Temple, which is halfway in between! Now, if you were to ask Shirley, she would likely point out that the St. George Temple was closed that day, or we would have been sealed there. Either way, in our marriage we have continued to strive for a pattern of oneness and unity in all we do.<br><br>Elder David A. Bednar beautifully described this pattern:<br><br><i>The natures of male and female spirits complete and perfect each other, and therefore men and women are intended to progress together toward</i>[a fulness of glory]. . . .<br><br><i>. . . The unique combination of spiritual, physical, mental, and emotional capacities of both males and females were needed to implement the plan of happiness. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . The man and the woman contribute differently but equally to a oneness and a unity that can be achieved in no other way. The man completes and perfects the woman and the woman completes and perfects the man as they learn from and mutually strengthen and bless each other.</i>["Marriage Is Essential to His Eternal Plan," Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting: Supporting the Family, 11 February 2006, in<i>Ensign,</i>June 2006, 83–84]<br><br>I love and cherish the daughter of God who is my companion. I once expressed gratitude to Heavenly Father for Shirley, declaring that she was my most priceless possession. The Spirit quickly whispered, however, that she was not my possession but Father's. If I am true and faithful to all of my covenants and keep the commandments and love her as Father loves her, then the day will come when we will be eternally together as one.<br><br>This is the greatest "work of salvation"--and we need to hasten that work by forming our eternal family in the house of the Lord and then striving to bring about Father's plan for each family member. As husband and wife, mother and father, we are working to bring to pass salvation for Heavenly Father's spirit children and eternal life for our whole family. If we live worthily, this blessing will be afforded each one of us in His due time.<br><h2><strong>A Divine Companion</strong></h2><br>We cannot accomplish this work, which is ultimately God's work, without revelation from Him--to us individually and as companions in marriage. That brings me to another companion Heavenly Father has provided to help us fulfill His plan.<br><br>Joseph Smith made it clear that "no man [or woman] can receive the Holy Ghost without receiving revelations" (<i>HC</i>6:58; quoted in<i>Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith</i>[Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2007], 132).<br><br>The Holy Ghost is necessary for revelation, and revelation is necessary to successfully fulfill Father's plan for us. As the third member of the Godhead, the Spirit is the witness for the Father and the Son. The righteous of all ages have enjoyed His companionship.<br><br>President Wilford Woodruff taught:<br><br><i>If you have the Holy Ghost with you--and every one ought to have--I can say unto you that there is no greater gift, there is no greater blessing, there is no greater testimony given to any man</i>[or woman]<i>on earth. . . . I claim that the gift of the Holy Ghost is the greatest gift that can be bestowed.</i>["Discourse Delivered by President Wilford Woodruff,"<i>Deseret Weekly,</i>6 April 1889, 451; quoted in<i>Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Wilford Woodruff</i>[2004], 49]<br><br>Of course, having this divine companion bestowed upon us is not enough. We must learn to<b>retain</b>the Holy Ghost,<b>rely</b>on Him, and appropriately<b>respond</b>to His promptings.<br><h3><i><b>1. Retaining the Holy Ghost</b></i></h3><br>We must be worthy vessels to have this companionship. If we are not keeping the covenants that we made at baptism and renew each week as we partake of the sacrament to "always remember [the Savior], and keep his commandments," we cannot expect Father to keep His part of the covenant to "always have his Spirit to be with [us]" (Moroni 4:3). But if we sincerely try to keep these covenants, we are entitled to this miraculous blessing.<br><br>Elder Dallin H. Oaks said:<br><br><i>The teachings of the Spirit often come as feelings</i>[such as]<i>a feeling of comfort and serenity. That is the witness many receive. That is the way revelation works. Truly, the still, small voice is just that, "still" and "small."</i>["Teaching and Learning by the Spirit,"<i>Ensign,</i>March 1997, 13]<br><br>For this reason we must always be spiritually sensitive to those feelings. In my experience the Holy Ghost is very sensitive to the environments in which we place ourselves. Clearly the Spirit cannot remain with us while we are reading, listening to, or viewing anything that contains violence, inappropriate language, or any kind of immodest, vile, or immoral content.<br><br>The Holy Ghost cares about your spiritual well-being, but if you engage in any of these things, you withdraw from Him, and the return is not easy. Do not let the world set your standards. The question for each of us is "How often do I want the Holy Ghost to be with me?" The Lord says "always." Our worthiness to have this constant companionship is an excellent indicator of how well we are following Heavenly Father's plan.<br><h3><i><b>2. Relying on the Holy Ghost</b></i></h3><br>Sometimes we may feel overly self-sufficient and do not rely as we should on the Holy Ghost as our guide. For example, do we remember that the Holy Ghost is a teacher? This has special application as you pursue learning, both here at BYU and throughout your life. Do you sufficiently seek His influence in your studies? The Savior promised that "the Holy Ghost . . . shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance" (John 14:26). This is always contingent, however, on our own preparation and effort--He will not do our work for us.<br><br>The Holy Ghost is also a comforter. Occasionally we want things that we should not have. We pray and then agonize when what seems to us to be a righteous desire is not realized--an illness is not healed, we fail an examination that seems vital to our future, or the Lord says "no" or "not right now" to our prayers. In these situations, if we submit ourselves to God's will, the Holy Ghost can soften that no. As Elder Neal A. Maxwell said:<br><br><i>He will comfort us and reassure us. The burdens not lifted from us, He will help us to bear, thus enabling</i>[us]<i>to continue with joy the soul-stretching journey.</i>["Apply the Atoning Blood of Christ,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1997, 24]<br><br>Develop the discipline to rely on the Holy Ghost always--not just in times of great need--and you will find that when those urgent moments arise, you will feel His comfort more readily and more deeply. No one can successfully fulfill Father's plan, individually or in marriage, without relying consistently on the Holy Ghost.<br><h3><i><b>3. Responding to the Holy Ghost</b></i></h3><br>President Boyd K. Packer counseled:<br><br><i>If you are slipping into things that you should not slip into or if you are associating with people who are pulling you away in the wrong direction, that is the time to assert your independence, your agency. Listen to the voice of the Spirit, and you will not be led astray.</i><br><br><i>. . . As a servant of the Lord, I promise that you will be protected and shielded from the attacks of the adversary<b>if</b>you will heed the promptings that come from the Holy Spirit.</i>["Counsel to Youth,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2011, 18; emphasis in original]<br><br>The Holy Ghost is a prompter of good works. When opportunities to serve come, do not push them aside with thoughts of your busy schedule or feelings of inadequacy. We can each be instruments through whom the Holy Ghost functions. For example, you may be walking to or from class and feel an impression to call, speak to, or visit someone--perhaps your sweetheart. I have found that immediately acting on these impressions increases my ability to feel them more completely in the future and helps Heavenly Father change my life and the lives of those I love.<br><br>Respond promptly to promptings.<br><br>I know that Heavenly Father is concerned about each one of us. He is the great architect of the magnificent plan of salvation and happiness. In addition to giving us a Savior in Jesus Christ, of whom I testify, He has also provided a witness, companion, guide, and comforter in the Holy Ghost. And He has made eternal marriage essential to His plan for His sons and daughters so that we may work together to achieve our eternal destiny: the continuation of the family into eternity and the glory and power that our heavenly parents enjoy. May we live and work to qualify for the promise of these blessings in this life and their fulness in the life to come is my prayer, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Larry M.

<h1>d Needs to See and Feel Your Light - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Shortly after accepting my job at BYU, I called Elder Jeffrey R. Holland's office to ask if he would do the voice-over for an athletics commercial during the height of Jimmermania. Because of my football career I had gotten to know Elder Holland, and I thought he would be the perfect person, with his distinctive voice, for the job.<br><br>Then I had a meeting with Tom Holmoe, BYU's athletic director, and I let him know how excited I was about the possibility of including Elder Holland in our project. I naïvely assumed that Tom would be thrilled about my phone call and invitation.<br><br>I was wrong. It was a major faux pas. He let me know that any invitation to one of the leaders of the Church needed to go through the president of the school. I quickly wrote an apology to President Samuelson, and this was his inspiring reply:<br><br><i>Chad,</i><br><br><i>No need to worry. We sometimes forget to inform those coming into BYU employment of the unique way things are done at BYU, particularly when it relates to contacts and requests of the senior Brethren. You are like those guaranteed a place in the celestial kingdom because no one ever taught them the gospel. We probably should not take this one up the line, but feel free to raise any good ideas you have. Sorry we didn't loop you in earlier. I know Elder Holland's only concern would be disappointing you. Know that you are loved and appreciated. All the best.</i><br><br><i>Cec</i><br><br>I love that letter. It is a shining example of my topic today: "The World Needs to See and Feel Your Light." What does President Samuelson's letter, with his good-natured correction for me, have to do with this theme? Everything! How do you think it made me feel as a new BYU employee to receive that letter? It inspired me. He didn't crush me with his authority; it was just the opposite. I could feel his light and the love he had for me.<br><br>As I share my thoughts with you today, I hope to better prepare you for tomorrow. Many of you will run your own companies. You may hold positions of leadership. You would be wise to follow President Samuelson's great example of how to correct and inspire others.<br><br>President Samuelson has tried to respond to every email from every student. Think of the encouragement and faith that he has shared with you and other students over the last eleven years. He has certainly followed the counsel of the Savior to let his light shine. He and Sister Samuelson are awesome, and I will miss my association with them. President Kevin Worthen and his wife, Peggy, will likewise win your hearts and earn your respect as they serve you. I know President Worthen and have complete confidence in him.<br><br>Our Savior Jesus Christ said, "Therefore let your light so shine before this people, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven" (3 Nephi 12:16). That is my favorite scripture. Let <i>your</i> light shine.<br><br>When President Thomas S. Monson spoke at BYU in 2011, he titled his remarks "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/thomas-s-monson_be-a-light-to-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Be a Light to the World.</a>" I love President Monson and know that he is the living prophet today. I support him and sustain him. He is a prophet like Abraham and Moses, like Joseph Smith and Gordon B. Hinckley. In that BYU devotional he shared his testimony of the Savior Jesus Christ:<br><br><i>He is our Savior and our Redeemer, our Advocate with the Father. He is our Exemplar and our strength. He is the light that shineth in darkness. That each of us here today may pledge to follow Him and to be His lights among men and women is my prayer.</i> [BYU devotional address, 1 November 2011]<br><h2><strong>Let Your Light Shine</strong></h2><br>The week of my BYU graduation I signed a contract to play football for the Philadelphia Eagles. I wanted to head to the East Coast and let my light shine, make the team, and score a bunch of touchdowns. My emotions swirled together in a mix of total excitement and nervousness.<br><br>I arrived at the Eagles facility and was the first player in the tight-end meeting room waiting for my coach to arrive. A tall man walked by the doorway and saw me out of the corner of his eye. After passing a few steps, he popped back and stood in the doorway, looking at me with a big grin on his face. He had a wad of chewing tobacco in his lower lip. With a twinkle in his eye he said, "Hey, Utah!"<br><br>"Yeah?" I responded.<br><br>"Are you a Mormon?"<br><br>"Yeah, I'm a Mormon."<br><br>"Are you a good Mormon?"<br><br>"I don't know; I try to be."<br><br>"Do you drink?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"Do you smoke?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"Yeah, you're a good Mormon!"<br><br>After that he walked off down the hall. I had no idea who he was then, but I later learned that he was Emmitt Thomas, the Eagles' defensive coordinator and legendary defensive back for the Kansas City Chiefs. He knew other Mormons, and he knew the difference between someone who was committed and someone who wasn't. He was loved by every player he ever coached, and I enjoyed his friendly banter. As you can probably imagine, the locker rooms and the atmosphere of the NFL are not quite like that of a missionary zone conference. And yet in that environment Emmitt Thomas was influenced by some great Latter-day Saints--like Ty Detmer, who was an Eagles quarterback.<br><br>There were times that year when negative statements were made about the Church and times when Emmitt thought I might be the target of ridicule for that reason. During my rookie season, whenever Emmitt saw some of that, he would say something like, "Leave him alone. He's a good guy." I loved him for that.<br><br>The ups and downs of my career sent me to the St. Louis Rams and then back to the Eagles a few years later, when Andy Reid was made the head coach. Emmitt also changed jobs and went to the Minnesota Vikings.<br><br>After my fourth season I was selected to play in the Pro Bowl, the NFL all-star game played each year in Hawaii. Emmitt Thomas was on the coaching staff for my team. The first thing I did when I got to the practice field was visit with him personally. I put my hand on his shoulder and told him how much I loved him. He smiled and humorously said, "I love you too, Chad."<br><br>I asked him if he knew what I was talking about, and with that same twinkle in his eye he said, "Yeah, I know what you're talking about." His impact on me left a lasting impression.<br><br>In 2008 Emmitt was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. I cried when I heard his acceptance speech because it brought back a flood of memories of how he let his light shine on me. These are the final lines of his speech:<br><br><i>As I go to my seat I'd like to leave you with these final thoughts. Our talent is God's gift to us. How we use that talent is our gift to him. My sincere hope and prayer is that God finds my gift back to him a worthy one. May God bless you, keep you and continue the good fight of faith.</i> [Emmitt Thomas' enshrinement speech, Pro Football Hall of Fame Field at Fawcett Stadium, 2 August 2008, profootballhof.com/hof/member.aspx?PlayerId=270&amp;amp;tab=Speech]<br><br>President Monson has counseled us to go to the rescue of those in need. He said:<br><br><i>Amidst the storms of life, danger lurks; and men, like boats, find themselves stranded and facing destruction. Who will man the lifeboats, leaving behind the comforts of home and family, and go to the rescue?</i> ["<a href="http://speeches.byu.edu/speakers/amy-harris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">To the Rescue</a>," <i>Ensign, </i> May 2001, 48]<br><br>Surely we try our best to do that as missionaries and in our service one to another. When I was on the practice field I was grateful that Emmitt Thomas spoke up on my behalf and, in his own way, shared his gift and came to my rescue. He could have easily remained silent. I will always love him for that act of Christian kindness.<br><br>I went to Philly with a deep desire to let my light shine, and what I found is that the bright sunshine of others is brilliant! I knew that as members of the Lord's Church we hadn't cornered the market on goodness, and what I found was that goodness in others was exactly the light I needed. I knew the NFL would have some rough characters, because I followed the game and I watched the news, but I was filled with hope when I got to know how many great people there are.<br><br>The people you work with and associate with out in the world will be drawn to you because of your desire to be like the Savior. Let your love for Him shine from your eyes. Let there be no doubt that He is who you follow. You have an understanding of the Atonement of Jesus Christ that the world needs to see and feel. The Book of Mormon is what teaches and clarifies the Atonement in a way that changes our hearts so that we can be born again.<br><br>Concerning the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith said:<br><br><i>I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.</i> [Book of Mormon introduction; also <i>HC</i> 4:461]<br><h2><strong>Surround Yourself with Greatness</strong></h2><br>Another person whose light greatly influenced my life was Jeff Thomason, my teammate and fellow tight end with the Eagles. The whole team loved Jeff because he earned their respect through hard work. He had a magnetic personality that made all of us want to be around him.<br><br>Jeff took his job seriously and was a professional in every way. He could handle mistakes on the field and keep his chin up better than anyone else I knew. A great example of this happened during a play at training camp. Jeff ran "22 Texas Y Out," which required a ten-yard vertical sprint with a sharp cut to the outside. He ran a nice route, and Donovan McNabb threw a sweet pass. When Jeff reached for the ball, it jammed his left pinky finger, which caused him to drop the ball and also resulted in a boutonniere deformity. That's when the pinky remains bent down; it's fairly common among football players.<br><br>Andy Reid blew up. He yelled that Jeff had just run the worst route he had ever seen. It was not typical of Andy to do that. Jeff smiled through the pain and even laughed behind his face mask as he held his finger. He knew Andy really liked him, and he didn't lose confidence over Andy's outburst.<br><br>Jeff's reaction caused me and the other tight end, Mike Bartrum, to crack up. Even though Andy was on fire, it was a humorous scene. We were exhausted from training camp, and anything funny was made funnier by the sheer physical and mental exhaustion we were experiencing. Jeff's ability to smile and laugh in times of trial and even pain lifted the spirits of those around him.<br><br>His attitude reminds me of Ammon taking on the Lamanites who scattered the flocks at the waters of Sebus. When the other servants with Ammon wept and murmured because of their dire situation, Ammon let his confident and faithful light shine:<br><br><i>Now when Ammon saw this his heart was swollen within him with joy; for, said he, I will show forth my power unto these my fellow-servants, or the power which is in me, in restoring these flocks unto the king, that I may win the hearts of these my fellow-servants, that I may lead them to believe in my words. </i> [Alma 17:29]<br><br>My weakness as a player was in blocking. Jeff not only helped me improve my physical technique by showing me how to do it but also always encouraged me to get better. Even in the highly competitive culture of the NFL he took the time and made the effort to help his teammates.<br><br>When Michele and I would go out to dinner with Jeff and his wife, Blake, Jeff would ask me to share stories of my mission in Taiwan. He said he loved hearing those stories. We gave them a copy of <i>The Other Side of Heaven,</i> the movie about Elder John H. Groberg's mission in Tonga, and he loved it. After watching it he said, "I wish I could have played at BYU and gone on a mission to Tonga!"<br><br>We gave the Thomasons a leather-bound copy of the Book of Mormon with our testimonies written to them inside the cover. Since we loved them, we wanted to share what meant most to us and what brought us peace and joy.<br><br>People will love to hear your stories. Don't be afraid to reach out and share them. Your stories did not just happen for you; they are meant to be shared. Sharing them is a great way for you to let your light shine for others.<br><br>Jeff finished his career and went to work for a national construction company. Two years later, when the Eagles played the Atlanta Falcons in the National Football Conference Championship Game, I broke my foot at the very end of the game, which made it impossible for me to play in the Super Bowl.<br><br>Andy called Jeff and signed him out of retirement to play in the world's biggest football game! The next two weeks were a media circus for Jeff. His story of going from construction worker to the Super Bowl was a big hit. He was on <i>The Today Show, Good Morning America,</i> CBS's <i>The Early Show,</i> and a <i>60 Minutes</i> special. He handled it all with class and humility.<br><br>The Eagles did not win Super Bowl XXXIX against the New England Patriots, but Jeff played a great game. It marked the end of our football careers together. The game is over, but we will be friends forever.<br><br>The light of friendship I felt from Jeff in challenging situations was illuminating--like a car driving at night with the headlights on high beam! I saw how important it was to be around someone who could maintain a positive outlook no matter the situation of the game, if there was a setback, or anything else. I learned it was vital to surround myself with greatness, and I invite you to do the same.<br><br>As you study here at BYU and then as you go out into the world, find people who will build you up and help you live your high standards. Surround yourself with people who will support your faith and not belittle you for seeking protection through your covenants with Heavenly Father.<br><h2><strong>The Power of Light, Love, and Friendship</strong></h2><br>It was a true gift to play in the NFL for a coach who shared my faith. Andy Reid came to BYU as a junior college transfer offensive lineman. He was part of the team that won the 1980 "Miracle Bowl" in which Jim McMahon threw the last-second, forty-one-yard bomb that was caught by Clay Brown to beat SMU. Andy was planning to go into the medical field and become a doctor like his mom, but LaVell Edwards saw something in Andy and told him that he would make a great head coach.<br><br>When he came to Provo, Andy was not a member of the Church. At BYU he met a girl named Tammy who changed his life. As they started to fall in love, she let him know that she wanted to be married in the temple. Andy wondered what the temple was all about. He loved Tammy enough to find out. Because she was willing to share her faith with him, he studied the gospel, embraced the teachings of the Restoration, and joined the Church. They were married in the temple, and they raised their five kids in the light of the gospel.<br><br>Andy's whole career has been defined by hard work, dedication, and treating others with the utmost respect. Like LaVell, Andy made no distinction between the quarterback, the janitor, the tight end, or the secretaries. He lifted the entire organization. He made sure the workplace was professional and clean, with no evidence of pornography. I thought I was the luckiest football player on earth to have been coached by LaVell in college and Andy in the pros.<br><br>For example, Andy did not allow bad movies to be played on the plane or the bus when we traveled. That was different from how many other teams operated. I even took some gentle ribbing from my teammates, who would ask, "What are we going to watch this week? Bambi? "<br><br>I told them, "If you're lucky!"<br><br>After 9/11 Andy spoke to our team about grief and love. It was powerful. The next day he pulled me aside and mentioned how much he enjoyed watching me and my teammates quote Bruce R. McConkie on the news when we didn't even know it. I asked him what he was talking about. He said, "Yeah, grief and love--I found an old conference report and plagiarized the whole thing!" It was no accident that when he left Philadelphia to become the Kansas City Chiefs' head coach that he hired Emmitt Thomas as his defensive back coach. Birds of a feather flock together.<br><br>When Michele and I finally left Philadelphia to move back to Utah, we were sad to say good-bye to friends who had made an eternal impact on our lives. Our bishop was Vai Sikahema, who had played football at BYU and also for the Philadelphia Eagles. He worked for NBC 10 News in Philly as the sports anchor.<br><br>When Michele and I had arrived in Philly, Vai and his wife, Keala, had immediately welcomed us into their family and their home. Through the years I think we ate as many meals at their house as we did at our own. Those meals often included missionaries and people who were investigating the Church. The Sikahemas demonstrated how to create a home in which the light of the Savior could be seen and felt through their love and friendship with others.<br><br>Since Vai was in the media and chose which interviews would make the news, he unwittingly let me share my testimony with my Chinese brothers and sisters. One day I started my interview by saying, "Syandzai, Kana, Yijyan chimyau de shrgung, Jyou yau chusyan yu ren jr ernyu de jungjyan!" I proceeded to quote the fourth section of the Doctrine and Covenants in Chinese. My mission president, Kent Watson, had all of the missionaries memorize and recite that section at each zone conference.<br><br>Michele called me as I drove home from work and asked what I had been saying in Chinese, because it had just aired on the news. I laughed and thought it was pretty cool for the Chinese people who lived in Philly to hear in their own language that "a marvelous work [was] about to come forth among the children of men" (D&amp;amp;C 4:1).<br><br>On our last day in Philly we sat in Vai's home while his son LJ played the guitar and sang to our family my favorite Hawaiian song, "Kanaka Vai Vai." I was overcome as I thought about the light and the love that the Sikahemas had let shine on our family for so many years. I learned from my good bishop that the Lord's servants are color-blind, that they love all of God's children. Vai made me feel like his Tongan brother.<br><br>While you are here at BYU please get to know your bishops. Help them remember your names by attending your meetings. Wherever you go after BYU, make sure you stay active and remain true to your testimony. Your bishop will help you feel the love of the Savior and better understand His Atonement.<br><br>A month after we left Philly, my best friend growing up, Bryan, moved into Vai's ward. He was not active in the Church and had quite a few challenges. He called me in distress, looking for help. When I called Vai to ask for his help, he responded by saying that I had called the right person. He said he would do everything in his power to help Bryan. He promised to be relentless and to go all the way to the end in lending a hand. He committed to use all of his connections, resources, and friendships to help; he committed to pull out all the stops.<br><br>A wave of gratitude washed over me. I knew Bryan was in the exact hands the Lord wanted him to be in. I thought of the Savior's parable of the good Samaritan:<br><br><i>But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,</i><br><br><i>And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</i><br><br><i>And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.</i> [Luke 10:33–35]<br><br>Vai did exactly that. He bound up Bryan's wounds and took him into his home the same way he had done for my family. He helped Bryan regain his footing in life and find his testimony in the Savior again. Over the next few years my friend met a girl named Temecia, and he helped her study the gospel with the missionaries. She got baptized and they got married. I was there and so was Vai when they were sealed in the Manhattan New York Temple. It was a miracle!<br><h2><strong>Help Others See and Feel the Light of the Savior</strong></h2><br>Presently my job and my passion is to develop the BYU Athletic Department. I get to work with some of the finest people I know. What a joy it is to work with the student athletes! Tom Holmoe calls them "the secret sauce," and he inspires us to do whatever we can to serve them and to help them. Who would eat a J Dawg without the secret sauce? And who would work here without trying as hard as possible to help the students succeed?<br><br>Taysom Hill is one of the 630 student athletes at BYU. He strives to let his light shine as he performs with energy and class. Jeff Simmons, Taysom's mission president, just told me that Taysom was one of the best missionaries Australia has ever seen. He couldn't stop describing the many ways Taysom let his light shine as a missionary. One telling comment he made was that he noticed Taysom's light long before he witnessed his athletic ability.<br><br>If I had time I would share many more examples of student athletes and generous supporters of BYU who give of their resources because they love you and want the best for you.<br><br>I am very grateful that I was fortunate enough to attend BYU. I love the professors and coaches who shared their lives and their light with me. As you apply the lessons and principles you learn here at BYU, I hope that you will find success. Be willing to share that success with others. Be willing to give back and to let your light shine so that the people around you will see and feel the light of the Savior.<br><br>I want you to know that I love my family with all of my heart. My parents and Michele's parents are the best people I know. Michele has been my constant support and my best friend. Marrying her is the best decision I ever made. She is the absolute love of my life. My children are my sweetest gifts. I love each one of them. I want them to know that they need to look to Christ for peace, joy, and a remission of their sins.<br><br>At age nineteen I was called as a missionary to the Chinese people in Taiwan. They are pioneers who have more courage than I could comprehend. I saw in their faces the divine kindness of the Savior. I promised them, and I promise you, that when you read the scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon, and pray to your Father in Heaven, you will feel His love for you. I know that teaching about and being cleansed by the Atonement is the greatest motivator in life. Jesus Christ suffered and died for you and for me. I know when I demonstrate my faith and repent of my sins that I feel close to Him. I know He is my Redeemer because I have felt His light and His love. He is who I believe in with my whole heart. I know that His arms of mercy are opened wide and that He is the way to have peace and joy with my family forever.<br><br>Let us do our best to help people see and feel His light. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Chad W. Lewis was associate athletic director at BYU when this devotional address was given on 25 March 2014.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>hip - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
We live in exciting times. Over 180 years ago the Lord said, "I will hasten my work in its time."<sup>1</sup> On every hand we hear from Church leaders and see evidence that now is that time. From temple construction to family history to conversion to reactivation, the pace is quickening. And the young adults of the Church are central to virtually every aspect of this hastening of the work.<br><br>However, this stone is not rolling forth without resistance.<sup>2</sup> These are exciting times, but they are also described as "perilous times."<sup>3</sup> Just as the hastening is taking place on multiple fronts, so the perils we face come from multiple directions. I would like to focus on what we can do in response to one trend that is making building the kingdom more difficult.<br><br>In 1996 Professor Jean Elshtain from the University of Chicago spoke from this stand about the state of democracy in America. She argued that we now live in a political age of resentment of and withdrawal from civic life. She described at some length the weakening of democratic civil society. <sup>4</sup> As a student of public decision processes, I can tell you that conditions have not improved in the years since Professor Elshtain spoke here. The ability of democratic societies to bring together diverse views, critically examine arguments, and take action continues to erode.<br><br>This is a problem for us because we need governments and civil society to work reasonably well if we are to effectively build the kingdom and spread the gospel. My purpose is to explore what we can do to hasten the building of the kingdom by improving the quality of governance in our society. In particular I want to consider more fully a theme that Professor Elshtain referred to briefly in her talk. She noted that the great democratic theorists argue that "democracy relies on the formation of civically engaged citizens." <sup>5</sup><br><br>Oscar Arias, former president of Costa Rica and recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, once observed:<br><br><i>Democracy cannot survive as a matter of institutions alone. It relies ultimately on the conscience and care of each citizen. . . . So individuals and individual choices <b>do</b> matter: the effect of one upright individual is incalculable. World leaders may see their effect in headlines, but the ultimate course of the globe will be determined by the efforts of innumerable individuals acting on their consciences.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>So the question I ask you to consider is, What must I do to be an engaged, conscientious, and caring citizen in a democracy? Some of you are now saying to yourself, "Oh, great, now I have to add saving democracy to the list of things I am supposed to do." My objective, however, is not to give you one more thing to do but to give you a citizen's approach to everything you do. In answering this question for yourself, my hope is that you will reflect more deeply on your role in our society.<br><br>To stimulate your thinking, I would like to share the personal vision that gets me out of bed every morning. In doing so I will compare being a citizen in our society to being a citizen in the kingdom of God.<br><h2><b>Two Views of Citizenship</b></h2><br>There are at least two ways to think about citizenship. The first sees citizens as having certain rights that should be protected by law. Those who hold this view see "citizenship as [a] legal status" <sup>7</sup> and are concerned mostly with defending individual freedoms from interference by others. There is no question that rights are an important aspect of citizenship. All too often, however, in today's world this approach to citizenship descends into a type of consumerism: citizens see themselves as no more than customers of government.<br><br>A government's efforts to improve their operations by focusing on citizens as customers are certainly valuable. My concern is with the way we <i>act</i> when we think of ourselves as customers of government. Consumer citizenship is something we assert only occasionally. We exercise our right to vote every year or two, maybe--when we go to the polls or "the store" to choose what we want from a list. If we don't like what is on the list, we may not even go to the store. If there is a problem in the community, we expect the government to deal with it. Most of the time, though, we just want to be left alone. We either actively avoid or at least ignore what is going on with governments. "After all," we say, "there is not much we can do about it anyway." We would certainly never think about what we do at work or at school or in the neighborhood in terms of citizenship.<br><br>Some view their citizenship in the Church in this way as well. They may attend their meetings, but if they miss occasionally, no big deal. They may have a calling, but if it doesn't get done very consistently, it is because other things came up. It may even be that they ward hop precisely because they want to limit other people's expectations of them. They may say to themselves, "I'll show up just often enough to keep the bishop off my back and to stay off the rescue list. I'll think about church part of the day on Sunday, but the rest of the week is mine."<br><br>The second vision of citizenship is more demanding and is captured well in a definition offered by Peter Block:<br><br><i>A citizen is one who is willing to be accountable for and committed to the well-being of the whole. That whole can be a city block, a community, a nation, the earth. A citizen is one who produces the future, someone who does not wait, beg, or dream for the future.</i><br><br><i>The antithesis of being a citizen is the choice to be a consumer or a client.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>We often see references to a quote from Theodore Roosevelt about "the man who is actually in the arena . . . ; who does actually strive to do the deeds; . . . who spends himself in a worthy cause; . . . who . . . , if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly." <sup>9</sup> What is less often remembered is that Roosevelt was describing what it means to be a citizen.<br><br>This view of citizens as doers of deeds and as active builders seems more consistent with what our Heavenly Father expects of us as fellow citizens in His kingdom. He blessed us with agency--the ability and responsibility to act in ways that make a difference in what happens. He expects us to use our agency to be anxiously engaged in building His kingdom.<br><br>There are lessons to be learned about active citizenship in the training we have been receiving about hastening the work through ward councils. If I understand the message correctly, each member of the ward council is to prayerfully consider the needs of the members of their organization. Then, as the council meets, these needs are expressed and discussed by all members of the council. As a body the council prayerfully deliberates on the needs of ward members, investigators, and their families. All members of the council take an active role in these deliberations. They bring their own perspectives, insights, and concerns to the discussion. All are equally and fully committed to the success of their joint efforts. A course of action is decided upon and assignments are made. In the weeks that follow, those receiving assignments are asked to report on their efforts. The council can then evaluate the actions taken and follow up as needed.<br><br>I believe we can see in this example five essential attributes of active citizens in the Church and in society more broadly. Active citizens accept responsibility, do their homework, engage with others, take action, and, finally, learn from their experiences. Let me say a bit more about each of these attributes.<br><h2><strong>Active Citizens Accept Responsibility</strong></h2><br>First, active citizens accept responsibility. In the Church these citizens take seriously the covenants they have made to bless the lives of God's children and to build the kingdom of God. They are "willing to be accountable for and committed to the well-being of the whole." <sup>10</sup><br><br>Elder Alexander B. Morrison made this observation about our stewardship as citizens in the kingdom of God:<br><br><i>In addition to all else for which they are responsible, faithful stewards also have a deep sense of personal commitment to the mission of the Church. They see that mission in personal terms, as one that applies directly to them and for which they bear a <b>personal</b> responsibility. They know that someday the Master will demand of them an accounting of what they did in helping to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>Section 134 of the Doctrine and Covenants connects this view of citizenship to our role in society. This declaration of the Church's belief regarding governments states:<br><br><i>Governments were instituted of God for the benefit of man; and . . . he holds men accountable for their acts in relation to them, both in making laws and administering them, for the good and safety of society.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>We believe that not only are we accountable for our individual actions but that we are also individually accountable for the actions taken by our governments. This accountability extends both to "making laws and administering them." Active engagement in the functioning of government and in addressing community concerns is an inherent responsibility of our citizenship and demands our best efforts.<br><h2><strong>Active Citizens Do Their Homework</strong></h2><br>Second, active citizens do their homework. Just a few verses after the Lord says He will hasten His work in its time, <sup>13</sup> He proceeds to outline what <i>we</i> need to do to prepare for that hastening. It is a challenging list: we are to "continue in prayer and fasting from" then on and<br><br><i>teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom</i> [and] <i>all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God . . . ;</i><br><br><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, [and] <i>things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home</i> [and] <i>abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms.</i><sup>14</sup></i><br><br>And then we are given the reason for pursuing such a broad education: "That ye may be prepared in all things when I shall send you again to magnify the calling whereunto I have called you, and the mission with which I have commissioned you." <sup>15</sup><br><br>So if we are to fill our role in hastening the Lord's work, we need to devote ourselves to the pursuit of knowledge, understanding, and wisdom in pretty much all fields. "If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy," <sup>16</sup> we aren't just interested in it--we seek <i>earnestly</i> after it.<br><br>Being an active citizen in our society requires the same kind of commitment to learning that is expected of active citizens in the kingdom of God. Eleanor Roosevelt once observed that "learning to be a good citizen is learning to live to the maximum of one's abilities and opportunities, and every subject should be taught every child with this in view." <sup>17</sup> Just as we see education as central to our preparation for citizenship in the kingdom, she saw producing citizens as the true purpose of education, and I agree.<br><br>This emphasis on preparation and education reminds me of an article I read as a young graduate student. I was enthusiastic about becoming a public policy analyst and anxious to understand what would be expected of me. I read an article by a well-known professor in the field that outlined what he thought should be included in the curricula of public policy programs. It was the most discouraging article I had ever read. He said that to be a competent policy analyst I needed to master not only economics and political science but all types of history, science, technology, philosophy, psychology, and institutional design and change and then be prepared to analyze any given public problem using methods from several of these fields simultaneously and at different scales. <sup>18</sup> For someone just starting out in the field, it was overwhelming.<br><br>I have now been doing policy analysis for over thirty years, and I have found that this professor was right. I have needed to understand these and other fields in order to address the different problems I have worked on. But I didn't have to master everything all at once; I did always have to be ready to learn new things. The nature of the problem I was working on determined the skills required in that situation.<br><br>The lesson I learned about preparation is that active citizens, both in the kingdom and in society, must prioritize and focus their attention on the most significant issues. They then do their research, critically evaluate information, and analyze carefully. They cultivate the ability to examine problems from the multiple perspectives that may be relevant. They seek to learn and understand all they can on any given issue.<br><h2><strong>Active Citizens Engage with Others</strong></h2><br>Third, active citizens engage with others. Paul wrote to the Ephesian converts:<br><br><i>Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;</i><br><br><i>And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;</i><br><br><i>In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord.</i><sup>19</sup><br><br>We are linked together through the gospel of Jesus Christ and the covenants we have made to produce the finished temple. The councils of the Church are more effective when all members of a council have embraced their responsibility, done their homework, and are fully involved in council deliberations. It is when we are all "fitly framed together"--united in our pursuit of the same eternal objectives and each contributing our utmost--that we make the most progress as a church and as a people.<br><br>It is the same in the broader society. Paul's statement is strikingly similar to a line that Thomas Jefferson penned: "A nation, as a society, forms a moral person, and every member of it is personally responsible for his society." <sup>20</sup><br><br>This is a weighty thought--that we are each personally responsible for our society--but that is also the declaration of Doctrine and Covenants 134. We are each accountable for the quality of governance in our communities and nations. But we are not asked to bear this responsibility alone. Our lives are interconnected with others'. Our capacities are enhanced and our possibilities expanded through cooperation and collaboration. Because of our shared responsibility and because we are so much more effective together than we are individually, as active citizens we must actively engage with others.<br><br>We must cultivate the ability to participate in collective reasoning, just as we do in Church councils. Such reasoning involves joining with others to identify issues and concerns, giving and receiving information, and taking counsel together. In this process citizens actually listen to others with a desire to understand their views. They ask questions they don't know the answers to. They respect others, and they respect the decision process.<br><br>Inevitably, deliberative processes such as the one I have described identify conflicting points of view. When that happens, active citizens don't give up but look for common ground and seek to build on a foundation of common understanding. We build relationships, coalitions, and networks as we patiently strive to reach joint decisions.<br><br>There is no question that serious deliberation with people we don't agree with can be slow and frustrating--especially if we want the Lord's help, because then we have to get rid of all those unkind thoughts so that the Spirit can be unrestrained. My experience suggests that we make much more progress when we put aside the idea that people who don't agree with us are ignorant of the facts, stupid, or evil and focus instead on what we have in common. Whether in the kingdom or in our society, active citizens must strive to synthesize and reconcile conflicting views, values, and priorities. This is not easy to do, even in the Church. It requires that we place the well-being of all on an equal footing and that we always balance the common good against individual claims.<br><br>One of the best examples of this type of deliberative process outside of the Church is the convention that produced the U.S. Constitution. The delegates came from different regions of the country, with strong and conflicting personal and regional interests. In creating a written constitution for a new form of government, they were attempting something that had never been done before. What they shared in common was a commitment to some very basic principles of freedom and governance. It took months of collaboration and, at times, contentious discussion, but the result has blessed the lives of millions.<br><h2><strong>Active Citizens Make Decisions and Take Action</strong></h2><br>Fourth, active citizens make decisions and take action. Active citizens realize that obtaining knowledge, understanding, and wisdom is not enough and that discussion is essential but insufficient. Deliberation must result in action. Agency implies both the ability and the responsibility to act for the accomplishment of our purposes. Active citizens produce the future; they do not simply wait for it or dream about it.<br><br>One of the best examples of this active citizenship attribute I have ever encountered is my wife, Carol. At one point in our early married life we moved to a very small town in Utah. We were concerned about the limited range of cultural opportunities in the community. Carol's response was to organize and direct a community theater. She also led an effort to relocate and expand the library. Shortly after we moved to Philadelphia so that I could attend graduate school, the teachers went on strike for several months. We had five children at the time. Carol's response was to organize the parents, find a venue, and hold classes for all the kids in our neighborhood.<br><br>When we moved to Provo, Carol continued to be involved in public education and was instrumental in developing a character education program that was implemented across the city. She is currently engaged in efforts to protect and improve environmental conditions in Utah. She is the mother of seven children, and each is a remarkable individual. Carol understands at a very fundamental level the need to take action if the future is to be better for our community than the present.<br><h2><strong>Active Citizens Learn from Experience</strong></h2><br>Fifth, active citizens learn from experience. The central purpose of life is to enable all of God's children to learn and develop through the exercise of their agency. As active citizens we should reflect on our own experiences and that of others as we continue to accept responsibility, do our homework, actively engage with others, make decisions, and take action. In the kingdom we learn through this process to become more Christlike. In society we learn from our experience to exemplify Christlike attitudes that will strengthen our communities. These attitudes include the humility to recognize that we might not be right, the empathy to strive to understand the minds of other men and women, the charity to value their interests alongside our own without bias, and the strength to aspire to a world in which the least are heard and considered side by side with the greatest. <sup>21</sup><br><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><br>I have briefly described five attributes of active citizens. I am convinced that developing these attributes will make each of us more effective in our citizenship roles. When Abraham Lincoln dedicated the cemetery at Gettysburg, he spoke of "the great task remaining before us"--the task of preserving a free and democratic government. The work of carrying out that task is not finished, and it never will be. It will always require active citizens to maintain a "government of the people, by the people, for the people." <sup>22</sup><br><br>For me and, I hope, for you, active citizenship in the kingdom of God and active citizenship in society are not separate. When I am in the service of humanity, I am in the service of my God, whether that is in my Church calling or in advising a developing country on how to raise the tax money needed to improve public services. I hope to go wherever opportunity presents itself to try to improve the functioning of governments, because governments have such a huge impact on the freedom, security, and happiness of all people. That connection between government and the well-being of God's children is why the Lord needs active citizens and why preparing students for careers in professional public service is essential to the mission of BYU.<br><br>What I have shared represents my vision and my testimony of what we need to become--what I strive to become. I am not suggesting that you must single-handedly save the world or even just democracy, but your path through your life is not intended to be a "leave-no-trace" hiking experience!<br><br>If you will live your life as an active citizen, you <i>will</i> have an impact on "the ultimate course of the globe." <sup>23</sup> The Lord will use you to hasten His work in ways unimaginable to you today. These are exciting times. The Lord has such confidence in us. May we as active citizens be willing to accept responsibility, do our homework, actively engage with others, take action, and always learn from our experiences.<br><br>I will close with words penned by the Prophet Joseph Smith from Liberty Jail, with a slight addition:<br><br><i>Therefore, dearly beloved brethren</i> [and sisters, my fellow citizens], <i>let us cheerfully do all things that lie in our power; and then may we stand still, with the utmost assurance, to see the salvation of God, and for his arm to be revealed.</i><sup>24</sup><br><br>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Lawrence C.

<br>
President Uchtdorf, Elder Cardon, President Samuelson, faculty, family, and friends, it is an honor to stand before you today on this special occasion and to express to you the gratitude of each of us as graduates for all of your love and support over the past several years. And to you, my fellow graduates, you are truly an inspiring sight today. I am grateful for this opportunity to share with you a few words.<br><br>When I first set foot on the BYU campus as a student, I had a plan. I was here to soak up every scrap of knowledge I could find that related to biochemistry, perform amazing research, go on to graduate school, and ultimately make some sort of scientific discovery that would forever change the world. And for me it all started with my 8 a.m. chemistry class. Despite the early hour, I loved it! I felt that my mind was expanding and the horizons were broadening right before my eyes. As I sat in my lab class and performed what I realize now were very rudimentary experiments and watched the solutions in my beaker change color, I felt that the key to understanding the universe was finally within my reach.<br><br>However, over the next couple of years, while my belief in chemistry did not slacken, I began to feel an increasing sense of frustration with myself. I felt that the jewels of knowledge that I had crammed, packed, and piled into my mind were seeping through the cracks in my memory and slipping away. Although I had once done well on my organic chemistry tests, I could no longer remember what a Diels-Alder reaction even was, nor could I sit down and diagram every intermediate of the glycolysis cycle as I once could. It seemed that the more knowledge I worked to pack into my mind, the more things seemed to slip out. I began to wonder what the point of my education even was. If I couldn't remember and retain all the facts that I had labored to learn, why was I even here? How would I ever be prepared to go forth and make a difference in the world?<br><br>At this rather critical juncture in my college experience, a professor--Dr. Steven Goates in the Chemistry Department, who had become a good friend and mentor--sensed my frustration and challenged me to seek out the answers to these two questions: What had I really come here to BYU to learn? and How would it help me to go forth to serve?<br><br>I would like to share with you today some of the reflections I have had over the past couple of years about what it really means to "enter to learn" and "go forth to serve" and how we can continue to fulfill the purpose of our BYU education as we take these next beginning steps in our lives.<br><br>Contrary to my initial opinion, what we came here to BYU to learn was not just a series of facts or skills; we came to learn patterns of thinking, methods of problem solving, and techniques for lifelong learning. For me, chemistry really has unlocked the mysteries of the universe--not just because it has given me knowledge but because it has taught me how to learn. Whether your key to the universe has been chemistry, English, business, or education, we have all learned similar lessons. We have learned that true education starts with a desire, a craving for greater understanding. We have also learned how to create solutions, experiment on those solutions, and interpret the results. And, most important, we have learned to pursue that which is desirable and entices us to do good. Indeed, we have learned that the Lord's pattern of learning outlined in Alma 32:27–28--to begin with a desire, to experiment upon the word, and to pursue that which bears good fruit--applies to academic as well as spiritual learning.<br><br>As we now prepare to leave this wonderful university and go forth to serve, it is imperative that we continue this process of lifelong learning. In a commencement address that he gave here at BYU in 2008, Elder David A. Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles said:<br><br><i>Learning to love learning is central to the gospel of Jesus Christ, is vital to our ongoing spiritual and personal development, and is an absolute necessity in the world in which we do now and will yet live, serve, and work.</i> ["Learning to Love Learning," BYU commencement address, 24 April 2008]<br><br>As we move forward into the world, we must continue to ask questions, create solutions, and pursue that which enlarges our souls and enlightens our understanding. Only then will we be ready and capable instruments in the Lord's hands as He moves His work forward in these the latter days, for the Lord needs passionate and engaged disciples in every branch of the social, political, and business worlds. Our ability to serve and benefit the world does not depend on the profession we choose but rather on our commitment to pursue that which is "virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy" in all that we do (Articles of Faith 1:13).<br><br>To each of you, my fellow graduates, I offer my sincere congratulations on all that you have accomplished. Your potential is both unlimited and eternal. May God bless you in all that you go forth to do. Thank you.<br><br><i>Megan Hirschi spoke as the representative of her graduating class at BYU commencement on 24 April 2014.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

President and Sister Uchtdorf, Elder Cardon, President and Sister Samuelson, all of the other distinguished Brethren from Salt Lake, all of the faculty and staff, students, friends, and family: There are some of you who will remember the classic children's story Winnie-the-Pooh. As you recall, Pooh had a very unique way of going down stairs. He would go bump, bump, bump, bump down the stairs on the back of his head.<br><br>According to one telling of the story, one day Christopher Robin asked Pooh why he always went down stairs on the back of his head when it must really hurt.<br><br>Pooh's response was classic. He said that he didn't know why and that he had been going down stairs that way for so long that he didn't know there was any other way to do it. (See The Positive Project, "Bump, bump, bump . . . ," thinkpositivetoday.wordpress.com/2014/04/28/bump-bump-bump; see also chapter 1, A. A. Milne, <i>Winnie-the-Pooh</i> [1926].)<br><br>Once Pooh realizes that he can make the decision to do it another way, he will find that he can go down stairs like everyone else. How many of us are like Pooh Bear? We get so stuck in a rut with the things we do and the decisions we make that we don't realize that there are other alternatives from which we can choose. This is how some of our habits form.<br><br>Most decisions we make are simple day-to-day decisions (e.g., what time we are going to get up, where we are going to go today, what entrée we are going to order from the menu). Other decisions get a little bit more complicated (e.g., what courses I will take, what job I will take, where I will live). And other decisions really require a lot of thought (e.g., whom I shall marry, what I need to do to retain the Spirit in my life, how I will demonstrate my love for the Savior). We are making these decisions every day of our lives, and we will yet make thousands more.<br><br>You have made one of the key decisions of your life: to work hard enough to graduate from one of the world's great institutions. Do you realize what that will mean to you? It doesn't mean that you simply survived. You have actually succeeded in accomplishing that for which you will be forever grateful. It doesn't matter whether you go on to work in the Church, at home, in your community, or in the workplace. You have made decisions and have taken the responsibility to succeed at something only a handful of people have ever done. In very deed you have prepared yourself for a life of service and continued learning by finding added meaning in your life through those experiences you have had here at BYU. The significance of that will unfold as the years pass.<br><br>Whatever your decisions, what I hope for you and what I pray for is that you will make the Lord a key part of those decisions, whether they are great or small. I also hope you will remember a little saying that has guided me for years. It goes something like this:<br><br><i>You are what you do;</i><br><i>You do what you choose.</i><br><i>If you don't like what you are,</i><br><i>Then change what you do.</i><br><br>It has always amazed me that by combining the powers of heaven and the power of personal responsibility, all things are possible--even going down stairs one step at a time.<br><br>Do you remember the last song from that great musical <i>The Wiz</i>? The Lion, the Scarecrow, and the Tin Man had joined Dorothy. They each wanted something that they didn't feel they had. As they traveled to the Emerald City, they had experiences that allowed them to arrive at thinking somewhat differently. By the end of the show, the Lion had realized his courage, the Tin Man had recognized his heart, and the Scarecrow had recognized his brains. Dorothy, however, was still unsure about how she was going to get back to Kansas. It was Glinda the Good who came to her and gave her the answer. She said, "Believe in yourself as I believe in you" ("Believe in Yourself," <i>The Wiz</i> [1978]).<br><br>My dear friends, we believe in you!<br><br>As president of the BYU Alumni Association, I hereby confer upon each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. We offer our congratulations and welcome you into this great association of more than 370,000 other alums. You will have many opportunities to join your fellow alumni over the years in meaningful activities associated with the university.<br><br>You are now a part of a great cadre of very talented people just like yourself. I hope that you will give back to BYU with your time, with your talents, and with your treasure. We need your time and talents to help others transition their lives from school to remarkable work lives.<br><br>We want to stay connected with you. We have chapters of alumni in various geographic locations throughout the country. We have employers who have significant alumni working in their corporations. You may also have the opportunity to provide some career mentoring. You will be contacted by LDS Philanthropies and invited to contribute of your treasure. Please accept those invitations and become fully involved with some of the greatest people you will ever meet. Please come back to visit and celebrate with us your successes and reinvigorate yourself with the Spirit of the Y. The world needs you, the Church needs you, your families need you, and we, as alumni, need you. Welcome!<br><br>I want to leave with you my testimony. I know that the gospel of Jesus Christ is true. I know that the work in which we are engaged is the work of the Lord. I know that His hand guides this great institution. God bless you in all that you do, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Terry R.

<br>
President Uchtdorf, President Samuelson, trustees, honored guests, distinguished faculty and staff, parents and family members, friends, and graduates: Dear brothers and sisters, it is an honor to be with you on this significant occasion. I offer my congratulations and deep respect for what you have achieved with the degrees now bestowed upon you. I acknowledge the years of commitment, sacrifice, and hard work that have occasioned your presence here today. I honor not only you graduates but also all the family members, friends, deans, professors, and university staff who have sustained you in so many ways. I highly commend all of you. President Samuelson, to you I offer my congratulations and appreciation for your eleven years of inspired leadership and devoted service to this outstanding university.<br><br>Following the kind introduction, I think it is appropriate for you to know of an incident in my educational past. Sister Cardon and I enjoyed living in the Boston area during our time at Harvard. For those of you who have lived in or visited the area, you know that the roads are sometimes full of curves over uneven terrain. At the end of the academic year I drove with Sister Cardon to the school to retrieve one of my final papers, whereupon I learned that although my final grade for the course was what I had hoped, the grade for this paper, although respectable, was not.<br><br>When we returned to the car, I handed the paper to Sister Cardon, and she began reading as we drove along a curvy, hilly road--not the best experience for one prone to motion nausea. After some time we came to a stop, and Sister Cardon put the paper down and said, "Honey, I just finished reading your paper, and I think I'm going to be sick."<br><br>My only response was, "I'm sorry you feel that way, dear, but evidently it had the same effect on the professor."<br><br>Over the years I have collected many quotations about education. One of my favorites comes from Sir Francis Bacon, an English statesman and philosopher. He identifies three central elements of education: reading, conference (or conferring with others), and writing. He says:<br><br><i>Reading maketh a full man; conference a ready man; and writing an exact man. And therefore, if a man write little, he had need have a great memory; if he confer little, he had need have a present wit: and if he read little, he had need have much cunning, to seem to know that he doth not.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>This observation is wise counsel to all who are engaged in educational pursuits, formal and informal. Reading, conferring, and writing all serve to exercise the mind, quicken the intellect, and discipline our expression--eliciting our very best. But unless reading, conferring, and writing have an essential spiritual element, they fall woefully short in pursuing the highest education available to us. In the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord admonishes us to "seek learning, even by study and also by faith."<sup>2</sup> This admonition suggests that the education God desires us to obtain embodies these two essential elements of study and faith--and that the absence of either study or faith compromises learning. Furthermore, this manner of learning invites us to engage in a never-ending commitment to continuing education. Indeed, though you will receive diplomas evidencing the attainment of a particular level of formal education, you now embark on a lifetime of learning--much of it exhilarating, most of it informal, and all of it of inestimable value.<br><br>Thirteen years ago I returned as a student to the formal classroom after a thirty-year absence. This experience afforded me the opportunity to examine important societal issues with honorable men and women of compatible and opposing views. Because most of the professors and other students held worldly views on many social issues, and because of the rigorous way we explored those issues, learning by faith in addition to learning by study was for me essential. It provided an inextinguishable flame of truth that enlightened every subject I encountered--in and out of the classroom.<br><br>This perspective is reflected in a host of scriptures<sup>3</sup> typified by the following words from Jacob:<br><br><i>O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish.</i><br><br><i>But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>And also these words of the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth.</i><br><br><i>Light and truth forsake that evil one.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>These and similar verses emphasize the importance of both gaining knowledge and ensuring that the knowledge we gain is founded in truth and is applied in a way that is consistent with the counsel of God.<br><br>It is in this light that, while I was preparing this address, the Lord brought to my attention a scriptural phrase I soon discovered to be unique to the Book of Mormon. This phrase, with its specific word content and sequencing, is not found in any other book of scripture. The phrase is simply this: "and thus we see."<sup>6</sup><br><br>Other related phrases unique to the Book of Mormon include "thus we see," "thus we may see," "we can behold," "we can see," and, finally, the descriptive and meaningful "and thus we can plainly discern."<sup>7</sup> Once again, these specific words in these specific sequences are found only in the Book of Mormon.<sup>8</sup><br><br>In total, the phrase "and thus we see" is used twenty-one times in the Book of Mormon. Not surprisingly, Mormon, the principal compiler of the book, uses this phrase sixteen times.<sup>9</sup><br><br>I would like to explore with you the educational values embedded in the phrase "and thus we see."<sup>10</sup> Those values have much to do with your continuing education. We will focus on how just two of the Book of Mormon writers, Mormon and Nephi, use this phrase.<br><br>We begin with Mormon. The first time Mormon employs this phrase is in abridging the account of the remarkable conversion of the Lamanites who changed their name to the Anti-Nephi-Lehies. Subsequently they presented themselves to be slaughtered by their former fellow Lamanites rather than risk offending God by using their swords against them. After recording these extraordinary events, Mormon observes:<br><br><i><b>And thus we see</b> that, when<b> these</b> Lamanites were brought to believe and to know the truth, they were firm, and would suffer even unto death rather than commit sin; <b>and thus we see</b> that . . . they buried the weapons of war, for peace.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>Mormon goes on to explain that the Anti-Nephi-Lehies "would lie down and perish, and praised God even in the very act of perishing under the sword."<sup>12</sup> In sharing this significant account of applied faith, Mormon explains:<br><br><i>Now when the</i> [other] <i>Lamanites saw this they did forbear from slaying them; and there were many whose hearts had swollen in them for those of their brethren who had fallen under the sword, for they repented of the things which they had done.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that they threw down their weapons of war, and they would not take them again, for they were stung for the murders which they had committed; and they came down even as their brethren, relying upon the mercies of those whose arms were lifted to slay them.</i><sup>13</sup><br><br>Mormon records that "the people of God were joined that day by more than the number who had been slain" and that "those who had been slain were righteous people, therefore we have no reason to doubt but what they were saved."<sup>14</sup> He then adds, "<i>Thus we see</i> that the Lord worketh in many ways to the salvation of his people."<sup>15</sup><br><br>But Mormon found even more in this account to help us see and discern. He continues:<br><br><i>Now the greatest number of those of the Lamanites who slew so many of their brethren were</i> [former Nephites], <i>the greatest number of whom were after the order of the Nehors.</i><br><br><i>Now, among those who joined the people of the Lord, there were none who were [former Nephites], <i>or who were of the order of Nehor.</i><sup>16</sup></i><br><br>With this sad commentary Mormon employs a phrase found only once in all of scripture:<br><br><i><b>And thus we can plainly discern,</b> that after a people have been once enlightened by the Spirit of God, and have had great knowledge of things pertaining to righteousness, and then have fallen away into sin and transgression, they become more hardened, and thus their state becomes worse than though they had never known these things.</i><sup>17</sup><br><br>Now, in light of the importance of continuing education and the Lord's admonition to "seek learning, even by study and also by faith," what is there in this account that Mormon invites us to see and discern with him?<br><br>Over a period of a few hundred years, Lamanite and Nephite cousins had been at war, fighting and killing each other. Certain mileposts in Mormon's earlier writings help us see how the Lamanites and Nephites got to this point. Recognizing these mileposts may help us avoid similar conflicts in our journey through life.<br><br>Lehi's family had been divided because of Laman's and Lemuel's hard hearts, by their desire to rule over others,<sup>18</sup> and by the contention they continually brought to their familial interactions.<sup>19</sup> Because they were unwilling to change, Nephi had attempted to distance himself from them by physical separation,<sup>20</sup> but this did not resolve the real problem. The Lamanites pursued the Nephites and battled them even in their new locations.<sup>21</sup> Hatred,<sup>22</sup> hard-heartedness,<sup>23</sup> pride,<sup>24</sup> murmuring,<sup>25</sup> rudeness,<sup>26</sup> and contention<sup>27</sup> were the real problems, and Laman and Lemuel were content in their contention.<br><br>Rudeness and contention offend conscience and often provoke one to assuage conscience through self-justification, and one's associates will not condone rudeness or contention without justification. Therefore Laman and Lemuel had to justify themselves and convince others of their justification. This they did by indoctrinating their families with messages of hatred for Nephi and his descendants.<sup>28</sup> Mormon sometimes referred to this pattern of self-justification and indoctrination as the incorrect "tradition of their fathers."<sup>29</sup> Indeed, he records that in an uninterrupted pattern, Lamanite parents had taught their children to hate their cousins over many generations.<sup>30</sup><br><br>Only through the exercise of faith by servants of the Lord, and through the operation of the Spirit, did the Lamanites finally come "to the knowledge of the truth [and] to the knowledge of the baseness of the traditions of their fathers, which were not correct."<sup>31</sup> By this means many lives were changed eternally and conflicts were resolved. This simple formula of exercising faith and the operation of the Spirit is the means to resolve hatred and contentions among today's families, nations, and peoples. Mormon saw the effect of it within the context of generations. We may do the same.<br><br>However, there is an even more egregious element associated with this account: the apostate Nephites after the order of Nehor.<br><br>Nehor was a man who taught two simple, intoxicating false doctrines against which the people of God in the Book of Mormon forever struggled thereafter and against which we struggle today. The first false doctrine is this: religious leaders should be popular and should be supported financially by the people.<sup>32</sup><br><br>The second false doctrine has profound spiritual implications: Don't worry about sinning because the Lord has redeemed all mankind, no matter what they do. In other words, because God is merciful, there is no wrong and no one need repent.<sup>33</sup><br><br>Alma identified these flattering concepts as priestcraft. When he encountered this false doctrine, he observed that "were priestcraft to be enforced among this people it would prove their entire destruction."<sup>34</sup><br><br>Indeed, priestcraft among the apostate Nephites nearly destroyed the Anti-Nephi-Lehies. In his account of these converted Lamanites, Mormon notes that while some hardened Lamanite hearts were softened when they saw their brethren prostrate themselves before them, the hearts of the apostate Nephites--those who had once known the truth and had then turned to the falsehoods perpetrated by Nehor--could not be penetrated. This was not only self-justification in the way they conducted themselves; it was self-justification as a foundational religious doctrine. And that doctrine is dangerously false.<br><br>In today's world the false doctrines of Nehor surround you. Popular propagandists supported by the people loudly proclaim that actions and lifestyles mocking God's commandments are merely acceptable expressions of individual freedoms. They say that if there is a God, He would not hold people accountable for such actions. This philosophy now permeates virtually every aspect of life.<br><br>It is not surprising, then, that Mormon uses the singularly unique phrase "and thus we can plainly discern" to help the spiritually inclined see the dangers of apostasy. In using this phrase Mormon employs the notion of discernment--of "seeing" with spiritual eyes and identifying the risks of sinning against light and knowledge.<br><br>Let us now consider the perspective of another writer in the Book of Mormon: Nephi. While Mormon's "and thus we see" comes from a perspective arising in part from patterns he saw occurring over centuries, Nephi's "and thus we see" comes from events he personally experienced. Like Mormon, Nephi derived lessons from those experiences for other aspects of life. We will look at his use of this phrase as it relates to the Liahona, which the Book of Mormon often refers to as "the ball."<br><br>While journeying in the wilderness, Nephi broke his bow. Because the bows of his brethren had "lost their springs,"<sup>35</sup> the family was unable to obtain food. In this precarious circumstance, most of the family began to murmur against the Lord. Nephi was the exception. Rather than murmur, he went to work. He "did make out of wood a bow, and out of a straight stick, an arrow; wherefore, [he] did arm [himself] with a bow and an arrow, with a sling and with stones."<sup>36</sup> Always respectful of the Lord's anointed, Nephi went to his father and asked where he should go to obtain food. Humbled by Nephi's faithfulness, Lehi inquired of the Lord. The Lord chastened Lehi and then told him to "look upon the ball, and behold the things which are written."<sup>37</sup><br><br>The record indicates that the writing on the Liahona directed Nephi to the top of the mountain, where he obtained food for the family. The record also indicates much more. When Lehi saw what was written, he and his entire family "did fear and tremble exceedingly."<sup>38</sup> That sounds like something more than just "go to the top of the mountain." Perceptive Nephi recognized that "the pointers which were in the ball . . . did work according to the faith and diligence and heed which we did give unto them."<sup>39</sup> He goes on to say that<br><br><i>there was also written upon them a new writing, which was plain to be read, which did give us understanding concerning the ways of the Lord; and it was written and changed from time to time, according to the faith and diligence which we gave unto it.</i><sup>40</sup><br><br>In this context Nephi says, "<i>And thus we see</i> that by small means the Lord can bring about great things."<sup>41</sup> Remember, it was Nephi's faithfulness--simply doing what he could to solve the problem without murmuring--that led the group to look at the Liahona for guidance. The resulting educational value for Nephi, Lehi, and the others far exceeded the physical understanding of where to find food. Nephi's "and thus we see" comes from his personal experience and from a much more narrow range of time than that which Mormon addressed.<br><br>In your continuing education, in your employment, in your families, and in life, you are going to face both kinds of circumstances. Some circumstances you encounter will be rooted in self-justifications that have been perpetuated over long periods of time. You will also face circumstances that are rooted in personal responses to immediate, direct challenges. In all of this, your education will be greatly enhanced by your ability to see the spiritual lessons and connections that evidence the true underlying principles that can lead to resolution. With that capacity you can also be "and thus we see" scholars.<br><br>I conclude with another story from my experience at Harvard. While there I unofficially audited a class jointly taught by three Harvard professors: a lawyer, a theologian, and a scientist. The title of the course was intriguing: "Thinking About Thinking."<br><br>The format of the class was to introduce subjects of societal interest, such as Religion and Violence or The Role of Dissent, and then examine each subject rigorously from the perspective of each of these three disciplines. In each session one of the professors would introduce the subject, and then each professor would explain the perspective of his discipline on it. The three professors would engage one another directly, often pointedly criticizing the lack of relevance or outright error he found in the other disciplines. These exchanges sometimes spilled over into the several hundred students gathered in the amphitheater classroom. I found it a remarkable experience.<br><br>One such session focused on the sources of authority in law, religion, and science--especially on matters of morality. Following the introduction by the theologian, the scientist simply observed that science creates moral dilemmas; it doesn't answer them. He noted, for example, that without science there would be no transplanting of human organs and therefore no black market for such organs. He had little to say thereafter.<br><br>The lawyer then stood and declared that there are only three sources of knowledge or authority: revelation, discovery (of something already existing), and invention. He then began a vigorous line of questioning, wanting to know from the theologian, in essence, the difference between religion and philosophy. The theologian's reply was, frankly, anemic. He acknowledged the contributions of philosophers and defined religion as a belief system and a body of believers. The lawyer was not satisfied, and with great animation he questioned why he or anyone else should consider religion's voice any more authoritative than philosophy's voice. He also demanded to know where there was any religious voice on earth even claiming to speak authoritatively in the name of God.<br><br>A few moments of awkward silence ensued as the theologian considered how he might respond. His next words were, for me, both unexpected and remarkable. He said, in essence: "Well, there was a man by the name of Joseph Smith who lived in the 1800s and claimed that God spoke to him, and he printed a book entitled the Book of Mormon that he claimed came from God and contains God's word for the world today. And the church that he founded, the Mormon Church, is directed today by those who claim to be prophets and apostles to whom God speaks."<br><br>The lawyer was momentarily silenced as he attempted to process what he had just heard. He then asked, in essence, "Well, is there anyone else?"<br><br>The theologian responded, "No."<br><br>The lawyer then continued his critique of religion, essentially ignoring what had just been "placed in evidence."<br><br>Although the response of this capable theologian was inconsistent with his own belief, in the press of the moment he had unwittingly identified the singular place where revealed truth and the preeminence of spiritual enlightenment in learning are found and taught. He had also affirmed their validity.<br><br>Surprising though this interchange was, especially in the environment in which I sat, the significance of what I had just witnessed was not lost on me. Nor was it lost on my nonmember colleagues, who, following the class, wondered why the lawyer had not engaged the response more directly. Not knowing the mind of the lawyer, I could only surmise that he was attempting to not give added attention to the one voice that directly and authoritatively refuted his premise.<br><br>As you leave this university and as your education continues, you will come to know more fully, as I have come to know, the essential place of spiritual elements in learning and teaching. Mormon expressed the principle well. Even with all of his preparation in abridging the Book of Mormon, with all of his reading, conferring, and writing, he wanted to be sure that we know what he knows above everything else:<br><br><i>And now I, Mormon, proceed to finish out my record . . . ; and I make it according to the knowledge and the understanding which God has given me.</i><sup>42</sup><br><br>As you continue your education, make sure you continue to develop an essential spiritual capacity, as the prophets have done, to see as the Source of all knowledge sees and thereby know and understand as He knows and understands.<sup>43</sup> In these continuing efforts, may the unique Book of Mormon phrase "and thus we see" typify and be a reminder to you of the spiritual capacity you are developing.<br><br>No matter what challenges or uncertainties you face, I pray that you will always faithfully employ this essential spiritual element in your learning. I promise that as you enthusiastically embrace this spiritual element, you and your families will receive everlasting blessings.<br><br>Congratulations, and may the Lord's blessings rest upon you. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Craig A.

There are two other similar phrases in the Book of Mormon that are also in other scriptures, but these phrases in other scriptures rarely convey the same significance as those in the Book of Mormon. Those phrases are "we see" (Alma 9:14; 12:24; 19:23, 36; 26:37; 29:8; 37:26; 42:3; 46:10; 50:21; Helaman 3:29; Psalms 36:9; 74:9; Jeremiah 5:12; John 9:41; Romans 8:25; 1 Corinthians 13:12; Hebrews 2:8, 9; 3:19) and "we may see" (Helaman 12:2; 2 Nephi 15:19; Isaiah 5:19; Mark 15:32; John 6:30). Other derivations include "we saw" and "we shall see." There is one similar phrase unique to the Doctrine and Covenants. It is "and thus we saw" (D&amp;amp;C 76:89, 91, 92).<br><br>9. Occurrences of "And thus we see":<br><br>Nephi--2<br>Antionah (quoted)--1<br>Alma--1<br>Mormon--16<br>Moroni--1<br><br>10. Given the divinely unique role of the Book of Mormon in this dispensation as another testament of Jesus Christ and the extraordinarily unique circumstances surrounding its writing, its preservation, its translation, and its publication, if there is a phrase unique to the book, this one seems to be particularly well suited.<br><br>11.

Generationally, Alma also had direct, personal experience that influenced his counsel against the dangers of these two false doctrines of Nehor when he and Amulek encountered the people of Ammonihah.

<h1>urance of Things Hoped For” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning, my brothers and sisters. Thank you for being here today. I pray that we may share some insights that will lift and encourage our spirits and help us in our pursuit of excellence. My message is based on a statement made by Elder Jeffrey R. Holland back in the fall of 1981, when he stated: "The opportunity of a lifetime has to be taken in the lifetime of the opportunity" ("Virtus et Veritas," in<i>BYU 1981–82 Fireside and Devotional Speeches</i> [Provo: Brigham Young University, 1982], p. 12). This morning let us look at opportunity in light of faith, opposition, and friendly support.<br><br>It is an honor to be with you today. When I received the invitation to speak, I thought back on how devotionals have been an important part of my life for more than thirty years. One of the first devotionals I remember was when I was a freshman at the school formerly known as Ricks College. I was raised in a faithful LDS home, and my patriarchal blessing said that I was blessed with a testimony through my earthly parents, which was true. But I was determined to strengthen my personal testimony of the restored gospel before serving a full-time mission.<br><br>At age eighteen I also had another gospel-related concern. I grew up in the Pacific Northwest, and most of my friends, neighbors, teachers, and coaches were not members of the Church. Using my developing powers of observation, I noticed that many of these people seemed to be happy, and many were interesting characters with a healthy sense of humor. My concern was that, up to that time in my life, my limited observations of senior Church leaders suggested that they were quite formal and proper. As a young man I had this nagging question: Would the highest degree of glory in heaven be a very nice but humorless place?<br><br>The devotional speaker in January 1982 was the oldest living apostle, ninety-five-year-old LeGrand Richards. Elder Richards was seven years old in 1893 and in attendance when President Wilford Woodruff dedicated the Salt Lake Temple.<br><br>Elder Richards rarely delivered a message from a written text. He spoke from his heart, drawing upon a lifetime of experience, study, and inspiration. I'd like to share a minute of his remarks so that you can get a sense of Elder LeGrand Richards. At this point in his message he is talking about a Sunday School conference he attended as a boy. The conference was taught by Brothers Karl G. Maeser and George Goddard of the general Sunday School presidency.<br><br><i>I can remember to this day--and it has been over 80 years--the songs Brother Goddard taught us to sing in that Sunday School conference. And when I didn't know I couldn't sing, I tried to sing with them. I don't do it anymore.</i><br><br><i>The first song goes like this: "Take away the whiskey, the coffee, and the tea. Cold water is the drink for me." And then it repeats and goes on. That made such an impression on me as a boy that I've hardly been able to drink anything but cold water since that time.</i><br><br><i>I was riding on the train a few years back--when we used to travel by train--headed for California. I went in the diner in the morning for breakfast, and the waiter said, "Are you ready for your coffee?"</i><br><br><i>"No, thank you."</i><br><br><i>"Would you like some tea?"</i><br><br><i>"No, thank you."</i><br><br><i>"Will you have some Postum?"</i><br><br><i>"No, thank you."</i><br><br><i>"Would you like a glass of milk?"</i><br><br><i>"No, thank you."</i><br><br><i>"What do you want to drink?"</i><br><br><i>I said, "A glass of cold water, please."</i><br><br><i>He said, "You're the funniest man I ever did see."</i> ["His Life Experiences," BYU–Idaho devotional address, 19 January 1982]<br><br>Elder Richards was a man of wit and good humor. My concerns about fitting in with people who qualified to return to our Heavenly Father simply faded away that day. More important, as I listened to Elder Richards speak from his heart and share his experiences and testimony, my faith in the Restoration deepened. He was a man of unwavering conviction of the truthfulness of the gospel. Here is a typical Elder Richards statement:<br><br><i>I truly love the work more than anything else in this world, and I know it is true. I could live better without the limbs of my body than I could without the testimony of the Holy Ghost and the Spirit of the Lord.</i> [<i>CR,</i> April 1952, 112; quoted in "<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1983/02/elder-legrand-richards-dies-beloved-apostle-missionary-friend?lang=eng">Elder LeGrand Richards Dies: Beloved Apostle, Missionary, Friend</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> February 1983, 6]<br><br>The fact that Elder Richards had personal connections to President Wilford Woodruff, who was a member of Zion's Camp, and to his great-uncle Willard Richards, who was in Carthage Jail with Joseph and Hyrum Smith, made the restoration of the gospel all that more real to me. After the devotional I stood in a long line to shake Elder Richards' hand. I consider that day and the increased faith and testimony I received a tender mercy. I had no doubt that Elder Richards knew the gospel to be true, but I, like you, needed to continue to build my testimony line upon line, precept upon precept.<br><h2><strong>The Extrarational Process of Obtaining Knowledge</strong></h2><br>After my mission I attended BYU for a semester, and I would have earned a degree here if it were not for a certain special young lady who later became my wife. Tina was a flight attendant based out of Seattle. After we were married, I transferred to the University of Washington to finish my degree.<br><br>I had an interesting experience in one of my first classes at the University of Washington. It was a large general education class, and the professor was obviously very smart and accomplished. He and his graduate teaching assistant had an exchange during one class in which they seemed to be criticizing religion. I went up after class and, based on my improving powers of observation, I said to the professor that it seemed to me he was criticizing people with religious beliefs.<br><br>As an aside, do you know what Yogi Berra, the famous baseball player, said about observation? He said, "You can observe a lot by watching" (see Yogi Berra, <i>You Can Observe a Lot by Watching: What I've Learned About Teamwork from the Yankees and Life</i> [Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley and Sons, 2008]).<br><br>I don't remember much from that college class, but I do remember the professor's response that day. He said, "Yes, we find that the more education people get, the less they need the crutch of religion."<br><br>That sounds similar to a warning in the Book of Mormon:<br><br><i>O that cunning plan of the evil one! O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish.</i> [2 Nephi 9:28]<br><br>I have met people who were once active members of the Church but who had set religion aside as they obtained additional learning. However, we know that education and learning are not inherently bad. The next verse in 2 Nephi 9 states, "But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God" (verse 29).<br><br>After completing my undergraduate degree, I worked in Seattle for a few years and then returned to the university to pursue a PhD. In graduate school I was trained in the scientific method, which is a rigorous and careful approach to gaining knowledge.<br><br>My area of professional specialty involves procedures and techniques used by professional accountants to evaluate the fairness of financial statement information. Financial statements tell the story of the performance of the company and its management. Professional accountants verify the fairness of what management reports by gathering and evaluating relevant and reliable information. They gather enough evidence to provide a high degree of assurance that the statements are fair. I will come back to the word <i>assurance</i> later.<br><br>This method of obtaining evidence and knowledge, like the scientific method, is similar to your academic work. In an excellent speech, former BYU president Rex E. Lee called this method of knowing "the rational process."<br><br>He said:<br><br><i>The rational process is the one that you are accustomed to using in your academic work. Its tools should be familiar to all of you: reading, analysis, research, criticism, and, generally, problem resolution by thoughtful inquiry. Properly applied, it is a strenuous, taxing, and frequently frustrating experience</i> [that] <i>results in the strengthening of our ability to use these processes.</i> ["By Study and Also by Faith," in <i>Educating Zion,</i> ed. John W. Welch and Don E. Norton (Provo: BYU Studies, 1996), 133]<br><br>Through your past and present academic efforts, you are becoming increasingly expert in acquiring knowledge using the rational method. Our Church leaders have repeatedly reminded us of the importance of this method. Modern-day revelation emphasizes we are to seek learning "by study and also by faith" and wisdom "out of the best books" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118).<br><br>There is another method of knowing. President Lee called it "the extrarational process," which comes through contact with godly things and revelation. He said: "The methods are not the same [as the rational process]. The results are much surer, though they are not as susceptible to our own control. . . . Extrarational learning takes a great variety of forms" (<i>Educating Zion,</i> 133, 136–37). It is this extrarational process that I want to explore further with you today.<br><br>President Lee noted that there is a tendency for those who become strong in rational processes to downplay the importance of the extrarational. Perhaps people believe that being excellent in rational processes compensates for being weak in extrarational processes.<br><br>The Bible Dictionary states: "Knowledge of divine and spiritual things is absolutely essential for one's salvation. . . . Knowledge is not obtained all at once, even by revelation, but line upon line, precept upon precept" (s.v. "knowledge," 721).<br><br>I have observed people fall away from the gospel and the Church of Jesus Christ. At least one of the reasons is that their rational skills seem stronger than their extrarational skills. One young person who has distanced himself from the Church said he recognizes the many good aspects of the Church and the gospel, but he currently doesn't see a need for organized religion. Another who has been out of the Church for several years said he wouldn't be surprised if he returned to church someday; he is just waiting for the right feeling that he should return. These comments seem to reflect a misunderstanding of important elements of the extrarational process.<br><br>In Hebrews 11:1 we read, "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."<br><br>If you look to the Joseph Smith translation of this verse, it reads, "Now faith is the <i>assurance</i> of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen" (JST, Hebrews 11:1; emphasis added).<br><br>There is that word--<i>assurance.</i> Recall that for professional accountants, obtaining a high degree of assurance involves a systematic process of gathering and evaluating evidence. I realize that there is a small chance that when you read the word <i>assurance</i> that you don't initially or automatically link it to the work of professional accountants.<br><br>My daughters, who are sitting here in the front, will tell you that while not all accountants are boring, they can get pretty excited about seemingly boring things.<br><br>So "faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." Is there a systematic way to apply extrarational processes to obtain a high degree of assurance of things hoped for? By applying these processes, could we someday even reach the level of assurance obtained by someone like Elder LeGrand Richards?<br><h2><strong>A Sincere and Humble Desire</strong></h2><br>A number of years ago our family moved to the beautiful little township of Basking Ridge, New Jersey. I was on a two-year professional development leave from BYU while I worked for a large firm headquartered in New York City. Our neighbor, the town historian, was surprised to learn we would be driving twenty-five minutes to attend the LDS Church when our township had three perfectly good and beautiful historic Christian churches.<br><br>After a couple of weeks in our new ward, the bishop extended a home teaching assignment to me to visit John and Nancy Ferderber. John was a retired business executive, and it looked to me like he was probably a former bishop. I was surprised to learn that he was not a member of the Church. His wife, Nancy, and children were members, and he had been very supportive of his children's Church involvement, missions, and temple marriages. He even attended sacrament meeting with Nancy. John had also always been supportive of the youth and Scouting midweek activities. He shared his enthusiasm for sports with the youth, and he was the longtime Young Women basketball coach. He was particularly skilled at starting with Beehives and, through instruction and practice, turning them into ball players.<br><br>John described himself as a dry Mormon and said he always felt welcomed by the members but had difficulty accepting all that went along with being a Mormon.<br><br>I remember our early visits with John and Nancy. John was quite interested in the business reasons for our move to New Jersey. I explained that when we came on home teaching visits, in addition to catching up and finding out how they were doing, we would be sharing a brief gospel message. John agreed. However, I quickly learned that he knew the home teaching drill very well. One time my lesson apparently wasn't brief enough, and before I was done he simply turned to my young companion and said, "How about that closing prayer?" which meant he had had enough for the day.<br><br>As we were teaching lessons of the Restoration, I asked John what his religious beliefs were. He said, "Steve, I'll tell you. I was baptized Catholic. I wasn't all that religious as a younger man, and now I choose to attend the Mormon Church." Then he said, "So you see, Steve, I've already been baptized."<br><br>I smiled and reminded him that we believed he would need to be baptized again by one holding the priesthood.<br><br>To which John said, "I understand, and maybe one of these days I'll take care of that."<br><br>Nancy, who had never given up hope, looked over at John and said, "What do you mean, one of these days? You are not getting any younger."<br><br>A year or so went by, during which time the full-time missionaries checked in on John and reported back that he was the nicest man but was not ready to accept the gospel. He kept attending sacrament meeting and accepting our home teaching visits, and as long as it was good-natured, he let me talk of how someday he would be joining the Church.<br><br>Then John had very serious health challenges that required several surgeries. After we gave him a blessing in the hospital, John told us he had been impressed that this life is the time to carefully and seriously consider the things of heaven. He told me that if he made it through the surgery, he would commit to retaking the missionary lessons.<br><br>After the surgery he said he felt watched over and realized he had been granted another chance. There were health complications and months of recovery, and through it all John's heart continued to soften. The prayers of his wife, children, grandchildren, ward members, and loved ones were heard, and he started to openly discuss the possibility, even the likelihood, of being baptized. Our two-year leave from BYU came to a close, and John's health situation was such that he was still months away from being well enough to be baptized. We returned to BYU and promised that we would travel back to New Jersey for his baptism.<br><br>When he was ready that following October, John walked up to the full-time missionaries at church and asked them what he would need to do in order to be baptized in early November.<br><br>It was a beautiful service. Imagine the scene as John entered the baptismal font with a large group of loved ones standing by--including Nancy and his children and many grandchildren--who had prayed for this day for so many years. When John came up out of the water, he smiled and raised his hands in celebration, and then, spontaneously, there went out a loud cheer from all those beautiful grandchildren and family members. It is the first and only time I have attended a baptism at which such a loud and joyous cheer went out, but, under the circumstances, it was totally appropriate.<br><br>John and Nancy were sealed in the temple a year later, and that was more than ten years ago now. John said he was so pleased to fulfill the promise in Nancy's patriarchal blessing that she would be married to an elder in the Church. Together they served as workers in the Manhattan New York Temple, and they have served two Church service missions. We are honored that John and Nancy are here with us today.<br><br>What lessons from John's experience do we learn about gaining assurance from extrarational processes? We certainly see the power of a loving and faithful wife and family who offered countless prayers in John's behalf. John also felt welcomed by the Saints. In the Book of Mormon Alma taught that the extrarational process often begins with a humble and basic desire to believe. As the word of God is planted like a seed in our hearts, it will begin to swell, provide enlightenment, and enlarge the soul (see Alma 32:28). John was humble, he had a desire, and he acted upon the spiritual promptings he received.<br><br>I remember talking to John on the phone in the weeks that followed his baptism. He was learning so much about the gospel and was surprised and a little nervous to be invited to teach the priesthood lesson. What was clear is that even though John had sat through hundreds of sacrament meeting talks, without the benefit of the gift of the Holy Ghost, he had not retained much of that teaching.<br><br>To apply extrarational processes, we must have a sincere and humble desire to gain knowledge, and we must act in response to spiritual promptings. The Holy Ghost is the great facilitator in obtaining assurance of spiritual things. If we ever find ourselves just going through the motions of attending Sunday meetings or offering prayers without a sincere and heartfelt desire, we need to recognize that this is not an effective application of our extrarational processes.<br><br>As a teenager David O. McKay desired to obtain his own witness of the truth. He described riding his horse into the hills to a secluded place to offer a fervent prayer, asking God for a testimony of the gospel. He expected that there would be a manifestation that would remove all doubt. As he was riding home after his prayer, he pondered on the events:<br><br><i>I remember rather introspectively searching myself and involuntarily shaking my head, saying to myself, "No sir, there is no change; I am just the same boy I was before I knelt down." The anticipated manifestation had not come.</i> ["Testimony . . . the Most Precious Gift," <i>Treasures of Life,</i> comp. Clare Middlemiss (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1962), 229–30; quoted in <i>Teachings of Presidents of the Church: David O. McKay</i> (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2003), 164]<br><br>Even though President McKay did not receive right away the manifestation he had expected, he continued to apply extrarational processes of humbly seeking with sincere desire and choosing to live a righteous life. He said, "The spiritual manifestation for which I had prayed as a boy in my teens came as a natural sequence to the performance of duty" ("The Prayer of Youth," <i>Cherished Experiences from the Writings of President David O. McKay,</i> comp. Clare Middlemiss, rev. ed. [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1976], 7; quoted in <i>Teachings of Presidents: McKay,</i> 164).<br><br>Answers to our prayers may not always come in an immediate and direct response to prayer or at the time or manner we anticipate, but they do come as we continue to do the will of God, and they come at a time and in a manner that is in our best interest.<br><h2><strong>Taking Action to Receive Assurance</strong></h2><br>My great-great-grandfather, Morris David Rosenbaum, was born in Germany in 1831 to a Jewish family. At eleven years old he asked the rabbi why there were no more prophets or temples. The rabbi explained that those things were no longer needed because the Old Testament was complete and contained all the necessary patterns. At age nineteen Morris traveled to New York City for business, and some years later he traveled to San Francisco. In his travels he heard about a Mormon settlement and was impressed to visit. His religious discussions with the Mormon settlers made little impression on him, although he recorded in his journal that the Mormons were the best people he had come into contact with.<br><br>Morris applied an important principle in obtaining assurance of things hoped for when he described the Mormons as the best people he had come into contact with. He recognized the fruits of the gospel. The Savior taught, "Every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. . . . Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them" (Matthew 7:17, 20).<br><br>As you apply extrarational processes, use your powers of observation to look around and examine the fruits of the gospel of Jesus Christ and His restored Church. Do you see the blessing it can be in people's lives and in their families? Do you see the peace and joy that comes, under any circumstance, to those who faithfully live the gospel? I know I have.<br><br>When the settlement of Mormons relocated to Utah, Morris decided to travel with them to spend the winter in Utah. He then planned to return to Germany. In Salt Lake City he heard Elder Heber C. Kimball speak, and he recorded in his journal that it seemed he had heard that sermon before because he could anticipate what Elder Kimball was going to say.<br><br>Morris then met Brother Neibaur, a member of the Church who was from Germany and also of Jewish descent. Morris and Brother Neibaur had several discussions about the gospel of Jesus Christ. At first Morris could not believe, as the teachings were so different from the teachings of his childhood. Little by little he became more interested, and a peaceful, teachable spirit fell upon him.<br><br>However, listen to what he records next in his journal: "When I listened to my selfish thoughts it seemed to me I was deceived. I hated Mormonism and regretted ever hearing it." Morris described selfish thoughts perhaps because he knew the likely reaction from his parents if he were to join the Church.<br><br>As we use our extrarational processes to gather assurance of things hoped for, will we encounter selfish or doubting thoughts? Absolutely!<br><br>We know that particularly in these latter days, gospel principles will be attacked, and those attacks may come through seemingly rational arguments. When our beliefs are challenged, we have the opportunity to choose the peace and protection that comes through faith. Faith is not a free gift. The Savior described action when he invited, "Come unto me" (Matthew 11:28) and "Knock, and it shall be [given] you" (Matthew 7:7). President Thomas S. Monson said, "Remember that doubt and faith cannot exist in the mind at the same time, for one will dispel the other. Whereas doubt destroys, faith fulfills" ("<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/thomas-s-monson_great-expectations-2/">Great Expectations</a>," BYU devotional address, 11 January 2009).<br><br>When Morris examined the fruits of his thoughts, he noticed that whenever he would determine to have nothing more to do with Mormonism there was darkness, but when he studied the Book of Mormon and went to meetings, he felt surrounded by a peaceful influence and felt he was being instructed the principles of the gospel by an unseen power.<br><br>Morris recorded in his journal that one time after Brother Neibaur bore his testimony of the gospel, Morris asked, "Mr. Neibaur, why cannot I have such a testimony?"<br><br>Brother Neibaur replied, "Mr. Rosenbaum, I promise you in the name of Israel's God you will if you obey the principles of the gospel, repent, and be baptized for the remission of sin, then ask prayerfully your Heavenly Father for it."<br><br>Morris longed for such, and a few days later he chose to be baptized and confirmed a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. President Brigham Young later sealed Morris and his wife in the Salt Lake Temple, and several years later Morris served a mission to Germany. By the way, my Grandfather Glover was also named Morris, and my middle name is Morris.<br><br>We learn important principles about applying extrarational processes from my great-great-grandfather's story. We must repent and be obedient, and we must often take action before receiving the desired witness. Morris also read the Book of Mormon from cover to cover and had a strong conviction that the book was written by inspiration.<br><h2><strong>Obtaining a High Degree of Assurance</strong></h2><br>It is said that when we wish to communicate with God, we do so through prayer, and when God wishes to communicate with us, it is often through the scriptures. Our son, who is currently serving in the Australia Melbourne Mission, has worked with people who have sought baptism after finding answers to important questions in the Book of Mormon. We learn in Alma 37 that the scriptures are our own personal Liahona. My experience is that it doesn't matter so much where in the scriptures we are reading and pondering; the act of studying and pondering opens the windows of heaven.<br><br>Using my now-keen powers of observation, I can tell you that the assurance you do obtain through extrarational processes can and will fade if you get lax in your church attendance, scripture study, and personal prayer. In Alma 32 we learn that even if the seed is good and grows into a tree that produces good fruit, if we neglect the tree it will wither away. It withers not because the seed is not good or the fruit is not delicious but rather because of the neglect and lack of nourishment.<br><br>I testify that by the proper application of our extrarational processes there is a systematic path leading to a high degree of assurance of things hoped for, even knowledge and a surety of divine and spiritual things.<br><br>I will close with a promise from our beloved prophet, President Thomas S. Monson, who in a BYU devotional taught:<br><br><i>To those who humbly seek, there is no need to stumble or falter along the pathway leading to truth. It is well marked by our Heavenly Father. We must first have a desire to know for ourselves. We must study. We must pray. We must do the will of the Father. And then we will know the truth, and the truth will make us free. Divine favor will attend those who humbly seek it. That is a promise which I leave with you. Think of it.</i> ["<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/thomas-s-monson_great-expectations-2/">Great Expectations</a>"]<br><br>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Steven M. Glover was a professor in the BYU School of Accountancy and associate dean of the BYU Marriott School of Management when this devotional address was given on 13 May 2014.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>es into Strength in Our Search for Knowledge - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am grateful for the opportunity the administration affords me to speak to you today. I am particularly grateful for the friends and family who have gathered here to support me and for the special privilege of having my father and my mother, Larry and Kathy Hickman, in the audience. So much of what I have been able to become is due to them.<br><br>In the next few minutes I hope to make the case that through the grace of Christ's Atonement both you and I have been given the chance to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost in our reading, writing, and speaking in ways that will open our eyes to new knowledge and to better ways of thinking about the challenges that beset us.<br><br>For me, one of the most intriguing chapters of the Book of Mormon is Ether 12, in which Moroni pauses in his translation of the Jaredite record to catalogue the many miracles that occurred because of faith put into action. Partway through this list Moroni seems to face a crisis of his own faith--at least as it touches upon the future reception of the scriptural record that he is creating for an audience in our day and time. He writes:<br><br><i>And I said unto him: Lord, the Gentiles will mock at these things, because of our weakness in writing; for Lord thou hast made us mighty in word by faith, but thou hast not made us mighty in writing; for thou hast made all this people that they could speak much, because of the Holy Ghost which thou hast given them;</i><br><br><i>And thou hast made us that we could write but little, because of the awkwardness of our hands. Behold, thou hast not made us mighty in writing like unto the brother of Jared, for thou madest him that the things which he wrote were mighty even as thou art, unto the overpowering of man to read them.</i><br><br><i>Thou hast also made our words powerful and great, even that we cannot write them; wherefore, when we write we behold our weakness, and stumble because of the placing of our words; and I fear lest the Gentiles shall mock at our words.</i> [Ether 12:23–25]<br><br>As an English professor whose own work focuses on twentieth-century and contemporary American literary history, several aspects of Moroni's concerns interest me. First, Moroni's sense of our time--that it would be an era characterized, among other things, by "mockery"--strikes me as unusually perceptive. Ours is indeed an age whose dominant mode is that of irony. On the heels of two world wars and many other regional ones, in the wake of some of the worst genocides in history, and in the aftermath of countless scandals in politics, business, and even religion, irony emerges in our day as a kind of cultural defense mechanism, a way of acknowledging that since things are rarely what they appear to be, nothing should be taken without the proverbial grain of salt.<br><br>In our day we luxuriate in an unprecedented omnipresence of information but paradoxically distrust this information more than ever because of its potential for manipulation or deceit. Also, the ability today to simulate reality has become so good that we live in a state that cultural critic Jean Baudrillard famously termed as "the generation by models of a real without origin or reality: a hyperreal," perhaps even "the desert of the real itself."<sup>1</sup><br><br>Under these conditions, some in our time allow cynicism to convince them that we have no way of knowing anything for sure, and many now frame the word <i>truth</i> in scare quotes to signal, even at the level of punctuation, a suspicion of the very notion of truth itself. In such a climate, conspiracy theory too often triumphs over systematic intellectual inquiry, and humankind--with its seemingly infinite capacity for what Pulitzer Prize–winning author Marilynne Robinson calls "self-befuddlement"--can "generate ideas that, however potent, are really, truly, and at very best worthless."<sup>2</sup> Such is the widespread societal confusion described by Isaiah and quoted to us again by Nephi of our present-day world "as a dream of a night vision" in which<br><br><i>it shall be unto</i> [us], <i>even as unto a hungry man which dreameth, and behold he eateth but he awaketh and his soul is empty; or like unto a thirsty man which dreameth, and behold he drinketh but he awaketh and behold he is faint, and his soul hath appetite.</i> [2 Nephi 27:3; see also Isaiah 29:8]<br><br>In an era like ours of existential disappointment and disillusion, of cynicism and confusion, why wouldn't irony and mockery reign not just as an avenue for humor but also as a paradigm for making one's way through life?<br><br>Second, Moroni's notion that our age, perhaps more than the ages that have preceded it, would focus on weaknesses in writing--and upon flaws in language generally--seems especially prophetic. Early in the twentieth century certain lines of inquiry in linguistics, philosophy, psychology, and cultural studies converged in their views about how language worked and to what degree it was determinative of human consciousness and agency. For a variety of reasons investigators in these fields increasingly realized the inherent arbitrariness in the words and other symbols we use to represent the concepts we want to relate and saw in that arbitrariness the capacity for miscommunication, misreading, and even misdirection. If this flawed language was perhaps constitutive of even our most basic sense of the reality we inhabit, how could we trust words to carry truth in the ways that earlier generations had imagined were possible?<br><br>To some degree I see this dilemma anticipated in our own eighth Article of Faith--"We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly"--signaling a recognition on the part of the Prophet Joseph Smith that even scriptural language, especially when passed from one person to another through the ages and subjected to the process of translation (or, in some cases, mistranslation), could lose some of the power of its original signification along the way.<br><br>Finally, Moroni's worry about the placement of his words--that they would cause him to "stumble" in his scriptural prose--hits at the heart of my writerly self, as I too have often worried about the same thing. I suspect that you students have all felt this too--perhaps late at night, your brain fogged by a lack of sleep and the stupor brought on by too much junk food, as you try to finish a paper for one of your classes. Take that worry and magnify it many times over as you imagine the pressure on poor Moroni struggling with his translation, wondering how he might possibly capture the power of the original Jaredite record in his own clunky reformed Egyptian, and knowing that his eventual audience might make fun of whatever words he chose.<br><br>Thankfully for Moroni's sake, the Lord offers him consolation through a formula that we, like Moroni, would do well to understand:<br><br><i>And when I had said this, the Lord spake unto me, saying: Fools mock, but they shall mourn; and my grace is sufficient for the meek, that they shall take no advantage of your weakness;</i><br><br><i>And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</i><br><br><i>Behold, I will show unto the Gentiles their weakness, and I will show unto them that faith, hope and charity bringeth unto me--the fountain of all righteousness.</i> [Ether 12:26–28]<br><br>In His answer the Lord signals several truths to Moroni. First, He underscores the importance of weakness--in this case, both of readerly weakness and writerly weakness--in bringing Moroni and his eventual audience to a key choice: whether or not to choose humility as an opportunity to exert faith and to learn.<br><br>Moroni, it would appear, needed to be humble and meek in accepting that his writing was always going to need the Lord's grace to work correctly as scripture. Moroni's readers need to be humble and meek in not taking advantage of his weaknesses--those likely found in the scriptural writing itself and perhaps also in Moroni's briefly faltering faith that his writing would do what it was supposed to do when the time came. Once humility is in place for all parties, enabled by the grace of Christ's Atonement, then both Moroni and his audience can exert faith so that weak things can become strong for all involved, especially if those receiving Moroni's words are filled with charity, which will enable them not to take advantage of his weaknesses.<br><br>In 1903 my great-great-grandfather Josiah E. Hickman, then head of the physics department at BYU, addressed in a speech the importance of faith in discovering new knowledge. A portion of that speech was reprinted in the student newspaper, the <i>White and Blue:</i><br><br><i>Columbus believed the earth round; Stevenson believed vehicles could be drawn by means of steam; Morse believed that thought could be flashed over wire by the aid of electricity; Marconi believed thoughts could be broadcast without a tangible medium; Joseph Smith believed that God could and would reveal himself. A faith in all of these unproved realities, accompanied with action, became household truths of a startled world. Faith is the harmonious struggle of all the powers of the mind towards knowing some unproved truth. . . . Without it, man becomes dead to the future and turns idolator to the present.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>How does the grace of the Lord enable our faith to help us to know truth and to avoid, as my great-great-grandfather said, becoming dead to the future and an "idolator to the present," especially since those of us gathered here today have devoted significant time and resources in the pursuit of true knowledge? Moroni himself gives us the answer in the final chapter of the Book of Mormon in what we often call Moroni's promise:<br><br><i>And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.</i><br><br><i>And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.</i> [Moroni 10:4–5]<br><br>While we know this scripture first and foremost as the invitation to read and study the Book of Mormon and to learn that it is true, what Moroni outlines here, especially in the final sentence of his promise, frames a pattern for how earnest seekers of knowledge about a wide variety of subjects may be led to truth time and again.<br><br>The pattern of humility, of faith, and of weak things--in this sense, our weakness of knowledge--being made strong unto us by the Spirit is echoed over and over in the scriptures. Nephi writes:<br><br><i>For he that diligently seeketh shall find; and the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto them, by the power of the Holy Ghost, as well in these times as in times of old, and as well in times of old as in times to come; wherefore, the course of the Lord is one eternal round.</i> [1 Nephi 10:19]<br><br>We are even told that the knowledge of truth is inseparable from the Spirit, and we read in the Doctrine and Covenants that we<br><br><i>were also in the beginning with the Father; that which is Spirit, even the Spirit of truth;</i><br><br><i>And truth is knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 93:23–24]<br><br>If the acquisition of knowledge is an act of humility and faith on our part that is powered by personal revelation from the Holy Ghost, then we need to do all we can to take full advantage of the gift of the Holy Ghost in our lives. About one month ago I had the privilege of baptizing and confirming my youngest son, Isaac, a member of the Church of Jesus Christ. As part of his confirmation I told him--just as those of you who have been baptized and confirmed have been told--to "receive the Holy Ghost." I believe that when we receive the Holy Ghost we receive not only the gift of a constant companion who can steer us to good choices instead of bad ones and can help us avoid temptation and danger but also a powerful teacher who can guide us to new knowledge that we can contribute to the world. How many of us have truly received the Holy Ghost as we were enjoined to do at our confirmations?<br><br>At the semiannual general conference of the Church in October 1958, Joseph Fielding Smith, then president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, made the following observation and offered the following caution:<br><br><i>However, it is my judgment that there are many members of this Church who have been baptized for the remission of their sins, who have had hands laid upon their heads for the gift of the Holy Ghost, who have never received that gift, that is, the manifestations of it. Why? Because they have never put themselves in order to receive these manifestations. They have never humbled themselves. They have never taken the steps that would prepare them for the companionship of the Holy Ghost. Therefore they go through life without that knowledge, and they have not the understanding. . . .</i><br><br><i>Now the Lord would give us gifts. He will quicken our minds. He will give us knowledge that will clear up all difficulties, and put us in harmony with the commandments that he has given us, and with a knowledge that will be so deeply rooted in our souls that the knowledge can never be rooted out, if we will just seek for the light and the truth and the understanding which is promised to us, and which we can receive if we will only be true and faithful to every covenant and obligation pertaining to the gospel of Jesus Christ.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>In my own imperfect experience, this process of humble and faithful inquiry leads to inspiration and knowledge about many things, even solutions to problems I have faced in my professional life here at BYU. These are undoubtedly some of the gifts to which President Smith refers.<br><br>One thing that people outside of academia, and often even students at universities, don't know is that when professors undergo a bid for tenure, it is an all-or-nothing proposition: either professors earn tenure (or what BYU calls "continuing faculty status") and have a nice measure of job security or they do not earn tenure, which results in their dismissal from the university, usually after another year is given to them so that they can secure another job elsewhere. Thus, while the reward of tenure is high, so is the risk--and so is the stress of getting there. In my pre-tenure years I worked assiduously to shore up my teaching, my publication record, and my service to the department and college so that I would meet the standard when the time came and so that I would establish good habits for my post‑tenure career.<br><br>In one particular case I had the opportunity to publish one of my essays in a book by a prominent university press, but while the initial drafting and submission of the piece had gone smoothly, I struggled with getting the revised essay just the way the editor wanted it. To make matters worse, I had a long professional relationship with the editor of the book, so my repeated failed attempts to successfully revise the essay to meet the reviewers' expectations embarrassed me, as my friend had to tell me that the essay still wasn't the way it needed to be. He explained that if I couldn't revise the essay to the reviewers' and the editor's satisfaction, it would not be included in the book and the project would move forward without my work in it.<br><br>Finally humbled, or perhaps compelled to be humble by the humiliation of the process, I did what I probably should have done long before: I knelt down in my office and prayed for Heavenly Father's help, asking that the Spirit would impress upon my mind what I needed to do to make the necessary changes to the essay so that it would be publishable. When I finished my prayer and sat back at my desk, I experienced what I think Joseph Smith meant by "pure intelligence flowing into you" and "sudden strokes of ideas" 5 from the Spirit. I had concepts coming into my mind as if a faucet had turned on in my brain, and I raced to jot down these ideas before they were lost. I subsequently moved around entire sections of the essay, incorporated some new information into it that I hadn't before known existed, and generally shifted the tone and tenor of my writing in keeping with the promptings I had received. The editor was astonished at the revision and accepted the essay without any subsequent changes. It made it into the book, which now sits on my shelf as a tangible reminder of an experience that was entirely more unusual for me than it should have been.<br><br>Is it strange for a professor to pray over the literary history and criticism that he writes? How is that different than when Amulek admonishes us to "humble [ourselves]" and to "cry unto [God]" over our "fields, yea, over all [our] flocks [and] over the crops of [our] fields, that [we] may prosper in them" (Alma 34:19, 20, 24)? I do not know to this day Heavenly Father's specific opinion of my interpretation of Theodore Roethke's poetry and its place in the development of American poetry in the middle of the twentieth century. What I do know, though, is that He cares about me and He cares that I be able to disseminate this knowledge to which He led me in the service of my family, my department, and my profession. I testify that He likewise cares about you and your pursuit of knowledge, and He will open your eyes to new ways of thinking about the intellectual challenges you face if you will allow the Spirit to provide you the revelation that you need in your sphere to advance your work.<br><br>I have found that the Spirit can also give me the knowledge and language that I need in unexpected, even extemporaneous, moments when I need to be wise beyond my own previous capacity. Recently I was reminded of something that happened to me as I presented my research at a national conference held during the same period of time as the first presidential run of Mitt Romney, himself an alumnus of BYU and a member of the Church. As you can probably recall, Romney's religion, its doctrines, and its practices were at the center of public discussion in an unprecedented way.<br><br>As I sat down to an evening banquet at the conference with many of my colleagues from universities across the country, two graduate students at my table saw "Brigham Young University" on my name tag and proceeded to relate a number of things they'd heard about the Church on a particular comedy show that, despite the show's reputation, these students found completely credible. They finished their all-too-lengthy anecdote with a pointed question for me: "We heard that Mormons wear 'magic underwear.' Do you wear the 'magic underwear'?"<br><br>I had not expected--at least at an academic conference populated by well-educated, open-minded professionals schooled in the humanities--to be asked such a question so bluntly and with such a lack of respect. I looked quickly around the table to see if my colleagues would rescue me, perhaps jumping in to point out the obvious impropriety of such a question at an academic banquet. Though I could tell that several of the professors were uncomfortable, they all turned and sat silently blinking at me, apparently waiting for my response. No one was going to let me off the hook. I was going to have to find a way to be true to what I believed without making myself look like a fool in front of people I admired but who lacked almost all context for what I could tell them on this particular subject. Like Moroni, I didn't want to be mocked for the clumsiness of the words that I might choose.<br><br>The Lord tells us in the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>Therefore, verily I say unto you, lift up your voices unto this people; speak the thoughts that I shall put into your hearts, and you shall not be confounded before men;</i><br><br><i>For it shall be given you in the very hour, yea, in the very moment, what ye shall say.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 100:5–6]<br><br>I swallowed hard and then spoke the words that came to my mind. I told these students that I was pretty sure they were referring to my temple garments and that just like many orthodox Jews who wear prayer shawls under their clothing to remind them of promises that they make to God about how they should live their lives, I too wear clothing that reminds me each day of promises I have made to God about how I will conduct myself in my daily decisions. I told them that from my experience any "magic" that my temple garments impart to me is simply from the blessings I receive for living the good life that I told God I'd live. Finally, after a slight pause, I asked those at the table, "Do any of you want to talk about your underwear?"<br><br>People burst into laughter at my question. The graduate students seemed appeased, if not a little ashamed, by the seriousness and attempted generosity of my answer to their inelegant question. Then, one by one, professors around the table talked about Mormons they had known and admired. Truth be told, I was relieved when the discussion shifted to another subject entirely. Still, I will always be grateful that the Spirit gave me the knowledge and the words that I needed in that precise moment so that I didn't embarrass either the Church or myself in front of my colleagues.<br><br>Sometimes I think individuals might mistakenly think that following the promptings of the Holy Ghost will curtail rigorous academic inquiry and keep their scholarship sequestered in a provincial prison of what has already been thought and proven safe. They might erroneously reason that to be able to really think new thoughts we need to free ourselves from the tyranny of commandments and faith, pressing boldly into areas of intellect to which faith has previously blinded us. In my experience, nothing could be further from the truth. Don't we believe that "faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen" (Hebrews 11:1)? In my view, faith always involves humbly asking that the Spirit take me from what I know to what I haven't yet discovered--wherever that takes me--strengthened by my belief.<br><br>Indeed, all Latter-day Saints should celebrate the ongoing process of restoration and revelation as outlined in the ninth Article of Faith:<br><br><i>We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.</i><br><br>Since the Doctrine and Covenants instructs us that the kingdom of God concerns itself not just with what we might think of as spiritual matters but also with "things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms" (D&amp;amp;C 88:79), then the Spirit has many fields of inquiry that are white and ready to harvest by a scholar with a humble heart and a sharp mind.<br><br>For me, having the Lord make weak things strong unto me as my faith meets intellectual inquiry is a process that I hope will someday culminate in something like that which happened to the servant of Elisha in the Old Testament. You will recall that the Syrian king was exasperated that the Lord kept revealing Syria's military strategy to Elisha, who would in turn pass it along to the king of Israel to aid him in foiling the Syrian enemy's plans. In retribution the Syrian army surrounded the city in which Elisha resided with horses and chariots, hoping to eliminate Elisha as the source of heaven-sent reconnaissance once and for all. Elisha's servant, upon seeing the huge army hemming them in, despaired and said to Elisha:<br><br><i>Alas, my master! how shall we do?</i><br><br><i>And</i> [Elisha] <i>answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.</i><br><br><i>And Elisha prayed, and said, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.</i> [2 Kings 6:15–17]<br><br>Ultimately, faithful intellectuals--ones who know that humility is not a liability but an asset, that faith is not a set of blinders but an eye-opening experience, and that the gift of the Holy Ghost is not a coward's crutch but a courageous revelator of the truth of all things--will see that the grace of Jesus Christ enlivens and informs every corner of knowledge that we can discover, blessing us and those with whom we share what we learn.<br><br>I would like to again quote Marilynne Robinson, this time from her novel <i>Gilead</i> when an aged pastor close to death reflects on how the Lord can open our eyes to new knowledge if we will let Him:<br><br><i>It has seemed to me sometimes as though the Lord breathes on this poor gray ember of Creation and it turns to radiance--for a moment or a year or the span of a life. And then it sinks back into itself again, and to look at it no one would know it had anything to do with fire, or light. . . . But the Lord is more constant and far more extravagant than it seems to imply. Wherever you turn your eyes the world can shine like transfiguration. You don't have to bring a thing to it except a little willingness to see. Only, who could have the courage to see it?</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>It is my hope that we will have the humility, the faith, the charity, and the willingness to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost necessary to be able to see our respective corners of the world shine like transfiguration in our own intellectual and academic inquiry. It is likewise my hope that we will have the Lord's help not to stumble on our words and that we will have the courage to see what needs to be seen and to say what needs to be said, however unpopular the view and however it may disturb the received logic of the time in which we live. May we ever pursue true knowledge, eventually finding for ourselves in the journey that all truth indeed is part of one great and eternal round, capacious enough to explain all the mysteries of the universe.<br><br>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Trenton L.

<h1>Know That He Loveth His Children . . .&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
After receiving the call from President Worthen asking me to speak at devotional today, I spent a considerable amount of time thinking about what I might say.<br><br>One evening my daughter Andrea, who is a recent graduate of BYU, said, "Dad, don't worry. I always went to devotional to feel the Spirit and to have a rest from the stress of a week of school. As long as you bring the Spirit, it will be okay."<br><br>My prayer since then has been for the Spirit to attend us here today and to teach us all something new.<br><br>I would like to start with a favorite scripture. In 1 Nephi the young Nephi desired to see the same things that his father, Lehi, saw in a vision. An angel came and showed him what Lehi saw--and even more--and asked him, "Knowest thou the condescension of God?" (1 Nephi 11:16).<br><br>Nephi replied, "I know that he loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things" (1 Nephi 11:17).<br><br>I remember reading the Book of Mormon as a boy and coming to these verses and thinking, "I don't even know what that word<i>--condescension--</i>means! But wow, I love Nephi's answer! He knew that his Heavenly Father loved him, and that was what mattered most to him."<br><br>I have spent years pondering this declaration of Nephi's. It tells me who I am: I am a child of a loving Father in Heaven. Many in the world today deny the divinity of man. They claim that we are merely the victors in a biological race for superiority of the species on this planet. But I testify that, through holy prophets, God has revealed that as we are His children, there is a purpose to our lives. We should all rejoice in this knowledge that we have. But we should realize that not all people have it.<br><br>After arriving in the mission field many years ago, one of the first things I learned was that most of the people in Taiwan with whom I came into contact had no concept of God as their Father in Heaven. I realized that I, however, had always just taken that knowledge for granted. Back then the discussions were memorized and were designated by letters of the alphabet. My favorite discussion quickly became the D discussion, the plan of salvation. I loved it mainly because it allowed us to teach this most fundamental truth--that of our relationship to a loving Heavenly Father. I saw this truth change the lives of the Taiwan Saints. Once they learned it, they were changed people; they radiated a love for their Heavenly Father.<br><br>In contrast, a few years ago we had a graduate student in our department who exhibited the opposite. Having been raised in a communist and atheistic country, he had no knowledge of what we are talking about here today. At one point in his studies he had a series of setbacks. From these he concluded that "fate" had turned against him. He felt powerless and not in control of his own destiny. He concluded he was not meant to complete his degree and decided to leave our graduate program. However, he was an excellent student who was making good progress toward his degree. His advisor counseled with him and eventually convinced him to stay. He completed a strong dissertation and obtained an excellent position with a major corporation but never came to understand the love of his Father in Heaven.<br><br>I have found that when I think about God--<i>specifically</i> in the context of His being my Father and me being His son--I have learned important insights. Further, when I combine those insights with what I have learned as a son of earthly parents and as a father to my children, I have learned even more. I would like to talk about four of these insights today.<br><h2><strong>Insight 1: Children Grow Up to Be Like Their Parents--and That Applies to Us</strong></h2><br>If God is my Father, then I am in the process of growing up to become like Him, if I so choose. We have been taught that that is the purpose of this life--to ultimately live the kind of life that God lives.<br><br>God told Moses, "For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). Regarding this eternal life, God has given this promise in the Doctrine and Covenants: "If you keep my commandments and endure to the end you shall have eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God" (D&amp;amp;C 14:7). Elder Delbert L. Stapley taught, "Eternal life is God's life, which he hopes to share with all his children" ("The Path to Eternal Life," <i>Ensign,</i> January 1974, 42).<br><br>How do we come to inherit eternal life? That is, how do we become like God? Christ gave us the ultimate goal when He said, "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (Matthew 5:48).<br><br>That is a tall order to fulfill indeed. I remember that as a young boy I viewed the gospel mainly through the lens of commandments. The gospel was a set of rules that I was to follow, and that was it. Later I realized that the gospel was maybe more than a checklist of rules to keep. I realized that it was about <i>what</i> I was trying to become and <i>whom</i> I was trying to become like. It was all about helping me fulfill my eternal destiny of becoming like my Father in Heaven.<br><br>If this is our focus, does that mean we won't keep the commandments--that we won't study the scriptures or do our home teaching or attend the temple or pay our tithing? No, we will do these things, but we will do them for different reasons--for better reasons.<br><br>Have you ever thought about the purpose of the commandments? As a father, what do I want for my children? I hope that what I want for them has some similarities with what Heavenly Father wants for me. Every night when I pray for my children, I pray for their safety, happiness, and growth. I believe that is precisely why our Father in Heaven has given us commandments. He knows that if we follow them, they will lead us to safety, happiness, and growth, and that growth will lead us in the direction of being therefore perfect even as our Father, who is in heaven, is perfect (see Matthew 5:48).<br><h2><strong>Insight 2: What Are the Ways in Which Father Might React to My Disobedience?</strong></h2><br>I have always assumed that God is unhappy with me when I fail to do what I should and when I do dumb things. I don't think I had thought much more about how He really might feel until I had an experience with one of my own children.<br><br>One day my wife, Julie, called me on the phone, fairly upset, and said, "I just got off the phone with the high school. Child So-and-So's teacher just called me to say that our child had been a real problem in class the past few days and has been disciplined."<br><br>I was surprised by my reaction. I was not angry; all I felt was a mixture of disappointment and sorrow. At that moment I just wanted to take my child into my arms and tell him how much I loved him and how badly I felt that he had not lived up to his potential and had fallen short. Then it hit me: could this possibly be how my Father in Heaven feels about me when I make mistakes--that He is disappointed and sad? I am a bit embarrassed to say that this thought had never occurred to me in quite that way before then.<br><br>Further, all I wanted was for my child to learn and grow from this experience. Could this also be how my Father in Heaven feels about me? Is that why He is so ready to forgive? That was a very reassuring thought for me. It was in that moment that I think I may have caught a finite glimpse into the infinite love and care God has for me, even though I am often a wayward child.<br><br>To finish the story, were there consequences for our child as a result of the bad behavior? There were, but they were motivated by our wanting to help a child learn from a bad choice rather than by our desire to mete out punishment. I only wish I always was able to respond in that way.<br><h2><strong>Insight 3: We Are Given Experiences, Often Challenging Ones, by Our Father to Help Us Grow</strong></h2><br>As parents, Julie and I have regularly tried to provide experiences for our children simply because we thought these experiences would be good for them and help our children grow. For example, in our home everyone took piano lessons. The goal was not for them to play in Carnegie Hall but simply to become proficient and to learn to love music. I think our children realized early on that piano lessons were just a part of being a Nelson. Now that our children are grown, you could ask each of them if they <i>always</i> saw practicing the piano as a positive and growing experience. If they were to say yes, you would know they were lying, because at times they all grew tired of the effort required. They either did not comprehend or had lost sight of the goal! But none has ever expressed regret for learning to play, and, at one time or another since, all have expressed gratitude for it.<br><br>Does our Father in Heaven give us specific experiences--sometimes challenging ones? Does He ask us to do things because they will be for our own good? I believe that <i>absolutely everything</i> Heavenly Father asks us to do is because it will be for our own good.<br><br>Take family history for instance (one of my favorite topics). President Gordon B. Hinckley said that as we search out our ancestors and do their temple work, "we literally become saviors on Mount Zion . . . to those . . . who have no means of advancing unless something is done in their behalf by those on earth" ("Closing Remarks," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2004, 105). How many commandments have ever been given in which, by our fulfilling the commandment, we are referred to as saviors? What a blessing!<br><br>That said, as I look at the state of my genealogical records and the mess that they often are in, I wonder if God couldn't find a far more efficient way to get families sealed together if that was the only goal. But I believe there is more to it than that. Our lives are blessed beyond comprehension as we do family history work. I testify that in my life I have felt closer to the Spirit while doing family history work than while doing anything else.<br><br>This is only one such example. Can you not say that you have benefited as much or more than anyone else when you have magnified your calling as a missionary or Scoutmaster or visiting teacher, paid your tithing, fulfilled your priesthood duty, or given service to someone in need? To me the miracle of the gospel is that everything we do benefits us as well as others. To use a popular phrase, it is win-win.<br><h2><strong>Insight 4: God Is Mindful of Me and Provides Tender Mercies to Bless My Life</strong></h2><br>As a father, I am always watching my children, and at times I try to provide help. This help comes in a variety of forms, from giving advice to providing for their physical needs. But sometimes it seems that what my children need most is simply encouragement and to know that they are loved and that we, as their parents, are there to help.<br><br>In my experience our Father in Heaven treats us similarly. Often His help comes in the form of tender mercies. In 2005 Elder David A. Bednar gave what to me was a landmark talk in general conference. His talk focused on the tender mercies provided to us by a loving Father in Heaven. In his talk he said:<br><br><i>The Lord's tender mercies are the very personal and individualized blessings, strength, protection, assurances, guidance, loving-kindnesses, consolation, support, and spiritual gifts which we receive from and because of and through the Lord Jesus Christ. Truly, the Lord suits "his mercies according to the conditions of the children of men" (D&amp;amp;C 46:15).</i> ["The Tender Mercies of the Lord," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2005, 99]<br><br>In other words, tender mercies are the <i>customized blessings and direction</i> that God gives to each of us to suit our needs. Importantly, as Elder Bednar said, "often, the Lord's timing of His tender mercies helps us to both discern and acknowledge them" ("Tender Mercies," 99). That is a very telling comment. According to Elder Bednar the Lord <i>wants</i> us to recognize and acknowledge His tender mercies for what they are: customized blessings, assurances, and protection.<br><br>To me there is nothing so exciting as to see the hand of the Lord working in my life and to see that things didn't simply happen in their natural course but that God has truly stepped in and done something <i>just for me</i> or, alternatively, as President Thomas S. Monson has said, that God has used me to provide help to someone else.<br><br>When giving talks I think we all like to talk about such experiences, and I am no exception. Why? I think it is because these experiences are the rarest of jewels--the most precious experiences we have in our lives. They are the very substance of our testimonies. They confirm our faith that God lives, that He loves us as Nephi said, and that, out of the billions of people on the earth, He knows each of us and is interested enough to step in and help us in specific and personal ways.<br><br>Tender mercies come in many ways and varieties, but because I have a daughter, Wendy, who is now serving a full-time mission, I would like to share some missionary work–related tender mercies I have received in my life. I have spent the years since I returned from my mission many years ago deeply pondering the effects of my service. Did I do what the Lord wanted me to do? Could I have done more? And the most pointed question I have asked is, Did I accomplish any good?<br><br>The Lord has provided me some specific tender mercies over the years to give me comfort and at least partial answers to these questions. These tender mercies did not come at once, but in hindsight I can see they came when I needed them. Importantly, they came at times and in ways that have helped to build my testimony that God knows me and is personally mindful of me.<br><br>In 2006 I returned to Taiwan to teach a short course in my research area. While there I attended church in the last area I served as a missionary. That day, immediately after I had returned from church to my hotel room, the phone rang, and the caller, who was in a different city in Taiwan, told me the following.<br><br>She said that as a part of the fiftieth anniversary of the Church in Taiwan, the members had been given a form in church meetings that very Sunday to fill out. The purpose of the form was to help them locate "lost missionaries" they hadn't heard from for years. She and her sisters had filled out the form and had decided to put my name on it. She said that almost immediately after returning home from their church meetings, their uncle had called to say that I was in Taiwan--he had seen me at church. As a result, they were immediately able to find me!<br><br>I was speechless. My companion and I had taught this family all through the late fall and winter of 1977. We had fallen in love with them, especially the six children, who ranged from junior high school age down to a toddler. They were a wonderful family. But when I left, they had not accepted the gospel. Only later I learned that they had been baptized. As we visited on the phone that day in my hotel room, I learned that not only had they joined the Church but that almost all of the children in the family--daughters and sons alike--had served missions, had married faithful members, and were now raising their own families in the light of the gospel!<br><br>A few days after receiving that phone call I traveled to where some of the family now live so I could visit them. Upon arriving, I walked in and saw that the room contained more than forty family members! During the visit many tears--certainly many of mine--were shed.<br><br>To quote Elder Bednar:<br><br><i>Some may count this experience as simply a nice coincidence, but I testify that the tender mercies of the Lord are real and that they do not occur randomly or merely by coincidence.</i> ["Tender Mercies," 99]<br><br>I have since wondered just who that tender mercy was intended for. This family's desire to reconnect with one of the missionaries who had taught them the gospel had been fulfilled that very day, and I had been allowed to see a part of the results of my missionary labors. I will forever love the Tan family.<br><br>My second experience is quite recent--it actually occurred while I was writing this talk. But, by way of background, we first need to go back thirty-six years. My companion and I were some of the very first missionaries to work in a town called Chunan. There was no branch of the Church there; there were no members there. Over a series of weeks we knocked on hundreds of doors in that town, without any visible success. At that point, to me the only memorable thing about the town was that at night, after tracting all day, as we trudged in the dark with our bikes through the rice fields back to our apartment, we would often stop and admire those rice fields filled with fireflies.<br><br>One day, after weeks of no success, we came to a house. A teenage boy answered the door and said, "没有人在," which literally means "nobody is here." He had been coached by his mother to say that.<br><br>We looked at him, and I said, "Well, you are home. Can we talk with you?"<br><br>He turned out to be a wonderful young man, and he quickly developed a strong testimony of the gospel and of the reality of his Heavenly Father, and he entered the waters of baptism. Brother Wu very soon thereafter went on to serve a mission himself and then married and raised a righteous family.<br><br>Now, fast-forward to just four weeks ago in early May of this year. I was accompanying the BYU Ballroom Dance Company on their tour of China and Hong Kong. Shortly before we left I learned we would be in the city where Brother Wu's son, Wilford, was living. I emailed ahead and asked if we could meet. My wife and I spent a wonderful evening together with him and his wife, Alice, and talked at length about what a blessing that day thirty-six years ago had been in both of their lives as well as in ours.<br><br>The next morning, on Sunday, we attended a local branch meeting with them and afterward were taking pictures together to remember the occasion.<br><br>At that moment someone tapped me on the shoulder and said, "I know you. I used to be your missionary companion."<br><br>I looked up to see Elder John Vance and remembered we had been companions when Brother Wu was baptized so many years ago. We had had no contact since the mission field.<br><br>I pointed to Wilford and asked, "John, do you know who this is?"<br><br>He did not. Imagine his surprise when I told him that Wilford was the son of our very own Brother Wu from so many years ago.<br><br>There we were, on separate business trips to a third country in which none of us had ever had any contact and in a city of twenty-four million people, and we just happened to run into one another--and at the same time I had located Brother Wu's son, Wilford. I knew it was an answer to my own prayers, but, as with my previous experience, it blessed everyone involved and was not just for me.<br><br>During the visit my wife and I had with Wilford and Alice, Alice told us of a similar experience she had had. I share it with her permission.<br><br>Last year she was on an internship in Berlin. While attending a Church meeting one Sunday, she was introduced to a Chinese woman who, after shaking hands, said, "Wait--you served a mission a year ago, right? You are the first missionary who taught me the first lesson!"<br><br>Alice did not recognize the woman at first glance, but she soon remembered her face, her name, and how they had met near the Hong Kong Temple eighteen months earlier while Alice was a missionary. She remembered how she and her companion had taught this woman the first lesson. It was a powerful lesson, and they gave her a Book of Mormon, but they couldn't do more because the woman had to return to her home country the next day.<br><br>What Alice didn't know was that after that initial lesson, the woman had returned home, but she wasn't able to attend church meetings or learn the gospel because the Church is not recognized there. When she later moved to Germany for her graduate studies, she immediately found the Church in Berlin, was taught, and soon was baptized. And there she was when Alice "randomly showed up in Berlin" (to use her words) because of an internship.<br><h2><strong>Insights into the Love of God</strong></h2><br>As I reread Elder Bednar's talk while preparing this talk of my own, I was struck that he repeated, essentially, the same phrase three different times in his talk. Three times! The points of his repeated phrase include the following:<br><br>• "The Lord's tender mercies do not occur randomly or merely by coincidence."<br><br>• "Faithfulness and obedience enable us to receive these important gifts."<br><br>• "Frequently, the Lord's timing helps us to recognize" and acknowledge tender mercies. ("Tender Mercies," 100.)<br><br>The experiences I have just related are gifts, even tender mercies--specific blessings given as answers to prayers by a loving Father to provide comfort and encouragement. To me they are also unmistakable evidence of the truthfulness of Nephi's declaration: "I know that he loveth his children" (1 Nephi 11:17).<br><br>Brothers and sisters, in summary, my testimony today is that, along with Nephi, I glory that I have a Father in Heaven who loves me and knows me. I am grateful for knowledge about my Father in Heaven that has been revealed through latter-day prophets. I have found great insights into the love of God for me by thinking specifically about Him as my Father. These insights include the following:<br><br>• We all have the potential to become like Him.<br><br>• Everything He asks of us in this life is for our benefit and is designed to help us in the growing process.<br><br>• There are parallels between the love and caring we have within proper family relationships and the love our Father in Heaven has for us.<br><br>• Just as earthly parents give their children challenging experiences to help them grow, our Father in Heaven does the same with us.<br><br>• God gives each of us <i>customized</i> blessings in the form of tender mercies. These do not occur by chance or coincidence, but faithfulness and obedience enable us to receive them. Often the Lord provides them to us at a time and in a way that helps us recognize and acknowledge them.<br><br>I am grateful for the gospel in my life and for the foundation it gives me. It is everything to me. I am grateful for a loving Heavenly Father who has designed the plan of salvation to become "the great plan of happiness" (Alma 42:8) for each of us. I am grateful for modern-day prophets who have revealed important truths to us about God. I am grateful to have family ties here that help teach me about my life's quest to become more like my Father in Heaven. May we each learn to better qualify for and recognize the tender mercies of the Lord in our lives.<br><br>I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Brent E.

<h1>mith: Seer, Translator, Revelator, and Prophet - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In my young years growing up in Logan, Utah, I was part of a musical family. My grandfather, Francis H. Baugh Jr., affectionately known in the community as Frank Baugh, was the director of music for nearly thirty years in the Logan City School District, where he directed the high school choral groups and musical productions in addition to supervising music education in the junior high and elementary schools. He was Logan's own music man.<br><br>By the time I was in elementary school he had retired from teaching in the public system, leaving him time to teach my siblings and me the piano. Not too many people can say they took piano lessons from their grandfather, but I did--he was my one and only teacher.<br><br>Every piano lesson included playing hymns from the LDS hymnal. Grandfather would have me go over each hymn several times while he pointed out fingering and dynamics and told me to "make the long notes longer and the short notes shorter." And since Grandfather was a choral director and a singer--a beautiful tenor, I might add--he would sing the hymns, every verse, as I would play them. By the time I was a teenager I could play many of the hymns, but surprisingly I could also sing the words of those hymns by heart because I had heard my grandfather sing them so many times.<br><br>Around the time I was in junior high school, my grandfather must have felt I was ready to take on the longest hymn in the hymnal: number 296, which was titled "The Seer, Joseph, the Seer," a poem written by John Taylor and later set to music by Ebenezer Beesley. Fortunately for me it was in the key of C, but it was <i>four pages long,</i> not to mention it was a choir number. I can't play it today, but I can still hear my grandfather's clear tenor voice singing the words:<br><br><i>The Seer, the Seer, Joseph, the Seer!</i><br><i>I'll sing of the Prophet ever dear . . . ;</i><br><i>His equal now cannot be found</i><br><i>By searching the wide world around.</i><br><br><i>With Gods he soared in the realms of day,</i><br><i>And men he taught the heavenly way. . . .</i><br><i>The earthly Seer! the heavenly Seer!</i><br><i>I love to dwell on his memory dear;</i><br><br><i>The chosen of God and the friend of man,</i><br><i>He brought the priesthood back again;</i><br><i>He gazed on the past and the future, too,</i><br><i>And opened . . . the heavenly world to view.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>Looking back, I think I can say that it was while I was learning to play that number and hearing my Grandfather Baugh sing the words that I felt the first feelings of a testimony in my heart concerning the life and mission of Joseph Smith. However, for many years I was puzzled as to why the text referred to Joseph Smith as a seer, a title I was not altogether familiar with. It was not until I read the Book of Mormon that I learned that perhaps the greatest designation Joseph Smith could have been given was that of a seer.<br><br>Today I would like to address four titles or roles given to Joseph Smith in the revelations, namely that of seer, translator, revelator, and prophet (see D&amp;amp;C 107:92; and D&amp;amp;C 124:125).<br><h2><strong>Joseph Smith as Seer</strong></h2><br>In the Book of Mormon, Ammon defined a seer as one who possessed "a gift from God" to translate ancient records (Mosiah 8:13; see also Mosiah 28:11–16). However, the seeric gift was not limited to translation, hence Ammon's additional statement "that a seer is a revelator and a prophet also" (Mosiah 8:16). Ammon further taught that "a seer can know of things which are past, and also of things which are to come," noting further that the gift of seership includes being able to understand mysteries and know all things, including that which is hidden or secret (Mosiah 8:17). In reality, the gift of seership is the greatest spiritual gift a person can have. It is no wonder that when Ammon explained to King Limhi what a seer was, the king responded "that a seer is greater than a prophet" (Mosiah 8:15).<br><br>Joseph Smith's role as a seer was known and prophesied of anciently. Joseph of Egypt, himself a gifted seer, prophesied that in the last days "a choice seer" would come through his lineage (2 Nephi 3:7; and Joseph Smith Translation, Genesis 50:27; see also verse 28). "That seer will the Lord bless," Joseph prophesied, specifically indicating that "his name shall be called after me" (2 Nephi 3:14–15; see also Joseph Smith Translation, Genesis 50:33).<br><br>In actuality, a seer is a <i>see-er,</i> particularly one who is entitled to see visions. Visions can take various forms, including a personal visitation or the appearance of deity or heavenly angels. In another type of vision, the veil is lifted from a person's mind and their spiritual eyes behold the things of God. This type of vision might be called a mind vision.<sup>2</sup> Finally, visionary experiences can also be conveyed through spiritual instruments, such as the Nephite interpreters, or, in the case of Joseph Smith, through a small, unusual stone often referred to as a seer stone, which he had in his possession.<br><br>A number of years ago I decided to explore the types of visions Joseph Smith had--as well as how many--and I was rather surprised when I discovered that documentation exists to show he had over <i>seventy</i> visions. Most of these visions are not found in the standard works, but they pervade the Prophet's own history and the records kept by contemporaries who were present when a vision was received or when Joseph Smith spoke about his sacred communications.<sup>3</sup><br><h3><b><i>Visitations of Heavenly Beings</i></b></h3><br>Joseph Smith may have received more visitations of heavenly personages than any other prophet in the history of the earth. Certainly his most magnificent and doctrinally significant theophany occurred in the Sacred Grove in the spring of 1820, when the Father and the Son appeared and ushered in the opening of the latter-day dispensation. Three years later young Joseph was visited for the first time by the resurrected angel Moroni, the last known survivor of the Nephite nation. Thereafter, for a period of nearly six years, from September 1823 until July 1829, when Joseph Smith returned the plates, Moroni appeared numerous times to the Prophet--twenty-two of which can be documented--to help prepare him to receive the plates and later to provide additional instruction during the course of the translation.<sup>4</sup><br><br>But Moroni was not Joseph's only spiritual teacher during those preparatory years. Statements made by some of the Prophet's contemporaries reveal that during his annual interviews with Moroni the young seer was visited and taught by numerous ancient prophets and apostles. Joseph never mentioned who those angelic ministrants were, but John Taylor provided a few possible identities. He reported: "When Joseph Smith was raised up as a Prophet of God, Mormon, Moroni, Nephi and others of the ancient Prophets who formerly lived on this Continent . . . came to him and communicated to him certain principles pertaining to the Gospel of the Son of God."<sup>5</sup><br><br>Elder Taylor also said:<br><br><i>The principles which he had placed him in communication with . . . the ancient apostles and prophets; such men . . . as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Noah, Adam, Seth, Enoch, and . . . the apostles that lived on this continent as well as those who lived on the Asiatic continent. He seemed to be as familiar with these people as we are with one another.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>In the Wentworth letter, published in 1842, the Prophet stated, <i>"After having received many visits from the angels of God . . . ,</i> the angel of the Lord delivered the records into my hands."<sup>7</sup> So although Moroni was Joseph's main instructor during the annual interviews at the Hill Cumorah, the ancient Book of Mormon prophet also invited a number of very special guest visitors.<br><br>Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery also testified of the personal appearances of John the Baptist, Peter, James, John, Moses, Elias, and Elijah, who appeared to confer priesthood authority and keys. The fact that both Joseph and Oliver were coparticipants in these visitations gives additional testimony and credibility to the reality of these visionary experiences.<sup>8</sup><br><h3><b><i>Mind Visions</i></b></h3><br>A second category or type of vision is that of a mind vision. A distinguishing difference between a visitation vision and a mind vision is that in a visitation manifestation a heavenly personage (or personages) is actually present. However, in a mind vision no divine personages are present, even though they might be seen. A mind vision might also include being able to see scenes of heaven or past, present, and future events.<br><br>The revelation that is now Doctrine and Covenants 76 is an example of this type of manifestation. Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon testified that in a vision they saw God the Father and Jesus Christ, but neither the Father nor the Son was actually present in the room when the Prophet and Sidney were experiencing the vision. The two men also saw Lucifer's premortal rebellion and the conditions associated with future inhabitants of each of the kingdoms of glory.<br><br>What is interesting is the description given by the Prophet and Sidney of <i>how</i> the vision was received. They recorded: "The Lord touched the eyes of our understandings and they were opened, and the glory of the Lord shone round about" (D&amp;amp;C 76:19). What they were saying was that they saw things with their spiritual eyes as though they were literally seeing and experiencing them; the vision was so real to them that it was as though they were actually there. It would be something similar to what people experience when they watch a 3-D movie in an IMAX theater--times one billion! Several years ago I saw the IMAX movie <i>Space Station 3D,</i> and for forty-seven minutes I sat mesmerized. The imagery was so real; it was almost as if I had been transported into space and was onboard the International Space Station, approximately 220 miles above the earth. It wasn't until the credits appeared and the lights went up that I gained my senses and became aware that I was sitting in a movie theater.<br><br>An impressive example of a mind vision comes from Zebedee Coltrin, an early Church member, who experienced an unusual vision with Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. In 1834, while in New Portage, Ohio, the Prophet requested that Oliver and Zebedee go on a short walk with him. After finding a suitable place, Joseph requested that they kneel and each pray in turn. After praying the Prophet said, "Now breth[r]en . . . we will see some visions." Joseph laid himself on the ground, and Oliver and Zebedee rested their heads on his outstretched arms. "The heavens gradually opened," Coltrin recalled, and we "saw a golden throne, . . . and on the throne were two aged personages, having white hair, and clothed in white garments." These personages were "the two most beautiful and perfect specimens of mankind" he had ever seen. Joseph said they were "our first parents, Adam and Eve."<sup>9</sup><br><br>Other examples of mind visions received by the Prophet Joseph Smith include a vision of the temple location in Jackson County, Missouri; visions of the general features and designs of the Kirtland and Nauvoo Temples; a vision of the pattern and organization of Church councils and quorums; a visionary understanding of the ancient warrior Zelph; a vision of the postmortal condition of the men who died on Zion's Camp; a vision of the Christian martyrs; and a vision of the common progenitors of a number of early Church leaders.<sup>10</sup><br><h3><b><i>Visions Through Divine Instruments</i></b></h3><br>Several examples in the scriptures demonstrate that ancient holy men often used divine instruments to receive revelation, including visions. The Book of Mormon makes it clear that the religious leaders of the Jaredite and Nephite civilizations possessed sacred interpreters (see Ether 4:5; Alma 37:21), which were originally given to the brother of Jared. Moroni, the last Book of Mormon prophet to possess the interpreters, included his instrument in the stone box along with the plates and the sacred breastplate to assist the future translator (see D&amp;amp;C 17:1).<br><br>In addition to the interpreters, Joseph Smith also had in his possession what is generally referred to as the seer stone.<sup>11</sup> Significantly, a passage in Alma 37 suggests that the future translator would use both the Nephite interpreters and a sacred stone to translate the Book of Mormon (see Alma 37:23–25). From statements made by eyewitnesses to the translation, it appears that Joseph Smith used the Nephite interpreters to translate the first 116 pages; thereafter, for convenience, he used the seer stone to complete the rest of the translation. Both objects functioned in much the same manner, both instruments conveyed visionary transmissions, and both were later referred to by Joseph Smith as the Urim and Thummim.<br><br>A number of Joseph Smith's earliest seeric visions were received by means of the seer stone. Joseph Knight Sr. remembered the Prophet sharing an incident regarding the seer stone that took place in September 1826 during the Prophet's third annual visit to the Hill Cumorah. Knight indicated that during the 1826 interview with Moroni, Joseph was told that he would receive the plates the following year if he brought the right person with him to the hill.<br><br>Confused, Joseph asked Moroni, "'Who is the right Person?' The answer was you will know. Then he looked in his [stone] and found it was Emma Hale."<sup>12</sup> Joseph understood what he needed to do. A few weeks later he traveled to Harmony to request Emma's hand in marriage from her father, Isaac Hale. However, Isaac opposed the marriage, and because of his opposition, Joseph and Emma eloped and were married in January 1827.<br><br>In accordance with Moroni's instructions, the following September when the Prophet went to retrieve the plates at the hill, Emma accompanied her husband in the wagon. The account given by Knight illustrates that it was made known to Joseph Smith by means of a visionary experience using the seer stone that he was to marry Emma.<sup>13</sup><br><br>Upon receiving the plates, breastplate, and Nephite interpreters in September 1827, Joseph developed a special affinity for the interpreters, which he called spectacles. Knight was at the Smith home in Palmyra when Joseph returned from the Hill Cumorah, and Knight remembered conversing with the Prophet about the sacred relics the morning after he had obtained possession of them.<br><br>"It is ten times Better then I expected," Knight remembered the Prophet saying. "He seamed to think more of the glasses . . . [than] he Did of the Plates, for, says he, 'I can see any thing; they are Marvelus.'"<sup>14</sup><br><br>David Whitmer recalled that when Joseph first put on the spectacles, "he saw his entire past history revealed to him." This experience, Whitmer believed, helped the young seer recognize the greater supernatural power God had given him.<sup>15</sup><br><h2><strong>Joseph Smith as Translator</strong></h2><br>When discussing Joseph Smith's role as a translator, many only associate the Prophet with his role in the translation of the Book of Mormon. However, he successfully translated at least three additional ancient texts.<br><h3><b><i>The Book of Mormon</i></b></h3><br>In discussing the translation of the Book of Mormon, many individuals have questioned how Joseph Smith was able to translate the gold plates. After all, he had no understanding of reformed Egyptian--no one did--yet he successfully dictated a remarkably coherent and inspiring text. Although a number of eyewitnesses to the translation process left statements regarding what they observed of the mechanics of the translation, the Prophet remained silent on how the interpretation of the Egyptian-like characters was actually transmitted. In an 1831 meeting, Hyrum Smith requested that the Prophet tell some of the details regarding the translation and the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, but Joseph announced "that it was not intended to tell the world all the particulars of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon [and] that it was not expedient for him to relate these things."<sup>16</sup> On other occasions, when questioned on the subject, Joseph Smith replied that the translation was done "by the gift and power of God."<sup>17</sup> What did he mean? Simply put, the Book of Mormon translation was revealed to him by divine revelation; it was a revelatory experience--one that for him was difficult to put into words.<sup>18</sup><br><br>Some might question whether or not the translation provided by Joseph Smith is accurate or even true. In response to that inquiry, I cite the following statement from a revelation directed to David Whitmer in June 1829. It is one of the most powerful declarations in all scripture: "And he [that is, Joseph Smith,] has translated the book, even that part which I have commanded him, and <i>as your Lord and your God liveth it is true"</i> (D&amp;amp;C 17:6; emphasis added).<sup>19</sup><br><br>On November 28, 1841, Wilford Woodruff recorded in his journal that Joseph Smith said that "the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any Book on Earth &amp;amp; the key stone of our religion &amp;amp; a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts than any other Book."<sup>20</sup> But what did the Prophet mean when he said that the Book of Mormon was the most correct book? Many have interpreted that to mean that the Book of Mormon is the most correct book in terms of doctrine. Let me suggest that what the Prophet might have actually been saying was that the English translation of the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any translated text. Why? Because the translation was given by revelation, and if it was given by revelation from God, it was correct.<br><h3><b><i>Ancient Writings by John the Revelator</i></b></h3><br>In discussing Joseph Smith's role as a translator, it appears he also translated an ancient New Testament text written by John the Beloved. While the Prophet and Oliver Cowdery were engaged in the translation of the plates, they frequently conversed on a number of subjects. On one occasion they reported that "a difference of opinion" arose regarding whether John the Beloved had died or whether he had been permitted to remain on the earth--a subject not clarified in the last verses of the last chapter in John.<sup>21</sup> To settle the matter, the Prophet inquired and received Doctrine and Covenants 7. Significantly, the heading to this revelation in the 1833 Book of Commandments states that the revelation was <i>"translated</i> from parchment, written and hid up by himself," namely John.<sup>22</sup> The English text that Joseph Smith received on this occasion was likely received in a manner similar to the Book of Mormon translation and could therefore be considered another translated work provided by the Prophet.<br><h3><b><i>Joseph Smith Translation</i></b></h3><br>Three months after the organizational meeting of the Church, Joseph Smith began what would be one of his most significant contributions to the Restoration: the production of an inspired revision of the Bible, or what is now known as the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible. This endeavor occupied much of his time from June 1830 until July 1833--a period of just over three years. The process of revising the text of the King James Version of the Bible constituted what Joseph Smith considered to be the means by which "many plain and precious things" (1 Nephi 13:28) that had been incorrectly translated, excluded, or extracted from the Bible would be restored. While the Joseph Smith Translation is not a translation from one language to another in the common use of the term, it can nonetheless be considered a translation, since the Prophet provided a new and different text than that of the King James Version's translators.<br><br>Joseph Smith made changes, additions, and insertions to approximately 3,400 verses, or roughly 11 percent of the 31,100 verses that make up the biblical text.<sup>23</sup> The 1979 Latter-day Saint edition of the Bible included approximately 600 Joseph Smith Translation verses or passages. Most appeared in the footnotes, while longer passages were located in the appendix. It should be noted that a few additional Joseph Smith Translation entries that were not included in the 1979 edition have recently been added to the 2013 edition.<sup>24</sup><br><br>However, the 600 Joseph Smith Translation entries in the 1979 Latter-day Saint edition of the King James Version of the Bible do not include the 356 verses that make up the book of Moses (i.e., the Joseph Smith Translation of Genesis 1–6:13) or the fifty-five verses that comprise Joseph Smith--Matthew in the Pearl of Great Price, which total an additional 411 verses. If we include the Moses and the Joseph Smith--Matthew texts, more than 1,000 Joseph Smith Translation verses or passages are included in our scriptures, representing roughly 30 percent, or just under one-third, of the complete Joseph Smith Translation text.<br><br>Mention could be made of literally hundreds of contributions made by the Joseph Smith Translation. Following are a few examples from Genesis.<br><br>In the Bible the Genesis material on Enoch covers a mere six verses (see Genesis 5:18–19, 21–24). However, the Joseph Smith Translation includes 117 verses on Enoch (see Moses 6:21–7:69), adding numerous important details about Enoch's life and ministry--what he preached (including an account of Adam's baptism), the righteousness of the city of Zion, and the fact that the inhabitants of the holy city were translated, or taken up into heaven.<sup>25</sup> Joseph Smith's added knowledge and understanding of Enoch affected him profoundly, as evidenced by the fact that one of his main lifetime objectives was to gather the Saints and establish a latter-day Zion community and society patterned after that of the ancient noble patriarch.<br><br>Joseph Smith also made a significant addition to the scriptural text in Genesis 14, adding sixteen verses about Melchizedek and the powers associated with the higher priesthood--information not found elsewhere in the Bible or in the Book of Mormon (see Joseph Smith Translation, Genesis 14:25–40). A similar contribution appears in Genesis 50, in which the Prophet added fifteen verses containing a marvelous prophecy of Joseph of Egypt that describes the future missions of Moses, Aaron, and Joseph Smith and even mentions each one by name (see Joseph Smith Translation, Genesis 50:24–38).<br><h3><b><i>Book of Abraham</i></b></h3><br>The text known as the book of Abraham is another translated work produced by Joseph Smith. In July 1835 Church leaders in Kirtland purchased four Egyptian mummies, two scrolls, and several papyrus fragments from Michael Chandler. Joseph Smith's interest in the collection stemmed from his observation that "one of the rolls contained the writings of Abraham, another the writings of Joseph of Egypt."<sup>26</sup> During the next five months the Prophet translated the majority of what became the book of Abraham, although he may have provided some additional translation to the text prior to its publication in three installments in the <i>Times and Seasons</i> beginning March 1842.<br><br>Just think about what we know as a result of Joseph Smith's production of the book of Abraham: Abraham's early life in the land of Ur of Chaldea, including the attempt made on his life by the priest of Elkenah and his miraculous deliverance; his revealed understanding and knowledge of the planetary systems; and his vision of the premortal Council in Heaven and Jesus's foreordination to be the Creator and Redeemer of the world--all of which are completely absent from the biblical text. While some debate whether the Prophet translated the book of Abraham from the characters found on the Egyptian papyrus he had in his possession or by direct revelation independent of the papyrus itself, the fact remains that the remarkable text that makes up the book of Abraham provides a convincing witness and testimony that Joseph Smith was indeed an inspired translator of ancient texts.<br><h2><strong>Joseph Smith as Revelator</strong></h2><br>In discussing Joseph Smith's role as a revelator, I do so in the context of the revelations that were actually written down or transcribed and identified by him as being revelatory documents.<br><br>The earliest surviving transcribed revelation by Joseph Smith is Doctrine and Covenants 3. The revelation is dated July 1828 and was received after Martin Harris lost the 116-page manuscript of the Book of Mormon. The transcription of this revelation, clear and powerful in content and tone, must have bolstered the twenty-two-year-old Prophet's confidence that he could indeed receive and record divine instruction. Thereafter, until his death in June 1844, Joseph Smith was the recipient of a steady and continuous flow of divine revelatory communication.<br><br>The Doctrine and Covenants contains 138 sections. All but four sections bear the revelatory stamp of Joseph Smith (see D&amp;amp;C 134, 135, 136, and 138). Four sections are composite revelations, originally composed of two to five separate revelations (see D&amp;amp;C 23, 30, 42, and 88). Five sections were extracted from letters dictated by the Prophet (see D&amp;amp;C 121, 122, 123, 127, and 128). At least eight sections were given through the Nephite interpreters or the seer stone (see D&amp;amp;C 3, 6, 7, 11, 14, 15, 16, and 17), and one section was given by means of an audible heavenly voice (see D&amp;amp;C 87; also 130:12–13). Two sections contain answers to questions about passages in the books of Revelation and Isaiah (see D&amp;amp;C 77 and 113, respectively, although D&amp;amp;C 74 and 86 could also fall under the category of receiving answers to questions asked about biblical passages). One section is the dedicatory prayer of the Kirtland Temple (see D&amp;amp;C 109), while another describes the appearances of Christ, Moses, Elias, and Elijah in the Kirtland Temple the week following the dedication (see D&amp;amp;C 110). Two sections are visions of heavenly realms (see D&amp;amp;C 76 and 137). Two sections are designated as "items of instruction," given in separate public meetings (D&amp;amp;C 130; see also D&amp;amp;C 131). With the exception of section 102, which is composed of the minutes of the first high council meeting, the revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants are similar in spiritual voice and expression.<br><br>Regardless, all could be considered revelations. Some are more doctrinally significant than others, but taken together they form a collection of doctrines, teachings, principles, prophecies, and commandments that are heart penetrating and mind expanding. Considering the spiritual magnitude of these revelations helps explain why the Prophet remarked that it is "an awful responsibility to write in the name of the Lord."<sup>27</sup> Yet Joseph Smith also understood that the source for the revelations was Jesus Christ. Speaking of the revelations, the Lord said:<br><br><i>These words are not of men nor of man, but of me; wherefore, you shall testify they are of me and not of man;</i><br><br><i>For it is my voice which speaketh them unto you; for they are given by my Spirit unto you.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 18:34–35]<br><br>Such a statement explains why the Prophet said, "I never told you I was perfect; but there is no error in the revelations which I have taught."<sup>28</sup><br><br>Given that the source of Joseph Smith's revelations was Jesus Christ, it would be virtually impossible for any uninspired person--one not endowed with the gift of the Holy Ghost--to produce anything comparable to the Prophet's collective revelations. It cannot be done, even if that individual were the most gifted, intelligent, or knowledgeable cerebral theologian, religious scholar, or academic. They could not do it.<sup>29</sup><br><br>Some have assumed that the Doctrine and Covenants constitutes all of Joseph Smith's known revelations, but such is not the case. In fact, there are a few dozen revelations received by the Prophet that are not included in the canon of scripture. The main reason these revelations were not included in the early editions of the Doctrine and Covenants is because the content was not considered to be relevant to the Church at large. One very important aspect of the Joseph Smith Papers Project will be the publication of all existing transcripted revelations received by the Prophet, including those not found in the Doctrine and Covenants.<sup>30</sup><br><h2><strong>Joseph Smith as Prophet</strong></h2><br>In Latter-day Saint terminology we generally refer to the president of the Church as the prophet, signifying that he is the highest governing officer in the Church and the Lord's spokesperson on earth. However, the word <i>prophet</i> has a much broader fundamental meaning.<br><br>Elder John A. Widtsoe wrote:<br><br><i>A prophet is a teacher. That is the essential meaning of the word. He teaches the body of truth, the gospel, revealed by the Lord to man; and under inspiration explains it to the understanding of the people. He is an expounder of truth.</i><sup>31</sup><br><br>In Joseph Smith's day, those not spiritually discerning might have been unimpressed by his demeanor or discourse, but to the faithful and God-fearing, his private counsel comforted their souls and his public sermons stirred their hearts. On April 6, 1837, Wilford Woodruff, upon hearing the Prophet preach in the Kirtland Temple, wrote the following entry in his journal:<br><br><i>President Joseph Smith Jr. arose and addressed the congregation for the term of three hours clothed with the power, spirit, and image of God. He unbosom'd his mind and feelings in the house of his friends. He presented many things of vast importance to the minds of the elders of Israel.</i><br><br><i>O that they might be written upon our hearts as with an iron pen to remain forever that we might practice them in our lives. That fountain of light, principle, and virtue that came forth out of the heart and mouth of the Prophet Joseph, whose soul like Enoch's swell'd wide as eternity. I say such evidences presented in such a forcible manner ought to drive into oblivion every particle of unbelief . . . from the mind of the hearers, for such language, sentiment, principle, and spirit cannot flow from darkness. Joseph Smith Jr. is a prophet of God raised up for the deliverance of Israel as true as my heart now burns within me while I am penning these lines which is as true as truth itself.</i><sup>32</sup><br><br>The Joseph Smith Collection in the Church Archives and a number of other repositories contain a significant body of documents that has been preserved relative to Joseph Smith's life. These records include his personal journals and histories, letters, newspaper reports, editorials, and various other primary source materials. In addition, Church members and other contemporaries of the Prophet recorded events and experiences associated with his life, including what they heard him discuss in his public sermons as well as in private conversations. From these sources has emerged a collection of many of the Prophet's teachings and his views on a number of subjects and topics.<br><br>Joseph Smith's life exemplified the role of what a prophet was, is, and should be. And he was not shy or reserved in letting others know that he was indeed a genuine prophet--one called and appointed by the very God of heaven Himself. His doctrinal teachings are profound, far-reaching, and all encompassing, and to those seeking additional light and truth, his inspired instructions and concepts are comparable in many instances to the eternal truths revealed in the canon of scripture. Here are just three examples:<br><br><i>Hell may pour forth its rage like the burning lava of Mount Vesuvius or of Etna or of the most terrible of the burning mountains, and yet shall Mormonism stand. . . . Truth is Mormonism. God is the author of it. He is our shield. It is by Him we received our birth. It was by His voice that we were called to a dispensation of His gospel in the beginning of the fulness of times. It was by Him we received the Book of Mormon, and it was by Him that we remain unto this day; and by Him we shall remain if it shall be for our glory. And in His almighty name we are determined to endure tribulation as good soldiers unto the end.</i><sup>33</sup><br><br><i>Happiness is the object and design of our existence, and will be the end thereof if we pursue the path that leads to it; and this path is virtue, uprightness, faithfulness, holiness, and keeping all the commandments of God. But we cannot keep all the commandments without first knowing them, and we cannot expect to know all, or more than we now know, unless we comply with or keep those we have already received. That which is wrong under one circumstance, may be and often is, right under another. God said thou shalt not kill--at another time he said thou shalt utterly destroy. This is the principle on which the government of heaven is conducted--by revelation adapted to the circumstances in which the children of the kingdom are placed. Whatever God requires is right, no matter what it is, although we may not see the reason thereof till long after the events transpire.</i><sup>34</sup><br><br><i>The things of God are of deep import, and time and experience and careful and ponderous and solemn thoughts can only find them out. Thy mind, O man, . . . must stretch as high as the utmost heavens, and search into and contemplate the lowest considerations of the darkest abyss, and expand upon the broad considerations of eternal expanse,</i> [and] <i>commune with God.</i><sup>35</sup><br><br>I give you my testimony that Joseph Smith's mind did indeed "stretch as high as the utmost heavens" and that he did indeed "commune with God" as a seer, translator, revelator, and prophet.<br><br><i>The Seer, the Seer, Joseph, the Seer! . . .</i><br><i>He gazed on the past and the future, too,</i><br><i>And opened . . . the heavenly world to view.</i><br><br>Of this I testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Alexander L.

He had vision after vision in order that his mind might be fully saturated with a knowledge of the things of God, and that he might comprehend the great and holy calling that God has bestowed upon him" (<i>JD</i> 23:362 [29 October 1882]). For additional statements concerning the heavenly beings who appeared to Joseph Smith, see <i>JD</i> 13:47; 18:326; 20:174–75; 21:65, 161–164; and 23:48–49.<br><br>9. From the minutes of a meeting held October 11, 1883, in "Salt Lake School of the Prophets Minute Book, 1883," Church History Library, Salt Lake City, 67; and in <i>Salt Lake School of the Prophets Minute Book, 1883</i> (Palm Desert, California: ULC Press, 1981), 45; Zebedee Coltrin also remembered Adam being "a large broadshouldered man, and Eve as a woman . . . as large in proportion."<br><br>The Prophet's manuscript history is the source for the date of the conference, which took place April 21, 1834, in the area of New Portage, Ohio (see Manuscript History of the Church, vol. A–1, 459–65, Church History Library; and <i>HC</i> 2:50, 52).<br><br>10. For descriptions of these mind visions, in addition to several others, see Baugh, "Parting the Veil," 32–48.<br><br>11. Joseph Smith obtained the stone, described as dark brown in color, while digging a well for Willard Chase around 1822 (see Willard Chase, "Testimony of William Chase," in Eber D. Howe, <i>Mormonism Unvailed</i> [Painesville, Ohio: Eber D. Howe, 1834], 240–41). This discovery occurred only two years after the First Vision but five years before Joseph obtained the plates and the interpreters from Moroni in 1827.<br><br>12. Joseph Smith, quoted in Joseph Knight Sr., "Manuscript of the Early History of Joseph Smith Finding of Plates," Church History Library; see Dean C.

Cook, ed., <i>David Whitmer Interviews: A Restoration Witness</i> (Orem, Utah: Grandin Book, 1991), 150. Joseph Smith returned the Nephite interpreters to Moroni at the completion of the translation (see Joseph Smith--History 1:60). It appears that following the completion of the Book of Mormon translation, the Prophet's use of the seer stone also declined. "Soon after the translation of the Book of Mormon was complete, Joseph Smith gave the stone to Oliver Cowdery, who possessed the stone until his death in 1848. That same year Phineas Young visited Oliver's widow, Lucy Cowdery, and persuaded her to give it to him. He returned to Salt Lake City and presented it to his brother, Brigham Young. The stone has remained in the possession of the Church since that time" (Baugh, "Parting the Veil," 52, note 35).<br><br>16.

Within days after this revelation was given, the three witnesses were privileged to receive a divine manifestation in which they saw Moroni, the Book of Mormon plates, and the sacred Nephite-Jaredite artifacts. Following their vision the witnesses transcribed a written testimony about their experience. In that testimony the three men stated that they knew the Book of Mormon had "been translated by the gift and power of God, for his voice hath declared it unto us; wherefore we know of a surety that the work is true" (Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris, "The Testimony of the Three Witnesses," introduction to the Book of Mormon).<br><br>20. Wilford Woodruff, <i>Wilford Woodruff's Journal, 1833–1898 Typescript,</i> ed. Scott G. Kenney, 9 vols. (Midvale, Utah: Signature Books, 1983–84), 2:139. Woodruff's entry was included word for word in Joseph Smith's manuscript history under the date of November 28, 1841 (see Manuscript History of the Church, vol. C–1, 1255; and <i>HC</i> 4:461; see also the introduction to the Book of Mormon).<br><br>21. <i>HC</i> 1:35–36.<br><br>22.

Of the 3,400 verse changes made by Joseph Smith, approximately 1,300 were in the Old Testament and 2,100 in the New Testament (see Scott H. Faulring, Kent P. Jackson, and Robert J. Matthews, eds., <i>Joseph Smith's New Translation of the Bible: Original Manuscripts</i> [Provo: Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University, 2004], 5).<br><br>24. One example of a Joseph Smith Translation change that was not in the 1979 Latter-day Saint edition of the King James Version of the Bible but was included in the 2013 edition comes from a passage from the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 7:21–23. The passage in the 1979 edition reads:<br><br><i>Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.</i><br><br><i>Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?</i><br><br><i>And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.</i><br><br>Now note the following change rendered by Joseph Smith to verse 23 (verse 33 in the Joseph Smith Translation) in the 2013 edition:<br><br><i>And then will I say, <b>Ye never knew me;</b> depart from me ye that work iniquity.</i> [Emphasis added]<br><br>Although the change is a small one, it provides an insightful and completely different meaning to the passage.<br><br>25. For a scholarly analysis of the Enoch passages in the book of Moses, see Jeffrey M. Bradshaw and David J. Larsen, <i>In God's Image and Likeness 2: Enoch, Noah, and the Tower of Babel</i> (Salt Lake City: The Interpreter Foundation and Eborn Books, 2014), 33–196.<br><br>26. Manuscript History of the Church, vol. B–1, 596; see also <i>HC</i> 2:236.

During a November 1831 conference at Hiram, Ohio, the decision was made to publish in book form a selection of Joseph Smith's revelations, but some of the elders expressed concerns over the wording, language, and phrasing of the revelations. To satisfy their concern, a test was proposed that basically consisted of composing a revelation. If the brethren could come up with a revelation equal to that of which they considered to be the least of any of the Prophet's revelations, they would be justified in condemning them for not being genuine. However, if they failed in their attempt, they were to "bear record" (i.e., compose a written testimony) that Joseph Smith's revelations were true and came from God (D&amp;amp;C 67:8; see also verses 1–8).<br><br>The elders who questioned the veracity of the revelations ultimately failed in their attempt to compose a comparable revelation (see Manuscript History of the Church, A–1, 162–63; and <i>HC</i> 1:226).<br><br>In accordance with the divine instructions, Sidney Rigdon, Orson Hyde, William E. McLellin, Luke Johnson, and Lyman Johnson's names were attached to a document wherein they testified that the revelations were "given by inspiration of God &amp;amp; are profitable for all men &amp;amp; are verily true" (Revelation Book 1, in Robin Scott Jensen, Robert J. Woodford, and Steven C. Harper, eds., <i>Revelations and Translations, Volume 1: Manuscript Revelation Books,</i> vol. 1 of the Revelations and Translations series of <i>The Joseph Smith Papers,</i> ed. Dean C. Jessee, Ronald K. Esplin, and Richard Lyman Bushman [Salt Lake City: Church Historian's Press, 2011], 165–66).<br><br>Thirteen additional signatories, each of whom were living in Missouri, later attached their names to the document (see <i>JSP</i> RT1:167).<br><br>30.

<h1>sings of Choice - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
We are and will be faced with all types of choices throughout our lives. Each choice we make or action we take carries some type of consequence. The consequence can be positive or negative. A consequence does not always have to be negative; I think we are conditioned to think of consequences as negative. Sometimes consequences appear to be both negative and positive, depending on your point of view.<br><br>Sometimes we make choices thinking we are doing good, only to have our good intentions and deeds backfire and make a bad situation worse. Sometimes we immediately regret a decision or choice. Sometimes regret comes later and with someone saying to us, "I told you so." Other times we may say or do something that we later find out actually inspired or uplifted someone. Sometimes we choose not to make a choice and instead let nature or circumstances unfold as they will. This reminds me of several lines from one of my favorite songs by Rush called "Freewill":<br><br><i>If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.</i><br><i>You can choose from phantom fears and kindness that can kill.</i><br><i>I will choose a path that's clear;</i><br><i>I will choose freewill.</i><br><h2><strong>Choosing Your Path</strong></h2><br>One of the great blessings we enjoy in this life is the blessing of choice--choosing the path our life will take and, maybe more important, the type of person we want to become.<br><br>We have a huge number of directions we can steer our lives in. You can allow others to steer for you and guide you on the path. There are plenty of people who will be more than happy to tell you what you should and should not do. They may even let you pay them for their advice. You can also decide to do whatever you fancy--it is your life, after all, and God has blessed you with agency. Or you can let life happen and just roll with the changes. Or maybe, best yet, you can be proactive and make the choices that best suit you and the direction you want your life to take.<br><br>Let me caution you that simply making certain decisions does not guarantee that you will end up exactly where you expect to be. The choice I am talking about is the type of person you want to be, regardless of where your life and vocation take you.<br><br>When I was in junior high and high school I was interested in several careers. The first and foremost was to play professional football. The second was to coach football and be a PE teacher. The third and most fleeting was to be a lead singer for an epic hard rock band.<br><br>The lead singer career was the first to fade as I realized three facts about myself: (1) I am not a good singer or screamer, (2) I really don't enjoy being on stage in front of people, and (3) I wasn't really ready for the superstar lifestyle and all that comes with it.<br><br>My poor singing ability was reconfirmed to me some years ago when my ward choir pleaded for male voices. They said any male voice was welcome. I decided to test how serious they were by sitting right behind the ward choir director during sacrament meeting and singing loud enough for her to hear me. This was my way of trying out for the choir. I did this for three straight weeks. The only response I got was a pained smile as the choir director turned to look and see who was making the strange sounds behind her. I received no personal invitation to join the choir.<br><br>I haven't given up singing. I just limit the venues I perform in. My current singing venue is in my old Chevy pickup truck when I crank up the stereo, roll the windows down, and sing along with one of my favorite bands on what you would call the classic rock station.<br><br>What happened to my pro football dream? Well, I will be honest: I wasn't really willing to put in the work and make the necessary sacrifices--plus, in reality, I probably wasn't ever as good as I thought I was. I did try coaching and teaching PE, and I enjoyed it, but that wasn't how I would make my living.<br><br>All of my vocational dreams fell apart before I left on my mission or soon after I returned from my mission. I didn't realize it at the time, but my life was destined to lead me through several twists and turns before I found a vocation and a career that suited me.<br><br>I struggled to find a major that suited me and later a career that would allow me to be the person I wanted to be and still provide for my family. I am very aware of what it feels like to be unemployed, wondering why no one wants to hire you. I am also aware of how it feels to be underemployed, wondering, "Why is this the only place that wants me?" Was I afraid my life would never get any better than it was? Sure, at times I was.<br><br>I want to share with you some of what I believe blessed my life and helped me find my way in this world and continues to help me find my way. At the ripe old age of fifty-one I am still finding my way--mostly because I have not achieved perfection yet and don't expect to anytime soon. I am just happy to know I am headed in the right direction.<br><h2><strong>Those Who Have Enriched and Blessed My Life</strong></h2><br>First, I must acknowledge my parents. Larry and Catherine were good parents and did their best to teach me all the things they thought I should know: how to share, love, work hard, be honest, love God and my Savior, treat others the way I want to be treated, endure hard things, be optimistic, look forward to marriage and a family of my own, stand up for the underdog, appreciate God's creations, treat a woman, think for myself, serve, clean, cook, do laundry, drive, and not be wasteful--among many other things. My mom was always very good at helping me face consequences. She helped me understand the importance of repenting, apologizing, and asking for forgiveness. She accompanied me to several homes in our neighborhood, where I got to practice repenting.<br><br>Next I have to thank and acknowledge my wife. Even though I was taught how to behave, it has been my wife--my soul mate, if you will--who has helped refine me the most. It is through our relationship and her patience and support that I have begun to understand what it means to love someone. I was in love when we first got married--no doubt about that--but now it is so much more. True love and friendship have blossomed through all the struggles we have been through together. I hate to think about where we would be had we quit on each other. When I think of my woman I like to think of a song by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, "Here Comes My Girl":<br><br><i>And then she looks me in the eye, says, "We gonna last forever."</i><br><i>And man, you know I can't begin to doubt it,</i><br><i>No, because this feels so good and so free and so right.</i><br><i>I know we ain't never goin' change our minds about it.</i><br><br>Her patience and faith in me have been a great blessing. Having a wife who knows the value of sacrificing wants for what is really important has been key to our family's well-being.<br><br>We were blessed to be able to be involved with our kids through church, school, and sports. My wife had this habit of signing me up to coach when she went to the recreation center to sign the kids up for one of the many sports they played. She signed me up to coach every season, even though I had announced my official retirement from coaching the previous season. She knew better, and now our children are all grown up and I have all these great memories of the extra time I got to spend with my sons and daughters and their friends. I still have young adults stop me occasionally and ask me if I remember them from one of the teams I was able to coach.<br><br>I also have to acknowledge my faith and my church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I love being a Mormon. I have learned so much through my association with this faith. It has helped refine me and guide me and has helped me find a purpose bigger than myself that is eternal in nature. It has taught me to endure to the end and that to love God is to love my fellow beings, that salvation is through the Savior, and that salvation is possible. The plan of salvation, or great plan of happiness, brings me great comfort. I think of all those who have gone on before and who wait on the other side. I love the eternal nature of families. It all comes down to the importance of family. I love my family. They are my greatest inspiration and motivation. I also love how my church has taught me to find strength in the midst of trials and to draw spiritual strength from the trials of our ancestors.<br><br>There are many people and experiences that have enriched and blessed my life. Ever since I can remember I have wanted to have an eternal family. I have always instinctively known that the plan of salvation is true doctrine. It is my belief that most people, whether LDS or not, believe they will see their loved ones again after this life. It is my faith and belief in God's plan of salvation that has helped guide me and will continue to guide my life and the choices I make.<br><h2><strong>Learning from Life's Difficult Experiences</strong></h2><br>I would like to share a few experiences from my early life that helped me develop my testimony and character. When I was about nine years old I suffered from the extreme fear of nothingness. The nothingness I feared was that there is nothing after and outside of this life. I had been taught to pray, so I put prayer into practice. We were living in Crow Agency, Montana, at the time, and it seemed I spent a large part of my time in the back of our family's Chrysler station wagon (Larry was a Chrysler/Dodge man and loved the big engines in those wagons). In rural Montana a short trip was anywhere between ten and 100 miles. Needless to say, I had lots of time to ponder the great mysteries of life while facing backward in the backseat of the old Safari classic station wagon.<br><br>On one particularly dark and ominous night the fear of nothingness got so bad that I felt sick inside. I prayed a silent prayer just to know that God was there and that life after death is real. I felt an almost instant feeling of warmth and assurance that God is there and that His plan of salvation is real. It is hard to describe even now how good I felt then and how good I feel now when I remember that experience.<br><br>I grew up on the Crow Indian Reservation and attended a small branch off the reservation in Hardin, Montana. I had always looked forward to becoming a deacon; passing the sacrament seemed like a big deal and a worthy goal. I made it to age twelve and passed off the Articles of Faith, which someone had led me to believe I had to do or I would be stuck in Primary until I did.<br><br>I then needed the outfit of a deacon--the white shirt, tie, slacks, and shiny shoes. My parents, especially my mother, were very frugal, and I was growing at rates they found hard to gauge. Often I was outfitted in clothes they predicted I would grow into. So my first Sunday as a deacon I was outfitted in a white shirt with one of my dad's clip-on ties--Larry loved the convenience of clip-on ties and hadn't yet had time to teach me to tie a real tie--black shiny shoes, and a pair of black slacks about four sizes too big. I found a belt and strapped those big pants on nice and high, well above my waist, so the cuffs didn't drag in the snow and ice.<br><br>As I was marching up to take my place on the bench in front of the sacrament table, several different members of the branch made jokes about my attire, especially the size of my slacks. By the time I reached the deacon bench, I had lost most of my self-confidence and desire to pass the sacrament. I soldiered up anyway and self-consciously did my deacon duty and passed the sacrament. After sacrament meeting I had just about decided to quit and not come back the next Sunday. What happened next is not miraculous. (And I eventually grew into the pants.) I decided that I couldn't and wouldn't let what other people think and say about me keep me from doing what is right for me. I also learned I needed to be a little less sensitive. I know the jokesters who had made fun of me and my big, oversized pants probably thought they were funny and did not mean any harm and would have felt bad had they known how their comments affected me. Now when there is something I know I should do or want to do, I think of that kid in the oversized pants, and I hike my pants up and move ahead.<br><br>I probably spent more time as an undergraduate student than I needed to. My wife was very patient with my academic endeavors. I changed my major at least twice before I found something I truly excelled at. I remember that as I was closing in on graduation I was informed that if I wanted to graduate that coming April, I needed to complete a basic math class that was worth zero credits. I had avoided math as much as possible and had thought I was done with it. But I signed up for the class my final semester as an undergraduate at BYU.<br><br>I knew I was in trouble as soon as I picked up the textbook at the Bookstore. This class turned out to be one of the most academically challenging experiences I have ever had. I spent many hours in the math lab trying to learn algebra. I wore out one poor tutor. She must have thought there was something seriously wrong with my memory. I faithfully worked with her every week up until the final exam. She was very kind and patient.<br><br>I remember leaving the math lab for the last time and heading to the testing center before I lost the knowledge I had gained that day. Amazingly, I did pass the final test and the class. I had such a feeling of relief and jubilation erupt in me that I could hardly stand it. I was going to graduate! I was so grateful I did not have to go home and disappoint my wife. Instead we got to celebrate this achievement together. My grade in the class was not good, but I am probably as proud of that grade as I am of any I have ever earned because I truly earned it.<br><br>These experiences are far from the most difficult of my life; however, from these experiences I have learned whom I can trust and lean on when I have difficult situations to endure. I know I can always rely on my Heavenly Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the influence of the Comforter. I have learned that if you work hard and have faith, God puts people in your life (like a math tutor) to help you accomplish what may seem improbable. I also have learned that it is important to forgive and be grateful and that when things are tough, I can hike up my pants and move forward, whether I look good doing it or not.<br><h2><strong>Deciding Who You Will Be</strong></h2><br>I began my remarks talking about choices. As important as choices are--such as what to major in, what career path to take, where to live, and where to send the kids to school--the choices you make regarding the type of person you want to be are, in my opinion, more important and will help you make those very important decisions regarding the direction you choose for your life and your family. As you stay close to the Lord, it may at times seem that as much as you want one path, you will feel inspired and guided--pushed--in another direction.<br><br>If you would like, you can take some time and think about the type of person you want to be from now through eternity. Deciding what kind of person you want to be does not eliminate difficult decisions or make you perfect, but I believe it will help you to make better choices and find peace of mind. What characteristics and attributes are important to you? Personal integrity, honesty, time with family, kindness, patience, perseverance, work ethic, frugality, service, respect for others, charity?<br><br>Anything good or worthwhile takes time, practice, and perseverance. The temptation to be less than you know you can be is always lurking and ready to present itself to you as an opportunity for personal gain or pleasure. Walking away from temptation--even when no one would know--and being true to yourself and God is a test passed. You and I will continue to take on many tests of our character and resolve. Often the pressure to be less will come from unexpected sources, such as desperate friends and family unwilling to accept consequences. Failing a test is not the end of the world. Failing to learn from that test could be.<br><br>When I am dealing with things that are physically, mentally, or spiritually hard, I like to recite scriptures in my mind to help remind me that God is mindful of me. Here are three of my favorite scriptures that I like to recite during difficult or challenging times:<br><br><i>And, if you keep my commandments and endure to the end you shall have eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 14:7]<br><br><i>Yea, and as often as my people repent will I forgive them their trespasses against me.</i> [Mosiah 26:30]<br><br><i>I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.</i> [Philippians 4:13]<br><br>Our ability to endure and continue to repent and improve is a blessing that is within each of our abilities and our grasp. We have so many great promises from God in the scriptures--promises we can count on if we are willing to reach out to God. I hope we can all be happy with who we are and who we are becoming. I like "me," and I hope to like myself even better as I become a better version of me.<br><br>Life is a journey, and I hope you enjoy it. May God bless you in all you do. God does live, and He is mindful of each of us. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>James L. Slaughter was BYU chaplain and assistant dean of students when this devotional address was given on 1 July 2014.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

You heard in the introduction that I am a biologist. Not surprisingly, as a young child I had a fascination with catching animals. I went through several phases in this interest. I first fell in love with lizards and toads. I then moved on to turtles and from those to small mammals and birds and fishes. I even had a scorpion phase. That one ended quite abruptly after I caught about a dozen scorpions and brought them into the house. I wanted to preserve them, so I doused them with rubbing alcohol until they no longer moved. I then proudly set each one out on the top of our television set to show my mother, who would be arriving home late that evening.<br><br>Apparently I then fell asleep, because the next thing I remember was hearing my mother screaming. I quickly realized that the rubbing alcohol treatment had not worked and that the scorpions were definitely not dead. In fact, they were loose in the house. That ended my scorpion phase.<br><br>Today, as a professor of biology, my students and I continue to collect and study different organisms throughout the world as we seek to understand how the richness of our living world has come about.<br><br>One thing I have learned in all of my years of collecting is that you need to know what you are looking for. In biology we refer to this as developing a "search image." Many species show remarkable adaptations that make it difficult for them to be found. A quick search on the Internet for "hidden animal images" will show just how striking some of these creatures are. Among the many images you will find will be geckos that look like dried-up leaves, frogs that have the shape and color of lichen, spiders that blend in with wood, green caterpillars with stripes that almost perfectly match the venation of leaves, and owls whose feathers look so much like the trees they perch on that a person could walk by one and never even know it was there. It often takes a bit of work to detect these hidden organisms, but with a trained eye and experience, you get better and better at it.<br><br>Today I would like to focus my thoughts on the idea of developing <i>eyes to see.</i> Just as a biologist must learn how to see organisms in their natural habitat, each of us has been invited by Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ to develop spiritual eyes to see and understand certain truths in our world so that we might help bring about God's great purpose, which is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of all of Heavenly Father's children--including you.<br><br>But how exactly does this work? What does it mean to have eyes to see? And how will we know if we have seen what is intended for us? The Savior Himself offered some insight into these questions and warned us that this might not be easy. Do you remember in the book of Matthew in the New Testament when Jesus started teaching in parables and His disciples came to Him and said--and now I am paraphrasing--"Hey, why are you teaching the people in parables?"<br><br>I get the sense from the scriptures that the disciples thought that this approach was perhaps too difficult for some of the people. Clearly it was not as easy to understand as the messages He delivered in the Sermon on the Mount. We know that the use of parables was a way to both reveal and conceal. But I want to focus on exactly how Jesus answered this question. Do you remember what He said? In Matthew we read:<br><br><i>He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.</i><br><br><i>For whosoever <b>receiveth,</b> to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance;</i><br><br><i>But whosoever <b>continueth not to receive,</b> from him shall be taken away even that he hath.</i><br><br><i>Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they, seeing, see not; and hearing, they hear not; neither do they understand.</i> [JST, Matthew 13:9–12; emphasis added; see also Matthew 13:11–13]<br><br>My dear brothers and sisters, sometimes this is us. Sometimes we choose not to receive what God has made available to us. We live in a world in which it is possible to have spiritual truths and access to revelation all around us, but, for whatever reason, we sometimes fail to find it. The good news is that we can get better and better at developing a spiritual search image. The really good news is that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ love us so deeply that They have created a world in which there is so much spiritual treasure to see and to find.<br><br>With permission, let me share a story of a young man who spotted a spiritual truth intended for him. Wesley was one of my Boy Scouts a few years ago. He had encountered a hardship in his life that would be difficult for anyone to bear, let alone a young boy. His father had died unexpectedly, and Wesley understandably was trying to make sense of it. That summer Wesley came with us to Scout camp. After a full week of fun and adventure together, we all sat around a campfire on our last night and shared feelings about our fears and our hopes and the things that we knew to be true. I will never forget one thing that Wesley said that night. As he looked into the sky he said, "You know, Heavenly Father didn't have to make the world so beautiful, but He did. And so I know that He loves us and that He loves me."<br><br>Wesley didn't just see bright stars and a calm lake and majestic trees. He didn't just see the outcome of the natural processes that have brought about this world. He saw evidence of a loving God and a merciful Savior. Wesley had discovered what Alma had taught and what Moses had taught and what other prophets have taught: that we live in a world with a purpose. In the book of Moses, Jesus Christ said it this way:<br><br><i>And behold, all things have their likeness, and all things are created and made to bear record of me, both things which are temporal, and things which are spiritual; things which are in the heavens above, and things which are on the earth, and things which are in the earth, and things which are under the earth, both above and beneath: all things bear record of me.</i> [Moses 6:63]<br><br>The last phrase in that scripture is important. It says "all things" bear record of Jesus Christ. Do we live so that we see evidence of a loving God in all aspects of our lives, or do we find it only when we decide it is time for formal worship?<br><br>I am a biologist, and I am amazed at how frequently I have been taught the lessons of the gospel through examples from the natural world. But we can have faith that regardless of what we study or what our vocation is or where we live or who we are, we can find evidence that Jesus Christ is the Creator and Redeemer of the world and that God the Father lives, that He is literally our Father.<br><br>One of the most remarkable things about Brigham Young University is that we invite all members of our community to find what is sacred and spiritual in the work that they do. I recently met with a group of new BYU faculty members. Our discussion centered on how to combine faith and intellect, both in the classroom and in our research. I was deeply impressed as each new faculty member talked about ways that Heavenly Father had blessed them with stronger testimonies as a result of the scientific research they were doing. What they did for their daily work honed their understanding of our Heavenly Father. Of course this invitation to see the hand of the Creator in our lives is extended to all people.<br><br>How do we live so that we can develop eyes to see--to see the things all around us that bear witness of Jesus Christ? May I offer two simple suggestions?<br><br>First, we must desire it. We must desire to see the world and those around us with spiritual eyes. Elder Neal A. Maxwell said it this way:<br><br>Desire <i>denotes a real longing or craving. Hence righteous desires are much more than passive preferences or fleeting feelings. . . .</i><br><br><i>Therefore, what we insistently desire, over time, is what we will eventually become and what we will receive.</i> ["According to the Desire of [Our] Hearts," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1996, 21]<br><br>In that beautiful 29th chapter of Alma in the Book of Mormon, Alma said it this way: "I know that [God] granteth unto men according to their desire . . . ; yea, I know that he allotteth unto men . . . according to their wills" (Alma 29:4). What we righteously desire, we usually get. Unfortunately, the opposite is also true: what we unrighteously desire, we also usually get.<br><br>My friend Mike recently taught me the importance of cultivating righteous desires. Mike is a good man. He served for a season as a bishop in a BYU ward and has had great success personally and professionally. He told me that he had been pondering an important question in his life and that this had gone on for some time. He had prayerfully asked for insights that might help him find an answer. Recently he felt impressed to ask Heavenly Father to teach him through his dreams. He confessed to me that he has never really been much of a dreamer, but still he acted on those promptings and asked in faith. In response, he actually had a dream that brought a remarkable peace to him. If we are to see spiritual truths in our lives, we must desire them and, as simple as it sounds, we must ask to see them.<br><br>The second thing that we must do to have eyes to see is prepare ourselves to receive personal revelation. Ultimate understanding requires revelation. For some this will be manifested through occasional promptings from the Holy Spirit. For those who have entered into the covenant of baptism, we have a promise that we can have the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost to help us perceive and understand truth. In the Book of Mormon the prophet Moroni taught, "By the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things" (Moroni 10:5). What the Holy Ghost can teach us exceeds what we can discover on our own.<br><br>Now it is worth asking what will happen to us as we begin to see the world through spiritual eyes, from the Savior's perspective. First of all, we will undoubtedly learn new truths. Little by little we will better understand the great plan of our Heavenly Father and His will for us. This is how the Lord teaches us, and as we come to recognize His truths, He will reveal more and more to us. In 2 Nephi we read:<br><br><i>For behold, thus saith the Lord God: I will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will give more; and from them that shall say, We have enough, from them shall be taken away even that which they have.</i> [2 Nephi 28:30]<br><br>Hence it is essential that we are consistently receiving revelation. If we are not, we risk losing the understanding that we already have.<br><br>There is also a remarkable secondary benefit that will come from this effort. Seeing things from the Savior's perspective will change our attitudes and our behavior. Let me offer a few examples of this. One thing that will likely happen is that we will begin to see others and ourselves for who we really are. Each week I have the opportunity to see the young women in my ward stand and recite these words:<br><br><i>We are daughters of our Heavenly Father, who loves us, and we love Him. We will "stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places" (Mosiah 18:9).</i> [<i>Personal Progress,</i> 2nd ed. (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2009), 3]<br><br>When we see each other as daughters and sons of our Heavenly Father, it changes us. It takes us away from superficial thinking in which we define ourselves as beautiful or athletic or intellectual or popular or not. Instead we begin to see each other as brothers and sisters with the singular purpose of striving to become ready to return to live with our Heavenly Father. Eyes that see this way replace harsh judgment with compassion and charity, helping us change our motives so that love is at the core of what we do. Eyes that see this way help us see how to overcome the natural man, who is an enemy to God.<br><br>For the past year I have tried to recall and to notice when people act in ways that show a godly perspective. I see it all the time now. I was impressed as I watched the end of a high school basketball game last winter. It was the last varsity game of the season. Five players who had not seen much playing time were sent to check into the game. All five wanted badly for their chance to get in and score. A foul was called, stopping the clock. The referee motioned for four of the players to come in; the fifth would have to wait for the free-throw shooter to finish his shot. It was then that one young substitute player recognized that the teammate who had played least of all that season would be the one left waiting at the scorer's table. So he motioned for this teammate to go in his place. This young man who gave up his own chance to play had eyes to see. Like young Mormon, he was "quick to observe" (Mormon 1:2). He saw perhaps what he thought our Savior would have seen--that his sacrifice could lift another person.<br><br>Oh, that we could always have eyes to see others as the Savior does. I think many of our natural man tendencies would fade away. Charity would motivate our actions. We wouldn't define others by their ACT scores or their dress or their planned profession or what sins they had or had not committed or any other imperfect indicator of the worth of a daughter or a son of God.<br><br>I had an interesting experience in which I was taught this just a couple of months ago. I took a group of students to Costa Rica as part of a tropical field biology class. I was excited to have these students with me. I have been conducting research on tropical fishes in Costa Rica for almost twenty years now. Given the many times I have been in Costa Rica, I warned my students about how to be safe. I recalled to them a time years earlier when our rental car had been broken into and several valuables had been taken. I told them what a hassle that had been and how angry and violated I had felt by that incident.<br><br>I had a great group of students with me this year. We began each day with a small devotional and a prayer, often asking Heavenly Father to watch over us. On the fourth day of our trip we arrived in a small city called Liberia, where we planned to have lunch. We parked our van in an attended lot adjacent to the town square, right across the street from a building that housed several police officers. We locked the van and asked the man attending the parking lot to keep an eye on our vehicle while we ate lunch. When we returned thirty minutes later, we found that the side window of the van had been broken and that four of our backpacks had been stolen.<br><br>I could not believe that with all of the precautions we had taken, our vehicle had been broken into again. As you can imagine, my first feeling might have again been one of anger. I knew that this meant hours in a police station and the need to replace the van, not to mention the items that were lost. Yet a remarkable thing happened to me. I had an overwhelming feeling of love come into my heart for the people who had perpetrated this crime. I could not believe what I was feeling. These impressions came to me quite strongly for several seconds. They completely changed my perspective. Rather than protecting our van, Heavenly Father was teaching me something. I wondered what circumstances had brought these people to a point in which they were acting in such desperate ways. I knew in that moment that God loves all of His children. Those feelings were a gift to me to know how our Savior feels about us, even when we sin.<br><br>I was so proud of the students who were with me. Rather than feeling anger, they also felt compassion. They truly accepted the Savior's invitation:<br><br><i>Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.</i> [Matthew 5:44]<br><br>Having eyes to see helps us maintain a godly perspective in an earthly existence.<br><br>It is so easy, so human, to <i>not</i> love those who do harm to us or who are different from us. These differences might be physical, they might be social, or they might be economic or political or based on degree of education. At our worst we might be tempted to ignore or to marginalize or to outright reject these individuals. Yet the Savior seemed to feel particularly tender toward those who were outcast--think of lepers, of lost sheep, of publicans, of sinners. The Savior reached out to all of them.<br><br>With eyes to see, you will understand that individuals who are different from you are loved by our Heavenly Father every bit as much as He loves you. I recall serving as a ward mission leader in a large city in the Pacific Northwest. One evening I had the opportunity to take one of the full-time missionaries with me as we looked up addresses of members of the Church whose names were on our rolls but whom we had never seen at church.<br><br>One evening we knocked at a door and a man answered. His appearance shocked us. He was not dressed in a way that one would expect. We asked him if he knew where we might find a certain brother who was a member of our church, to which he replied that he was that man. At first we weren't sure if we could believe him; his appearance and lifestyle seemed so distant from our expectations. He told us that he had served a full-time mission but that he had drifted far from activity in the Church and that he had essentially abandoned the Church and forsaken the gospel of Jesus Christ. Without much expectation we invited him to return. We told him what time and where we met on Sunday. And, to be honest, I thought that would be the end of it.<br><br>Then Sunday came, and to my great astonishment this man entered the chapel just after sacrament meeting had started. As I looked from the stand toward him, I could see that his appearance was just as it had been when we met him at his home. I could tell that he felt a bit uncomfortable as he found a seat at the back of the chapel. After the service was over I quickly raced to his side, trying to insulate him from what I worried might be awkward comments from others about how he looked. We talked for several minutes, and then he told me that he wanted to attend priesthood meeting. So I brought him in. There he was in a room full of men wearing suits and white shirts and ties. I feared that he would not be received well--his appearance and apparent lifestyle could have so easily drawn out a sense of exclusion from the men who sat in that room.<br><br>I stood and introduced him, and the response from those priesthood men will forever be burned in my heart. Almost in unison they said, "Welcome back, brother. Welcome back."<br><br>This response prompted a feeling of love that eventually led to an earnest prayer by this good man--a prayer that Heavenly Father answered so forcefully that it led to a mighty change of heart in this man that I could scarcely have imagined.<br><br>This is a beautiful story with a wonderful ending that I wish I had time to share. But what has always stood out in my mind is how these priesthood brothers saw who this man really was, not who he appeared to be. They understood what the Lord meant when He said to Samuel:<br><br><i>Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature . . . : for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.</i> [1 Samuel 16:7]<br><br>They understood the great love that God feels for His children. President Dieter F. Uchtdorf said it so kindly in the October 2009 general conference. He said:<br><br><i>Think of the purest, most all-consuming love you can imagine. Now multiply that love by an infinite amount--that is the measure of God's love for you.</i><br><br><i>God does not look on the outward appearance. I believe that He doesn't care one bit if we live in a castle or a cottage, if we are handsome or homely, if we are famous or forgotten. Though we are incomplete, God loves us completely. Though we are imperfect, He loves us perfectly. Though we may feel lost and without compass, God's love encompasses us completely.</i><br><br><i>He loves us because He is filled with an infinite measure of holy, pure, and indescribable love. We are important to God not because of our résumé but because we are His children. He loves every one of us, even those who are flawed, rejected, awkward, sorrowful, or broken. God's love is so great that He loves even the proud, the selfish, the arrogant, and the wicked.</i> ["The Love of God," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2009, 22–23]<br><br>This good brother might have felt that there was no longer a place for him in the Church. But of course there was. And there is a place for each of us in the Church of Jesus Christ. To those of you who wonder whether or not you belong or who are struggling to find your place, please know that you belong. We need you. The Lord needs you.<br><br>I am so grateful for living prophets. We live in turbulent times, when many "call evil good, and good evil" (Isaiah 5:20). In His great mercy our Heavenly Father has called and bestowed keys upon prophets today. What a gift this is. They serve as oracles to help guide us in ways that will keep us safe from evil.<br><br>It is true that they are people. I will never forget when I was a graduate student living in New England when President Gordon B. Hinckley came to speak at an area conference. We sat near the front of a great auditorium rented to accommodate the large gathering of Saints.<br><br>Before the meeting began, my oldest son, Erik, who was just three years old at the time, broke loose and ran forward toward the stage where President Hinckley was seated. As young parents, I think my wife and I were a bit embarrassed at what might happen next, fearing that Erik would end up on the stand singing and dancing. Yet as Erik approached, President Hinckley saw him coming and in the kindest way smiled at him and waved affectionately, just as any grandfather would do. Erik stopped to wave back, providing us just enough time to corner the kid.<br><br>Yes, prophets are real people, but they are much more than that. They are direct conduits to our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. They act by authority to administer the Church as directed by Jesus Christ, whose church this is. Each of us has the privilege to gain a testimony that Jesus Christ has called prophets today. I am grateful for this direct link to heaven and that man is not left untethered but, rather, that the keys of the kingdom have been restored to the earth and that they reside with living prophets. When we have eyes to see the divine calling that prophets hold and when we act upon their words, we put ourselves in a place of spiritual safety.<br><br>Finally, and most important, how do we see Jesus Christ? Interestingly, Jesus asked His own disciples this very question:<br><br><i>Whom do men say that I am?</i><br><br><i>And they answered, John the Baptist: but some say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.</i><br><br><i>And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.</i> [Mark 8:27–29]<br><br>Elder Robert D. Hales put it this way:<br><br><i>Think of</i> [it]. <i>At</i> [some] <i>point in our eternal progression, each one of us is going to have to answer the question Who is Jesus Christ? We are told that every eye shall see, every ear shall hear, and every knee shall bow, every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord (see Philip. 2:10–11); "When all men shall stand to be judged of him, then shall they confess that he is God" (Mosiah 27:31).</i> ["What Think Ye of Christ?" "Whom Say Ye That I Am?" <i>Ensign,</i> May 1979, 77]<br><br>I testify that Jesus Christ is a god. He is more than a great man who lived on the earth two thousand years ago. He is the Firstborn Son of our Heavenly Father. He is our Savior and the Redeemer of the world. He is also a Creator. The world that we live in is here for a purpose. With eyes to see, we can find evidence in our world that God loves us and that He knows us. I also testify that if we desire it and if we ask Him, He will reveal truth unto us. This truth will help guide us in our own eternal progression. He will allow us to see others for who they really are.<br><br>What a blessing it is to see each other as brothers and sisters, each of infinite worth in the eyes of God. How can we be anything but charitable and kind and merciful when we see others this way? Our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ see you this way. Of this I testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Jerald B.

<h1>&#039;s Country and Kingdom-Your Passport - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am honored to speak to you today, but first I need to deal with that quizzical look on your faces about my last name. Yes, it really is Money, and yes, I really am a professor at the business school. It was even better when I worked at the bank. My colleagues would say, "Mr. Money's here now; we can open the vault."<br><br>A reporter from the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> called a few years ago to interview me for a story she was doing about professors whose fields fit their names, like a Dr. Payne she had found at a dental school. She asked, but I assured her I was not going to name a daughter Penny. The story was indeed published on the front page of the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> as one of those "fun" stories. So there you have it--how I managed to use up a few minutes of my fame in this life.<br><br>Now we can move on. Devotionals are a special part of being at BYU, and I commend you for taking advantage of the opportunity to learn and to grow, in spite of the fact that I am the one speaking today. Devotionals help you think about the difference between things that are really important and things that are not.<br><br>When I was asked to speak, I asked my kids, several of whom are BYU students, what I should talk about. We were at the dinner table, and my nephew was visiting. He said, "Hey, that's easy. If you want to play to the crowd, just talk about dating."<br><br>Well, I am not going to talk about dating, but I am going to talk about something very important to me, and I believe it is important to you--that is, how you, as a member of this global church, can stay within the borders and be a strong citizen of "the Lord's country and kingdom" (which phrase I will explain a little later), no matter where you come from or travel to--Moscow, Russia, or Moscow, Idaho, or any one of the seventeen small towns in the United States named Paris, or even the one in France. Just as with citizenship in temporal countries, you need a passport for the Lord's country and kingdom; I will talk about how to stamp that passport and keep it valid.<br><br>Before doing that, however, let me just say a word about getting out of Provo. If the world is our campus, then we need to get out there on that campus. I was introduced as director of the Global Management Center, overseeing the international activities of the Marriott School. I <i>love</i> BYU international experiences. A few weeks ago I attended a reunion of the London study abroad program on which I was a student; that program started thirty-three years ago this month. Amazingly, many of us still keep in touch. I have directed many study abroad programs of my own as a faculty member, and I love to see the growth in students as their horizons expand.<br><br>Former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice gave a forum speech on this campus a few years ago; a major theme of her remarks was this: while a student at BYU, you need to learn a language, leave Provo, and do some studying abroad to enrich your education and perspective greatly. To quote Mark Twain, "Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness."<sup>1</sup><br><br>May I reiterate: if the world is our campus, then let's get out "on campus." In the large atrium of the Tanner Building, where I work, there hang eighty-two flags representing the countries from which our business students hail. The flags are not just for decoration. Our business school's mission statement reinforces the imperative to train global leaders for a global economy and a global church.<br><br>I have encouraged you to get out of Provo--sort of my commercial message, if you will. One noncommercial thing you will learn out there on the campus of our world is an appreciation for the privilege of studying and living here in the United States and the price others have paid for your freedom to worship "according to the dictates of [your] own conscience"--"how, where, or what [you] may" (Articles of Faith 1:11).<br><br>During my first BYU London study abroad program as a student, my father came to visit. We took an excursion to France, where his uncle is buried in a World War I military cemetery. The young Lars Lester Larsen--big brother to my dad's mother--was sent to France as a private in September 1918 and was last seen alive filling his canteen in a small creek before enemy artillery fire set in. He was killed just weeks before the armistice.<br><br>The blue star on the banner in the Larsens' living room window, a national tradition that indicated a son was serving in the military, was changed to gold, the sign that the son had died in combat. His mother--my great-grandmother--was heartbroken and fell ill; her health never recovered. After the war the government organized a trip overseas for those "gold star mothers" of soldiers buried in Europe to visit the graves of their sons. My great-grandmother died the day the ship set sail from New York. So my father and I were the first two relatives ever to visit his uncle's gravesite, to dedicate it for a glorious resurrection.<br><br>When we arrived at the grave marker for Private Larsen, in the midst of thousands and thousands of crosses, with nobody else around, the first thing my father did was put on a suit coat and tie.<br><br>He said, "Son, we are here to dedicate a grave, a priesthood ordinance, and when you perform the duties of the priesthood, you do so appropriately attired."<br><br>After his dedicatory prayer he said, "Grandmother would be happy."<br><br>Not only did I learn to be appropriately dressed to perform the duties of the priesthood but I also learned of the terrible price that was paid for our citizenship in a free country--much like the sacrifices of our spiritual forebearers and Jesus Christ Himself to allow us to be members of "the Lord's country and kingdom."<br><br>The phrase comes from Doctrine and Covenants 88. This first verse is quoted often:<br><br><i>Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God.</i> [verse 78]<br><br>But here are the verses I am emphasizing today:<br><br><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; <b>things which are at home, things which are abroad</b>; the wars and the <b>perplexities of the nations,</b> and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of <b>countries and of kingdoms--</b></i><br><br><i>That ye may be prepared in all things.</i> [verses 79–80; emphasis added]<br><br>What I would like to talk to you about today is your citizenship in the Lord's country and kingdom; what puts you on His side of the borderline; how to make sure you always have a stamped, valid passport; and what keeps us strong within the Lord's province. If you lose your passport on an international trip, or if it is not valid, that trip stops--rather abruptly. Let's not let that happen on our eternal journey.<br><br>Let me illustrate the theme of borders with a true tale from one of my study abroad programs as a director. We were in Venice, Italy, having taken a very small ferryboat from our bus terminal to a dock across the Grand Canal. The appointed time to leave was approaching, and all but a handful of my BYU students were aboard. The Italian boat captain revved his engine, signaling departure. His English was poor and my Italian was worse, but somehow we communicated that he wanted the boat to leave and I wanted the boat to stay for the missing students. His next load of passengers was waiting on the other side. To emphasize my negotiating position, I placed one foot on the dock with the other foot on the boat--not too smart. To emphasize his rather superior negotiating position, the captain slowly began pulling away from the dock, with me about to fall into the water.<br><br>I will tell you what happened later, but, for now, that experience illustrates how impossible it is to have one foot on the Lord's side and one on the adversary's side--and the gap is getting wider and wider. What is at stake for you is more than a refreshing dip in the Grand Canal of Venice and a soggy wallet. What is at stake is your very soul. My message, therefore, is less about tourism and more about a spiritual journey, with way stations of experiences that happened to me out there on the campus of our world (many times with BYU students), where I learned very important eternal lessons.<br><br>So what of the Lord's country and kingdom, its borders, your citizenship, and your passport?<br><br>Sheri Dew gave a devotional speech some years ago entitled "Living on the Lord's Side of the Line." <a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/sheri-l-dew_living-lords-side-line/"><sup>2</sup></a> Therein she described her experience visiting the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ, that divides North and South Korea. She described the anxiety of leaving the protection of the United States and compared it to leaving the Lord's side of the line. Having stood with BYU students in that same DMZ, and having a father who had served as an army chaplain in the Korean War, her message was all the more personal to me.<br><br>So what is it that we need to do specifically, at home or abroad, to live within the borders of and be strong citizens of the Lord's country and kingdom with a valid passport? I will name four things, the first two being <i>private</i> religious behavior and <i>public</i> religious behavior; the third I will call "just being nice"; and fourth, remaining true in the face of trials. You know these things--there is nothing new here--but, as Elder Neal A. Maxwell liked to quote from C. S. Lewis, "People need to be reminded more often than they need to be instructed." <sup>3</sup><br><h2><b>The First Stamp: Private Religious Behavior</b></h2><br>The first stamp in your passport to the Lord's country and kingdom is private religious behavior, one component of which is prayer. By the time I was a returned missionary, I thought I had learned all about the need to pray as a kid in Sunday School. But let me tell you where I really learned about my duty to pray. I learned it from a Polish man in a youth hostel in Innsbruck, Switzerland, when I was traveling around Europe during my study abroad as a BYU student.<br><br>As you may know, youth hostels are cheap and gender-separate but communal lodging with large rooms full of bunk beds. There I was, about to retire for the evening in a room full of people I did not know and a little shy about praying in front of strangers. This older Polish man, with a jovial laugh, went around the room asking each of us where we were from. His English was limited, but he ascertained as he pointed: "American-neen?" Next. "American-neen?" Next. "American-neen?" "Ohhhhhhh! Everybody American-neen!"<br><br>After joking around some more about being outnumbered, he excused himself, knelt beside his bed, and offered up his evening prayers in Polish as the rest of us milled around a bit and a hush fell over the room. I will always remember being slightly embarrassed--me, a returned missionary who had taught others to pray--because I had not led the way. Though I was not necessarily wanting to perform my "alms before men" (Matthew 6:1; 3 Nephi 13:1), I committed then and there to never fail to pray, no matter what the circumstances.<br><br>Pray for your families and pray for those around you who struggle. Pray for the rulers of nations and their people, that the work may be hastened throughout the world, as the Prophet Joseph prayed at the dedication of the Kirtland Temple, the first dedicatory prayer of this dispensation. He prayed for "the kings, the princes, the nobles, and the great ones of the earth, . . . that their hearts may be softened . . . , that all the ends of the earth may know that . . . thou hast sent us" (D&amp;amp;C 109:55–57).<br><br>My father, from whom I acquired my love of travel, would always kneel with us in prayer before setting off on the day's adventures. I remember that so vividly--more than many of the adventures. In your life, pray hard, then work hard. Go and "do something more Than dream of your mansion above." <sup>4</sup><br><br>Another component of private religious behavior is scripture study. In the current study guide for Melchizedek priesthood quorums and Relief Society, Joseph Fielding Smith asked us:<br><br><i>Can we not arrange to find at least fifteen minutes in each day to devote to systematic reading and reflection? . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Very few among us read too much; most of us read too little.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>Don't be guilty, as most of us have been at times, of saying, "You know, what is in the headlines today is just more interesting and important than what somebody wrote hundreds or thousands of years ago." It is not. Scriptures are somebody's spiritual journals, and those somebodies are prophets of the living God.<br><br>Temple worship is another aspect of private religious behavior that can stamp your passport to the Lord's country and kingdom. As a family, one thing we like to do abroad is visit temples, from Hong Kong to Switzerland. Closer to home, every time a new temple holds an open house, we try to go with all of our children, younger and older. As we gather in the celestial room, we try to make the point that we only have one goal in life as their parents--to see all seven of our children and their spouses eventually back in a temple celestial room someday. Because if we get that head start, maybe, just maybe, our whole family will be back in the presence of our Heavenly Father in the celestial kingdom. And if your family is anything like ours, I guarantee that your parents feel exactly the same way. The temple is "the mountain of the Lord's house"--"and all nations shall flow unto it" (Isaiah 2:2; 2 Nephi 12:2). Temples are certainly within the boundaries of the Lord's country and kingdom, and your recommend is a passport stamp.<br><br>The last element of private religious behavior I will mention is to follow the prophets. We sustain fifteen of them on the earth today. About two years ago I stood in the church in Copenhagen, Denmark, in which stands the original <i>Christus</i> statue--renowned and beloved by our faith--by the Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen. Around the chapel also stand statues of Christ's Twelve Apostles.<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball visited that church in 1976, accompanied by several members of the Quorum of the Twelve. President Kimball said to a kind maintenance worker, pointing to the statues, "These are the dead Apostles." Then, pointing to his Brethren, he said, "Here we have the living Apostles." He said, "Elder Packer is an Apostle." And, pointing to the others, he said, "Elder Monson and Elder Perry are Apostles, and I am an Apostle. We are the living Apostles." The custodian, who up to that time had shown little emotion, was suddenly in tears. <sup>6</sup> Incidentally, exact replicas of these twelve statues will greet guests in the new Rome Temple Visitors' Center.<br><h2><b>The Second Stamp: Public Religious Behavior</b></h2><br>In addition to private religious behavior, the second passport stamp for the Lord's country and kingdom is public religious behavior. This includes service to others. Countless talks have been given on service--not to make you feel even more guilty that you are not out right now mowing somebody's lawn but to keep it at the top of your mind. As the poet John Milton said, "Our voluntary service [God] requires." <sup>7</sup> Think about that. How can service be both voluntary and required? Because God requires your heart as a freewill offering. If you have to force yourself to give, it doesn't count!<br><br>As a young boy, my son Tanner thought the Tanner Building was named for him; actually, both my son and the building are named for President N. Eldon Tanner, counselor in the First Presidency when I was a youth. I had the honor of meeting him once when I was in high school. Just that brief interaction had a profound impact on my life. Underneath the bust of President Tanner in the lobby of the Tanner Building reads this inscription: "Service is the rent we pay for living in this world of ours."<br><br>Two months ago, along with BYU students, I visited the Mother Teresa House of Charity in India and held a small orphan in my arms. Seeing India with its hundreds of millions of people living in crushing poverty somehow changed me. I am not sure what the answer is. The easy questions in world economics have already been answered; only the tough ones remain. But this I do know: I will never look at the line on the Church donation slip that says "humanitarian aid" quite the same. We who have been given so much, we too must give--let us all pay generous fast and other offerings. I have seen places in which our contributions will go far and wide.<br><br>Another aspect of public religious behavior is fulfilling Church callings, whatever or wherever they may be. Here is my favorite example.<br><br>President J. Reuben Clark Jr. had just been released after serving as first counselor to two presidents of the Church. He was then sustained as second counselor to President David O. McKay. Sensitive to the possibility that some might think he had been demoted, President Clark made this public statement:<br><br><i>In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, one takes the place to which one is duly called, which place one neither seeks nor declines. </i><sup>8</sup><br><br>Elder Dallin H. Oaks gave an international perspective in a general conference address about how national culture sometimes conflicts with gospel culture:<br><br><i>In the world, we refer to the up or down of promotions or reductions. But there is no up or down in Church positions. We just move around. </i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2003/10/repentance-and-change?lang=eng"><sup>9</sup></a><br><h2><b>The Third Stamp: Just Being Nice</b></h2><br>In addition to private and public religious behavior, my third passport stamp in the Lord's country and kingdom is just being nice. Jesus commanded us to love our neighbor, and He illustrated that commandment with the parable of the good Samaritan. As I tell my children, you don't have to go all the way to Samaria to be a good Samaritan.<br><br>I ask my children, "If we are commanded to love our neighbor, who is the neighbor closest to you?"<br><br>They usually respond, "Well, the So-and-So family across the street."<br><br>Then I say, "How about your sister in the bedroom next to yours?"<br><br>People in your family are your closest neighbors. Just be nice to them. On my father's retired military uniform, his chaplain's crest reads, "Go, and do thou likewise" (Luke 10:37), the closing line from the parable of the good Samaritan.<br><br>One aspect of just being nice is appreciating the dignity of every human soul--even those you don't know, but especially those you do, and even more especially the hard to love among you. On that same London study abroad program when I was a student, the group took an excursion to the Soviet Union. This was not the tourist-friendly, come-see-Anastasia's-parlor Russia of today. It was 1981. The Cold War was raging. The two superpowers were wrestling close to the brink of another world conflict--this one full of nuclear mushroom clouds. Both sides were armed and ready. I was surprised to see on the runway of the Moscow airport that even Soviet passenger jetliners had guns sticking out of the nosecones. Anyway, there was nothing a good Soviet bureaucrat would love more than to make life difficult for an American.<br><br>Well, the lucky man in our group was a student who also happened to be someone who was less than fully cooperative with our faculty director, even by his own admission--there was a bit of a personality conflict. As we were about to leave the airport, this same student was detained by Soviet officials over some passport issue--real or trumped up, I don't know, but I do know I had never seen just about anyone as scared as he was. He was not getting out of the Soviet Union, he was in trouble, and there was no negotiating.<br><br>Our director tried some quick diplomacy, but it wasn't working. One of the director's older children with us, a teenager who knew this was a difficult student and said what most of us were thinking but dared not say. In offhanded teen talk she said, "Oh, Dad, just leave him. He's not worth it."<br><br>In the tension of that moment, I will never forget the director's perfectly calm response: "Oh, yes he is. He is worth it. We are not leaving without him."<br><br>My director treated this student as the Savior treats us: we are all "worth it." The crisis was resolved, and we were on our way.<br><h2>The Fourth Stamp: Be True in the Midst of Your Trials</h2><br>In addition to public and private religious behavior and just being nice, my fourth and final passport stamp for the Lord's country and kingdom is to be true in the midst of your trials. Most of the serious trials I have learned from involve life-changing or life-ending events. People say death is just part of life. That is easy to say unless it is your parent, your spouse, your child, or your close friend who dies.<br><br>For example, when I was a first-year MBA student, the only other Mormon in my section of eighty students was a bright, enthusiastic close friend. One fall afternoon he was crossing the bridge from our student housing to campus and collapsed and died of a heart arrhythmia. He was twenty-six years old and left a young widow and two small daughters. Jim Rasband, now dean of BYU's law school, was a law student in our ward at that time and was the family's home teacher, rendering much-needed service. I had the assignment to speak at this man's funeral as a representative of the business school student body--the most difficult assignment of my life to that point.<br><br>I learned for the first time in my short twenty-something years that life is precious--and life is fragile. The question becomes not <i>why</i> our loved ones suffer and <i>why</i> they are called home when they are but <i>how:</i> How can we ease their suffering and how can we be as prepared--as hopefully they were--when our time comes?<br><br>I once witnessed a very elderly gentleman pass away in an ordinance room in the Los Angeles Temple. It seemed like a seamless transition from this life to the next. As a fellow temple patron said to me, "At least he didn't have far to go."<br><br>I have referenced my father in this talk. The last talk I gave was at the funeral of my father, three weeks ago yesterday. There is an old Church movie called <i>Man's Search for Happiness.</i> A line from that film states, "Life's greatest test comes with the death of a loved one." <sup>10</sup> That is when you are faced with what your faith really is. I have faith that I will see my father again someday.<br><br>But most trials are not as spectacular as life and death, literally. Most come in the daily struggle to just "keep pluggin'," as my grandmother--my father's mother from Spanish Fork--would often say.<br><br>So, to recap, these four things--(1) private religious behavior, (2) public religious behavior, (3) just being nice, and (4) enduring your trials well--will stamp your passport to the Lord's country and kingdom and keep it valid. But I can almost hear the refrain rising from the audience: "Oh, come <i>on,</i> Brother Money, these are the Sunday School answers." Or, "Hey, if we got all that when we were Sunbeams, that's great. If we didn't, aren't you about twenty years too late?"<br><br>True, my young friends, these are the Sunday School answers, but let me say something here and now. The longer I live and the more funerals at which I speak, the more I have come to realize that the Sunday School answers <i>are</i> the answers. Let me repeat that: The Sunday School answers <i>are</i> the answers. So listen up in Sunday School, passport in hand--stamped with the four things I have discussed today and the other things you learn wherever pure gospel doctrine is taught. You will "land [your] souls, yea, [your] immortal souls," quoting Helaman, "in the kingdom of heaven . . . , to go no more out" (Helaman 3:30). As much as I love travel, when I arrive there, I will not be interested in leaving that country. I will retire my passport.<br><br>Therefore, do not ever let your passport to the Lord's country and kingdom lapse. If you do, you will find yourself outside its borders, or at least trying to straddle them. Which means I need to finish my story about the Venice boat dock. The distance between my one foot on the dock and my other foot on the boat slowly became wider and wider. It was clear that the boat captain was not going to hold the boat for my students, and I was not going to leave without them. While my dear wife and students on the boat were screaming as my legs continued to spread and my blood pressure went up, I thought to myself that this was like something out of a Marx Brothers or Charlie Chaplin movie (or now it would be a great YouTube video), with everyone watching me plop into the drink. But no, breaking the stalemate came the sounds of my rescue thundering down the alleyway, and the remaining students scrambled over the dock and jumped a few ever-widening feet onto the boat. The boat captain and I are not exactly on each other's Christmas card lists, but I did get all the students on board and he made it back to pick up more passengers.<br><br>We cannot have one foot in God's kingdom and one in Babylon, a country whose standards are ever distancing themselves from the values we hold so precious at BYU and its sponsoring institution, the Lord's Church. As Elder Maxwell described it, we cannot have our primary residence in Zion and keep a summer cottage in Babylon. <a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2006/10/wherefore-settle-this-in-your-hearts?lang=eng"><sup>11</sup></a> Take a few moments before school starts again this fall and commit to do what it takes to be a strong citizen of the Lord's country and kingdom. With both feet squarely in it and your valid, stamped passport firmly in your grasp, engage in private as well as public religious behavior, just be nice, and stay true in the face of trials. If you do these things you will have no need to wonder if you are going to make it. You will. By "make it," I mean completing your BYU education; starting your careers of professional accomplishment; continuing lifelong service; raising, with your eternal mate, righteous families of your own; and leading them and God's kingdom into the generations to come.<br><br>Let me conclude with another of my favorite scriptures, Doctrine and Covenants 90:24:<br><br><i>Search diligently, pray always, and be believing, and all things shall work together for your good, if ye walk uprightly and remember the covenant wherewith ye have covenanted one with another.</i><br><br>It is all about that covenant--we can all make it. And <i>all</i> things shall work together for your good--not just <i>some</i> things, not <i>most</i> things, and not all things <i>just on Tuesdays and Thursdays. All</i> things shall work together for your good.<br><br>I testify that God is a loving Heavenly Father who is concerned about the daily details of your life. Jesus Christ lives and loves us dearly. He is the Savior of the world--the <i>whole</i> world, which world is the campus of this special university. I so testify in His name, Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>R.

<h1>nt Service - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The title of my talk is "Convenient Service." You may think this is an oxymoron, but during the course of this talk I hope to explain why it should not be.<br><br>Jesus Christ preached:<br><br><i>Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.</i> [Matthew 7:12; see also 3 Nephi 14:12 and Luke 6:31]<br><br>Jesus also said:<br><br><i>If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</i><br><br><i>For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.</i> [Matthew 16:24–25; see also Matthew 10:39]<br><br>President Thomas S. Monson said:<br><br><i>I believe the Savior is telling us that unless we lose ourselves in service to others, there is little purpose to our own lives. Those who live only for themselves eventually shrivel up and figuratively lose their lives, while those who lose themselves in service to others grow and flourish--and in effect save their lives.</i> ["<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2009/11/what-have-i-done-for-someone-today?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What Have I Done for Someone Today</a>?" <i>Ensign,</i> November 2009, 85]<br><br>Furthermore, we read in Revelation 2:19:<br><br><i>I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first. </i><br><br>Notice how "works" is in this scripture twice--actually, I believe it is in there four times, as charity and service could also be "works." Heavenly Father is saying here that He <i>knows</i> our works. So what works or service are we personally known for? Do we hesitate when confronted with the opportunity to serve? Is it convenient to serve? Or is service something we sign up for once in a while when the sign-up sheet is passed around?<br><br>With my profession as a nurse and my job here at BYU, I have the opportunity to work both locally and abroad with the sick in hospitals and various communities. Much of what I see is humbling and life changing. I would like to relate an experience of service I had a few years ago.<br><br>I was in a hospital in a developing country doing research for my doctoral project. In many hospitals or healthcare facilities in third-world countries, medicine is not available to the patients from the hospital itself. If the doctor feels the patient should receive a particular medicine, even if it is lifesaving, a prescription is written out to the family, and they need to take it to a pharmacy, pay for it, and then bring it back to the hospital for administration to the patient. Understandably, this is difficult for many patients, and they do not get medicines, as their family simply cannot afford them.<br><br>Partly due to these situations, it is not uncommon for there to be many beggars just outside the hospital grounds with their hands outstretched for money. But once you get in the gates of the complex, you usually aren't asked for money. As I was an obvious foreigner, I was asked for money many times a day. In fact, I had become quite calloused to this situation.<br><br>I had been in the hospital working a few days in the intensive care unit. As I was doing research, I was observing and taking notes on the care that the patients were receiving. Little did I realize that people were also watching and noticing me. I was walking across the hospital campus and a little lady came up to me. She introduced herself and said she had been watching me in the intensive care unit; her son was a patient there. She stated that her son was unconscious from a car crash. He was on a ventilator and not doing well. I could not remember which patient was her son. As she continued explaining the situation, she started pulling out a piece of paper.<br><br>I saw it and thought, "Oh, this is it. This is a prescription, and she is going to ask me for money."<br><br>I then thought about the twenty-dollar bill I had in my pocket. I don't carry a lot of money with me when I travel, and I had been waiting all week to eat in the hotel restaurant and order the roast beef, which is delicious and cheap compared to American standards. I told her I couldn't give her any money and walked away. She was just another beggar.<br><br>I walked away quickly, and after a few moments I turned around and looked at her. She was looking around with a look of "What do I do now?" My heart was pierced. I couldn't believe I was so eager to eat roast beef over giving this woman money that would possibly enable her son to live. I couldn't allow it! I quickly ran back down the steps and said, "Espera, Senora--wait! I have money to give you."<br><br>She accepted my twenty-dollar bill with tears in her eyes. And tears were in mine also.<br><br>The desire to help another was strong. I am glad I had this experience, because I have been able to reflect on it a lot. I call it my personal parable of the roast beef.<br><br>What of these people who are less fortunate than we are? How do we serve them? In my travels I have wondered why there is so much variation of wealth, health, or material blessings. What do others desire when they appear to have so little? Elder Neal A. Maxwell said something that has helped me understand:<br><br><i>God thus takes into merciful account not only our desires and our performance, but also the degrees of difficulty which our varied circumstances impose upon us.</i> ["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1996/10/according-to-the-desire-of-our-hearts?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to the Desire of [Our] Hearts</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1996, 21]<br><br>Of course everybody has similar desires, but it is the performance and the degree of difficulty it takes for us to perform that God considers. God takes into account the degrees of difficulty. So what does that say when it truly is quite easy to give a little service because of our blessings and fortune? Well, "unto whom much is given much is required" (D&amp;amp;C 82:3; see also Luke 12:48).<br><br>We have a low degree of difficulty, and we should really be getting off the couch, so to speak, and providing meaningful service. We are blessed for a reason. If it is only a little difficult to render service, should we not do it more often? If it is only a little inconvenient, why can't we do it more frequently?<br><br>What about those who have a higher degree of difficulty in providing service? Think of those who are struggling in the world. I am sure many missionaries can relate to the experiences I had while I was on my mission years ago. Families who had little to eat would prepare food for the missionaries. Surely these families have a different degree of difficulty when it comes to giving and rendering service.<br><br>I clearly remember an episode of service on my mission over thirty years ago. This was one of those occasions in which we thought we were the ones giving service, but, as it turns out, we were the ones being served. My companion and I had traveled out to a little settlement in Itakyry, Paraguay. This area basically consisted of a large member family and a few neighbors who were investigating. We were going out to visit the family and attend church and a baptism the next day.<br><br>Since it took so long to travel out there, down dirt roads and over streams, we had to stay the night with the family. Even though it was in a jungle, it was cold. The parents gave me and my companion their one bed and their one blanket. The large family then slept on the dirt floor in the next room, with the little ones tucked between them.<br><br>I froze that night. I kept on all my clothes, my sweater, and even my rubber boots. I felt so guilty and was so cold that I could not sleep. The next day, as we sat on logs under the open sky for fast and testimony meeting, the family could not express enough thanks to me and my companion for coming all the way out to visit them on this special occasion. My heart was pierced. It was then that I realized that this family had been providing me service--in the way that they could--by providing their own bed and blanket on a chilly night in Paraguay.<br><br>Even though there are material inequalities in the world, we all can have the righteous desire to serve. <i>And it is the pursuit of these righteous desires that measures our reward in heaven. </i><br><br>We do not have to travel abroad to have fascinating and memorable experiences of service. We can and should start right here in our homes and neighborhoods. Jesus did not travel very far; often He served those very near to Him. We have opportunities to serve by simply being sons and daughters, fathers and mothers, and brothers and sisters. We serve through our church callings and by being members of our wards. I often think that Heavenly Father will ask me, "What did you do to serve the women you visit taught? How did you change their lives or help them in times of need? How did you serve your brothers? Did you even notice when they needed help?"<br><br>These can be sobering thoughts.<br><br>So, how can we make service convenient? We start by practicing with "automatic responses."<br><br>Let me relate another little experience. This one was only a few months after my experience in the hospital with the roast beef money. It was Christmastime, and I was in the checkout line at Walmart, thinking of all I had to do. I was watching the young couple in front of me buy a little girl's bike. The cost was around sixty-five dollars. I watched the man hand over dollar bills and then frustratingly search in his pockets for change. Then the couple searched in the woman's purse for money. I averted my eyes to avoid additional embarrassment for them. Even at that moment I felt uncomfortable and awkward. I guess they finally came up with the right amount of money. I was too busy trying not to notice.<br><br>After I had made my purchases, I followed them out of the store--realizing I had again missed the opportunity to help. It was most likely only a few dollars they had needed. Where had my desire gone? Why couldn't I have just conveniently handed them a few dollars? Again, I couldn't believe it! Why hadn't I performed an automatic response by offering a dollar or two?<br><br>Giving service and having it become "convenient" is a work in progress. While I was in the temple the other night I thought about how tightly related service is with sacrifice and consecration. Service is a stepping-stone toward these two great doctrines of our religion. It is up to us how big this stepping-stone of service is. Are the stepping-stones of service huge, insurmountable boulders that we believe are set in our way? Or are they merely soft, round pebbles upon which we tread? If we treat service like helpful small pebbles that line our pathway back to the Savior, we may find that these pebbles become convenient guides that will help us along the way. If we can master the task of providing service to those around us, how much easier, then, is it to sacrifice for others and consecrate what we do for the Lord.<br><br>Elder Bruce R. McConkie gave a talk in April 1975 about obedience, consecration, and sacrifice. He said:<br><br><i>We have covenanted in the waters of baptism to love and serve him, to keep his commandments, and to put first in our lives the things of his kingdom. In return he has promised us eternal life in his Father's kingdom. We are thus in a position to receive and obey some of the higher laws which prepare us for that eternal life which we so sincerely seek. </i><br><br>Elder McConkie then went on to say:<br><br><i>It is written: "He who is not able to abide the law of a celestial kingdom cannot abide a celestial glory." (D&amp;amp;C 88:22.) The law of sacrifice is a celestial law; so also is the law of consecration. Thus to gain that celestial reward which we so devoutly desire, we must be <b>able</b> to live these two laws.</i><br><br>Sacrifice and consecration are inseparably intertwined. ["Obedience, Consecration, and Sacrifice," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1975, 50; emphasis in original]<br><br>I would like to add: How can we ever get to the laws of sacrifice and consecration without first applying service in our lives? When we are physically serving our brother, we are sacrificing--whether it be our time, our physical abilities, or our material blessings. When we perform service with the right kind of spirit, we practice consecration. We are consecrating our time, our physical abilities, and our material blessings to others--and in essence to the Lord. Service in our lives is similar to stepping-stones; the way we perceive or encounter service determines the size of those stones. Are they helps or hindrances to our eternal progression?<br><br>Just like we consciously work on other fine attributes in our lives, we need to put in place a conscious decision to make service convenient. We need to plan on this behavior.<br><br>President Thomas S. Monson taught Brigham Young University students that their student days should include "the matter of spiritual preparation," including service to others:<br><br><i>An attitude of love characterized the mission of the Master. He gave sight to the blind, legs to the lame, and life to the dead. Perhaps when we</i> [face] <i>our Maker, we will not be asked, "How many positions did you hold?" but rather, "How many people did you help?" In reality, you can never love the Lord until you serve Him by serving His people.</i> ["<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/thomas-s-monson_great-expectations-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Great Expectations</a>," BYU devotional address, 11 January 2009]<br><br>I would like to look at some examples of Jesus Christ when He served. What were His interactions like? Was service convenient for Him? Let's take a look at some interactions:<br><br><i>And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</i><br><br>And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. [Matthew 8:2–3]<br><br><i>And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a fever.</i><br><br>And he touched her hand. [Matthew 8:14]<br><br><i>Behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.</i><br><br>And Jesus arose, and followed him. [Matthew 9:18]<br><br><i>And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment: . . .</i><br><br><i>But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort.</i> [Matthew 9:20]<br><br><i>And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.</i><br><br><i>But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them.</i> [Matthew 9:35–36]<br><br>What was Jesus doing? He said, "I will," He "touched," He "arose," He "turned him about," and He "was moved with compassion." These are characteristics of kindness and love. He was not inconvenienced. It was His way of life. When we act and serve as Jesus did, we become more like Him.<br><br>How can we make service our way of life? How can we have it be an immediate reaction instead of a thought-out action? How can we make it convenient?<br><br>We can <i>prepare</i> for service. We may start out with creating a habit of always being willing to or being ready to <i>do</i> something extra. Maybe you enjoy mowing the lawn, so if a neighbor needs help, that can be your automatic reaction--you can mow their lawn. Or maybe you have a special chicken enchilada recipe that turns out great every time--that can be your automatic reaction if there is a need for a meal in your ward. Maybe you have a keen listening ear and enjoy conversation--that can be your automatic reaction when a family member is in need. The key is to create automatic reactions within ourselves. They do not have to be big service activities.<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball said:<br><br><i>It is vital that we serve each other in the kingdom. . . . So often, our acts of service consist of simple encouragement or of giving . . . help with mundane tasks, but what glorious consequences can flow . . . from small but deliberate deeds!</i> ["<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1974/12/small-acts-of-service?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Small Acts of Service</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> December 1974, 5; quoted in <i>Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Spencer W. Kimball</i> (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2006), 82]<br><br>Elder Vaughn J. Featherstone gave a talk about serving when it is inconvenient. He said:<br><br><i>Now my young friends, . . . think of all the opportunities you will have to serve at inconvenient times. I promise you that most of the service you render to the Lord will come at times not convenient to you. Think about some of them:</i><br><br><i>Your call to serve an 18-month mission, right in the middle of your schooling, courting, and vocational training.</i><br><br><i>A call to serve in the ward when you have grades to maintain and a social life to fulfill.</i><br><br><i>An invitation to speak at church.</i><br><br><i>Home teaching visits.</i><br><br><i>Early-morning seminary, which in many stakes begins at 6:00 a.m., not a convenient hour.</i><br><br><i>A hospital visit to a sick friend.</i><br><br><i>Assisting a friend in his or her school election campaign.</i><br><br><i>Someone with a flat tire or other auto problems on the highway. It generally is not a convenient time to stop.</i><br><br><i>Shoveling snow or mowing a lawn of someone in need--a widow or neighbor--when your day is already too full.</i><br><br>Elder Featherstone went on to say:<br><br><i>I could list many, many more opportunities that may well come to all of us in a lifetime but most often at an inappropriate time. You can make a decision that you are too busy, but that is generally only an excuse. . . .</i><br><br><i>My beloved young friends, determine to serve one another. Listen to the spirit when your flesh is weak. For truly the Master said, "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me" (Matt. 25:40). The blessings are tenfold when we do those good, kindly acts of Christlike service when it is inopportune or not convenient.</i> ["The Message: Why Now? Why Me?" <i>New Era,</i> January–February 1984, 7]<br><br>I appreciate Sister Burton's advice to "first observe, then serve" (see "<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2012/10/first-observe-then-serve?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First Observe, Then Serve</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2012, 78–80). How closely do we observe? What do we notice as we go about our daily, hurried lives? What can you do as a BYU student? Take a look around you. Do as Sister Burton said: "First observe, then serve." I have seen students sit by themselves an entire semester. I have seen students not talk to anybody during class breaks. We need to serve those around us first, whether they are family, roommates, or neighbors.<br><br>I have experienced memorable acts of service. I have been the giver and the receiver. Yet even with many years of experience, I still struggle with how "convenient" the service is. I have felt my heart pierced with love, compassion, thankfulness, and the Spirit. Shouldn't these feelings be enough motivation? My memories of two opposite experiences lately are vivid. My parable of the roast beef keeps me remembering how it feels to serve. My experience in Walmart at Christmastime is a sobering, memorable occurrence of <i>not</i> serving, or <i>not</i> observing; in fact, I averted my eyes to the need for a dollar or two.<br><br>Yes, service becoming convenient is a work in progress. Giving service throughout our lives is like being led down a beautiful path of stepping-stones. However, to make service convenient, we must practice and practice.<br><br>I think about and study the life of our Savior. How He acted and how He served is an example to me. Again, what was Jesus doing? He said, "I will," He "touched," He "arose," He "turned him about," and He "was moved with compassion." These are characteristics of kindness and love. He was not inconvenienced. It was His way of life. May we pray to make this our way of life also, I say in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Sheri Patten Palmer was an associate teaching professor in the BYU College of Nursing when this devotional address was given on 29 July 2014.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>So Loved You - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
How many of you recall seeing the great arch of the Milky Way span the sky over your head, along with millions of other stars that cover the dome of the heavens?<br><br>Because I live in a city, one of the things that I forget is the glory of that night sky stretching from one horizon to the other. Prior to the industrialization of society, a view of the night sky filled with stars would have been common. It is breathtaking to realize that the stars seen from Earth are only a few of the stars in our Milky Way Galaxy, which is estimated to contain on the order of 300 billion stars.<br><br>Sometime back our friends who have a cabin in the San Juan Mountains of southern Colorado invited us to a star party in which a group gathered with telescopes far from city lights to view interesting features such as planets in our own solar system and nebulae in our galaxy, as well as the Andromeda Galaxy, our nearest galactic neighbor. The telescopes ranged in size from small refracting telescopes on tripods to large reflecting telescopes that required a ladder to get to the eyepiece. As powerful as these amateur telescopes were, astronomy research requires much more powerful instruments.<br><br>One of those powerful instruments is the Hubble Space Telescope, built in 1990. It orbits about 350 miles above the earth, far above the interference of the atmosphere. Hubble's mirror is 2.4 meters in diameter, and the entire telescope weighs more than ten tons. Since its launch it has made more than one million observations, resulting in more than 100 terabytes of data. Astronomers from all over the world use the Hubble in their research. Many of you have likely seen images from the Hubble.<br><br>Even amateur telescopes can capture a detailed view of Saturn, but the Hubble Telescope is able to catch colorful views of Saturn in wavelengths not visible to the human eye. Saturn is, in my view, the most beautiful planet in our solar system, and it lies only about 1.1 light-hours from Earth at its nearest approach.<br><br>Although viewing the planets of our own solar system has yielded spectacular results, the Hubble isn't limited to close-range objects.<br><br>Looking beyond our solar system, the Hubble Telescope has captured images of the Ring Nebula, located about 2,000 light-years from Earth, that shows the varying colors of each ring of debris from the supernova that created the nebula thousands of years ago. C. Robert O'Dell noted that<br><br><i>the nebula is not like a bagel, but rather, it's like a jelly doughnut, because it's filled with material in the middle. . . . With Hubble's detail, we see a completely different shape than what's been thought about historically for this classic nebula. The new Hubble observations show the nebula in much clearer detail, and we see things are not as simple as we previously thought.</i> [Quoted in "Hubble Reveals the Ring Nebula's True Shape," NASA, 23 May 2013, nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/ring-nebula.html#.]<br><br>The Hubble Telescope has also captured images of the Pinwheel Galaxy, which is twenty-one million light-years from us. It is estimated that this galaxy contains hundreds of billions of stars. It is larger than our own galaxy, which has 300 billion stars, but it is shaped similarly to our own galaxy. What must it be like to be able to perceive the slow spin of this galaxy and the interactions of all of its stars?<br><br>Pointed at what appeared to be a minuscule, vacant region of the sky and taking multiple exposures adding up to 560 hours, the Hubble Telescope has captured 5,500 galaxies at a distance of as much as 13.2 billion light-years. The faintest galaxies in the image are one ten-billionth the brightness of what the human eye can see. If we assume that this is the same type of image we would see if we were able to view the universe from any direction, the number of galaxies that there are and the number of stars in those galaxies is overwhelming.<br><br>I feel very, very small.<br><h2><b>Moses's Vision of the Works of God</b></h2><br>Moses, whose record of his vision of God's creations is in the Pearl of Great Price, felt the same way. He said, "Now, for this cause I know that man is nothing, which thing I never had supposed" (Moses 1:10). How is it that a planet as small as ours, orbiting a single star out of billions among galaxies that seem endless, can attract the attention of the Creator? Continuing in Moses's vision, Father in Heaven revealed:<br><br><i>And worlds without number have I created; and I also created them for mine own purpose; and by the Son I created them, which is mine Only Begotten. . . .</i><br><br><i>And as one earth shall pass away, and the heavens thereof even so shall another come; and there is no end to my works, neither to my words.</i> [Moses 1:33, 38]<br><br>Father in Heaven then revealed why He attends to our small planet and its population: "For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). Or, if I might be permitted to paraphrase, "For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass your immortality and eternal life."<br><br>Our Father in Heaven's work is individual salvation and individual happiness for eternity. We aren't specks in the universal expanse of God's creations but individuals loved and cherished by God. Whereas we use huge telescopes to see the expanse of God's creations, it is as though our Father in Heaven uses a huge microscope so that He can see each of us individually and be with us.<br><br>President Dieter F. Uchtdorf made similar observations in the October 2011 general conference:<br><br><i>But even though man is nothing, it fills me with wonder and awe to think that "the worth of souls is great in the sight of God."</i><br><br><i>And while we may look at the vast expanse of the universe and say, "What is man in comparison to the glory of creation?" God Himself said we are the reason He created the universe! His work and glory--the purpose for this magnificent universe--is to save and exalt mankind. In other words, the vast expanse of eternity, the glories and mysteries of infinite space and time are all built for the benefit of ordinary mortals like you and me. Our Heavenly Father created the universe that we might reach our potential as His sons and daughters.</i><br><br><i>This is a paradox of man: compared to God, man is nothing; yet we are everything to God. While against the backdrop of infinite creation we may appear to be nothing, we have a spark of eternal fire burning within our breast. We have the incomprehensible promise of exaltation--worlds without end--within our grasp. And it is God's great desire to help us reach it.</i> ["You Matter to Him," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2011]<br><h2><b>Individual Love</b></h2><br>If there is anything I can do from this podium today, it is to share with you the love that God and His Son have for us and the personal attention They give each of us. At the risk of starting with the trivial, I'd like to share an example from my own life that shows how our Father in Heaven cares for even the smallest problems in our lives.<br><br>As was said in the introduction, I have a PhD in computer science. What was not mentioned is that my PhD was awarded this year in April's graduation. Nine years ago, as I was attending the general priesthood session of general conference, I was struck with a strong prompting to get a PhD in computer science. My initial reaction was mixed: I love learning, but the work that a PhD requires is enormous. Soon after I started my PhD I was called as a bishop in a BYU singles ward, which on the surface seemed to make the task even more difficult.<br><br>An experience that showed Heavenly Father's individual love for me during my PhD program was that I found I got more accomplished when I was a father and a bishop, working a full-time job, moving toward tenure as a member of the library faculty, and beginning a PhD program. After my release as a bishop, I commented to my wife that I wished they would call me as a bishop again so that I could move through my PhD program more quickly; it seemed I had more difficulties making progress.<br><br>Another example deals with personal revelation. During my doctoral course work there was a significant concept that I could not wrap my mind around. Needless to say, this was frustrating, and it made me question my participation in the PhD program altogether. One night after my family had gone to bed, and after having spent the better part of the day trying to internalize the concept, I turned in frustration to my Father in Heaven. My prayer to Him was simply that I had tried to understand but had failed. If He didn't directly help me, I would not succeed. I turned the problem over to Him. Within ten minutes of offering that prayer, my understanding was opened and I was able to proceed.<br><br>I marveled at this. Why should the Creator of heaven and earth care about what is essentially a trivial problem compared to the troubles of the world and the scope of all of His creations? Aren't there more desperate prayers to be answered?<br><br>I was taught by this--and have remembered since--that my Heavenly Father cares about what I care about in righteousness. Even though my problem was minuscule, He intervened and moved me forward because it was important to me.<br><h2><b>My Brother in Vietnam</b></h2><br>Another experience I would like to share concerns my brother when he served in the United States Army in Vietnam forty-five years ago.<br><br>Regarding current relations among Vietnam, the United States, and the Church, I read recently that the Vietnamese government recognized three Vietnamese members of the Church as the Interim Representative Committee of the Church in Vietnam. There are currently more than 1,600 members of the Church in Vietnam, according to the Church's press release.<br><br>It is wonderful that peace and cooperation have replaced hostility between our two countries, leading to this first step in the recognition of the Church in their good country. Clearly the Spirit of the Lord has brought peace.<br><br>However, returning to the events of forty-five years ago, in which hostilities were fierce, my brother enlisted in the army, preferring to be a medical evacuation pilot rather than an attack helicopter pilot. Although the casualty rate for medical evacuation personnel was quite high, he chose this way to serve his country. Of the thirteen pilots who graduated with him in medical evacuation pilot training, only six returned, and of those six, only three were unharmed.<br><br>Although everyone who served in that theater of conflict was in harm's way, my brother recounts one particular day when the hand of Heavenly Father, through our grandmother, preserved his life. Some years prior to these events our maternal grandmother, whom my brother had been very close to, passed away.<br><br>On this particular day my brother and his medical evacuation team were called to the front lines to evacuate wounded soldiers during a battle. As was their practice, they circled a short distance from the battlefield until it was possible to land under the cover of fire from attack helicopters. Landing, receiving the wounded, and taking off again placed them in great danger since they had to hover in a single place as they landed, making them an easy target. On this particular day they had already made one run to the battle location. The commanding officer then asked my brother and his team to return to the same battle site to recover additional severely wounded soldiers. The fighting was intense, and my brother recalls the fear that was in everyone's hearts. They successfully retrieved the wounded despite the heavy fighting.<br><br>My brother said that after he landed back at the military base, he could barely walk, and he sat at the edge of the helicopter's cockpit door shaking. He said that he had never felt our grandmother's presence so strongly, providing him with protection, as he did at that time. Later he was told that on his way out of the combat zone he had unknowingly flown over a camouflaged antiaircraft installation. Why they did not fire on him he does not know.<br><br>When I was talking to my brother about this experience, he said to me that he knows that Heavenly Father knows his name, who he is, and what he needs. He knows this as surely as the sun rises each morning.<br><h2><b>Mom and My Brother</b></h2><br>My parents were justifiably concerned for my brother's safety. My mother once told me of a night when she was crying out of concern for my brother's safety. Without warning, the room filled with light, as though there had been a lightning bolt outside, and she felt the presence of her mother. She heard her mother's voice say, "Anne, Richard will be okay. You don't need to worry."<br><br>This promise was fulfilled not only in the event I have just related but also in my brother's entire tour of service in the military. I have wondered if my brother's experience in Vietnam and my mother's prayer occurred near the same time, but I have no way of knowing that.<br><br>From these two experiences I have learned that our loved ones who have passed on can, under the guidance of our Father in Heaven, be actively involved in our lives on earth.<br><h2><b>"In Quiet Desperation"</b></h2><br>The last example I would like to share with you is from the book <i>In Quiet Desperation: Understanding the Challenge of Same-Gender Attraction</i> by Fred Matis, Marilyn Matis, and Ty Mansfield (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2004). Ty Mansfield is associated with North Star International (NorthStarLDS.org). North Star, not formally associated with nor supported by the Church, provides help and support to individuals struggling with same-gender attraction within the context of the teachings of the Church and the gospel.<br><br>I became aware of this organization when, as a bishop helping ward members with same-gender attraction, I needed to open my mind to and my understanding of this very difficult circumstance and the pain that ward members were experiencing. <i>In Quiet Desperation</i> shares experiences of individuals struggling with same-gender attraction.<br><br>One of the accounts relates:<br><br><i>I have to believe that our Father in Heaven, as a literal Parent, loves me personally, is interested in my life and progress, and is willing to bestow upon me whatever blessing I truly need and am open to receive. President Brigham Young said poignantly, "If you do not believe</i> [that God is your Heavenly Father], <i>cease to call him Father; and when you pray, pray to some other character."</i> [Matis, Matis, and Mansfield, 87–88; quoting <i>JD</i> 4:216]<br><br>Indeed, if we don't believe that Heavenly Father is our Father, then why do we address Him as such?<br><br>The book also contains an analogy of the story of the Israelites fleeing Egypt only to encounter the impassable Red Sea. At this point many of the Israelites wanted to return to Egypt and to slavery rather than have faith in their God and His prophet:<br><br><i>When my back was against the sea and my feet were pointing toward Egypt, I have felt the delivering power of my Redeemer--I have seen "the salvation of the Lord" through sacred personal experiences. During the period of my greatest struggle, all I knew to do was continue doing that which I knew how to do: to study His word and pray for understanding. As I have left my heart open--even in my times of doubt and fear--to potentially feeling the comfort and instruction of the Spirit, He has helped me, through personal spiritual experiences, to internalize for the first time in my life certain principles I had always believed or already "known." As I felt the power and grace of Christ actively working in me, I felt the glimmer of hope and the fire of faith begin again to grow brighter in my heart. My barriers of doubt and faithlessness were being parted, and I was given the strength and desire to continue forward once again.</i> [In Matis, Matis, and Mansfield, <i>In Quiet Desperation,</i> 81]<br><br>I don't know why we suffer with challenges such as same-gender attraction, alcoholism, and addictions, other than that we live in a fallen world that is subject to the temptations of Satan and the corruptibility of mortality, and that brings forth thorns and thistles to afflict us. However, I know that we are also subject to the love of our Heavenly Father as we struggle with our individual problems. Sacred personal experiences break through the darkness of this telestial world and show us the way.<br><h2><b>Remember What You Know</b></h2><br>I have recounted instances in which our Father in Heaven has directly intervened in individuals' lives, from tender mercies to life-altering experiences. One of the dangers in this life is forgetting what you already know and have experienced. Remember what Father in Heaven has already done for you. Refresh your memories and seek new spiritual experiences; it is all too easy to forget and to deceive yourself. These tender mercies and life‑altering experiences are there to give you hope, faith, and understanding. Remember that your Father in Heaven has already shown His love for you, and just because an answer may be no or, more frustrating, there is no response, that does not mean that He does not love you.<br><h2><b>Forgetting Former Help</b></h2><br>The scriptures are full of examples of people who forgot how their Father in Heaven had helped them. In the journey to the promised land, Laman and Lemuel turned on their brother Nephi, only to be stopped by an angel. Within a few verses they were complaining again, as though the angel had never been there at all. The whole Book of Mormon seems to be one cycle of people being helped by God, forgetting that they had been helped, remembering and repenting, and then being helped again. One thing to be learned from the Book of Mormon is to not repeat this cycle in your own lives.<br><br>Returning to the analogy of the children of Israel at the shores of the Red Sea, the account from <i>In Quiet Desperation</i> reads:<br><br><i>I understood in a personal way the feelings I believe the children of Israel must have felt as they faced the wall of water that caused them to fear and doubt their course as they watched the pursuing Egyptians. As I sometimes have, they forgot the earlier miracles and their earlier illumination. "When Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid" (Exodus 14:10). Elder Jeffrey R. Holland commented on those verses: "Some . . . said words to this effect: 'Let's go back. This isn't worth it. We must have been wrong. That probably wasn't the right spirit telling us to leave Egypt.'"</i> [Matis, Matis, and Mansfield, 80; quoting Holland, "Cast Not Away Therefore Your Confidence," <i>Ensign,</i> March 2000]<br><br>The children of Israel forgot what they had already experienced and known, and they preferred the slavery in Egypt to the freedom of following the Lord. Remembering all of the interactions our Heavenly Father has had with us should illuminate our current decisions and paths.<br><br>In the New Testament the apostle Peter wrote of attributes of righteousness, such as faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness, and charity. He then continued:<br><br><i>For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</i><br><br><i>But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.</i> [2 Peter 1:8–9]<br><br>Peter admonished us that when we live by righteous principles, we are fruitful in the knowledge of our Savior. But unrighteousness makes us blind and makes us forget how our Savior has blessed us. Forgetting is like saying that these experiences never occurred and that we don't value them. Forgetting may lead us to make decisions as though our Father in Heaven has never influenced our lives at all.<br><h2><b><i>Lost and Found</i></b></h2><br>A painting by Greg Olsen titled <i>Lost and Found</i> is one of my favorites (see gregolsen.com/artwork/christian-art/lost-and-found). In this painting the Savior is giving a young man His complete attention. His body is leaning forward and He is listening intently.<br><br>Who is the young man? With his backpack, he seems to be on a journey; but he is alone, except the Savior has found him. What is the young man looking for? There is a path leading from the forest. Is this the path that led him to the bench where the Savior was waiting for him?<br><br>This painting is particularly important to some friends of ours. One of their children had left the family, and they did not know where this child had gone. There was nothing they could do to help since there was no contact and they had no notion of where to find their child. This picture was important to them because they could do nothing to help. All they could hope for was that the Savior, or someone feeling the Savior's influence, was there to help their child.<br><br>This image says more to me. It also says that it may be one of us who is sent to help through Christ's help and inspiration. On more than one occasion as a bishop I recall being stopped in my tracks and told to visit a member of my ward. On many of those occasions the visit was well timed to provide help to a ward member. This built my testimony of the Lord's love for my ward members, as the Lord sent me when and where I was needed.<br><br>Last week, in my ward's sacrament meeting, one of the youth speakers, Nicole Tirrell, noted that the phone number we call for help is 911 but that we should think of the number 991 to give help--recalling the Savior's parable of the shepherd leaving the ninety-nine to find the one (see Matthew 18:12–13 and Luke 15:4–6).<br><br>Brothers and sisters, I have shared with you examples of our Heavenly Father reaching out. We should seek out and identify those experiences in our lives that demonstrate God's love for us and His attention to our needs and our lives. We should remember them and let them encourage and strengthen us.<br><br>Remember:<br><br>• Seek your Father in Heaven's help.<br>• Remember everything that your Father in Heaven has done for you personally.<br>• Use those memories to sustain you throughout your trials.<br>• Be the one who is listening and helping.<br><br>To paraphrase John 3:16, always remember that God so loved you that He gave His Only Begotten Son and that if you should believe on Him you should not perish but have eternal life. I leave these things with you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>William B.

<h1> Learning and Continuous Service - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As I look over this sea of blue, I see thousands who have taken the challenge that is sculpted near the entrance to BYU: "Enter to Learn; Go Forth to Serve." Congratulations. You are now a graduate of one of the greatest universities in the world.<br><br>One of my privileges as alumni president is to officially welcome you into the BYU Alumni Association. I hereby confer upon each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. We welcome you to this great association of more than 400,000 alumni.<br><br>As you go forth to serve, I invite you to stay connected to BYU through the BYU Alumni Association. We have more than eighty-five alumni groups, called chapters, located across the country in which you can associate with fellow friends and alums of BYU. Through these chapters you can not only watch a game or see a university touring group together but also mentor students and contribute to replenishment grants that help students who live in your region to graduate.<br><br>In fact, just as King Benjamin counseled, I hope you will make service a yardstick to measure every aspect of your postgraduate life (see Mosiah 2).<br><br>One of my favorite stories that illustrates the depth of true service is in a book called <i>The Giving Tree,</i> by Shel Silverstein (New York: Harper and Row, 1964).<br><br>The story describes the relationship that develops over time between a boy and an apple tree. When he was a child, the boy would climb, swing, eat apples, and gather leaves, which made both the boy and the tree very happy.<br><br>As the boy grew and his needs changed, the tree offered its service in different ways: its apples for selling, its branches for building a home, and even its trunk for carving a canoe so the boy could sail away.<br><br>The last time the boy--as an elderly man--visited the tree, all that remained was a stump. As the tree apologized for having nothing left to offer, the man said that all he needed was a place to sit. The tree then straightened itself up to allow the elderly man a chance to rest--and at that moment both were happy.<br><br>The great outcomes of a BYU education are founded in lifelong learning and continuous service. As you give heed to the charge in Silverstein's simple story, you will be amazed at how much good you can accomplish.<br><br>As you scatter to all corners of the world this week, I hope you will remember your alma mater. Continue your love and support. Stay connected with us and let us know about your successes so we can celebrate with you. We want to stay connected with you throughout your lives--connected for good.<br><br>We know that you will have many priorities competing for your time. Your family, your community, the Church, and your employer will all need you. Remember, those who follow you here at BYU also need you.<br><br>As President Worthen has said:<br><br><i>There is a divine destiny at this school, . . . and it [plays] out largely in the lives of our graduates and the influence that they have. . . . To be part of an organization that has that kind of impact--an eternal impact on people's lives--it's a tremendous experience.</i> [Quoted in Peter B. Gardner, "Meet the Worthens," <i>BYU Magazine,</i> summer 2014, 47]<br><br>He is talking about you, my friends. You have a real opportunity "to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life" (<i>The Mission of Brigham Young University</i> and <i>The Aims of a BYU Education</i> [Provo: BYU, 2014], 1).<br><br>Go forth and prosper, both spiritually and professionally. We applaud you and will always hold you close to our hearts.<br><br>I bear testimony that this is the Lord's Church, that the Lord leads and guides us today, and that this institution was divinely established and is divinely led. And I bear you that testimony in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Terry R. Seamons was president of the BYU Alumni Association when this commencement address was given on 14 August 2014.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>s of Jesus Christ-Defenders of Marriage - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, President Worthen, for your gracious introduction. Wendy and I are grateful for the privilege of being here on this significant occasion. I bring love and greetings from President Thomas S. Monson, President Henry B. Eyring, President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, my beloved Brethren of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and members of the board of trustees.<br><br>We are grateful for President Kevin J Worthen and President Cecil O. Samuelson, who have presided over the studies of this graduating class. We thank the faculty and staff for their service and tireless striving for excellence. And today we congratulate every graduate, along with their families and friends who have provided encouragement along the way. We are very proud of each of you!<br><br>Some of you will continue your education and achieve graduate degrees. Some of you will enter the workforce on a full-time basis. Many of you have married or will marry and begin your families. Family life will provide your most enduring rewards. As partners, you and your spouse will work together to achieve mutual goals and enjoy the fruits of your labors. By the way, brethren, you might bear this in mind: Behind every successful man is a surprised mother-in-law. I know mine was!<br><br>There is great power in a strong partnership. True partners can achieve more than the sum of each acting alone. With true partners, one plus one is much more than two. For example, Dr. Will Mayo and his brother, Dr. Charles Mayo, formed the Mayo Clinic. Lawyers and others form important partnerships. And in marriage, a husband and wife can form the most significant partnership of all--an eternal family.<br><br>Sustainable improvements in any endeavor depend on collaboration and agreement. Great leaders and partners develop the skill of sharing insights and efforts and the pattern of building consensus. Great partners are completely loyal. They suppress personal ego in exchange for being part of creating something larger than themselves. Great partnerships are dependent upon each individual developing his or her own personal attributes of character.<br><br>Each of us was born as an individual and is educated as an individual. You have passed tests to meet standards imposed upon you by someone else. You have been jumping over educational high hurdles, all erected by other people. For years you have been primarily task-oriented, preparing for what you want <i>to do</i> in life.<br><br>That is essential. But now it is time for a significant shift. Now it is time for you to define your own goals and meet your own expectations. From now on, you decide! Instead of concentrating on what you are <i>to do,</i> now is the time to zero in on who you are <i>to be--</i>on that person you are yet <i>to become,</i> as President Worthen explained so well. Now is the time for you to focus on developing great attributes of character.<br><br>Now seems to be my time for attending funerals. I have witnessed many families saying good-bye, for a season, to those they love and to whom they are sealed. I often leave funerals wondering, "What would I like to have said about me at my funeral?"<br><br>It is not too early in your life to ask the same question. What would you like to have said about you at your funeral? Hopefully that you were a good husband and father or a good wife and mother.<br><br>That you were a person of integrity.<br><br>That you were kind and patient.<br><br>Or humble and hardworking.<br><br>Or a person of virtue.<br><br>The greatest guardians of any and all virtues are marriage and family. This is particularly the case with the virtues of chastity and fidelity in marriage, both of which are required to create enduring and fully rewarding marriage partnerships and family relationships.<br><br>Male and female are created for what they can do and become, together. It takes a man and a woman to bring a child into the world. Mothers and fathers are not interchangeable. Men and women are distinct and complementary. Children deserve a chance to grow up with both a mom and a dad.<br><br>As you go forth from BYU, you will likely encounter increasing debate about the definition of marriage. Many of your neighbors, colleagues, and friends will have never heard logical and inspired truths about the importance of marriage as God Himself defined it. You will have many opportunities to strengthen understanding of the Lord's side of that argument by the eloquence of your examples, both as individuals and as families.<br><br>The Apostle Paul foresaw our circumstances when he said:<br><br><i>In the last days perilous times shall come.</i><br><br><i>For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, </i><br><br><i>Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, . . . despisers of those that are good, </i><br><br><i>. . . lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God. </i><br><br>Then he concluded, "From such turn away."<sup>1</sup><br><br>After his remarkable prophecy of our time, Paul added this word of warning:<br><br><i>Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>Ponder that! It means that during these perilous times, life will not be comfortable for true disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ. But we will have His approval. He gave us this assurance:<br><br><i>And blessed are all they who are persecuted for my name's sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. </i><sup>3</sup><br><br>In short, as disciples, each of us will be put to the test. At any hour of any day we have the privilege of choosing between right and wrong. This is an age-old battle that started in a premortal realm. And that battle is becoming more intense every day. Your individual strength of character is needed now more than ever before.<br><br>The day is gone when you can be a quiet and comfortable Christian. Your religion is not just about showing up for church on Sunday. It is about showing up as a true disciple from Sunday morning through Saturday night--24/7! There is no such thing as a "part-time" disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus invited anyone who wants to be His disciple to take up His cross and follow Him.<sup>4</sup> Are you ready to join the ranks?<br><br>Or will you be ashamed of the gospel? Will you be ashamed of your Lord and His plan?<sup>5</sup> Will you yield to voices of those who would have you join them on the popular side of contemporary history?<br><br>No! The youth of Zion will not falter! I believe you will be courageous and proclaim God's truth with clarity and kindness, even when His truth is politically unpopular! Paul set that pattern when he declared:<br><br><i>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>Disciples of the Lord are defenders of marriage. We cannot yield. History is not our judge. A secular society is not our judge. God is our judge! For each of us, Judgment Day will be held in God's own way and time.<sup>7</sup><br><br>The future of marriage and of countless human lives will be determined by your willingness to bear solemn witness of the Lord and live according to His gospel. Great protection is available to us as we enter the waters of baptism and take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ. King Benjamin so explained:<br><br><i>And now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>I appreciate a statement made by Sister Sheri L. Dew at the recent BYU Women's Conference. She said:<br><br><i>At the heart of becoming disciples is <b>doing</b> what we promise to do every time we partake of the sacrament--which is to "always remember" the Lord (see Moroni 4:3; 5:2). This means remembering Him when we choose what media we're willing to expose our spirits to. It means remembering Him in how we spend our time and when choosing between a steady diet of pop culture or the Word of God. It means remembering Him in the middle of conflict or when temptation looms. It means remembering Him when critics attack His Church and mock truth. It means remembering that we have taken His name upon us (Mosiah 5:7).</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>Sister Dew's message is consonant with a message from President Howard W. Hunter (1907–1995), who said:<br><br><i>If our lives and our faith are centered upon Jesus Christ and his restored gospel, nothing can ever go permanently wrong. . . . If our lives are not centered on the Savior and his teachings, no other success can ever be permanently right. </i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/howard-w-hunter_fear-little-flock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>10</sup></a><br><br>Wherever we go, you and I as disciples of the Lord bear a solemn responsibility to proclaim the will of God to all people. And one of the more demanding opportunities of our time is to stand up for the truth regarding the sacred nature of marriage.<br><br>Our message is shaped by divine doctrine, canonized in the Bible:<br><br><i>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br><i>So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. </i><sup>12</sup><br><br><i>And God blessed them, and . . . said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.</i><sup>13</sup><br><br><i>Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. </i><sup>14</sup><br><br><i>And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living. </i><sup>15</sup><br><br>God is the Father of all men and women. They are His children. It was He who ordained marriage as the union of a man and a woman. Marriage was not created by human judges or legislators. It was not created by think tanks or by popular vote or by oft-quoted bloggers or by pundits. It was not created by lobbyists. Marriage was created by God!<br><br>The Ten Commandments forbade adultery and covetousness.16 Those ancient commandments were given later to people of New Testament<sup>17</sup> and Book of Mormon<sup>18</sup> times. In modern revelation the Lord has reaffirmed:<br><br><i>Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else.</i><sup>19</sup><br><br>True intimacy, as planned by our Creator, is experienced only within the sacred union of a husband and wife because it is enriched by truth and ennobled by the honoring of covenants a husband and wife make with each other and with God. It is crucial to note that full fidelity to those covenants forbids pornography, lust, or abuse in any form.<br><br>Social and political pressures to change marriage laws are resulting in practices contrary to God's will regarding the eternal nature and purposes of marriage. Man simply cannot make moral what God has declared to be immoral. Sin, even if legalized by man, is still sin in the eyes of God.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, undergirded by incontrovertible truth, proclaim your love for God! Proclaim your love for all human beings "with malice toward none, with charity for all."<sup>20</sup> They as children of God are our brothers and sisters. We value their rights and feelings. But we cannot condone efforts to change divine doctrine. It is not for man to change.<br><br>God loves His children. And if they love Him, they will show that love by keeping His commandments,<sup>21</sup> including chastity before marriage and total fidelity within marriage. Scriptures warn that behavior contrary to the commandments of the Lord will not only deprive couples of divinely approved intimacy but will bring about the stern judgments of God.<sup>22</sup><br><br>The noblest yearning of the human heart is for a marriage that will endure beyond death. Complete fidelity to covenants made in holy temples will allow husband and wife to be sealed together throughout all eternity.<sup>23</sup><br><br>Dear graduates, families, and friends, the burden of discipleship is heavy. As disciples of the Lord you will stand as defenders of marriage. And as you are true and faithful, not only will He help you and protect you,<sup>24</sup> He will bless your families.<sup>25</sup><br><br>You are beneficiaries of the infinite Atonement of the Lord. Because of Him all of you will eventually be rewarded with immortality. And because of Him you may enjoy the blessing of eternal life with Him and your families.<br><br>Now, invoking the keys of the holy apostleship in me vested, I bless you with a fervent desire to feast on the words of Jesus Christ and to apply His teachings in your daily lives. I bless you with success in your continuing educational and occupational pursuits. I bless you with joy as you keep the commandments of Almighty God. And I bless you with protection, peace, and continual growth as you stand as disciples and defenders of the Lord Jesus Christ and His gospel.<br><br>God lives! Jesus is the Christ! He stands as the Head of His Church, restored in these latter days to accomplish its divine destiny. I so testify, with my expression of love and gratitude for each of you, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Russell M.

<h1> You Serve? - BYU Speeches</h1>

<br>
Elder Nelson, President Worthen, distinguished faculty and guests, family, friends, and fellow graduates: Good afternoon.<br><br>In October 2012 I realized that I would not be getting a master's degree--at least not right away. Devon and I had been married just a couple months, and, after praying and going to the temple, we decided to start our family. At that time I was halfway through my education. In two years I was supposed to have participated in a study abroad program, completed summer internships, graduated, and been accepted to a master's program. But after doing the math, I realized that even getting my undergraduate degree would be difficult with a young baby--and it has been. I knew that getting a master's degree afterward would be nearly impossible for me and for our young family.<br><br>Until this point I thought the purpose of my education at Brigham Young University was purely academic. I had come here to get a great education. BYU was the perfect stepping-stone for me to achieve professional service and success. But when my plans for graduate study and professional life were delayed, I had to reevaluate the purpose of my BYU education.<br><br>What <i>is</i> the purpose of a BYU education? The answer is written clearly on a plaque at the entrance to campus. It is an adage we have all seen many times: Enter to Learn; Go Forth to Serve. But what does this actually mean? How are we to serve? As a young college student I thought that "go forth to serve" meant "go forth and get an awesome job." I was wrong; service means more than that. The Lord requires service with our whole souls and with all of our knowledge, not just the academic knowledge or technical skills we have learned in our degree programs. Doctrine and Covenants 4:2 invokes, "O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength." Truly serving God requires our emotions, physicality, willpower, and intelligence.<br><br>As I reevaluated my plans, I learned that my college education would be just as important to my success as a wife and a mother as it would be to my success in the professional world. My understanding of different cultures and people will help me raise open-minded and empathetic children. My improved knowledge of scripture and Church history will help me teach my children and serve in Church callings. More than anything else, in college I have learned <i>how</i> to learn, and that is a skill that I will continue to use as I approach many challenges and opportunities in the coming years.<br><br>Though a BYU education starts in academics, it doesn't end there. Rather, a BYU education is multifaceted. Throughout our time at BYU we have learned how to live with people who are different from us. We have learned to love them and to value the <i>ways</i> they are different from us. We have learned more about the gospel from religion classes and from serving in callings. We have learned how to be self-sufficient by doing our own laundry, washing our own dishes, and holding down a job--all while continuing to take classes. All of these skills that a BYU education has taught us are gifts we can share with others. They are tools that we can use to serve the people around us, wherever we find ourselves.<br><br>On the cusp of graduation, I find myself in a place that I could not have anticipated: married, with a one-year-old son. Though unexpected, I know it is the exact place in which the Lord wants me to serve right now.<br><br>My experience aside, many of us <i>will</i> go on to get jobs or internships. Some will go on to graduate school, others to missions or self-employment. All of us will be surprised by where our education takes us in the coming years, and none of us will be able to anticipate the opportunities we will have to serve. Regardless of where we end up after graduation, going forth to serve will require <i>all</i> that we have learned as students in this institution. We will have opportunities to serve in every context if we look for them. Our service is vital to our homes, communities, wards, and stakes.<br><br>As you sit here in this congregation, ask yourself, "How can I serve?" Think of all you have learned during the past four or so years. How will you share the blessings of your BYU education? Who can you teach, uplift, comfort, or love? As you reflect on your experience at BYU and plan your future, be grateful for your BYU education and remember your responsibility to go forth and serve.<br><br><i>Phoebe Romney Cook spoke as the representative of her graduating class at BYU commencement on 14 August 2014.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>ating Your Divine Potential - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
This is my first graduation ceremony as president of the university. As you might imagine, I have given a little thought to what graduation ceremonies are all about.<br><br>In some respects, a graduation ceremony is a rather odd event. While the graduation ceremony had its origins in Europe, it is now largely an American phenomenon. As Robert Pippin, a philosophy professor at the University of Chicago, once noted on a similar occasion:<br><br><i>All modern developed nations have universities and some sort of procedure or exam for marking the end of study, but virtually no other nation in the world has graduation ceremonies (the exception is some in England). . . . We Americans, uniquely in all the world, are crazy about such ceremonies. We even have them . . . for graduation from kindergarten, first grade, fourth grade, eighth grade, high school, driving school, secretarial school, dog obedience school, and so on.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>To make the matter even more odd, even though this is mostly an American ceremony, we dress in ways that hardly any Americans--except perhaps priests, judges, or individuals we would consider to be deranged--would ever think about dressing.<sup>2</sup> The ceremonial garb we wear today did at one point have some practical significance. In medieval Europe many ordinary people wore long-sleeved gowns or robes to provide warmth in poorly heated buildings. They also wore hoods, which they could pull over their heads when it became too cold.<br><br>Over time, distinctive gowns and hoods were developed for the various professions, trades, and religious orders. Because most of the professors at early universities in Italy, France, and England were clerics, formal academic wear came to resemble that of the early clergy.<br><br>However, once someone figured out how to heat buildings properly, most people abandoned the gown-and-hood look for something more practical. Status conscious as they were, academics "still tried to mark themselves off as in a special group," as Professor Pippin noted, and faculty and students at most universities "continued to attend class and teach in what had by then . . . become the basic university attire, the black gown."<sup>3</sup><br><br>By the end of the nineteenth century practicality overcame status symbols, and the practice of wearing academic robes to class every day slowly died out, even in America. However, Americans continued to hang on to the tradition of donning the garb for graduation ceremonies. And, in typical American fashion, marketing forces soon began to influence the practice. Professor Pippin explained:<br><br><i>Mr. Gardner Cottrell Leonard, a young man of industry and sound commercial sense, . . . had not been happy with the shape and fit of his graduation gown, worn at Williams College in 1883, and he spent the next year traveling across Europe, researching medieval attire and the design of gowns and hats. For the next ten years or so, he had developed and promoted the business of designing and supplying such gowns, and when a meeting of college officials was held at Columbia in 1895 to decide on uniform standards . . . , Mr. Leonard was the technical expert . . . and very successful promoter of all this regalia.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>The standards set at that meeting were revised over time, and there is today--and I am not making this up--an academic costume code that prescribes the style of the sleeves, the nature of the material, the color of the hood and width of its binding, and the type and color of the tassel, all according to the institution and the degree awarded.<sup>5</sup><br><br>So here we sit--or, I guess, there you sit and here I stand--"dressed," in the words of Professor Pippin, "like thirteenth-century monks thanks partly to the marketing skills of the son of a dry goods manufacturer in Albany, New York" in the late 1800s.<sup>6</sup> And we do so in order to go through a ceremony largely abandoned by the rest of the modern world. How does one explain this?<br><br>Anthropologists, philosophers, sociologists, and, I suppose, even psychologists could provide a variety of interesting answers to that question. Let me offer just one.<br><br>I suggest we are willing to endure what might seem like an odd custom because ceremonies help us mark transition points in our lives, making it clear to us (and to others) that we have finished one important phase of our lives and are now entering another. Thus we celebrate not only what you have accomplished here in the past few years but, more important, the fact that you are moving on to a new stage of life in which--because of what you have experienced and learned here--you will be prepared to accomplish even more. That is the reason why--even though you are finishing your formal education here--this ceremony is called a commencement rather than a termination.<br><br>Almost all societies have some kind of ceremony (either formal or informal) to mark life-stage transitions. Ceremonies like this one help us reflect on what we have learned and on how that learning has prepared us for the challenges that lie ahead.<br><br>As you ponder on those matters today, let me suggest that, as someone once observed, "the question to be asked at the end of an educational step or sequence is not what has the student learned but what has the student become."<sup>7</sup><br><br>As I am sure you have already discovered--and if you have not, you soon will--there is a vast difference between knowing something and doing something. You may understand the theoretical principles of physics, for example, and still not be able to construct a rocket ship. The gap between theory and practice is sometimes wide.<br><br>But the observation goes one step further, drawing a contrast not just between knowing and doing but also between doing and being. That distinction is particularly important at a university like this one whose mission is not just to convey knowledge to students but also "to assist [them] in their quest for perfection and eternal life."<sup>8</sup><br><br>In the long run, your success at BYU--and your success in the next phases of your life--will be measured not by what you have learned from some textbook. You will soon forget much of that, if it wasn't forgotten the minute you walked out of the final. Nor will your success be determined solely by what you have done here. Your grade point average, for example, will matter less and less as time goes on. (For some that is good news.) Your success, here and beyond, will ultimately be measured by what you become, by your character. The real question to be asked at a ceremony of this kind is "How close are we to reaching our full potential?" The BYU mission statement indicates that this is a place where "the full realization of human potential is pursued."<sup>9</sup> And that potential is greater than many in the world imagine, because all human beings are "beloved spirit son[s] or daughter[s] of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny."<sup>10</sup><br><br>As important and as powerful as it is to learn some truth or to do some good act, it is much more important to <i>be</i> true and to <i>be</i> good. If you become a true and good spouse, parent, child, sibling, co-worker, or friend--and ultimately realize your divine potential as sons and daughters of heavenly parents--your higher education that has begun but not ended here will be a true success. Reminding ourselves of these truths and that potential is reason aplenty to engage in this distinctive ceremony. May each of you realize that full potential is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Kevin J Worthen was president of Brigham Young University when this commencement address was given on 14 August 2014.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1>rated Faculty - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I begin today by paying tribute to President Cecil O. Samuelson and his wife, Sister Sharon G. Samuelson. The Samuelsons were asked by President Gordon B. Hinckley to lead the university for what they expected would be five to seven years, and they were here for eleven. President and Sister Samuelson had longtime and deep personal, family, and professional ties to the University of Utah. Yet because of their profound faith, when the call came to serve here, they turned immediately from red to blue, inside and out. Their loyalty to BYU went much deeper than duty.<br><br>President Samuelson has been a remarkable leader: insightful and incisive, with the wisdom and experience of a seasoned administrator in a variety of settings. He was unapologetic about his high academic standards. Despite his driven interest in the institution of BYU, he quietly made himself available to individuals who sought his listening ear and counsel. He was guided by an absolute commitment to do what was right, not what was popular. He had the ability to capitalize on the strengths of those around him, despite being acutely aware of their weaknesses.<br><br>The university was everything in the Samuelsons' lives from early morning to late night, seven days a week, and in my interactions with them I never once heard them complain. While he would never want it to be said this way because he has no need for acclaim, President Samuelson has left an indelible mark on the university. Programs are stronger, processes are improved, and resources are more carefully administered. For the Samuelsons' service we can be deeply grateful.<br><br>President Samuelson leaves a stronger university in the hands of our new president, Kevin J Worthen. President Worthen brings a long history with and deep love for BYU to his new assignment. He is well prepared to assume this responsibility. He is an academic who is distinguished in his own career in the J. Reuben Clark Law School, and he is fiercely committed to the Church, which sponsors BYU, and to the BYU Board of Trustees, whose support and direction are a vital part of BYU and our mission.<br><br>President Worthen has already shown himself to be accessible, student oriented, an authentic listener, and a willing and ready learner, and he enjoys a good laugh. He is collegial and congenial, and while he is a quick study, he is also deliberative and collaborative in his decision making. By his side is his wife, Peggy, who, by President Worthen's own admission, is a primary motivating and inspiring force behind his leadership. I welcome President Worthen by saying what the board already knows: They and we can be confident that firm, capable, and experienced hands are at the helm of Brigham Young University.<br><br>From the very establishment of the Church of Jesus Christ in this dispensation, the education of the Latter-day Saints has been a prophetic priority. For 180 years Church presidents have spoken emphatically regarding the centrality of education in our doctrine. The eternal implications of learning in this life were defined by revelation in Doctrine and Covenants 130:18: "Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection."<br><br>Let me share a sampling of statements from past presidents. President Brigham Young, who had little formal education, counseled, "Learn everything that the children of men know, and be prepared for the most refined society upon the face of the earth" (<i>JD</i> 16:77).<br><br>President John Taylor declared:<br><br><i>We ought to foster education and intelligence of every kind; cultivate literary tastes; and men of literary and scientific talent should improve that talent and all should magnify the gifts which God has given unto them. . . . But with all our getting, we want to get understanding, and that understanding which flows from God.</i> [<i>JD</i> 20:48]<br><br>From President Lorenzo Snow:<br><br><i>We ought to understand that we have espoused a system of religion that is calculated in its nature to increase within us wisdom and knowledge. . . .</i><br><br><i>The whole idea of Mormonism is improvement--mentally, physically, morally, and spiritually. No half-way education suffices for the Latter-day Saint.</i> [<i>The Teachings of Lorenzo Snow: Fifth President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, </i> ed. Clyde J. Williams (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1996), 26–27]<br><br>President Joseph Fielding Smith, an extraordinary scholar in his own right, counseled:<br><br><i>Speaking from an eternal viewpoint, we hope to continue learning until we become like the Lord and know all things and have eternal life in his kingdom.</i><br><br><i>But even here and now, in this life, there are few things as important as proper education.</i> ["Educating for a Golden Era of Continuing Righteousness," BYU campus education week address, 8 June 1971, 1]<br><br>And, more recently, from President Gordon B. Hinckley:<br><br><i>We live in a world where knowledge is developing at an ever-accelerating rate. Drink deeply from this ever-springing well of wisdom and human experience. If you should stop now, you will only stunt your intellectual and spiritual growth. Keep everlastingly at it.</i> [<i>TGBH,</i> 171; quoting "A Three-Point Challenge," BYU commencement address, 27 April 1995]<br><br>Finally, perhaps President Spencer W. Kimball described the importance of education to the Latter-day Saints most succinctly when he delivered to the BYU community on the 100-year anniversary of the university what has come to be known as the "Second Century" address: "We understand, as few people do, that education is a part of being about our Father's business" ("The Second Century of Brigham Young University," BYU devotional address, 10 October 1975; see also excerpted text in "Climbing the Hills Just Ahead: Three Addresses," in John W. Welch and Don E. Norton, eds., <i>Educating Zion</i> [Provo: BYU Studies, 1996], 73).<br><br>In addition to these statements, our history as a Church shows a continual emphasis on providing opportunities for education in policy and process, often in the face of great challenge. Just two years into the history of the fledgling Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Lord directed the establishment of the School of the Prophets. The curriculum for the school included such diversity as astronomy, geology, archaeology, physics, chemistry, biology, history, prophecy, current events, foreign affairs, international relations, geography, and other areas. In 1834, under the direction of the Prophet Joseph Smith, a school for the education of young men and women was established in Kirtland, Ohio. Then, shortly after some of the Church members moved to Independence, Missouri, a frontier school was established. Parley P. Pratt was called to administer the school, which convened once a week in the open air. After being driven from Independence in 1833, the Saints established new headquarters in Far West. The official history of Caldwell County notes, "There were many teachers among them and schoolhouses were among their first buildings" (<i>HC</i> 3:XLIII, note; quoting <i>History of Caldwell and Livingston Counties, Missouri</i> [St. Louis: National Historical Company, 1886], 121).<br><br>When the Saints reached Illinois, not only was primary education a continuing priority for Church leadership, but a vision for higher education also emerged. In 1840 Joseph Smith petitioned the Illinois legislature not only for a charter for the new city of Nauvoo but for a university charter as well. Requests for both charters were granted. The legislative act stipulated:<br><br><i>Sec. 24. The City Council may establish and organize an institution of learning within the limits of the city, for the teaching of the Arts, Sciences, and Learned Professions, to be called the "University of the City of Nauvoo," which institution . . . shall have all the powers and privileges for the advancement of the cause of education which appertain to the Trustees of any other College or University of this State.</i> [<i>HC</i> 4:243–44; quoting <i>The City Charter: Laws, Ordinances, and Acts of the City Council of the City of Nauvoo</i> (Nauvoo, Illinois: City Council of Nauvoo, 1842), 7; see also Ernest L. Wilkinson and W. Cleon Skousen, <i>Brigham Young University: A School of Destiny</i> (Provo: BYU Press, 1976), 12]<br><br>The University of the City of Nauvoo was "the first municipal university in America" (Milton Lynn Bennion, <i>Mormonism and Education</i> [Salt Lake City: Department of Education of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1939], 22; see also <i>School of Destiny,</i> 12). It seems quite ambitious to be concerned with university education when the community was still draining swampland to make way for homes and farms.<br><br>After settling in the Rocky Mountains, the pioneers continued their emphasis on education. In October 1847, barely three months after the arrival of the first party of pioneers in the Salt Lake Valley, the first school was opened. Within two years there would be schools in most of the Mormon settlements in the West. Buildings to accommodate these schools were the first public structures to be erected in each settlement and were often built in a community effort before pioneers had completed the construction of their own homes. It was not uncommon for instruction to begin before the schoolhouse was constructed.<br><br>On February 28, 1850, following the Nauvoo pattern, the territorial legislature authorized the establishment of the University of the State of Deseret. This was the first public university west of the Mississippi. It would eventually become the University of Utah, which ultimately achieved its stature as a state institution independent of the Church. The need for a school that would be free to integrate principles of the restored gospel with traditional dimensions of learning led to the establishment of Brigham Young Academy in 1875 under Karl G. Maeser's leadership. The Academy's successor, Brigham Young University, was officially born in 1903. The history of hardship and heaven's hand in the early years of the Academy and subsequently Brigham Young University has been discussed in past annual university conferences.<br><br>It is abundantly clear from this brief history that education has been crucial in the hearts and minds of Church leaders and members and that it was pursued against great odds. Prophet leaders concerned themselves personally with integrating learning into the lives of Church members. In the early days of the restored Church, the establishment of education required faculty of devotion and commitment. Elder Parley P. Pratt--the apostle and appointed administrator of the frontier school in Independence, Missouri, that I mentioned earlier--recorded that he walked six miles to the open-air school, often barefoot, to teach there (see <i>PPP,</i> chapter 13; see also <i>School of Destiny,</i> 11). In March 1851, George A. Smith, a member of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles, was dispatched by President Brigham Young from Salt Lake City to the new Utah territory cities of Parowan and Cedar City to help establish schools. Elder Smith described the primitive learning environment in his diary:<br><br><i>Monday, March 3rd, 1851. My wicky-up is a very important establishment, composed of brush, a few slabs, and 3 wagons. A fire in the center and a lot of milking stools, benches and logs placed around, two of which are fashioned with buffalo robes. It answers for various purposes, kitchen, school-house, dining room, meeting house, council house, sitting room, reading room, store room. To see my school some of the cold nights in February, scholars standing round my huge camp fire, the wind broken off by the brush and the whole canopy of heaven for covering. Thermometer standing at 7°, one side roasting while the other freezing requiring a continual turning to keep as near as possible an equilibrium of temperature. I would stand with my grammar book, the only one in school, would give out a sentence at a time and pass it around. Notwithstanding these circumstances, I never saw a grammar class learn faster for the time.</i> [Quoted in John Clifton Moffitt, <i>The History of Public Education in Utah</i> (Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1946), 20; also quoted in <i>School of Destiny,</i> 15]<br><br>The faculty of Brigham Young Academy often worked only for the garden produce their pupils' families could contribute as tuition. Shortly after the year 1900, during the administration of President George H. Brimhall at the Academy, teachers were paid only one-third of their salaries in cash, with the balance paid in scrip. The scrip was used as trade currency, was often discounted relative to cash at local stores, and was without value outside of Utah Valley.<br><br>Faculty compensation in the early years of Brigham Young University was a perennial problem. This was particularly acute in the depression years. In 1929, during the administration of President Franklin S. Harris, BYU boasted a complement of eighty-five faculty members. That number grew to 115 by 1934, despite the lowest Church budget appropriation to BYU in a decade. The growth in faculty was possible in part because the faculty accepted a 10 percent pay cut in 1932. In a letter to the Church commissioner of education, President Harris wrote:<br><br><i>While everyone, of course, regrets that conditions make retrenchment necessary, they voted one hundred per cent to cooperate with the Church Board in the matter. I was really delighted with the spirit of the faculty in which they recognized the problems that confront the authorities of the Church in these days of financial depression.</i> [Letter from Franklin S. Harris to Joseph F. Merrill, 7 March 1932; quoted in <i>School of Destiny,</i> 290]<br><br>The next year, 1933, with a further deteriorating economy, President Harris announced to the faculty an additional one-eighth salary cut and advised them that compensation in coming years would be provisional, without a specific commitment as to salary (see <i>School of Destiny,</i> 290). It might also be interesting to note that the total Church appropriation to BYU in 1939 during President Harris's tenure was $320,000--the equivalent today, $5.49 million, is significantly less than the current total operating budget for most of our academic colleges.<br><br>The Lord's emphasis on education has been strong and sustained. The dedication of this founding faculty to BYU early in the university's history is humbling. We are the beneficiaries of the toil of early colleagues who built BYU at considerable personal sacrifice. Indeed, the faculty were <i>consecrated.</i> They were united in their devotion to the special purpose of BYU, willingly offering their time and talents in this cause.<br><br>Now, here, with some 1,500 faculty, 10 million square feet of well-maintained academic and support space, a beautifully groomed campus, superb computer facilities, a world-class library, and well-prepared students, we are no longer living on donated turnips and warming ourselves in ill-equipped, borrowed buildings. Although we are far more richly and stably resourced today, there is no less need for a consecrated faculty at BYU. Consecration is not just about sacrifice, though sacrifice is indeed a part. Consecration is about making our offering sacred.<br><br>In his short time in office, President Worthen has already made it an emphasis to remind us of the mission of BYU, which "is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life" (<i>The Mission of Brigham Young University</i> and <i>The Aims of a BYU Education</i> [Provo: BYU, 2014], 1).<br><br>The Aims of a BYU Education are to provide an educational experience that is "(1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building, leading to (4) lifelong learning and service" (<i>Mission</i> and <i>Aims,</i> 5). We have heard it said on many occasions that there is no reason for a Church-sponsored BYU if our objective is only to be a very fine university. Said President Kimball:<br><br><i>For while you will do many things in the programs of this university that are done elsewhere, these same things can and must be done better here than others do them. You will also do some special things here that are left undone by other institutions.</i> ["Second Century"; see also excerpted text in <i>Educating Zion,</i> 64]<br><br>There can be little question that the board of trustees expects us to do the traditional work of university business more effectually than it is done elsewhere. But we are asked to do more. President David O. McKay taught the BYU community nearly eighty years ago:<br><br><i>Brigham Young University is primarily a religious institution. It was established for the sole purpose of associating with facts of science, art, literature, and philosophy the truths of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. . . .</i><br><br><i>Such teaching is given effectively not necessarily in a formal theology class, but in literature, art, geology, biology, and other classes.</i> ["The Church University," <i>Messenger</i> 11, no. 10 (October 1937): 3, 4; see also <i>Educating Zion,</i> 10, 12; see also Ernest L. Wilkinson, ed., <i>Brigham Young University: The First One Hundred Years,</i> 4 vols. (Provo: BYU Press, 1975–76), 4:185]<br><br>I readily acknowledge that what we are attempting here is difficult. We are asked to do much more than what we might be asked to undertake in a faculty appointment elsewhere. This task includes not just world-class teaching and world-changing research. We are asked to change lives. This is precisely why each BYU faculty member is selected for hire because of the foundation of superb research training and extraordinary preparation to teach the discipline and, beyond that, a distinctive credential that qualifies him or her to fulfill BYU's imposing mission. Because of the unique nature of this university and the faculty who make it so, it might be said that every gathering of students on this campus is both a class and a congregation in which faculty sensitively and appropriately respond to the charge to weave together the sacred and the secular. Brigham Young University's mission cannot be achieved and the university cannot reach its prophetic destiny without a consecrated faculty. That we hold such an individual and collective vision is central to BYU's very existence. Again, from President Kimball:<br><br><i>Your double heritage and dual concerns with the secular and the spiritual require you to be "bilingual." As scholars you must speak with authority and excellence to your professional colleagues in the language of scholarship, and you must also be literate in the language of spiritual things. We must be more bilingual, in that sense, to fulfill our promise in the second century of BYU.</i> ["Second Century"; see also excerpted text in <i>Educating Zion,</i> 64]<br><br>I would like to note that President Kimball referred to fulfilling our "promise" rather than our "potential" or our "possibilities."<br><br>The university's mission guides all that we are about here: faculty hiring, retention, and promotion; faculty development; annual stewardship evaluations and compensation decisions; curriculum development; teaching in the classroom, laboratory, studio, field, and clinic; assessment of learning; scholarly and creative work; and more. Some of those critical university functions are evaluative in nature. A spirit of consecration doesn't make those often-difficult tasks less personal or less painful, but it does make the decisions more principled.<br><br>The beautiful and mature BYU garden from which we are now harvesting fruit was planted by consecrated faculty of the past. The faculty of today and the future will cultivate that garden and see it flourish. For such devoted faculty, work at the university is a natural part of their lives and mirrors their service at home and in the Church. Whereas the lives of academics elsewhere are often one-dimensional, with attention given only to activities that will advance their careers, I find it remarkable that faculty in this gathering freely give of their time in Church service wherever they are called.<br><br>Examples abound. You are likely seated in this meeting next to a PhD-prepared nursery leader, Relief Society teacher, or Scoutmaster.<br><br>Jan Scharman, student life vice president and faculty member in Counseling and Psychological Services, just completed a term as Young Women president in her ward.<br><br>Scott Holden of the School of Music was educated at Julliard and the Manhattan School of Music, has performed domestically and abroad, and has mentored students who have won national and international performance competitions. Early in his BYU career he served as the Primary pianist in his ward.<br><br>These examples are representative of all of you whose lives of seamlessly blended service across home, work, and Church make this faculty extraordinary. Where else but at BYU would such dedication be encountered among such distinguished academics? This is, in part, why the board of trustees cares as much about who you are as they do about what you know. The lessons students learn in observing the priorities in the lives of their faculty mentors are among the most lasting that they will take with them from this campus.<br><br>A united embrace of our mission elevates our aspirations and goals. We unashamedly celebrate the individual accomplishments of our colleagues in their disciplines. However, as I mentioned in my remarks in this setting last year, our distinguished colleagues here understand that humility is central to all learning and that it underpins the commitment of this institution to the collective good. In his address at the inauguration of President Dallin H. Oaks, Elder Neal A. Maxwell reminded us of the real motivation for our work at the university: "Brigham Young University seeks to improve and 'sanctify' itself for the sake of others--not for the praise of the world, but to serve the world better" (Neal A. Maxwell, "Greetings to the President," <i>Addresses Delivered at the Inauguration of Dallin Harris Oaks</i> [Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1971], 1; quoted in Kimball, "Second Century").<br><br>Those many among us who merit attention and acclaim for their distinguished academic records have no need to seek it. And frankly, those who don't seek it are so much more pleasant to work with. I am grateful that at BYU we have the professional and spiritual maturity to revel in the successes of the students, our colleagues, and the university.<br><br>Your dedicated vision of BYU's purpose causes you to serve beyond your own careers and beyond what the university can provide to you in advancement of your own professional agenda. In a talk to the BYU community entitled "Education for Eternity," President Spencer W. Kimball noted, "This university is not the place for mercenaries" (pre-school address to BYU faculty and staff, 12 September 1967; see also excerpted text in <i>Educating Zion,</i> 50).<br><br>Yes, we are ambitious, but appropriately so, both individually and institutionally. The employment "package" for faculty at a university may include expectations and provisions: expectations for teaching, curriculum development, scholarship, committee work and more, as well as provisions for salary, travel support, assistants, laboratory or studio space, necessary supplies, and such. At BYU that package also includes the obligation and opportunity for the kind of special student interaction that is the personality of BYU.<br><br>The focus on students' welfare and progress is at the very core of this consecrated faculty. The 2014 Gallup-Purdue Index Report includes the results of a survey of more than 30,000 college graduates across the United States. The study was designed to identify elements of college experience that yield long-term success for graduates. Survey questions sought to gauge graduates' well-being in five areas:<br><br>• Purpose well-being<br>• Social well-being<br>• Financial well-being<br>• Community well-being<br>• Physical well-being<br><br>Graduates' well-being in these areas was rated on a spectrum from "thriving" to "suffering." The study revealed that--independent of the type or size or admission selectivity of the college or university attended--graduates were twice as likely to thrive in all areas of well-being if they felt their college prepared them well for life outside of it. Similarly, the odds of graduates thriving in all areas nearly double when the students agree that their college was passionate about their long-term success.<br><br>It should be troubling to American higher education that only 3 percent of college graduates across the United States were found to be thriving in all areas of well-being, down from 26 percent in the decade of the 1960s. In a truly stunning finding, the survey found that graduates who in their college studies (1) "had a professor who cared about them as a person," (2) had a professor who "made them excited about learning," and (3) had a mentor who "encouraged them to pursue their dreams" were more than twice as likely to be engaged at work and were nearly three times as likely to be thriving as those who didn't feel supported in these three specific ways. Among all survey respondents, nearly two-thirds (63 percent) had a professor who excited them about learning while only one-quarter (27 percent) felt their professors cared about them, and only one-fifth (22 percent) had a mentor who encouraged them to pursue goals. How many graduates experienced all three? Only one in seven (14 percent). These data are sobering. (See <i>Great Jobs, Great Lives: The 2014 Gallup-Purdue Index Report,</i> gallup.com/strategicconsulting/168791/gallup-purdue-index-inaugural-national-report.aspx.)<br><br>The study illustrates how far-reaching our potential impact is on students, both in and out of the classroom. This kind of interaction is and should be natural to us at BYU. In his 1975 address, President Kimball stated, "Education on this campus deliberately and persistently concerns itself with 'education for eternity'" ("Second Century"; see also excerpted text in <i>Educating Zion,</i> 64). Educating for eternity is timely counsel to us in a day when American universities seem to be struggling even to educate for time only. I suspect that all of us are here today in large part because of a professor who took an interest in and inspired, encouraged, and mentored us. Examples of such mentoring are found in every department and program across this campus. Surely we are doing better than our national peer institutions, and as we begin a new academic year, perhaps we can do better than we are doing now.<br><br>Our faculty sees the potential in students and cultivates it. Two relatively recent faculty hires in the School of Accountancy, Bill Tayler and Steve Smith, have facilitated the formation of a student club in the school. This year a student team from the club participated in the National Case Competition of the Institute of Management Accountants (IMA). That the student group did well in the competition is not surprising; the university regularly sees success among our students in these competitions. The circumstances surrounding their success are what make this particular case extraordinary.<br><br>The IMA selected the BYU student team as the winner of this year's competition without the team personally appearing in the final presentation round. Because the BYU team told the IMA before the competition that they would not participate in the final round, as it was scheduled for a Sunday, the organization invited the team instead to record their final presentation in front of a live audience and submit their presentation on a DVD for judging. The recording was shown during the final round while all other student presentations were live. At the awards luncheon the IMA announced that BYU had won the competition, although there was no one from the team to accept the award because the awards ceremony was held on Sunday.<br><br>There are three dimensions of this singular experience that are remarkable. First, and perhaps most obvious, we have extraordinary students who rise to the top in any comparative setting. Second, this illustrates the impact of interested and unselfish faculty providing extra-mile mentoring to students. And third, when our programs and their products are superb, we are taken seriously and accommodated by external entities that are respectful of our unique positions. Indeed, when we are superb, the decisions of such professional entities are themselves questioned if we are excluded.<br><br>The university's signature emphasis on student mentoring was perhaps foreseen, as evidenced by a statement by President Kimball:<br><br><i>We can do much in excellence and, at the same time, emphasize the large-scale participation of our students. . . . We can bless many and give many experience while, at the same time, we are developing the few select souls who can take us to new heights of attainment.</i> ["Second Century"; see also excerpted text in <i>Educating Zion,</i> 73]<br><br>The consecrated faculty at BYU are content, but they are never satisfied. We are generously resourced, and I often hear you express gratitude for those resources. But BYU faculty are, after all, humans as well as academics and could always consume more resources--more space, more funding, more travel, etc. When I say BYU faculty are "content but never satisfied," I mean to observe that in the quest for excellence you refuse to be limited by limitations in resources. As an undergraduate student at BYU in the years 1952 to 1954, David Dalton, emeritus professor of viola in the School of Music, took classes in the Knight Mangum Hall--which was called the Social Hall at the time. Music students and faculty struggled with inadequate facilities in that era but made do through determination and dedication. Student practice rooms were not available, so students were left to their own initiative and ingenuity for private practice. From Professor Dalton's own description, I quote:<br><br><i>Of the various options available, nothing seemed adequate for enterprising music students who were keenly aware of the hours needed to hone one's craft in private. One day, while hoping to find a space--any space--to try and perfect solo Bach or my concertmaster solos on the violin, I espied a possibility that I was convinced had never been thought of before: the small, yes, intimate janitor's closet in a narrow hallway.</i><br><br><i>First, I sleuthed it out regarding frequency of use. Typically it was used early morning, midday, and late afternoon. Second, I took measurements with the eye of the interior. Here might be a problem. I didn't dare rearrange brooms and mops or remove buckets and cleaning solvents. All must be left as I found it.</i><br><br><i>Ready for the final test, I took my violin inside and started playing. If I used a full bow, I came dangerously close to ramming the tip into the wall or plunging the frog into a mop. What to do? I surveyed and discovered that the room wasn't square but slightly rectangular. If I repositioned myself 90 degrees, everything worked! Barely.</i> [Private communication with David Dalton]<br><br>As a result of Professor Dalton's undergraduate study, he qualified for entrance to the Eastman School of Music with the world's foremost violist, William Primrose. Professor Dalton returned to join the BYU School of Music faculty in 1963, and over the course of a nearly four-decade career, his artistry and research led him to receive in 2014 the prestigious International Viola Society's Golden Clef Award, which the society has awarded only one other time in its history. Whatever resource constraints we have or think we have, history would suggest we have no basis for complaint. While real needs exist on campus, in terms of influence on students, a single faculty member far outweighs beautifully appointed buildings or state-of-the-art equipment. With the level of support we enjoy, our accomplishment is limited only by our vision and our effort.<br><br>A consecrated faculty is committed to excellence and is passionate about learning--both their own learning through their scholarly pursuits and that of their students in all the various settings in which students are engaged. Such a faculty will never be satisfied with mediocrity or limited influence. Thirty-nine years ago President Kimball invited us to lengthen our stride and quicken our step (see "Second Century"; see also excerpted text in <i>Educating Zion,</i> 74). He further declared, "While the discovery of new knowledge must increase, there must always be a heavy and primary emphasis on transmitting knowledge--on the quality of teaching at BYU" ("Second Century"; see also excerpted text in <i>Educating Zion,</i> 68).<br><br>Our theology seeks perfection. Isn't that a sobering thought in the context of our university assignment? We must actively aspire to teaching that delivers instructional material effectively, stretches students, encourages critical thinking, and evaluates and adjusts its material and methods regularly as warranted. Another second-century charge, perhaps more relevant today than ever before, sets the standard for our teaching: "We must be certain that the lessons are not only taught but are also absorbed and learned" (Kimball, "Second Century"; see also excerpted text in <i>Educating Zion,</i> 68).<br><br>President Kimball continued:<br><br><i>We do not want BYU ever to become an educational factory. It must concern itself with not only the dispensing of facts but with the preparation of its students to take their place in society as thinking, thoughtful, and sensitive individuals who . . . come here dedicated to love of God, pursuit of truth, and service to mankind.</i> ["Second Century"; see also excerpted text in <i>Educating Zion,</i> 69]<br><br>We must pursue scholarship of enduring value, appearing in the finest venues and attracting the respected attention of our peers in the field. In that effort we are promised a competitive edge: that a faithful faculty will have access to heaven's help. Again, from President Kimball:<br><br><i>We expect the natural unfolding of knowledge to occur as a result of scholarship, but there will always be that added dimension that the Lord can provide when we are qualified to receive and he chooses to speak.</i> ["Second Century"; see also excerpted text in <i>Educating Zion,</i> 71]<br><br>These are lofty aspirations for excellence, which, unfortunately, can be lost in the grind of grading papers and revising rejected manuscripts. We are doing well and improving on all fronts. I hope this reminder of the prophetic vision for BYU will inspire us in our day-to-day work. Consecration means work--hard work, long work, often repetitive work, and work that is variously frustrating and fruitful. As we fully understand the noble cause in which we are engaged, it will surely be satisfying. Our past BYU president Ernest L. Wilkinson said, "Dreams and prophetic utterances are not self-executing. They are fulfilled only by righteous and devoted people making the prophecies come true" (<i>School of Destiny,</i> 876; quoted in Kimball, "Second Century"; see also excerpted text in <i>Educating Zion,</i> 74).<br><br>In offering these observations on the character and activity of consecrated faculty, I am careful not to suggest an institutional change in emphasis on any aspect of our faculty stewardship. The learning of our students and our own learning are coupled. The special spiritual nature of BYU is not an excuse for mediocrity in teaching or research. I am urging that our efforts in rigorous disciplinary instruction and high-quality scholarly work be celebrated and elevated as a model for President Joseph Fielding Smith's declaration that "knowledge comes both by reason and by revelation" ("Educating for a Golden Era," 2; quoted in Kimball, "Second Century"; see also excerpted text in <i>Educating Zion,</i> 71).<br><br>Admittedly, there are a finite number of hours in a faculty member's workday (usually ten or twelve), and our activities must be approached with a careful balance to ensure that no aspect of university responsibility is neglected. With appropriate management facilitated by heaven's help, all areas of faculty stewardship will be cooperative rather than competitive, with complementary outcomes. Hundreds of you are demonstrating this to be so.<br><br>I conclude today with my hope for a tremendously successful year and with the prayer that the spirit of consecration will propel us to even greater effectiveness in all dimensions of our sacred stewardship at the university, for one cannot speak of consecration without also speaking of stewardship. In the coming year may we pursue excellence with energy and with confidence of success, involving and shaping students in the full BYU endeavor defined in our mission.<br><br>"Shall we not go on in so great a cause?" (D&amp;amp;C 128:22). Indeed, we shall go on in this great cause, magnified by the fruit of consecrated service that lifts us far beyond our own abilities and extends our humble influence to that envisioned by those who have foreseen the destiny of Brigham Young University.<br><br><i>Brent W.

<h1>of the Y - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The theme of this year's BYU annual university conference comes from Doctrine and Covenants 128, which is a letter written by Joseph Smith to the Saints in September 1842. It is in the form of a rhetorical question: "Shall we not go on in so great a cause?"--the implicit answer being, "Of course!"<sup>1</sup><br><br>The particular cause that Joseph was addressing when he wrote this inspired epistle was baptism for the dead--a great cause indeed. The cause in which we are now engaged is a different one. Or, more correctly, it is a different part of the same great cause--the greatest cause of all--the overarching cause of all of God's work "to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life"<sup>2</sup> of His children.<br><br>That our work at Brigham Young University is part of this greater cause is made clear by the opening sentence of our Brigham Young University mission statement, which plainly states that our main purpose "is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life."<sup>3</sup> Those who have heard me speak in the past three months will not be surprised to hear me start with the mission statement. That document, to use the words of Joseph, "seems to occupy my mind, and press itself upon my feelings the strongest"<sup>4</sup> since I was appointed president.<br><br>This morning I would like to review with you some of the key principles in our mission statement with the ultimate aim of helping us better understand the great cause in which we are engaged and the ways in which each of us can better carry out our roles in this cause.<br><br>Let me begin by highlighting one of the key principles of the mission statement--one that is found only implicitly in that document and, therefore, one that is possible to overlook, as obvious as it may seem. The principle is this: Our mission as a university focuses on the students.<br><br>While that exact statement does not appear anywhere in the mission statement, the document is founded on that assumption.<br><br>• The word <i>students</i> appears in the mission statement seven times.<br><br>• The word <i>faculty</i> appears twice.<br><br>• The terms <i>administrators</i> and <i>staff</i> appear only once each.<br><br>Although I am quite confident that the authors of the mission statement did not engage in a careful word analysis to ensure that the relative importance of each group was precisely represented in the numeric ratio of the nouns used in the document, I think noting these occurrences is not a bad way of reminding ourselves that our mission focuses on the students and not on us or on anyone else.<br><br>At the end of the day, students are the product we produce, to put it in business terms. How they turn out--what they do and, more important, who they are--is the ultimate metric by which our work will be measured.<br><br>And by that measure we are doing quite well. Our graduates are succeeding in the world of work, in their communities, and in their homes. But lest we become puffed up in unrighteous pride for things not of our own doing, let me remind you that we start with very good raw material, so to speak.<br><br>As a result of their own gifts and hard work as well as the loving nurture of families and communities, our students are extraordinary people even before they arrive on campus--before we have had any impact at all on them. Just to give you one incomplete view of what we start with, here are some facts about the students who were admitted during our most recent admission process.<br><br>This spring we admitted 6,997 potential students--just over half of the 12,698 students who applied. Now, not all of those 6,997 will show up, but this is what the group looks like at this point.<br><br>The average ACT score of these students we admitted is 28.81, and 42.4 percent of them have an ACT score of 30 or higher. The average high school GPA of this class is 3.83. Over half had a GPA of 3.9 or higher--that is, the median is at least 3.9. Of these admitted students, 22.1 percent of them graduated as one of the top five students in their class--not the top 5 percent but the top five. And these students did not achieve these impressive academic credentials by locking themselves in the library all day and ignoring everything but their studies.<br><br>• 70.7 percent of them participated in high school sports<br><br>• 77.5 percent of them participated in musical groups, dance, plays, or concerts<br><br>• 77 percent were employed during high school<br><br>• 82.7 percent earned their Duty to God or Young Womanhood Recognition awards<br><br>• 95.6 percent graduated from four years of seminary, with almost half of those attending early-morning seminary<br><br>No wonder our graduates turn out so well. As a group, they come to us with a remarkable amount of talent, intellect, and experience in the gospel. The real question for us is, "Are we doing as much as we can to enhance the development of these outstanding students during their relatively brief tenure with us?"<br><br>That is a question we should ask ourselves regularly, particularly as we begin new programs, activities, or initiatives or make decisions about the future. At such times we would do well to ask ourselves this question: "How is this course of action--the one we are considering--going to enhance the educational experience of our students?" If the answer is "not at all," we might want to think twice about adopting that particular course of action. If the answer is that it will undermine that educational experience for these students, we would want to think a lot more about it--usually enough more that we forget what we were thinking about.<br><br>In short, we are and will remain a student-centric university, one that focuses on the development of our students above all else. With every major decision we make, we need to ask ourselves how this endeavor can enhance the educational experience of our students.<br><br>To answer that question in any meaningful way, we have to know what kind of experience we want our students to have. That brings us back to the mission statement.<br><br>As noted previously, the main goal of our educational experience is to help students in their quest for perfection and eternal life. Although the mission statement was approved by the BYU Board of Trustees in 1981, Karl G. Maeser articulated this ultimate ambitious goal more than 100 years ago, as explained in Professor Buddy Richards' recent biography of Maeser.<br><br>In November 1900, three months before he died, Maeser was invited to attend a Founders Day celebration at Maeser Elementary School, a public school in Provo that had been named in his honor two years earlier. During his visit in 1900, Maeser wrote a different phrase on the chalkboard of each of the four classrooms to summarize his teachings and his thoughts about education.<sup>5</sup><br><br>On the blackboard in the corner of the southwest classroom, he wrote, "This life is one great object lesson to practice on the principles of immortality and eternal life."<sup>6</sup> That has been the ambitious goal of this place from the outset, and it remains so today.<br><br>But we are not the only institution or individuals who have a part in that exalting process. As the language indicates, our mission is to "assist" in that process, not to make it happen. Agency and the key contributions of others--including, principally, the central role of the Savior's Atonement--make it such that we are not solely responsible for the exaltation of any of our students. So it is important for us to understand what our role is in the quest for perfection and eternal life in the lives of these students.<br><br>That is explained in the very next sentence from the mission statement: "That assistance should provide a period of intensive learning in a stimulating setting where a commitment to excellence is expected and the full realization of human potential is pursued."<sup>7</sup><br><br>There are three key principles in that sentence, each of which is further elaborated in succeeding sections of the mission statement.<br><br>First, our role is an educational role. We are to provide a period of intensive learning. As then President Dallin H. Oaks stated in his inaugural address more than forty years ago: "Our reason for <i>being</i> is to be a university."<sup>8</sup> Note that the goal is to provide a period of learning, not teaching--two things that, while related, are not always the same.<br><br>Our recent emphasis on learning outcomes rather than on teaching inputs is in line with the mission statement. I commend all those who have undertaken the difficult task of evaluating what we want students to learn in our programs and even in individual courses. That effort will not only place us in good stead with our major accrediting body as they visit us this coming year but will also properly align us with this key part of our mission statement.<br><br>Note also that the learning experience is to be "intensive." That word has roots in the Latin term <i>intendere,</i> which means to "stretch" or "strain."<sup>9</sup> We should not be afraid to stretch our students intellectually. In fact, if we don't do so, we will not be meeting the board's expectations. As their academic indicators demonstrate, our students are capable of doing more than student bodies of the past. And we need to require them to do their best so they realize their full potential, which is likely greater than they understand. But we must take care to do so in ways that clearly indicate our ultimate goal and motivation.<br><br>Again, Brother Maeser provided us with an example at the outset. One of his former students, George Sutherland--who went on to become a U.S. Supreme Court justice--described the way Maeser worked with his students:<br><br><i>He saw the shortcomings as well as the excellences of his pupils, and while he never hesitated to point them out--sometimes in a genial, humorous way--it was always with such an undercurrent of kindly interest that no criticism ever left a sting. </i><sup>10</sup><br><br>We need to stretch our students in the same way, pointing out when and where they are deficient but always in a way that leaves no doubt of our overriding concern for their well-being.<br><br>Second, while we will not do everything that other universities do, the expectation is that everything we do will be first-rate. According to the mission statement, "a commitment to excellence" is expected. It is not an aspiration; it is an expectation.<br><br>That same principle is articulated later in the portion of the mission statement discussing the curriculum: "The university cannot provide programs in all possible areas of professional or vocational work, but in those it does provide the preparation must be excellent."<sup>11</sup><br><br>Note the verb <i>must--</i>not <i>should.</i> Again, the commitment to excellence is an expectation, not an aspiration. President Oaks further stated in his inaugural address:<br><br><i>We cannot use success in attaining our spiritual goals . . . as an alibi for failure to enjoy first-class status as a university. We must reinforce our drive for excellence in all areas of the university and persist for superiority in some. </i><sup>12</sup><br><br>This commitment to excellence is not limited to the academic part of our endeavor. As the next section of the mission statement makes clear, no one is excused from that commitment: "All instruction, programs, and services at BYU, including a wide variety of extracurricular experiences, should make their own contribution"<sup>13</sup> to our overarching goal. Just as our graduates "should be capable of competing with the best in their fields,"<sup>14</sup> our grounds crew should be as good as there is--likewise our physical facilities group, our financial services personnel, and all other important support groups. Each must have the same commitment to excellence in its area. And our athletic programs and our performing groups should aspire to be as good as the best in their fields. "All" means all--not some.<br><br>Third, the end of all we do--both the intensive learning and the other activities that enhance the student's experience--is not just to prepare students for their first job or professional career, nor even to enjoy and appreciate their mortal experience more fully, which are the very worthwhile goals of many other universities. At the end of the day, we have a distinctive, even unique, end in mind.<br><br>We are to pursue "the full realization of human potential" of our students. And our view of that potential is, indeed, unique. As we know from "The Family: A Proclamation to the World":<br><br><i>All human beings . . . are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny. </i><sup>15</sup><br><br>Quoting Elder Oaks once again, "Our reason for <i>being</i> is to be a university. But our reason for <i>being a university </i>is to encourage and prepare young men and women to rise to their full spiritual potential as sons and daughters of God."<sup>16</sup><br><br>Keeping in mind that broader context, the mission statement outlines the "four major educational goals"<sup>17</sup> we have for our students. The curricular aspects of those goals are outlined in the topic sentences of the three middle paragraphs of the mission statement:<br><br>1. "All students at BYU should be taught the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ."<br><br>2. "Because the gospel encourages the pursuit of all truth, students at BYU should receive a broad university education."<br><br>3. "In addition to a strong general education, students should also receive instruction in the special fields of their choice."<sup>18</sup><br><br>While there is much that could be extracted from these sentences and their accompanying paragraphs, let me emphasize just two points for today's purposes. First, notice the sequence. The first and foundational part of the curriculum consists of the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ. That certainly includes the doctrine of the Church and the truths taught in modern and ancient scripture. But it is not enough to offer--or even require--our students to take courses in religious education. If the only insights that students receive on gospel truths are in their religion classes, we will not be that different from other good universities to which an institute of religion is attached. What will truly make us unique--and what we must uniquely do well--is to meet the challenge set forth by President Spencer W. Kimball:<br><br><i>That every professor and teacher in this institution would keep his</i> [or her] <i>subject matter bathed in the light and color of the restored gospel and have all his</i> [or her] <i>subject matter perfumed lightly with the spirit of the gospel. </i><sup>19</sup><br><br>Brother Maeser established the tone early on. In his final address as principal of Brigham Young Academy, he noted that when<br><br><i>the words of President Brigham Young--that neither the alphabet nor the multiplication table was to be taught without the Spirit of God--were given as the mainspring of all teaching, the orientation for the course of the educational system inaugurated by the foundation of this academy was made, and any deviation from it would lead inevitably to disastrous results. </i><sup>20</sup><br><br>The second point is related to the first. We pursue the expanded knowledge characterized as "a broad university education" or "a strong general education" not so that our students will be able to engage in intelligent conversation on a variety of topics but "because the gospel encourages the pursuit of all truth." Our curricular choice to require general education is not motivated solely by a desire to imitate the best universities but by the firm doctrinal teaching that the acquisition of such knowledge is a gospel imperative. And it is a gospel imperative because such knowledge prepares us for our ultimate destiny--to become like our heavenly parents. As Orson Pratt put it:<br><br><i>The study of science is the study of something eternal. If we study astronomy, we study the works of God. If we study chemistry, geology, optics, or any other branch of science, every new truth we come to the understanding of is eternal; it is a part of the great system of universal truth. It is truth that exists throughout universal nature; and God is the dispenser of all truth--scientific, religious, and political. </i><sup>21</sup><br><br>While there are other portions of the mission statement we might profitably consider in more detail, and while each of those portions is as important as the ones I have discussed, this brief review of some of the sections gives us enough of a feel for the kind of student learning and development that we hope our students experience and that we hope to enhance with our actions. It is, as our BYU aims document puts it, an educational experience that is "(1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building, leading to (4) lifelong learning and service."<sup>22</sup><br><br>One way to summarize this is to put some of the key principles from the mission statement and aims document into visual form. The mission statement indicates that each of our students should receive an education that is broad--one covering the arts, letters, and sciences. You might think of that as a line going across in a horizontal plane.<br><br><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10398" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/jpg/worthen_1.jpg" alt="worthen_1" width="270" height="200" /><br><br>The mission statement also indicates that, in addition, they should receive in-depth instruction in a specialized field of their choice. This T-shaped learning<sup>23</sup> reflecting the breadth and depth of a good college education is similar to that offered by many other great universities.<br><br><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10399" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/jpg/worthen_2.jpg" alt="worthen_2" width="270" height="200" /><br><br>And while it is a necessary part of the unique educational experience we are to provide our students, it is not by itself sufficient to achieve our more ambitious aim of helping them realize their full divine potential. In order to do that, we have to ensure that the educational process is spiritually strengthening.<br><br><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10400" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/jpg/worthen_3.jpg" alt="worthen_3" width="270" height="200" /><br><br>Notice that this important component covers all the knowledge we are conveying. It is not an appendage to the general or specialized curriculum; it is an essential part of every aspect of the learning process.<br><br>Finally, the education will not be complete until the key principles are cemented into the character of our students--until the learning becomes part of who they are.<br><br><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10401" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/jpg/worthen_4.jpg" alt="worthen_4" width="270" height="200" /><br><br>If we achieve the full aims of our mission, what starts out looking like the kind of education that is provided by other great universities takes on a distinctive and--eventually, I might suggest--unique shape:<br><br><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10402" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/jpg/worthen_5.jpg" alt="worthen_5" width="270" height="200" /><br><br>In a sense then, our own iconic symbol can convey the kind of unique educational experience we hope to provide to our students. We might say that the letter <i>Y</i> explains why--W-H-Y--we exist and what we hope to accomplish.<br><br>The photograph of new freshmen forming the Y in today's <i>Universe</i> then takes on new meaning, reminding us that the students are the Y and the why.<br><br><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10404" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/gif/students-in-block-Y.gif" alt="students-in-block-Y" width="288" height="265" /><br><br><sup><i>Photography by Jaren Wilkey</i></sup><br><br>And now we reach the critical stage of the discussion--the portion that President Boyd K. Packer often calls the "therefore, what?" part.<sup>24</sup> What do these concepts in the mission statement mean to each of us individually? What do I hope you take away from this meeting? There are two things in particular--both of them fairly simple but, I think, fairly impactful.<br><br>First, I hope all will understand that each of us has a role to play in carrying out the mission that has been set for us by the BYU Board of Trustees. The mission statement assumes that all members of the BYU community will make their own contribution to the mission--not just at a secondary support level but also in the actual learning process. We tend to think of that domain as belonging exclusively to the faculty, but the mission statement makes it clear that not just formal instruction but all programs and all services "should make their own contribution." And this contribution is not limited just to the indirect kind of contribution to learning that is made by keeping the classrooms clean and functional or providing food in between classes. Each individual is to make his or her own contribution directly to the kind of learning experience that leads to "the balanced development of the total person."<sup>25</sup><br><br>More of you than you realize may be involved in the intensive learning process. Speaking of his university experience, when he worked part-time on the grounds and cleaning crews, President Henry B. Eyring observed:<br><br><i>Physics taught me to understand the changes occurring in the world at large. But the things I learned as a groundskeeper and a janitor were worth more in working with the Brethren. Among those is the expectation that you know your duty thoroughly, you do more than you're asked, and you do it in a way that doesn't stand out. </i><sup>26</sup><br><br>Second, once you realize you have a role, ask yourself repeatedly the key questions "What is that role?" and "How can I perform it better?" There are a variety of things that might be done to get answers to those questions. Let me suggest a couple.<br><br>First, become more familiar with the mission statement. You have been provided with copies of it and the aims document today. I urge each of you to read it and to reread it, even if you have read it many times before. As you do so, consider ways in which what you do can enhance the student experience and then strive to do that better.<br><br>Second--and this goes in tandem with rereading the mission and aims documents--seek inspiration. I firmly believe that through prayerful study you will receive insights that will improve not only your individual efforts but also, in some cases, the institution itself. I am convinced that many if not most of the ideas that will greatly improve the university in the coming years will not come from task forces impaneled by the central administration with a top-down agenda; instead they will come from individual departments, bringing to light concepts and practices that will benefit not just those departments or units but the entire university. Many of the current university-wide programs that benefit thousands of students originated in the minds and practices of individual faculty and staff.<br><br>The potential results of these kinds of efforts are spelled out in the last sentence of the mission statement:<br><br><i>We believe the earnest pursuit of this institutional mission can have a strong effect on the course of higher education and will greatly enlarge Brigham Young University's influence in a world we wish to improve. </i><sup>27</sup><br><br>Note the difference in the two key verbs. The earnest pursuit of this mission <i>can</i> have a positive impact on the course of higher education. I believe it likely that some of the ideas we generate here will ripple throughout other universities in positive ways. But the mission statement describes that impact only in terms of possibilities.<br><br>By contrast, the other result of our earnest pursuit of this inspired mission seems more certain. It "<i>will</i> greatly enlarge" the influence of the university, not just in the realm of higher education but also in the world at large.<br><br>Let me cite one of many examples I could give of how this may occur. This particular example also demonstrates how some of the distinctive ways in which we do things prepares our graduates to compete "with the best in their fields," as the mission statement challenges us to do.<br><br>A year ago a story in the <i>New York Times Magazine--</i>headlined "When Hollywood Wants Good, Clean Fun, It Goes to Mormon Country"--highlighted the work of the BYU Center for Animation, which operates under the direction of three colleges: the Ira A. Fulton College of Engineering and Technology, the College of Fine Arts and Communications, and the College of Physical and Mathematical Sciences.<br><br>The author of the article, Jon Mooallem, first described the type of animated short films that BYU students have produced during the last fourteen years. He then stated:<br><br><i>Those films have consistently racked up student Emmys and student Academy Awards. They've played at Cannes and Sundance. Most important, they've impressed recruiters. Out of nowhere, BYU--a Mormon university owned and operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints--has become a farm team for the country's top animation studios and effects companies. Unlikely as it sounds, young Mormons are being sucked out of the middle of Utah and into the very centers of American pop-culture manufacturing.</i><sup>28</sup><br><br>Now he might have said they are prepared to compete "with the best in their fields"--the terms used in the mission statement.<br><br>Mooallem continued, describing what I would call the influence these graduates can have on the world:<br><br><i>The BYU program is designed to be a . . . kind of ethical counterweight: it's trying to unleash values-oriented filmmakers into the industry who can inflect its sensibility. "Without being preachy about it,"</i> [Professor R. Brent] <i>Adams told me, "if we can add something to the culture that makes people think about being better human beings--more productive, more kind, more forgiving--that's what we want to do."</i><sup>29</sup><br><br>Mooallem continued:<br><br><i>At first I struggled to understand the specifics of that mission. Everyone talked about wanting to make "clean movies" or "movies I wouldn't be afraid to take my mother to," but these phrases were shibboleths, loaded and tough to pin down. It wasn't simply a matter of avoiding sex and violence. . . . There was, instead, a fixation on whether you walked away from the movie feeling uplifted. That question superseded everything, even the usual genre and age-demographic lines.</i><sup>30</sup><br><br>The world--at least the animation world--is noticing the difference.<br><br>Mooallem went on to say:<br><br><i>The industry has found a new breed of employee in Utah. One recruiter from Sony Animation Pictures described the typical BYU grad as . . . equipped with "a different mind-set." In most animation programs, each student leads production on his or her own film. But at BYU, everyone works as a team on a single film because, unlike at art schools, students are too busy with religion courses and other requirements to be full-time filmmakers. Out of necessity, production on each year's film winds up mirroring the way the industry actually works. BYU students emerge committed to a specialty and to collaboration--prepared for an entry-level job. </i><sup>31</sup><br><br>Notice how our distinctiveness, religion courses, and "other requirements"--which might include ward or family responsibilities--caused the BYU Animation Center to do things in a different way that turns out to be a better way.<br><br>Returning to the story:<br><br><i>"Honestly," says Marilyn Friedman, the former head of outreach at DreamWorks, who visited BYU frequently, "the first few times I went to Provo, I was like: What am I doing here? I'm a little Jewish girl from back East. But I was just amazed by how absolutely lovely those kids are. They couldn't be nicer, humbler, more respectful. It's a pleasure. And when they come here, they stay that way."</i><sup>32</sup><br><br>The author of the article added:<br><br><i>Many of the students I met in Provo grew up in insular Mormon communities. They came from what's dismissed as flyover country. They don't smoke or drink, and I noticed that one faculty member, for example, kept saying, "Holy schnikeys!" whenever he wanted to curse. And yet creative types in Hollywood kept raving to me about how much "more worldly" these Mormons were than the moody, Gen Y art-school grads coming out of New York and Los Angeles and how grateful they were to have them onboard. This cut against so many different stereotypes--of Mormons, of Hollywood, of tortured artsy kids--and at the oddest angles. By coincidence, it seemed, Mormon culture was grooming its young people to be ideal employees of the same industry it predisposed them to be wary of.</i><sup>33</sup><br><br>Mooallem concluded with an observation that may prove prophetic:<br><br><i>I kept being reminded that BYU's program was only 13 years old: most of the moral emissaries that it has been pouring into the industry are still climbing to the positions from which they'll be able to truly influence a film's tone and content. One day there will be alumni directing and producing, students insisted--it's an inevitability. "Right now we're the workhorses," an alumnus at DreamWorks told me. "But I think our future is bright in terms of being able to shape the industry."</i><sup>34</sup><br><br>What an example of how "the earnest pursuit of this institutional mission . . . will greatly enlarge Brigham Young University's influence in a world we wish to improve."<br><br>I close with observations about two key parts of the first sentence of the mission statement that I rushed by in my earlier remarks. I skipped them not because they are not important but precisely because they are, and I wanted to highlight them.<br><br>First, note that even though the mission statement focuses on students, the broad mission of the university is to assist "individuals" in their quest for perfection and eternal life. Given the student-centric nature of the mission statement and the educational enterprise in which we are engaged, I would have expected that phrase to read, "assist <i>students</i>in their quest for perfection and eternal life." But the mission statement uses the broader term <i>individuals.</i> To me this suggests that while our efforts ought to be focused on the students and what happens to them, the results of that focus may assist others in their quest for perfection and eternal life. Let me cite as one example the experience of one of our lesser-known founders.<br><br>I must confess that until I had an office on the third floor of the ASB, I thought that Karl G. Maeser was the first academic leader of this institution. While Maeser is rightly credited with being one of its key founders, he was not the first principal of Brigham Young Academy, as many of you know. I learned this early in my tenure as advancement vice president when I walked down the hall and saw pictures of the presidents of BYU ending with President Cecil O. Samuelson but beginning, much to my surprise, not with Karl G. Maeser but with Warren Dusenberry, who was the principal of Brigham Young Academy during what was called its experimental term from January 3, 1876, to April 15 of that year--a period of only four months, not much longer than I have been in office.<br><br>Warren Dusenberry was born in 1836 in Pennsylvania.<sup>35</sup> When he was five years old, his family moved to an area near Hannibal, Missouri, where, five years later, his mother, Aurilla, joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. His father, Mahlon, did not join his wife in that action, and neither did Warren or his brother Wilson. In April 1860, when Warren was twenty-three years old, the Dusenberry family made their way to California. After two years there, Aurilla and Mahlon reached the breaking point over religion, and she left for Utah with Warren, Wilson, and their two sisters.<sup>36</sup> Mahlon's instruction to his son Wilson was to keep himself "free from the curse of Mormonism."<sup>37</sup><br><br>Although he was not a member of the Church, Warren's first job in Provo was as a teacher in the First Ward School, with classes conducted in the basement of the original tabernacle.<sup>38</sup> Focusing as he did on the well-being of the students, Warren invested fifty dollars of his own money to buy textbooks for the first school.<sup>39</sup><br><br>Wilson sometimes substituted for his brother and recorded in his journal some of what he called the "botherations"<sup>40</sup> of teaching in a pioneer town. After one particularly trying day, he wrote, "The little brats were determined on having a spree. [I] checked their cheer a little, however."<sup>41</sup><br><br>In the fall of 1863 the brothers decided to start their own school, which in later years many viewed as the real predecessor of Brigham Young Academy. The brothers were "the only teachers, administrators, and janitors"<sup>42</sup> of the new Dusenberry School. The finances were so tight that they were forced to live at the school, at first sleeping on the floor.<sup>43</sup> When after several months they acquired a bed, Wilson recorded his one-word reaction in his journal: "Wonderful!" 44<br><br>The financial strain eventually grew too heavy, and the brothers closed the school after two years.<sup>45</sup> The school reopened four years later in 1869,<sup>46</sup> and shortly thereafter it became the Timpanogos Branch of the University of Deseret, with Warren operating as the principal.<sup>47</sup> The school stayed afloat for six years, until financial problems once again caused the school to go under in 1875. It was in April of that year that Wilson wrote a letter to Brigham Young informing him that they could not go on without some additional financial help.<sup>48</sup> In response, President Young informed them that he would not sustain their school because he had decided to endow a new institution of learning, and Warren set to work drawing up some plans.<sup>49</sup><br><br>In the fall of 1875 President Young established Brigham Young Academy, and Warren was appointed as its first principal.<sup>50</sup> The appointment was from the outset intended to be temporary, as Warren had over time become involved in other activities.<sup>51</sup> As planned, he resigned after the 1876 spring experimental term to make way for Karl G. Maeser.<sup>52</sup><br><br>Warren and Wilson Dusenberry dedicated eight years of their lives to the education of youth in Provo, sacrificing their means, their time, and their comfort "toward the balanced development of the total person." As Warren and Wilson focused on the well-being of their students, their attitude toward them changed. Whereas early on Wilson described the students as "botherations" and "brats" whose cheer needed to be checked, he later recorded, "Who can teach school without forming ties of affection? Not I."<sup>53</sup> The Dusenberrys' capacity to take joy from seeing students grow had increased because of their focus on the well-being of their students.<br><br>But their association with the students and others in the community had an even more fundamental impact on them. On July 24, 1864, during their first year of teaching in Provo, Warren told Wilson that he was ready to be baptized, and both of them were--on that very day.<sup>54</sup><br><br>Among those individuals whose quest for perfection and eternal life were aided by the educational efforts of Warren and Wilson Dusenberry, none was affected more profoundly than the Dusenberrys themselves.<br><br>That may be the case with us as well. The "individuals" whose quest for perfection and eternal life is assisted by our efforts at BYU may include not only the students who attend here but also those who are changed by their interaction with those students now and in the future, including ourselves.<br><br>Finally, there is the phrase in the mission statement that we too often completely skip over: "founded, supported, and guided by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints."<sup>55</sup> As important as it is to remind ourselves constantly that students are the focus of our efforts, it is equally important to always remember the source of not only our founding and our funding but also our direction.<br><br>We are blessed to be led by those who are prophets, seers, and revelators. It was the inspiration given to such individuals, starting with Brigham Young, that has brought us to this point. And it will be their inspiration and vision that will guide us in the future. We will fulfill our mission only to the extent that we accept and follow that guidance. As the mission statement says, "To succeed in this mission the university must provide an environment enlightened by living prophets."<sup>56</sup><br><br>Along the way, those living prophets have provided us glimpses of the destiny of this place. You are familiar with them from Brigham Young and John Taylor and onward. I close with one of my favorites, from President Spencer W. Kimball:<br><br><i>I am both hopeful and expectant that from this university there will rise brilliant stars in drama, literature, music, art, science, and all the scholarly graces. This university can be the refining host for many such individuals who in the future, long after they have left this campus, can lift and inspire others around the globe. . . .</i><br><br><em>As previous First Presidencies have said, we say again to you: "We expect--we do not merely hope--that Brigham Young University will become a leader among the great universities of the world." To that expectation I would add, "Remain a unique university in all the world!" Then, in the process of time, this truly will become the fully recognized university of the Lord about which so much has been spoken in the past.</em><sup>57</sup><br><br>May we go forward in this great cause with energy, enthusiasm, and inspiration. I bear my witness that Heavenly Father is aware of our efforts. He is interested in our efforts, both for our benefit and for that of our students. If we will but focus in on what our mission is, we will be blessed to raise the stature of the university and, more important, affect the lives of thousands of our students. I bear you that witness in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Kevin J Worthen was president of Brigham Young University when this address was given at the BYU annual university conference on 26 August 2014.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1>ned, Uplifted, and Changed - Kevin J Worthen - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
During his final address as principal of Brigham Young Academy, Karl G. Maeser gave this wise counsel:<br><br><i>There are two periods in a man's labors when circumstances seem to dictate . . . the advisability of making as few words as possible: they are at the beginning and at the end of his work.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>George Washington apparently shared the same sentiment, as his second inaugural address consisted of only 135 words.<sup>2</sup><br><br>Following the example of these outstanding leaders, I will be relatively brief. I emphasize "relatively" because I am, by training, a lawyer--one of a group of people who often speak as if they were paid by the word. So don't expect me to match Washington's brevity. I want you to get your money's worth.<br><br>Let me begin with expressions of appreciation, starting with my wife, Peggy, who has not only stood by my side but has also often propped me up as we have shared so many wonderful adventures these past thirty-six years. I think it is safe to say that she did not envision that we would ever be in this position when she agreed to marry me. But no one has been more supportive or had more impact on my success than has she.<br><br>I also express appreciation to the members of the board of trustees, whose confidence in me bolsters my own confidence. We are truly blessed to be led by inspired men and women whose lives of consecration and service provide such clear examples of what we hope our students become.<br><br>Finally, I thank those who have sacrificed so much to make BYU the outstanding university that it is, including especially the twelve individuals who have preceded me as leaders of this institution. I am particularly indebted to the past five--Presidents Oaks, Holland, Lee, Bateman, and Samuelson--each of whom has had a profound impact not only on this university but also on me personally. I will never feel comfortable being considered in the same category as these remarkable men, but I will always feel grateful for the extraordinary institutional leadership and personal mentoring they have provided.<br><br>As a result of the efforts of these outstanding leaders and the prophets who have guided them through the decades, the direction of Brigham Young University is firmly set. It is clearly stated in our mission statement. We are "to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life" by providing "a period of intensive learning" that includes not just "the arts, letters, and sciences" but also "the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ."<sup>3</sup><br><br>What some consider to be a dubious effort to demonstrate "that faith in the Almighty can accompany and enrich scholarship in the secular" is, as President Gordon B. Hinckley observed, "more than an experiment [at BYU]. It is an accomplishment."<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/gordon-b-hinckley_remarks-inauguration-president-cecil-o-samuelson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>4</sup></a> We have posted our colors to that mast and are fully committed to that cause with a faculty and student body who are better prepared than ever to achieve that goal.<br><br>Given the clear direction provided by our mission statement, the question for us is how we can best move this important work forward at this time. My answer is simple: by going to the mountains.<br><br>One of the first things that many visitors to this university notice is the presence of the majestic mountains that rise dramatically to the east of our campus. The program and posters for this inauguration contain a painting of one of those mountains--Y Mountain, as it is known. A rendering of that mountain is also on the back side of the medallion that was just placed around my neck. I chose that particular feature as a kind of personal symbol for my tenure as president. I did so in part because of the iconic block Y on that mountain. As I explained to the faculty, staff, and administration at our recent annual university conference, the block Y can remind us of the unique education that we are to provide to our students--one that is broad, deep, spiritual, and character building. But the large block Y is only part of the reason I chose Y Mountain as a symbol. I also chose it because it is a mountain. And mountains are good symbols of the kind of educational process that I hope occurs here.<br><br>The link between education and mountains was observed by Henry David Thoreau more than 150 years ago. After spending time in the mountains near Williams College in western Massachusetts, Thoreau stated:<br><br><i>It would be no small advantage if every college were . . . located at the base of a mountain, as good at least as one well-endowed professorship. . . . Some will remember, no doubt, not only that they went to the college, but that they went to the mountain.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>Thoreau's observation was not just a plea to include physical activity as part of a well-rounded curriculum. For Thoreau, mountains were places where people could be "elevated and . . . etherealized."<sup>6</sup> <i>Etherealize</i> is not a word we use often. It means "to refine, exalt, or spiritualize (something)."<sup>7</sup> Mountains are thus locations where people can be enlightened, uplifted, and changed.<br><br>The learning process to which we are committed should do the same. It should be education that elevates and etherealizes. That doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, so I don't expect it to catch on as a phrase here. But it describes well the kind of education I hope we provide at Brigham Young University in the coming years, and I hope the mountains that surround us will be reminders of that aspiration.<br><br>The general pattern for this type of learning process can be seen by reviewing what the scriptures teach about the role mountain settings play in God's interaction with His children.<br><br>First, mountains are places of instruction--places to learn new things. It was on the mountain that Nephi received instruction on how to build a ship,<sup>8</sup> a task he had never engaged in previously. And the brother of Jared came to understand new ways of lighting ships while "upon the top of the mount."<sup>9</sup><br><br>Similarly, our classrooms, labs, offices, and other settings in which learning occurs must be places of instruction at the highest level. Students and faculty alike should ascend high enough in their disciplines to think new thoughts and to find new ways to make things better.<br><br>That will require strenuous effort. As President James E. Faust observed when addressing law students:<br><br><i>Do not expect your professor . . . to concentrate his lessons out of the scriptures, although occasionally he may wish to do so. His obligation is to teach you the secular rules of . . . law. . . . Your obligation is to learn the rules of law. . . . The whisperings of the Holy Spirit will no doubt help you, but you must learn the rules . . . using Churchill's phrase, by "blood, sweat, and tears."</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>You see, climbing mountains is hard work.<br><br>Second, mountains are places of spiritual communication and revelation. On more than one occasion the Savior went to the mountain to pray, including before He called His apostles.<sup>11</sup> The grand revelation in which God provided "an account of this earth, and the inhabitants thereof"<sup>12</sup> to Moses was given "in the mount."<sup>13</sup> Spiritual insights often come in mountain settings.<br><br>In like manner, we must go to the mountains spiritually if we are to obtain an elevated and ethereal education. It is not enough to gain learning by study; we must also live our lives in such a way that we--both students and faculty--are able to receive inspiration directly from God. That requires adherence to both the spirit and letter of the Honor Code--which was designed not just to distinguish us from other universities but to prepare us for elevated forms of learning.<br><br>Finally, mountains are places of transfiguration--places where individuals are transformed and changed in significant ways. Moses was visibly different after he had spoken with the Lord in the mountain.<sup>14</sup> And one elevated place in the Holy Land is known as the Mount of Transfiguration because of the increased light that emanated from the Savior's countenance when He ascended there with some of His apostles.<sup>15</sup><br><br>Likewise, the education we provide here should change the students in significant ways. In the long run, the learning process will not be complete unless it becomes ingrained in their character, unless it becomes part of who they are. We need to provide an education that allows our students not just to learn new things and to experience spiritual insights but to become different, better people--to be etherealized, if you will.<br><br>So that is the kind of education we aspire to provide: the type of life-changing education that can take an inexperienced and insecure young man from the coal mines of Carbon County--whose sole and futile aspiration growing up was to be a pro basketball player and who never dreamed of being a university professor--and prepare that kind of individual intellectually and spiritually to become, by some unlikely miracle, the president of one of the greatest universities in America. Elevated and etherealized indeed.<br><br>It is no coincidence that Brigham Young University was established in this mountain location. It is a partial fulfillment of prophecy proclaimed by Isaiah more than 2,500 years ago. Speaking at the inauguration of President Dallin H. Oaks, President Harold B. Lee stated:<br><br><i>Brigham Young University, led by its president, must never forget its role in bringing to reality the ancient prophecy--to build the mountain of the Lord's house in the tops of the mountains, so great and so glorious that all nations may come to this place and be constrained to say, "Show us your way that we may walk therein." (See Isaiah 2:2–3.)</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/merrill-j-bateman_pioneer-roots-world-class-worldwide-institution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>16</sup></a><br><br>As we ascend to the tops of the mountains in these ways as a university, we will discover that new peaks lie ahead. As imposing as Y Mountain may seem from its base, it is not the tallest mountain to the east of campus. As you reach the summit of that mountain, you realize there are higher mountains behind it. And so it is for us. As we elevate ourselves intellectually, spiritually, and in character-building ways, we will encounter new and exciting challenges and opportunities that we have not seen before. As President Spencer W. Kimball explained some thirty years ago:<br><br><i>It should be obvious to us all that the ultimate future of BYU is partially hidden from our immediate view. Until we have climbed the hills just ahead, we cannot glimpse what lies beyond. And the hills ahead are higher than we think. We cannot be transported over them without meeting demanding challenges. . . . You will not always be able to see the future, but by drawing close to our Heavenly Father, you will be guided.</i><sup>17</sup><br><br>So, to the mountains we go. The climb will be challenging, but it will also be exhilarating, elevating, and, yes, ethereal. May we move ever upward in that endeavor is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Kevin J Worthen was the president of Brigham Young University when this address was delivered at his inauguration on 9 September 2014.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1> of Learners - President Henry B. Eyring - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am grateful to be with you as we celebrate the inauguration of President Kevin J Worthen as the new leader of this great university. He will help move it upward on a steady path of progress that his distinguished predecessors have marked and followed. He is particularly well prepared and suited to this task.<br><br>A precious preparation was to have President Cecil O. Samuelson as an inspired mentor. We honor President and Sister Samuelson today. President Samuelson was and is an example of the educational ideals fixed at the heart of this university when it was founded.<br><br>President Worthen, from his long experience as a student, a teacher, and an effective leader here at this university, knows and honors its roots. Its founder, President Brigham Young, set its course based on an inspired view of education. One line captures the vigor of his view. It is a message to all in this enterprise of learning, and it describes the effect that the leadership of President Worthen will have on those who study, teach, and serve here. This leadership will "put forth your ability to learn as fast as you can, and gather all the strength of mind and principle of faith you possibly can, and then distribute your knowledge to the people" (<i>JD</i> 8:146).<br><br>For President Worthen that view has permeated his own life, and it will guide his leadership here. This is a vibrant and determined community of learners and lifters. Students, faculty, and staff here are driven by a desire and a strength of mind to learn as fast as they can.<br><br>Their confidence that they can and must improve springs from their faith that they are children of God--who knows all truth and will prosper their efforts to find it. And it comes from a faith that by the Spirit of Christ they can recognize what is good and true.<br><br>It goes beyond learning for ourselves. The vision at the founding was that all here will seek truth not for themselves alone but will also distribute what they have learned to bless others. There is a sign at the edge of this campus: "Enter to learn; go forth to serve." That is more than a slogan; it is a main part of the founding vision.<br><br>As President Worthen knows, inspired leaders and teachers here have made it possible for students to begin to serve with what they have learned while they are still here. They don't wait to graduate to become colleagues in the role of teachers. Many of the faculty include students in their own efforts to learn by inviting them to participate as partners in their own studies.<br><br>In fairness, that is neither new nor unique to Brigham Young University. But here that view of students as colleagues is in its very nature. Everyone is a learner and everyone is a mentor. All can share in the faith that with God's help they can learn, and then they can help others learn, grow, and change for the better.<br><br>President Worthen and his predecessors have been masters at maintaining and nurturing a shared vision of learning, teaching, and serving that has shaped this university.<br><br>It has not been easy to do here. There is much to distract us. President Worthen will find his time almost consumed by administrative details; seeing visitors; even having lunch, as he will today with me; and attending to the crises that people may say demand his attention. But in the midst of what may at times seem a tumult, he will be carried back to the view that is the heart of this university by the joy he has always found in being a determined learner and a mentor of other children of God.<br><br>That view will guide him as he deals with administrative decisions. He will also be asking himself and others, as he considers alternative recommendations, "Is there a way to strengthen the determination of all who study and serve here to learn, to increase their faith, and to move them to serve others better?" And with such a view President Worthen will be calm and wise when faced with the challenges that will come.<br><br>He will move quickly and confidently to help individuals in need. But he will be at peace about the university itself because it and those who study here and teach here are on the course set and maintained by the long line of those who have served before him. He will then find himself saying quietly in the face of what appear to be crises, "Things will work out."<br><br>On behalf of the Brigham Young University Board of Trustees and all who love and have loved this university, I say to President Worthen and to his wife, Peggy, "Welcome. We love you. And Godspeed."<br><br>I give you my solemn witness that I have seen the hand of the Lord guiding and prospering this great university. God the Father lives, as does His resurrected Son, our Savior Jesus Christ. They have been and always will be attentive to the needs of all who study and serve others here and who go on learning and serving others over their lifetimes and beyond. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Henry B.

<h1>ting Spiritual Stability - Dale G. Renlund - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Let me begin by relating an obscure historical event, and then I will draw out some lessons that can be learned from this remote maritime misfortune.<br><br>In the early seventeenth century, Sweden was a world power. Sweden's king, Gustav II Adolf, commissioned a warship that would be christened the <i>Vasa.</i> The ship represented a substantial outlay of resources, particularly the oak from which the vessel would be built. Oak was so valuable that cutting down an oak tree without authorization was a capital offense. Gustav Adolf closely oversaw the construction process, attempting to ensure that the <i>Vasa</i> would fully realize his expectations.<br><br>After construction had begun, Gustav Adolf ordered the <i>Vasa</i> to be made longer. Because the width supports had already been built from precious oak, the king directed the builders to increase the ship's length without increasing its width. Although the shipwrights knew that doing so would compromise the <i>Vasa</i>'s seaworthiness, they were hesitant to tell the king something they knew he did not want to hear. They complied. Gustav Adolf also insisted that this ship have not simply the customary single deck of guns but cannons on three decks, with the heaviest cannons on the upper deck. Again, against their better judgment, the shipwrights complied.<br><br>Over the course of several years, shipwrights, carpenters, rope makers, and others worked diligently to build the <i>Vasa.</i> Over one thousand oak trees were used to complete the ship. It had sixty-four cannons and masts taller than 150 feet. To give the ship the opulence befitting a king's flagship, several hundred gilded and painted sculptures were added.<br><br>On August 10, 1628, the <i>Vasa</i> began its maiden voyage. In view of countless spectators, the ship left its mooring directly below the royal castle in Stockholm. After being pulled along by anchors for the first several hundred feet, the <i>Vasa</i> left the shelter of the harbor. A stronger wind entered its sails, and the ship began to tip. The <i>Vasa</i> righted itself slightly, but only temporarily. Before long, as recorded by an observer, "she heeled right over and water gushed in through the gun ports until she slowly went to the bottom under sail, pennants and all."<sup>1</sup> The <i>Vasa</i>'s maiden voyage was about 4,200 feet.<br><br>The <i>Vasa</i> rested at the bottom of the Baltic Sea until it was recovered three centuries later in 1961. It was successfully raised from the seabed and towed back to Stockholm. Today the <i>Vasa</i> rests in a temperature- and humidity-controlled museum in Djurgården, an island in central Stockholm. I have a model of the ship in my office at Church headquarters as a reminder of several lessons that underlie its short, tragic history.<br><br>Despite the <i>Vasa</i>'s magnificent appearance, the ship was not seaworthy. The alterations in its construction resulted in it not having sufficient lateral stability to enable safe seafaring. Gustav Adolf's desire for an extravagant status symbol ruined the design of what would have been a magnificent sailing vessel, the mightiest warship of its time. The shipbuilders' reluctance to speak up--their fear of the king's displeasure--deprived the king of their knowledge and insight. All involved lost sight of the goals of the enterprise: to protect Sweden and to promote its interests abroad. A ship that attempts to defy the laws of physics is simply a boat that won't float.<br><br>For us to successfully navigate our mortal sojourn, we also need sufficient lateral stability--which is really spiritual stability--to confront crosswinds and crosscurrents, make the necessary turns, and return safely to our heavenly home. There are things we can do to increase our spiritual stability. There are also things we can do to diminish our spiritual stability. As our spiritual stability decreases, we predictably bring consequences on ourselves that could have been avoided. I will touch on four matters that help us build spiritual stability.<br><h2><b>Obeying God's Commandments</b></h2><br>The first is obeying God's commandments. Just as the <i>Vasa</i> was subject to physical laws--even if it was designed by a king--we are all subject to spiritual laws. No one is exempt. We need to obey these spiritual laws, which we refer to as God's commandments.<br><br>Imagine if Gustav Adolf had been frankly informed that building a long, skinny, top-heavy ship ignored a physical law related to lateral stability. Imagine him then saying, in a sullen, adolescent, whiny manner: "That's not fair. I'm the king. I should be able to do whatever I want. You don't understand."<br><br>Working with the physical laws related to lateral stability in the ship's construction might have felt restrictive to Gustav Adolf, but the <i>Vasa</i> would not have sunk before its mission started had it complied with these laws. Instead, it would have had the freedom and flexibility to accomplish what it was intended to do.<br><br>So, too, obedience to God's laws preserves our freedom, flexibility, and ability to achieve our potential. The commandments are not intended to restrict us. Rather, obedience leads to increased spiritual stability and long-term happiness.<br><br>Imagine fighting life's crosscurrents and crosswinds without spiritual stability. There is a reason obedience is the first law of heaven. Obedience is our choice. The Savior made this clear. As stated in the Joseph Smith Translation of Luke 14:28, Jesus directed, "Wherefore, settle this in your hearts, that ye will do the things which I shall teach, and command you."<br><br>It is that simple. Settle it. Decide now to be exactly obedient. As we do so, our spiritual stability will be greatly enhanced. We will avoid squandering God-given resources and making unproductive and destructive detours in our lives.<br><br>In 1980 my wife, daughter, and I moved to Baltimore, Maryland. Soon after our arrival we were invited to a ward party at the home of a member. We were told it was to be a crab feast. We were excited, but we really didn't know what to expect. Our experience with seafood consisted of trout, canned salmon, and pickled herring. As we came to the member's backyard, we saw that newspapers had been spread on picnic tables and steaming bushels filled with red creatures the size of my fist had been dumped out on them.<br><br>My wife, Ruth, asked, "What are these?" referring to the red creatures.<br><br>We were informed that these were Maryland blue crabs, which turn bright red when they are steamed.<br><br>Ruth asked, "How do you catch them?"<br><br>We were told that early that morning, two of the brethren had gone to a butcher shop and purchased a bucket of chicken necks. As you know, chicken necks look like chicken and smell like chicken when cooked, but if that is what you are given for dinner, you will go hungry. The chicken neck consists of bone, tendon, and skin.<br><br>The assigned men had gone out in a skiff on the shallow Chesapeake Bay. In water about eight feet deep, they began the process of catching a crab. They tied a chicken neck to a string, dropped it into the water, and allowed it to settle on the sandy ocean floor. Sensing a potential feast, a crab scurried along the bottom and grabbed the chicken neck with its big claw. The men then slowly and steadily began pulling on the string. The crab held on to the chicken neck, and just as it was about to breach the surface of the bay, the crab became agitated and let go. But by that time the men had placed a small net under the crab. They took it out of the water and flung it into the boat. And, voilà: ward dinner!<br><br>Ruth said, "So, that's it? There's no hook? There's no rod? There's no reel?"<br><br>"That's right," they replied.<br><br>She said, "The crab could let go at any time?"<br><br>"Right."<br><br>"But they don't?"<br><br>"No," was the reply.<br><br>Ruth summed up this newfound knowledge by saying, "Boy, are those crab stupid!"<br><br>If you were writing a pamphlet called <i>For the Strength of Young Crabs,</i> it would be pretty short, wouldn't it? It would say, "Lay off the chicken necks! They are a trap. Don't be fooled."<br><br>There are many chicken necks in the world: things that look enticing, things that look like a veritable feast, and things that seem worth a minor detour. But if we take that detour, we will, like the prodigal in the parable, experience a fleeting paroxysm of enjoyment followed by degradation ranging from slight to abysmal and misery ranging from small to unutterable before coming to ourselves and recognizing the mistake. The mistake is that these detours are traps.<br><br>We can look at each commandment separately and decide whether to obey or not, rationalize disobedience or not, or we can simply settle it in our hearts that we will do the things that the Lord teaches and commands. Nothing will increase spiritual stability more. Nothing will give us greater freedom to accomplish our life's mission. "Faithfulness and obedience" are not only "the marks of true discipleship"; they are "the requisites of true freedom."<sup>2</sup><br><h2><b>Heeding Counsel and Becoming Lifelong Learners</b></h2><br>Second, we need to pay attention and give heed to counsel we receive from trusted sources and commit ourselves to becoming lifelong determined learners. Sometimes we can become like Gustav Adolf, unwilling to listen to counsel from even trusted sources if that counsel does not conform to our biases and desires. We can create an environment that makes others become like the shipbuilders, fearful of giving their best counsel and advice. When we fail to invite and heed counsel from trusted sources, we decrease our spiritual stability and fall into the trap of building a tall, skinny, top-heavy spiritual ship--a boat that won't float.<br><br>President Henry B. Eyring has pointed out that one of the pitfalls of gaining knowledge is the development of hubris,<sup>3</sup> which is the arrogance that can come when we think we know so much that there is nothing left to learn. We have all seen this in individuals who are too certain of their own brilliance. It is really hard to teach a know-it-all. This educational hubris can occur in both students and university professors, in inexperienced as well as experienced Church leaders, and in new converts and longtime members of the Church. It appears that the risk, however, is greater in those with more education and more experience.<br><br>Mindful of this risk and desirous to be a lifelong determined learner, President Eyring said, "I am still a child with lots to learn. Most folks can teach me something."<sup>4</sup> When he extended the call to me to be a General Authority, President Eyring taught me an important lesson. He said that when he hears someone tell a story that he has heard before or use a scripture that he is very familiar with, he asks himself the questions Why is the Lord underlining that for me? and What have I yet to learn from that story or scripture? Likewise, if we wish to increase our spiritual stability, we will be willing to learn and we will be sufficiently humble to accept guidance no matter our age and experience.<br><br>On one occasion I was assigned to accompany Elder Neal A. Maxwell, then of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, to a stake conference. It was marvelous to be with one of the most remarkable gospel teachers of this dispensation. At the conference I gained an insight into how he had developed and magnified what was undoubtedly a God-given gift. As we were driving away from the stake center on Saturday evening, he turned in his seat and asked me, "What could I have done better to teach the principles we taught?"<br><br>I thought he had to be joking. But he kept on grilling me until he extracted from me a comment about some minor thing that might have been slightly unclear. The next day, in the Sunday general session of the stake conference, he clarified that minor thing that I had mentioned. I realized that I was with a humble disciple of Jesus Christ who welcomed counsel, was committed to being a lifelong determined learner, and desired to become better.<br><br>How we receive counsel makes a difference in whether those around us will feel comfortable in giving us counsel. We can become prickly, cantankerous, and defensive, or we can welcome the input, knowing it is given with loving motives and, if taken in the right spirit, will help us learn and improve.<br><br>It really is our choice. We can listen to and heed counsel given to us by Church leaders, especially those we sustain as prophets, seers, and revelators; by parents; and by trusted friends--or not. We can seek to be determined lifelong learners--or not. We can increase our spiritual stability--or not. If we fail to increase our spiritual stability, we will become like the <i>Vasa:</i> a long, skinny, top-heavy ship--a boat that won't float.<br><h2><b>Serving Others</b></h2><br>Third, being outwardly directed, caring about others, and serving others increases our spiritual stability. It is akin to constructing an outrigger for a canoe. Such an outrigger dramatically increases the canoe's lateral stability.<br><br>A desire to help others is paradoxically both a consequence of true conversion and an attribute that helps us remain converted. President Marion G. Romney stated:<br><br><i>Service is not something we endure on this earth so we can earn the right to live in the celestial kingdom. Service is the very fiber of which an exalted life in the celestial kingdom is made.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>Eternity stays in clearer focus when we focus on others as we seek to help Heavenly Father's children in some way. I have always found it much easier to receive inspiration when I am praying to find out how I can help another than when I am simply praying for myself.<br><br>We may believe that at some future point we will be in a better situation to help our fellowman. In reality, now is the time. Having this "fiber" of service become part of who we are is not situational. We are sorely mistaken if we think that at some future point it will be more convenient when we have more time, more money, or more anything to serve others better. Now is the time to begin. Our spiritual stability will instantly improve.<br><br>My father taught my brother, sisters, and me that helping others is a duty, a choice that we make regardless of our own circumstances. My dad was born in northern Finland, outside the town of Jakobstad, which is also known as Pietasaari. He loved Finnish literature, especially the works of a Finnish poet, Johan Ludvig Runeberg. Runeberg had also been born in Jakobstad.<br><br>Dad would quote Finnish literature at night as bedtime stories. These stories were really rather somber. It seemed to us as children that the moral of these stories was to fight valiantly against impossible odds and then die. It was like listening to the book of Job without the happy ending.<br><br>One of Runeberg's poems that we heard over and over told the story of Farmer Paavo. Paavo was a poor peasant farmer who lived with his wife and children in Saarijärvi in the lake region of central Finland. Several years in a row, some combination of the runoff from the spring snowmelt, summer hailstorms, or an early autumn frost killed most of his crop.<br><br>Each time the meager harvest came in, his wife said, "Paavo, Paavo, you unfortunate old man. God has forsaken us."<br><br>Paavo, in turn, said, "Woman, mix bark with the rye flour to make bread so we won't go hungry. I will work harder to drain the marshy fields. God is testing us, but He will provide."<br><br>Every time the crop was destroyed, Paavo directed his wife to double the amount of bark that she mixed into the bread to ward off starvation. Poor Paavo worked even harder. He dug ditches to drain the marsh to decrease his fields' susceptibility to the spring snowmelt and to the exposure of an early autumn frost.<br><br>Finally, Paavo harvested a rich crop. Overjoyed, his wife said, "Paavo, Paavo, these are happy times! It is time to throw away the bark and bake bread made only with the rye."<br><br>But Paavo took his wife's hand and said, "Woman, mix the bread with half bark, for our neighbor's fields have frosted over."<sup>6</sup><br><br>Left unstated in the poem was Paavo's intent to help his devastated, destitute neighbor.<br><br>As I have reread that story as an adult, I have come to understand a little bit better what my dad was trying to teach me and my siblings. Regardless of circumstances, we have a choice. Will we help others or not? We flunk a significant test of mortality if we do not choose to help those in need. And, if we do help, we increase our own spiritual stability. Serving others allows us to express that fiber of which an exalted life in the celestial kingdom is made.<br><h2><b>Making Jesus Christ Our Foundation</b></h2><br>Fourth, finally, and most important, our spiritual stability increases in proportion to the degree to which we establish Jesus Christ as our foundation. The prophet Mormon lamented the change that occurred when his people stopped making Christ their foundation. Of those who abandon the sure moorings of faith in Christ, he stated:<br><br><i>They are led about by Satan, even as chaff is driven before the wind, or as a vessel is tossed about upon the waves, without sail or anchor, or without anything wherewith to steer her; and even as she is, so are they.</i> [Mormon 5:18]<br><br>Without Christ, we are driven like a vessel tossed about upon the waves. We have no power because we have no sail. We have no stability, especially in times of storm, because we have no anchor. We have no direction or purpose because we don't have anything with which to steer.<br><br>If we wish to avoid navigating through life in a long, skinny, top-heavy ship, we must make Christ our foundation and seek His counsel. The ultimate in educational hubris is to believe ourselves to be so wise that we do not need to seek direction from the Lord through the Holy Ghost. Remember, "to be learned is good if [we] hearken unto the counsels of God" (2 Nephi 9:29; see also verse 28).<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>In order to face, overcome, and be prepared for the crosswinds and crosscurrents of life, we must obey God's commandments; become humble, willing, and determined lifelong learners; serve others; and establish Jesus Christ as the foundation of our lives. As we do so we dramatically increase our spiritual stability. Unlike the <i>Vasa,</i> we will be able to return to safe harbor, having fulfilled our destiny.<br><br>Not too long ago, in the central part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ruth and I met with a large number of Latter-day Saints who live in impoverished circumstances. I asked the assembled congregation, "What are your challenges?"<br><br>There was no response. I asked again. Again, there was no response. I asked a third time.<br><br>Finally, an older man stood slowly and asked me in all sincerity, "Elder Renlund, how can we have any challenges? We have the gospel of Jesus Christ."<br><br>Initially I felt like grabbing him and telling him to look around. They had nothing--no electricity and no running water. But then I understood. It is not what they possess that gives them strength; it is what they know. Their commitment to what they know gives them extraordinary spiritual stability. They keep the commandments. They are determined to be lifelong learners of spiritual things. They help each other. And they have Christ as their foundation.<br><br>My dear brothers and sisters, I testify to you that our Redeemer lives. I know that Jesus Christ rose from the tomb. I know that the resurrected Lord, along with God our Heavenly Father, appeared to the Prophet Joseph that day in 1820, just as Joseph said. I know that we are led by God's prophet on the earth today, President Thomas S. Monson. But it is Jesus Christ who directs this work through His prophet and through others whom we sustain as prophets, seers, and revelators. I know that this is true. I pray the richest blessings to be upon you as you go through your mortal sojourn and navigate this challenging, wonderful life. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Dale G.

<br>
<br>
As an adjunct professor who has taught at BYU for several years, I am in awe of this amazing institution that attracts the finest, most extraordinary faculty and stu-dents on the planet.<br><br>I honor you and believe that King Benjamin could have easily been describing you when he said:<br><br><i>And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual.</i> [Mosiah 2:41]<br><br>Yes, you are awesome, and this could be the most important assignment I have ever had as a professional speaker. Consequently, I wanted to be at my best.<br><br>However, as I was getting ready this morning, I noticed that I was losing hair on my head and growing it in my nose and ears and on my back--in places I don't even need it. That is not a fair trade-off. My only hope this morning was that the hair in my right ear would grow long enough so that I could comb it up over the top of my head and fake all of you out! It didn't happen.<br><br>When President Worthen asked me to speak to you today, two life-altering experiences surfaced in my mind, helping me focus my remarks. First, I recently returned from an eighteen-day military tribute tour with my invited guests American Idol finalist/Sony recording artist David Archuleta; world-class musician, vocal coach, and musical director Dean Kaelin; and celebrity impressionist Jason Hewlett. We performed our <i>Evening of Music, Comedy, and Motivational Theater</i> to fourteen amazing audiences; held six firesides for the U.S. combat troops in Afghanistan, Djibouti, Bahrain, and Kuwait along the Iraqi border; and concluded the tour with a special visit to the missionaries, members, and investigators in Ethiopia. We were touched by the dedication of Church members and the fearless commitment to service before self of our brave men and women in uniform. And when we got shot at and returned machine gun fire during one of our flights in a Chinook helicopter to a remote forward operating base, I realized that we should never take our freedom for granted and was reminded of the sense of urgency with which we all should live our lives.<br><br>The second life-altering experience happened on October 23, 2010, when I had the rare opportunity to soar to the edge of space in a U-2 reconnaissance aircraft. Because it was a classified mission, I can only tell you that at 70,000 feet you can see two-thirds of the state of California. At 80,000 feet you can see some distinctly mapped outlines of America. And at 90,000 feet you tear up and feel like you can reach out and touch the face of God! It was a spiritual experience I wish each of you could have.<br><br>For four hours I sat in the sounds of silence, looking at the breathtaking curvature of the earth, gazing into the endless blackness of space, pondering eternity, and reflecting on President Dieter F. Uchtdorf's reminder that we are more than just mortal beings living on a small planet for a short season (see "You Matter to Him," <i>Ensign, </i> November 2011, 22).<br><br>Through this experience I became an eyewitness to the words of Alma: "For behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors" (Alma 34:32).<br><br>Through fasting and prayer I have chosen this scripture as the text for my remarks, and I will use the four transformational words in it as my template: <i>life, time, prepare, </i> and <i>perform. </i> I have affectionately named them "The Four Steps on the Stairway to Heaven."<br><h2><b>Life</b></h2><br>The United States Declaration of Independence states that we "are endowed by [our] Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." This makes life sound like an exciting, fulfilling adventure that should be relatively easy, right? But as a two-time bishop for young single adults, I learned firsthand that many of you are making life way too hard. Simplifying your life and creating the happiness you dream of and deserve is about attracting and maintaining good, clean, pure, powerful, positive, productive relationships; coming to grips with your own humanness; and appreciating the Atonement in a different way.<br><br>As I have traveled the world, I have come to realize that we become the average of the five people we associate with the most, which means we must be willing to pay any price and travel any distance to associate with extraordinary human beings.<br><br>Isn't this why you chose to come to BYU? Isn't this why we attend our church meetings each week? Isn't this the formula for creating an extraordinary culture of excellence in academics and for how to build a championship sports program--in which the coaches recruit one extraordinary human being at a time who also happens to be a gifted athlete?<br><br>It is my experience that when you put a hard-to-catch horse in the same field with an easy-to-catch horse, you usually end up with two hard-to-catch horses. When you put a healthy child in the same room with a sick child, you usually end up with two sick children.<br><br>So what is the moral to the story? To be disciplined, healthy, and significant, you need to associate with the disciplined, healthy, and significant people who share your same values and follow your same personal and institutional honor code.<br><br>That is obvious. But do you know anyone who refuses to see this logic and who has given up what matters most for what they think they want at the moment?<br><br>The scriptures clearly warn:<br><br><i>For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? </i><br><br><i>Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? </i> [Mark 8:36–37]<br><h3><b><i>Successful Versus Significant</i></b></h3><br>I saw this reality unfold in two separate scenarios. The first one involved a football teammate of mine who was drafted into the National Football League with a huge second-round signing bonus and a big salary.<br><br>However, after only four years in the league, while at the top of his superstar career, he walked out of practice--quit--never to play again. Why? He loved being a football player but he hated playing football. He got what he wanted but he hated what he got. He loved the celebrity perks and fame and fortune that allowed him a successful life focused on a destination that's impressive. But because his inner voice and true purpose were misaligned with who he was and what he did, he would never be able to enjoy a life of significance that focused on a journey that's important. Can any of you relate? Will some of you graduate with a degree you want but, because in the real world there are no jobs in that field, never want what you get?<br><br>The second explanatory scenario unfolded with a beautiful, smart, and talented BYU coed who is an incredible singer-songwriter and who has written with many of the biggest names in country music.<br><br>Consequently, many of the lead-singing bad boys of bands are attracted to her, and she is attracted to them. As a conservative friend, I tried to counsel her that she has everything she needs to get what she wants, but at some point she should stop long enough to make sure she wants what she is getting.<br><br>My words continually fell on deaf ears until one day I had an epiphany. I told her she was acting like a dog chasing cars. If she, like a dog, caught the car, what would she do with it? Just let it drag her down a road she had not intended to go down and beat her up until she finally let go in divorce?<br><br>Are any of you chasing cars you really won't want? Are any of you becoming desensitized to what matters most, which is what lasts the longest, and are you slowly going inactive because of the influences around you? Are any of you dating someone who can't take you to the temple because you are confused about the real definition of love?<br><br>The Bible says, "God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him" (1 John 4:16), which means that love is a commitment, not a way of feeling. Romance is not love. Romance comes from a Greek word that means "erotic," so I don't even want to talk about that. However, I do want you to think differently about love.<br><br>If I love you because you are beautiful, that is romance. But if you are beautiful because I love you, that is real love--it is a value-creating love that inspires you to be the best you can be.<br><br>Yet how many of us confuse love (commitment) with romance (emotion). What have we said our whole lives? "I love her so much; she makes me feel differently than I have ever felt before." Or, "I love him so much; he makes me feel differently than I have ever felt before." So do breakfast burritos! If you think you are in love, maybe you just need a long, cold shower and a box of Rolaids!<br><br>"I love you" means nothing unless we back it up with action. True love is not finding someone who is perfect--it is finding someone who is perfect for you, so that when you are apart, you always say, "I like me best when I am with you; I want to see you again."<br><h3><b><i>Coming to Grips</i></b></h3><br>Creating the life of happiness you dream of and deserve also requires that you come to grips with your own humanness.<br><br>I know what you had to do to get into BYU. Congratulations for qualifying both spiritually and intellectually! Most of you were on your high school honor roll every time. That was not the case for me, and I am fortunate that my dad cut me some slack.<br><br>One time I came home with a report card that had four Fs and one D on it. What was my dad's response? "Son, it looks to me like you are spending too much time on one subject." You have got to love my dad!<br><br>The part of your extremely high achievement world here at BYU that is often forgotten is the frightening reality that when you do make a mistake, mess up, fail, or fall, it is usually harder on you than on most. BYU is a school of academic and sports champions--which means that around here, losing hurts worse than winning feels good.<br><br>The Doctrine and Covenants gives us comfort, stating, "Thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment" and "shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good" (D&amp;amp;C 121:7, 122:7).<br><br>But the question still remains: What are you going to do about it? Make excuses or claim "the devil made me do it"? No, he didn't. The apostle Paul was clear when he said:<br><br><i>There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it. </i> [1 Corinthians 10:13]<br><br>Are you going to get mad, blame others, and stay mad? I think not. Staying angry and holding a grudge is like you drinking poison and expecting the other person to die. You need to forgive and get on with it.<br><br>And no, it wasn't peer pressure that made you let your guard down. Pressure is not something that is naturally there; it is created when you question your own ability. And when you know what you can do, there is never any question.<br><br>So the question isn't, Are you going to crash and burn every once in a while? Of course you are--you are human! In Romans 3:23 we read, "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God." The question is, What are you going to do about it?<br><br>Some will counsel you to exercise faith. But faith without works is not faith at all. Some will encourage you to have hope. But the words of French philosopher Blaise Pascal caution, "We never live, but we hope to live; and, as we are always preparing to be happy, it is inevitable we should never be so" (<i>Pensées</i> [1670], section 2, "The Misery of Man Without God," 172). These people are waiting for someone to ask them to the senior prom but have never taken the time to learn how to dance!<br><br>The most common counsel is to be patient. Patience is a virtue, yes, but not always. Any virtue taken to the extreme can become a vice. Patience allows us to never begin. Patience allows us to mindlessly wait our turn, believing that this is the hand we have been dealt, that this is the cross we must bear, and that there is nothing we can do about it--it is meant to be!<br><br>No, no, no! When life gets tough--and it surely will, because if you are not failing a few times, that means you are not pushing yourself hard enough--what you need is an unshakable commitment to persevere. Perseverance is patience with a purpose, when you willingly and proactively take your turn because you know why you should.<br><h3><b><i>The Atonement</i></b></h3><br>This is why creating the life of happiness you dream of and deserve also requires that you appreciate the Atonement in a different way.<br><br>We all know the first law of heaven is obedience. To test our obedience, God gave us the gift of moral agency. To protect our agency, we were given "an opposition in all things" (2 Nephi 2:11), compelling us to choose in every situation whether or not we will stand for what we believe. And because we are all human and are susceptible to the temptations of the world, God did not leave us on our own to face our challenges. Through Moroni He told us: "For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge" (Moroni 7:16).<br><br>We commonly call this inherent ability to discern right from wrong our conscience. This scripture means our conscience will never fail us; only our desire to follow it decreases as we continue to do the wrong thing.<br><br>Because Heavenly Father knew our agency would get us into trouble when we don't follow our conscience, John 3:16 beautifully states: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."<br><br>I testify that Jesus is the Christ and that He died on the cross. He is my personal Savior. I know He lives and was resurrected, which guarantees our immortality. As Christians, we Latter-day Saints know that "by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast" (Ephesians 2:8–9).<br><br>Because of the infinite Atonement, the Lord is not disappointed when you fall or transgress. The Lord is only disappointed when you don't learn the lesson and get back up and go again. The Atonement of Jesus Christ is continuous and real, which means that pain is a signal to grow, not to suffer. And once you learn the lesson the pain is teaching you, the pain goes away. In life there are no mistakes, only lessons.<br><br>So if you ever find yourself in a position in which you need to clear some things up and talk with an ecclesiastical leader about repenting and receiving forgiveness, remember that discipline is to teach, not to punish. You can't increase a person's performance by making that person feel worse. Humiliation immobilizes your behavior. This means that you can walk into your bishop's office with the comforting and motivating assurance of Elder Jeffrey R. Holland's words: "It takes exactly as long to repent as it takes you to say, 'I'll change'--and mean it" ("<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/jeffrey-r-holland_times-trouble/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">For Times of Trouble</a>," BYU devotional address, 18 March 1980).<br><br>And while you are working with your loving bishop, will you make sure you are also working on loving yourself? Every therapist will tell you that when you slip up and make a mistake at any level, the hardest thing for you to do is to forgive yourself. I promise it will always be okay in the end. And if it is not okay right now, then it is not the end!<br><h2><b>Time</b></h2><br>This brings me to the second transformational word of Alma's wisdom: <i>time. </i> Using your time wisely is about realizing that there are no ordinary moments and finding your personal "why."<br><br>I love what NFL Hall of Fame inductee Emmitt Smith said about his 24/7 understanding of time:<br><br><i>Winning isn't something that just happens to you on the field when the whistle blows or the crowd roars. Winning is something that is built physically and mentally every day that you train and every night that you dream. </i> [<i>Game On: Find Your Purpose--Pursue Your Dream</i> (Carol Stream, Illinois: Tyndale House Publishers, 2011), 4, 13]<br><br>When you boil it down, there are really only two times in life: now and too late. Today you have never been this old before, and today you will never be this young again. So all you ever have is right now; every right now matters. This means you can't always control what happens--but you can always control what happens next.<br><br>Did you get all that? Do you believe it? Do you believe that you can leave the Marriott Center today different than you were when you arrived? Do you believe that no matter what your past has been, you have a spotless future? Do you really believe that one moment in time can change you forever? I do.<br><h3><b><i>Fonzie</i></b></h3><br>I was on a program with the famous actor Henry Winkler, who played Fonzie on the 1970s television sitcom <i>Happy Days. </i> The saddest thing is that most of you are so young you don't even know who I am talking about. You need to Google him and see that he was the coolest dude who ever lived. He played the dad in the movie <i>Holes</i> and the football coach in <i>The Water Boy. </i><br><br>After our speeches Winkler decided he wanted to take some time off and treat himself to a matinee movie, so he slid in through the side exit door of the theater. As he shuffled down the aisle to find a vacant seat and turned to sit down in the chair, the little girl sitting right behind him smiled a giant smile, pointed her finger, and slowly said, "Fonzie."<br><br>Winkler immediately snapped into the Fonzie character. He wiggled his hips, flipped his hair, pointed his finger, and said, "Hey, whoa!"<br><br>The lady sitting next to the little girl passed out. The theater manager immediately came out and took care of the woman's needs. Lying in the aisle with a cold pack on her forehead, she was asked why she had passed out. With tears in her eyes, she whispered, "My little girl is autistic, and that is the very first word she has ever spoken in her entire life!"<br><br>Yes, one moment in time can change you forever--either positively or negatively. The difference will be in how you react and what you learn from it. In other words, things happen for a reason, but it is our responsibility in every moment in time to determine what that reason is. The scriptures are clear that our individual use of time is significant to God:<br><br><i>Lord, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is; that I may know how frail I am. </i> [Psalm 39:4]<br><br>[A man's] <i>days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass; </i><br><br><i>Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day. </i> [Job 14:5–6]<br><br><i>Thy days are known, and thy years shall not be numbered less; therefore, fear not what man can do, for God shall be with you forever and ever. </i> [D&amp;amp;C 122:9]<br><br>A popular saying explains it perfectly: "The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why" (see Taylor Hartman, <i>Color Your Future: Using the Color Code to Strengthen Your Character</i> [New York: Fireside, 2000], 147).<br><br>In my experience, when your "why" is bigger than your "why not," you can always persevere to become significant. Let me illustrate with another life-altering event that actually links me to why I am here today.<br><h3><b><i>Finding Your Personal "Why" </i></b></h3><br>I played football for thirteen years and was a projected number-one draft pick into the National Football League until one day in practice that dream ended. Lyle and I lined up fifteen yards apart in a tackling drill, and on the coach's whistle, we ran into each other full speed. In a violent head-on collision, our helmets crashed, my shoulder was smashed into my sharp fiberglass pad, and we slammed to the ground. When Lyle got off of me, my arm dangled at my side and a sharp, burning, piercing pain penetrated the entire right side of my body.<br><br>I had compressed my neck, severed the axillary nerve in my right deltoid, and suffered a grade-two concussion, which meant that as I lay in bed that night, I heavily perspired, profusely shook, threw up several times, and cried myself to sleep.<br><br>Most thought it was only a shoulder injury, but I was paralyzed physically and emotionally for fourteen months. I visited sixteen of the best doctors in North America, who all told me that I would not get any better.<br><br>Have you ever heard this? What if you believed it? You would never get any better.<br><br>Sure, it was a physical injury, but it affected my whole life. I couldn't write anymore; I was right-handed. I couldn't concentrate on school or work because it felt like someone was biting my shoulder and burning my body 24/7. My arm would get crazy contractions that felt like somebody had plugged it into an electric socket. Once I went home to a family gathering, and as I was sitting at the dinner table, my arm suddenly twitched and knocked a bowl of mayonnaise off the table about twenty feet. At the next meal my younger brother showed up wearing a batting helmet and goggles!<br><br>Before long my life was in a downward spiral that hit rock bottom, and I didn't think I could get up and go again. Can any of you relate? Have any of you ever felt lonely in a loved one's arms or alone in a crowded room? I have. Have any of you ever had your heart broken by someone you loved or had your dreams shattered by a career-ending athletic injury or lost your starting position on your team or not gotten accepted to the grad school of your choice or blown off a semester so badly that you could lose your scholarship? I have.<br><br>And to make it worse, I had people come up to me and say, "I know what you are going through." No, they didn't!<br><br>Psychologists tell us that the average person talks between 100 and 200 words per minute, and yet we think between 200 and 400 words per minute, which means no one ever knows everything that we think or feel or all that we want to say. The author Henry David Thoreau was right when he wrote, "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation" (<i>Walden</i> [1854], I, "Economy").<br><br>So again, the question remains: What are you going to do about it?<br><br>You can't quit--it is a league rule! Yet no one knows your pain and sorrow. So where do you go? To whom do you turn?<br><br>If you remember nothing else I say today, always remember that you are never all alone at any time or for any reason because our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is always there and always understands everything you are going through and will help you help yourself through it. In my darkest moments I knew "I [could] do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me" (Philippians 4:13).<br><h3><b><i>God Didn't Heal Me</i></b></h3><br>I received several priesthood blessings over the course of my ordeal, and, yes, the Lord blessed me with strength to carry on. However, although He could have completely and instantaneously healed me, He did not.<br><br>I felt like the brother of Jared when God told him to build a boat but didn't tell him how to light the journey. The brother of Jared had to find the solution on his own, which incidentally included him asking the Lord to touch the stones to illuminate the way.<br><br>In my case, what God did give me was an inspirational understanding of the giant difference between being depressed and being discouraged--the wisdom that there is a huge difference between being depressed and being disappointed--which meant getting better would also be a joint venture between me and heaven in which I would pray and plead to Almighty God as though everything depended on Him and work as though everything depended on me.<br><br>The bottom line: I stayed paralyzed for fourteen months because I was asking the wrong questions. I was blaming God, asking Him, "How could You let this happen to me?" And I was asking the doctors, "How can I get better?" When I should have been asking God, "Why did this happen and what am I supposed to learn from this?" and asking myself, "Why should I get better?"<br><br>You see, once we answer why, figuring out the "how to" is simple.<br><br>Part of my answer was realizing that football was just what I did, not who I was as a man. When you identify yourself in terms of what you do instead of who you are, you become a human doing instead of a human being--unacceptable if significance is what you seek.<br><br>Now that I have fully recovered, I must confess that my accident is clearly one of the best things that ever happened to me. Because adversity introduces us to ourselves, I am the man I am and have the perspective I have because of this heartbreaking, dream-shattering ordeal. And through it all I learned that if you do today what others won't, you can accomplish tomorrow what others can't. It is guaranteed that with God's help you can always turn your setbacks into comebacks and your stumbling blocks into stepping-stones.<br><h2><b>Prepare</b></h2><br>This brings me to the third transformational word of Alma's wisdom: <i>prepare. </i> Preparing yourself to meet God is about serving the Lord on a mission and judging less and accepting more.<br><br>There is no better place or time for a young man and a young woman to prepare themselves to meet God than in the mission field. My personal testimony is that it is not a choice to go on a mission; it is a calling to serve the Lord through missionary work. When it comes to the Lord, our answer should always be yes--and then find out what He needs us to do afterward.<br><br>Brother and Sister Smith were an elderly couple in their late seventies who had been baptized for one year, had just gone to the temple to be sealed to their family, and had just received their patriarchal blessings. Right before I left on my mission, in a fast and testimony meeting, Brother Smith stood to bear his testimony. He asked for the attention of all the young men and women, pulled out his blessing, unfolded the paper, and read, "Brother Smith. You and your wife would have joined the Church many years earlier except the missionary who was supposed to teach you the gospel decided not to go on a mission."<br><br>To every young man and young woman within the sound of my voice, I challenge you to prepare yourself to accept the sacred call to serve the Lord on a full-time mission! Don't go to please your parents or because it is expected by Church leaders. Go because you demand it of yourself, regardless of whether you get called to Brazil; England; Cut-n-Shoot, Texas; or Alligator, Mississippi, where the sign at the edge of town reads, "Population 196 and Larry's Coon Dog." Go because you realize that Heavenly Father usually answers prayers through other people, and it will be really cool when He uses you.<br><br>Those of us who are returned missionaries can all testify that we know we were called by inspiration to serve in our specific mission fields and that we were put with specific companions to proselyte in specific areas and to love and serve specific people who were searching for the truth but needed our specific personality to help them find it.<br><br>The sad thing about this witness is that many of us believe that when we were released as full-time missionaries, our mission was over and complete. This is not true. Whenever we leave our classmates, teammates, or coworkers; drop our date off after a night on the town; get off work; finish our athletic practice; or conclude a study session at the library, if we have talked about the right things and set the proper example, are we not in fact still "returning missionaries" when we get back to our apartments?<br><br>And in all humility and with great soberness, will you please remember that when the investigators you taught and the new members you helped convert come looking for "their missionary" who brought them true happiness and an eternal family, if they find you have gone inactive and have stopped keeping the covenants you made in the temple, this shocking disappointment could have a long-term, generational, negative impact on them. As a former prodigal son, I promise you are welcome and wanted and needed, knowing firsthand that our church meetings are not country clubs for saints--they are sanctuaries for sinners! Come back, my friend, and let us run to meet you!<br><br>For those of you who have not chosen to go on a full-time mission, have come home early for personal reasons, have chosen to serve our country and protect our freedom in our amazing military, or are one of our wonderful friends of another faith, know that we love you and need you and honor you and that you are as equally significant to the Lord as everybody else. You still have been called to serve the Lord on a mission in other ways, which is the best way to prepare to meet God.<br><br>Preparing to meet God also requires that you judge less and accept more. They say there is no one more self-righteous than the newly converted or those who believe they have the exclusive truth. Does this apply to any of us here today?<br><h3><i><b>Missionary Moment</b></i></h3><br>When I was on my mission in Ireland, I was sent with my companion to open up a city called Tralee, which had no members. One day a woman answered her door and surprisingly called us "elders" and invited us in. I noticed she had not looked at our name tags, so I asked her what she knew about the Church. She smiled and proudly told us she was a member but had been inactive for years. I asked her if she still believed, and she told us that yes, she still had a testimony.<br><br>When I asked her why she had gone inactive, she explained that she had never been able to break her smoking habit and that every time she went to Church and the members smelled the smoke on her clothes and breath, she was made to feel guilty and unwanted. She then turned her head away for about sixty seconds. When she looked back at us, she had tears streaming down her cheeks. With her lip quivering, she sweetly and humbly replied, "I sure wish everybody's sins smelled."<br><br>Didn't Jesus invite us all to come as we are? Didn't Jesus say, "He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her" (John 8:7)? Didn't Jesus teach us to "leave the ninety and nine and go after [the one]" (Luke 15:4)?<br><h3><b><i>"Just Don't Look!" </i></b></h3><br>As this message percolates within your soul, let me also tie its powerful ramifications into the unacceptable plague of pornography. If you are one who is fighting this battle, yes, you are welcome to come as you are to all of our church meetings, and yes, you should continually work with your bishop and professional therapist. But you have to stop judging yourself as weak and addicted beyond your self-control and start accepting the fact that when it comes to pornography, it is not enough to say, "I will do my best." You must succeed in doing that which is necessary. Pornography is a deal breaker in every relationship!<br><br>As a bishop of young single adults, I came to realize that nothing smells worse than the stench of the effects of pornography. Even though some of you think pornography is something you can hide, your obvious lack of affection and calloused inability to be sensitive to the needs of others "smells" at home, at school, at work, on a date, and in church! My solemn message to those of you who are facing this challenge is encompassed in a short and pointed story.<br><br>I was flying cross-country with my family and playing cards with my ten year-old daughter, who was sitting next to me.<br><br>I said, "Alexandrea, you need to turn your cards and hold them up closer to your face so I can't see them."<br><br>She scowled and fired back, "Just don't look!"<br><br>Any questions? If I am going too fast, just raise your hand. Didn't President Uchtdorf tell us in a recent conference talk, "Stop it!" ("The Merciful Obtain Mercy," <i>Ensign, </i> May 2012, 75)?<br><br>Yes, Jesus said, "He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone," and, yes, we can hate the sin and love the sinner. But let us not forget what Jesus emphatically told the woman as she departed: "Go, and sin no more" (John 8:11). That's right--don't look at pornography any more. Stop it now. End of discussion!<br><h2><b>Perform</b></h2><br>This brings me to the fourth and final transformational word of Alma's wisdom: <i>perform. </i> Performing your labors is about raising your bar, understanding the true purpose of education, and supporting each other in our beliefs and righteous desires.<br><h3><b><i>Broomstick</i></b></h3><br>I am paid big bucks by teams in the National Football League to work with their players to take their performance to the next level. When I walk into a team meeting, there are around fifty-three elite athletes who collectively represent over $105 million dollars in annual salary. Totally absurd! What would you say to them? The good news is that the same thing that motivates them is the same thing that motivates you and me: expectations.<br><br>At these meetings I ask an assistant coach and a captain of the team to come to the front of the room and hold a broomstick twelve inches off the floor. Before the meeting I get the name of the most naturally gifted athlete on the team--the guy who can jump thirty-eight inches high. And, for the record, every one of the thirty-two teams in the NFL has a player on their roster who can jump thirty-eight inches high!<br><br>I then ask this superstar to come forward and face the broomstick. I ask him if he thinks he can jump over the twelve-inch-high broomstick. He doesn't move and glares at me like I am out of my mind. So I change the question: "Will you jump over this twelve-inch-high broomstick?"<br><br>Reluctantly he hops over the bar, and this is when the motivational teaching begins.<br><br>I ask him, "Why did you only jump twelve inches high when you and your teammates know you can jump thirty-eight inches high?"<br><br>And the answer is always the same: "Because that is all you asked me to do!"<br><br>How high is your bar? Everybody with whom you live, play, study, worship, and work knows how high your bar is because they see it every day. But only you know how high it should be. Only you know if you are pushing yourself to your ultimate capacity and potential as a human being--physically, mentally, spiritually, and socially.<br><br>We are taught in the scriptures to "stand in holy places" (D&amp;amp;C 45:32; 101:22). My bishop, Steve Murdock, challenged our young people to "stand holy in places." Whether we are on a date, competing in sports, taking a test, working on the job, or attending church, the Lord needs each of us to stand as a witness to the benefits of living the gospel of Jesus Christ and encourage one another to do the same.<br><h3><b><i>Why We Really Go to College</i></b></h3><br>Performing your labors also requires that you fully understand the true purpose of education. In 2007, according to <i>Motto, </i> a national magazine, the sign at the entrance of the BYU campus--"Enter to learn; go forth to serve"--ranked as one of the top ten best college mottos in the United States (see "BYU Not Alone in Using Motto 'Enter to Learn,'" <i>Deseret News, </i> 4 August 2007). But what does this motto mean?<br><br>When fourteen-year-old Joseph Smith entered the Sacred Grove to pray, it was because he had read the Bible passage found in James 1:5, which reads, "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God." It doesn't say, "If any of you lack knowledge or information"; it specifically states, "If any of you lack wisdom." A dictionary definition of wisdom is "applied knowledge--the practical application of truth through experience."<br><br>Yes, Joseph learned some important things that day during his conversation with the Father and the Son--especially about the true identity and real personality of the Godhead, which distinguishes our theology from other churches. This one fact alone gives me courage in dealing with other beliefs or disbeliefs, as in the case of an atheist who claims he doesn't believe in God. My response to him is always, "What version of God is it that you don't believe in? There are so many and so many churches to choose from. There is a good chance that I don't believe in the God you don't believe in either."<br><br>The other significant thing Joseph learned that day in the grove was that both the Father and the Son knew him by name. Heavenly Father, pointing to Jesus, said, "[Joseph,] this is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!" (Joseph Smith-- History 1:17). The Lord also knows your name and your innermost thoughts and desires and will always respond to your requests for Him to be a part of your life.<br><br>But perhaps more important than the new knowledge Joseph acquired was the challenge he received to walk out of the grove and do something with his newly acquired education. As college students you must remember that knowledge is power, but knowledge has no heart. All of the information in the world isn't going to make a person successful: "Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven" (Matthew 7:21).<br><br>My favorite scripture of all time is 1 Nephi 3:7:<br><br><i>I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them. </i><br><br>We don't learn to know; we learn to do. Reason leads to conclusions, but it is emotion that leads to action. This truth is illuminated in one of the most profound lessons in all of scripture. At the Last Supper, Jesus told Peter:<br><br><i>Behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: </i><br><br><i>But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren. </i> [Luke 22:31–32]<br><br>Obviously Peter had a strong testimony that Jesus was the Christ. He had seen Him heal the sick, raise the dead, walk on water, and feed thousands with a few loaves of bread; he was with Jesus on the Mount of Transfiguration. In Matthew 16 we read of when Peter bore his testimony:<br><br><i>When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am? . . . </i><br><br><i>And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. </i><br><br><i>And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. </i> [Matthew 16:13, 16–17]<br><br>Yes, the apostle Peter had a strong testimony of the Savior. But Jesus knew Peter was still weak enough to deny Him three times. Consequently He spoke of a future understanding and a deeper conviction He called conversion.<br><br>Are you truly converted? Do you have an unshakable conviction so you will never deny Christ?<br><br>I have spoken at the Utah State Prison three times. It is an eerie place. Did you know that many returned missionaries are locked up there? Here are some questions to consider: Did they have testimonies before they broke the law? Could what happened to them happen to you? Do you believe the Church is true or do you absolutely know it is true? Do you merely have a testimony of the Book of Mormon or are you absolutely converted to follow its teachings and live its truth? It is never enough to just know the gospel--we must do the gospel! We read in James 2:19: "Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble."<br><br>Because you BYU students understand the significance of having a testimony <i>and</i> being converted, you know something that other students are not aware of. The reason you go to college is to get the job of your dreams, not just the job that is left over. When you graduate, the goal is not to engage and do business with everyone who wants what you have. The goal is to engage and do business with those who believe what you believe.<br><br>In sports, the teams that win championships are not those that have players who want what you want--because everybody wants to win. Teams that win championships like you do at BYU have players who believe what you believe!<br><h3><b><i>The Broken Doll</i></b></h3><br>This brings me to my final point--that performing your labors is also about supporting each other in your beliefs and in every righteous desire. At the end of every day, who you are and what you have accomplished is determined by the support you have received and have given to others.<br><br>I conclude with a favorite vignette that drives this point home.<br><br>A mother encouraged her daughter to come home as soon as school was over. The time she was supposed to arrive came, and the time went. Thirty minutes later, her daughter walked in through the front door of their home, and the mother scolded her, saying, "Where have you been? I have been worried sick!"<br><br>The daughter said, "Oh, Mommy, I walked my friend Sally home. She dropped her doll on the sidewalk, and it broke all to pieces. It was awful!"<br><br>Her mother said, "So you are late because you stayed to help your friend pick up the pieces of the doll and put it back together again?"<br><br>She replied, "Oh, no, Mommy. I didn't know how to fix the doll. I just stayed to help her cry."<br><br>My prayer is that you will leave here today more committed than ever before to be there for each other, not just in sharing tears of sadness but in sharing tears of joy and victory as you support one another in your climb up the four steps on the stairway to heaven--that your <i>life</i> will be significant, that your <i>time</i> will be well spent, that you will <i>prepare</i> in every way, and that you will <i>perform</i> in every moment.<br><br>So when you do meet God, you will hear those most rewarding words that make it all worthwhile: "Well done, thou good and faithful servant . . . : enter thou into the joy of thy lord" (Matthew 25:21) and be "received into heaven, that [you] may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness. O remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord God hath spoken it" (Mosiah 2:41).<br><br>In case this is my final address to you, I want each of you to know--especially my friends of other faiths--that I know God is real and that this unconditionally loving Heavenly Father actually hears and answers our prayers. I know that Jesus is the Christ and my personal Savior. I know the Book of Mormon is true and testify that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is led today by a living prophet of Almighty God. And I testify that this Church has the priesthood power of God, as I have been miraculously healed on many occasions at the hands of my priesthood brethren.<br><br>Because of this testimony, my challenge is on the table. Because one moment in time can change everything, and because no matter what our past has been we have a spotless future, we can actually start to prepare to meet God in a more intensified way the second we leave the Marriott Center today. I challenge you and myself to do so, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Dan Clark was the CEO of The Art of Significance Leadership Development Corporation when this devotional address was given on 30 September 2014.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<br>
The other day, while walking through the Wilkinson Center on my way to the Cougareat, I noticed the windows of the Y-Serve office. Students had turned the name Y-Serve into a question--Why serve?--and, using colorful markers, they had covered the windows with responses to why they serve. I was intrigued and stopped to read them.<br><br>A few of the answers were humorous--or just incredibly honest: "Because I usually get refreshments!" "To get dates." "Women." And "Because when you are in the service of your fellowman, you are closer to the food."<br><br>But most answers offered serious reflection: "Because I love my Heavenly Father." "Because the gospel is delicious to me." And "[Because I want] to put more good . . . into a troubled world."<br><br>As I continued reading, I realized there are a lot of reasons why people serve. I pondered some of the listed reasons and thought of my own motives for serving, and I wondered if perhaps my service could use some refining at times.<br><br>Well, if the intent of the good people in the Y-Serve office was to get us thinking about our service, it worked on me. What began as a simple attempt to get a salad at the Cougareat turned into weeks of thinking about this topic and then into a devotional talk.<br><br>So this morning I would like to write on that window, so to speak, and share with you some of my thoughts on "Why serve?"<br><h2><b>Why Serve?</b></h2><br>I would like to begin by examining some primary reasons for serving. Elder Dallin H. Oaks has made this task easy for me. In a conference address he gave when I was a student, he introduced six reasons why people serve, in ascending order from lesser to greater. The first and lowest reason is "for hope of earthly reward," in which our service is focused on receiving honor, praise, or recognition. The second reason is "to obtain good companionship," which is centered on social benefits. Both of these reasons, he noted, are self-serving.<br><br>Moving upward along the continuum is serving "out of fear of punishment," or a concern for what will happen to us if we don't faithfully serve. He then listed serving out of duty or loyalty--a motive that is commendable and will merit blessings but still falls short of the ideal. The fifth "reason for service is the hope of an eternal reward"--"one of the most powerful sources of motivation" but not quite there yet.<sup>1</sup><br><br>Have any of these reasons ever found their way into your service? Admittedly, they have found their way into mine.<br><br>Elder Oaks then reminded us of the highest reason--the "more excellent way," <sup>2</sup> which is charity, "the pure love of Christ," <sup>3</sup> the greatest of all virtues. <sup>4</sup> He explained:<br><br><i>It is not enough to serve God with all of our <b>might and strength.</b> He who looks into our hearts and knows our minds demands more than this. In order to stand blameless before God at the last day, we must also serve him with all our <b>heart and mind.</b></i><sup>5</sup><br><br>If we hunted down another set of windows on campus to write on, we might pose this question: Why serve out of charity?<br><br>Before exploring this question, I would like to review what the virtue of charity is and how it is developed. Mormon explained that charity is the pure love of Christ and that it<br><br><i>suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>We know that charity encompasses all godly virtues. It is not merely a kind act; it is something that we become. The process of developing charity begins with a sincere, heartfelt desire. That desire leads to and grows out of a study of the life of Jesus Christ and a commitment to follow Him.<br><br>We know that prayer is also critical in developing charity because charity is a divine gift that is bestowed upon us. Mormon taught:<br><br><i>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure. </i><sup>7</sup><br><h2><b>Lost and Found</b></h2><br>Now to the question "Why serve out of charity?" In offering my own answer, I'd like to begin with a story.<br><br>While living in Tucson, Arizona, my wife, Colette, and I were watching the local news one Saturday night when we heard the story of an eight-year-old boy who earlier that morning had wandered from a campground south of Tucson and had failed to return. The terrain into which he had wandered included mountains, gullies, and foothills covered in desert vegetation--much of it dense--making the search very difficult. When we saw the story on the news, the boy had already spent a hot day and was about to spend a cold night alone in the desert.<br><br>Colette and I thought of the boy's parents and the unimaginable anguish they must be feeling. We also considered the young boy--alone and cold in the desert. We thought of our own young children and couldn't imagine how we would feel if they were lost.<br><br>Just before midnight the phone rang.<br><br>"Brother Callister, this is the bishop. Did you hear on the news about the lost boy?"<br><br>I confirmed I had.<br><br>"The boy is in our stake," he said. "He was on a fathers and sons' outing, and early this morning he got separated from a group of older boys who were exploring a short distance from camp. People have been searching since then, but he is still lost. Would you meet in the morning at my house to help in the search? They need more volunteers."<br><br>Very early the next morning, before the sun rose, a large group of us gathered at the bishop's home and quickly set out in vans to the search site. As we drove into the foothills and neared the campground, I saw cars leaving, carrying volunteers who had already spent a long day and a night searching the desert. The boy's father, I later learned, was not aware that replacement volunteers were on the way, and with many volunteers returning home to eat and to sleep, he was wondering if there would be enough people to cover the expanding search area that at that point extended for miles in all directions. But when he saw our large caravan filled with volunteers pull into the parking lot, he was overcome with emotion. I remember seeing him cover his face in his hands and cry at the sight of so many people coming to search for his son.<br><br>The leader of the search and rescue effort--a large, burly man with a thick beard--quickly organized us into small teams and assigned us to search areas marked on a map that lay across the hood of his car. We felt the urgency of the rescue as he explained that twenty-four hours had passed since the boy had wandered from camp, that the boy had already gone through a very hot day and a cold night, that the search area was immense, and that the desert terrain was rugged.<br><br>I was on the last team to receive an assignment, and while waiting, I watched the boy's father. I saw his anguish. I could only imagine the overwhelming pain and concern he was feeling. I listened as he expressed gratitude to the departing teams as they set out into the desert. I couldn't help but feel a love for this good father and his lost son.<br><br>As I stood next to the leader, I suddenly heard the crackle of his radio. We then heard an excited voice from one of the search teams exclaim, "We found him! We found him! He is okay."<br><br>The leader, who had shown great control up to that point, jumped in the air for joy and then actually started to cry. His voice was choked with emotion as he called out to the boy's father and to all present, "They found him!" The leader called for all the search parties to return to the campground and then quickly drove off with the joyful father to pick up the son.<br><br>I then watched a beautiful scene unfold. Across the desert floor and over the hills came the search parties, which had been largely hidden from view up until that point. They were numerous. I watched them materialize from the hills, the gullies, the canyons, and the valley below. Some volunteers looked very tired and worn--having searched since the beginning--but full of joy at the news.<br><br>Soon the vehicle carrying the son and his father arrived back in camp. I could not hold back the tears when the father emerged from the car holding his son. The son's face was buried in his father's neck as he clung tightly to him. The large group of volunteers quickly crowded around to cherish the sight of the father and his son safely reunited.<br><br>The stake president asked for all the news cameras to be turned off and for hats to be removed while he offered a prayer of gratitude. The image of that father holding his son, encircled by an army of volunteers with heads bowed, is one of the sweetest memories of my life.<br><h2><b>"Dear Are the Sheep That Have Wandered"</b></h2><br>There are many parallels from this experience that I could highlight--such as the urgency in these last days of searching out the lost sheep, the sacrifices that such efforts entail, and the persistence required. But it was the image of that father during the search and rescue that has remained most salient in my memory and that I would like to focus on.<br><br>That morning I received a small glimpse into what our Heavenly Father must feel as He looks out and sees so many of His children struggling and wandering across a rapidly darkening and spiritually hostile landscape. For Him who is perfect in love and compassion, whose creations are continually before His eyes, the pain and anguish He must feel is hard to imagine. I think of the words to the hymn "Dear to the Heart of the Shepherd":<br><br><i>Dear to the heart of the Shepherd, </i><br><i>Dear are the "ninety and nine"; </i><br><i>Dear are the sheep that have wandered</i><br><i>Out in the desert to pine. </i><br><br><i>Hark! he is earnestly calling, </i><br><i>Tenderly pleading today: </i><br><i>"Will you not seek for my lost ones, </i><br><i>Off from my shelter astray?" </i><br><br><i>Out in the desert they wander, </i><br><i>Hungry and helpless and cold; </i><br><i>Off to the rescue he hastens, </i><br><i>Bringing them back to the fold. </i><sup>8</sup><br><br>Enoch was given a similar perspective on a far grander level than mine. The Lord showed him in a vision all the inhabitants of the earth, and he witnessed the disturbing spread of Satan's power as it covered the world. He saw Satan and his angels laughing and rejoicing in their success at enticing God's children into darkening and forbidden lands.<br><br>Then Enoch's perspective was suddenly and forever changed. He saw something that absolutely astonished him: he saw God weeping.<br><br>"How is it that thou canst weep, seeing thou art holy, and from all eternity to all eternity?" <sup>9</sup> he asked, unable to hide his surprise. "Thou art just; thou art merciful and kind forever; . . . and mercy shall go before thy face and have no end; how is it thou canst weep?" <sup>10</sup><br><br>In answer to Enoch's question, the Lord described the future suffering of His disobedient and unrepentant children. He then said, "Wherefore should not the heavens weep, seeing these shall suffer?" <sup>11</sup><br><br>Enoch learned that God feels anguish, pain, and sorrow for His wandering and suffering children. He witnessed the great depth of God's love and compassion for each and every one of us--not just on some general, abstract level but on an individual, intimate, and personal level. His love, concern, and interest in us are beyond our comprehension.<br><br>That morning I saw the gratitude of the boy's father for those who so willingly and lovingly sacrificed. I also witnessed his great joy at the return of his son. Our Heavenly Father feels these emotions as well but in far greater measure. He is ever grateful to those who search for, lift, and bless others. Those who go out and search for the lost ones or for those who struggle certainly offer our Heavenly Father some relief from His concern, anguish, and sorrow. His joy is full in the sheep that return to the fold or the lambs that are comforted.<br><h2><b>The Lord's Undershepherds</b></h2><br>For me, part of the answer to the question "Why serve out of charity?" is rooted in God's infinite love for His children and in His desire for His children to experience that love. He accomplishes this, in part, through his undershepherds--those who lovingly assist Him in His work. When our service springs forth from the wells of charity, we experience God's love as it flows through us to those we serve, and they in turn come to feel that love. Let me illustrate with a story.<br><br>Many years ago, as a freshman at BYU–Hawaii, I was passing through some difficult life experiences. I was also aware of my imperfections and felt distant from my Heavenly Father. I was not guilty of any egregious sins, but I was not where I wanted to be spiritually. I was much like the boy who, through some carelessness, had wandered into the desert.<br><br>On a particular Sunday a conference was held on campus, presided over by President Spencer W. Kimball. He spoke to a large gathering of Saints who had come to hear the prophet. I remember feeling the Spirit as he spoke. Following the closing prayer all arose, and in respectful silence we watched that great man exit the building.<br><br>As we filed out, two young Polynesian students I had met at the dorms approached me and invited me to walk with them to the Laie Hawaii Temple, where they were going to spend the afternoon reading from the scriptures. I was a bit surprised at the invitation--not knowing them very well at the time--but I gladly accepted. When we arrived at the temple, we walked to the upper grounds. I didn't have scriptures with me, so as they sat on the grass to read, I walked a short distance away and sat on a stone bench.<br><br>I cannot remember all that I thought and felt that day--it was many years ago--but I remember thinking about my Heavenly Father and about how I wanted to draw closer to Him. I started to pray, but as I did, I remember I felt heavy and discouraged. At that time in my life I had a hard time envisioning a God of love and compassion. I felt I was praying to someone who was always displeased and disappointed with me and far away. I didn't understand the true nature of my Heavenly Father.<br><br>But my perspective was about to change. As I sat on that bench, my attention was suddenly drawn to a small group of people excitedly walking toward the entrance of the temple. I looked beyond them, and to my great surprise I saw President Kimball and some local and general Church leaders coming out of the temple. They were walking down a sidewalk that led to a gate where cars had just pulled up to carry them to the airport. A half dozen or so people lined the sidewalk, waiting to greet President Kimball as he made his way to the awaiting cars.<br><br>I stood up and apprehensively approached the sidewalk, deciding to remain a short distance away from where he would pass. However irrational it might sound, I was afraid to approach him. I had decided that as a prophet he might be able to peer into my heart and see my imperfections. I felt that I was in need of greater spirituality and a serious haircut, so I decided to remain what I considered to be a safe distance away from the sidewalk.<br><br>Well, I miscalculated. As President Kimball passed by, he looked right at me. I recorded in my journal what happened next: "President Kimball suddenly stopped and turned and headed right for me. The prophet grabbed my hand, gave me a hug, and kissed me on my cheek and then looked me in the eyes and said, 'I love you.'"<br><br>I was overcome with emotion. The only words I was able to get out were <i>thank you. </i> I felt something in that hug and expression of love. I watched him through my tears as he climbed into an awaiting car. He looked through the window at us with such pure and loving eyes and waved good-bye as he drove away.<br><br>I then ran behind the temple and had a good cry. Yes, I felt President Kimball's love for me, but his love pointed to the wellspring from which it flowed. I felt an outpouring of my Heavenly Father's love for me, so real and so clear. The feeling remained with me for a time. President Kimball's act of kindness could have come from the groundskeeper that day, because if it had flowed from fountains of charity, I am convinced the same results would have followed. Having it come from the prophet certainly made it very special, but what flowed through him and was communicated to me was my Heavenly Father's love. Heavenly Father was reaching out to me through one of His special servants and two wonderful students, through whom the pure love of Christ had flowed to me that day.<br><br>Through that experience and others I have learned that as we strive to follow the Savior and as we fervently pray for charity, our service undergoes a remarkable change. We begin to feel His love more keenly for those we serve, and we feel His love for us as we serve. The outcome can be marvelous. When our Heavenly Father bestows His love upon us, it is not meant to simply pool within us. As it flows through us to others in Christlike service, we are transformed. Like a river flowing over rough stones that with time become smooth, polished, and beautiful, as His pure love flows through us, it transforms our nature and blesses those we serve.<br><br>President Kimball once said, "My life is like my shoes--to be worn out in service." <sup>12</sup> That same discipleship has defined President Thomas S. Monson's life and the lives of so many others we have come to know. They are Christlike because they strive to serve as He did.<br><br>Perhaps at times you may feel that God is not aware of you or that you haven't felt His love. I believe that if you will reflect for just a moment on the loving service you receive from others, you will see the workings of the Lord moving in the background. The Lord may move someone to offer a hug, a smile, a kind note, or an invitation. I believe that Heavenly Father is far more involved in those experiences than we may know.<br><h2><b>Charity, Pure and Sweet</b></h2><br>Another reason we serve out of charity is because charity can deepen our love for our Heavenly Father and for His children.<br><br>Robert L. Millet once said:<br><br><i>As we live in a manner that allows the Spirit to be with us regularly, we begin to see things as they really are. Our love for God grows as we begin to sense his goodness to us, as we become aware of his involvement in our lives, and as we begin to acknowledge his hand in all that is noble and good and worthy. </i><sup>13</sup><br><br>A few weeks ago I felt weighed down with a heavy matter. I prayed for a time, asking the Lord to lift my spirit. I arose from my knees and went downstairs to the kitchen, where my wife, Colette, was loading the dishwasher. She stopped in the middle of loading, looked up at me, and immediately walked over to give me a hug. When she eventually pulled away, she said, "Are you all right?"<br><br>I was surprised at her question, knowing she knew nothing of the difficult matter. She said she felt an impression in that moment to give me a hug. I marveled at our Heavenly Father's kindness and tender mercies, that He would prompt my wife to lift my spirit. He might have lifted my spirit while I was praying, which He sometimes does for us, but instead He chose to work through her. As a result, Colette felt and witnessed His love, as did I, and the experience served to bring her and me even closer together.<br><br>At times we are called upon to serve those who may make it difficult to love them. The Savior taught, "For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?" <sup>14</sup> But charity in such moments can soften hearts and heal relationships.<br><br>I remember on one occasion a frustrated and angry ward member speaking quite sharply and unkindly to a bishop, criticizing his leadership. As I listened I found my anger rising, feeling this criticism was unfair and inappropriate, for I had such great respect for this bishop and knew of his great sacrifices and able leadership. After the ward member concluded his comments, I was ready to provide a strong defense for the bishop and tell the ward member how I felt about his behavior.<br><br>But before I could speak, this great bishop, with his eyes moist from the stinging rebuke, replied with such genuine love to the member. "Thank you for sharing your comments," he said. "I know that I have shortcomings, and you have shown me where I can improve. I commit to do better. Now, what can I do to make things better for you?"<br><br>A spirit came into that room and a change came over the ward member--a visible softening--and he apologized. The bishop then expressed his genuine love for this man and the meeting came to a close. I remained in the room until the ward member had left and I was alone with the bishop. I couldn't speak; I was so moved by what I had just witnessed. It was charity, pure and sweet.<br><br>The bishop looked over at me, and he could tell that I was emotional. He asked if I was all right.<br><br>I couldn't answer for a moment. I then told him that I had just witnessed one of the most beautiful, Christlike experiences of my life and thanked him for it.<br><h2><b>"Waters to Swim In"</b></h2><br>In closing, I want to draw upon Ezekiel's vision in which he saw a millennial temple built in Jerusalem and witnessed waters suddenly bursting forth from the threshold of the temple and flowing eastward toward the Dead Sea. Joseph Smith spoke of the literal fulfillment of this future event.<br><br>Imagine Ezekiel standing on the riverbank under the hot Judean sun, looking over this miraculous river in the desert as it flowed from the temple and journeyed eastward. In the vision an angel invited Ezekiel to walk with him along the banks a thousand cubits and then to wade across the river. As Ezekiel crossed the river, he noticed that the water reached to his ankles. While this must have offered him some relief from the heat, the Lord never intended him to have only an ankle-deep experience. No, the river offered far more.<br><br>To feel more of this river, Ezekiel obediently followed the angel farther downriver along the bank. After he had progressed another thousand cubits, he was instructed to once more cross the river. This time the river had risen up to his knees. The pure, clear water flowing through the hot and arid desert valley must have been so refreshing to Ezekiel--perhaps his desire grew to experience all that this remarkable river had to offer. After obediently following the angel for another stretch and after another crossing, he found that the waters had again risen and this time reached his waist.<br><br>Again he was called to follow, and again he obeyed. After walking along the bank for a final thousand cubits, Ezekiel was astonished at what he saw. He recorded, "It was a river that I could not pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over." <sup>15</sup><br><br>Waters to swim in! A river so vast and mighty that it could not be passed over! What an appropriate symbol for the infinite love that flows from our Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ.<br><br>But the angel had one more surprise for Ezekiel: he showed him the transforming and miraculous power of this river. Ezekiel saw that everything the waters touched they blessed, healed, and prospered. The desert landscape was literally transformed; it came alive on both sides of the river with an abundance of trees and fruits of all kinds and with plants whose leaves contained healing powers. He beheld great fish in the river, drawing people from all around to cast in their nets. To his joy he then witnessed the pure waters ultimately flowing into the Dead Sea, healing its waters forever. Ezekiel concluded: "Every thing that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live." <sup>16</sup><br><br>Such transforming and healing powers point to the Atonement of Jesus Christ, the ultimate expression of love. My prayer would be that we might desire with all our hearts to swim in such waters--not ankle or knee deep, but waters to swim in. This is only possible to the extent that we follow the Savior in faith and obedience and pray with all our hearts that He might bestow His love upon us, that we might feel those living waters of the Spirit--the pure love flowing to us from our Heavenly Father and His Son. They desire that we direct these waters to others through our Christlike service. This is why we serve out of charity.<br><h2><b>The Fruits of Charity</b></h2><br>The fruits of charity are a greater desire for the eternal welfare of others and a heart that is quick to forgive, slow to judge, and slow to anger and that sees the good in others, is patient and kind, and seeks out those in need.<br><br>I am grateful for the great shepherds who have blessed my family and me and who have led me to these living waters through Christlike service. Isn't it exciting to look out over this mortal desert and see so many missionaries--over 88,000 strong, young and old--searching for our Heavenly Father's children to bring them out from the desert to these healing waters. It is inspiring to see so many of you making your way to the temple, lovingly fulfilling callings, doing genealogy, and performing simple, everyday acts of kindness: a hug, a smile, a compliment, a kind note, or an expression of love. May we strive to do a little better each day.<br><br>I wish to close with the final verse of the hymn I cited earlier. In response to the Lord's plea "Will you not seek for my lost ones?" I pray that this might be our answer to our loving Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ:<br><br><i>Green are the pastures inviting; </i><br><i>Sweet are the waters and still. </i><br><i>Lord, we will answer thee gladly, </i><br><i>"Yes, blessed Master, we will! </i><br><br><i>Make us thy true undershepherds; </i><br><i>Give us a love that is deep. </i><br><i>Send us out into the desert, </i><br><i>Seeking thy wandering sheep." </i><sup>17</sup><br><br>I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Mark Alden Callister was a professor in the BYU Department of Communications when he delivered this devotional address on 7 October 2014.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1> - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for the kind introduction. My wife, Mary, and I are very grateful to be here today with you and with many of our family.<br><br>During this past general conference I had the opportunity to say the prayer at the beginning of the final session on Sunday afternoon. Let me tell you what happened while I said the prayer. As I was praying, I meant to say, "I pray that our faith may be strengthened." Instead, I prayed that "our strength may be faithened." I quickly corrected myself; however, I soon found that once something is said in a digital format, one can never take it back.<br><br>As soon as I got home after general conference and opened up Facebook, I had a post from one of our former missionaries. His post read, "And just that fast, you're a meme." A photo of me praying at general conference was attached to the post. This experience has taught me, and it should teach you, something about things you say that are sent out to the world in a digital form.<br><br>My prayer today is that not only will your strength be faithened but that your faith might also truly be strengthened.<br><br>Not long ago I was sitting in my office and the phone rang. President Dieter F. Uchtdorf was calling. As we spoke, President Uchtdorf told me that he was ponder-ing a word in English. The word was <i>tenacity</i> President Uchtdorf's command of the English language is remarkable. In our conversation he defined <i>tenacity</i> as the ability to stick to a task, even when obstacles arise, and he in-dicated that this word includes in its meaning an absolute determination to accom-plish the work or task that has been undertaken. He noted that tenacity is a quality worth developing, especially in our youth and young single adults. It is the opposite of what he sometimes observes when some people meet adversity. Those without tenacity may strive halfheartedly against an obstacle, only to give up and quit when it becomes too difficult; others quit before they have even begun because their task seems insurmountable.<br><br>One online dictionary defines <i>tenacity</i> as "persistence, perseverance, and stubborn determination" and states that "tenacity is the quality displayed by someone who just won't quit--who keeps trying until they reach their goal."<sup>1</sup><br><br>I agree with President Uchtdorf. Tenacity is required to become true disciples of the Savior and to achieve those truly good goals--to become a great missionary, to complete your education, to find an eternal companion, and to start a family--that our Heavenly Father knows we need to achieve in this life to prepare for eternity. Our ability to be tenacious in all good things will determine whether we become the sons and daughters of God that He knows we can and must become.<br><br>This conversation with President Uchtdorf caused me to think of the many examples of tenacious righteousness we find in the scriptures. The examples I use are not, of necessity, exhaustive. But they have given me both hope to be able to become a true disciple of Christ and faith that our Heavenly Father and His Son will help you and me hold on and persist in righteousness.<br><br>Your generation has been declared "the greatest generation of missionaries in the history of the Church,"<sup>2</sup> and this generation of missionaries has frequently been compared to Helaman's 2,000 stripling warriors. Like you, these 2,000 stripling warriors had tenacity in everything that was good. Think of how the scriptures describe them:<br><br>• They "entered into a covenant."<sup>3</sup><br><br>• They were "a great support"<sup>4</sup> and gave those around them "great hopes and much joy."<sup>5</sup><br><br>• They had "great courage,"<sup>6</sup> "they did not fear,"<sup>7</sup> and "they did not doubt"<sup>8</sup>; they "were firm and undaunted."<sup>9</sup><br><br>• "They did obey and observe to perform every word of command with exactness."<sup>10</sup><br><br>• The Lord blessed them "according to their faith."<sup>11</sup><br><br>• "They were exceedingly valiant for courage, and also for strength and activity."<sup>12</sup><br><br>• They "were true at all times in whatsoever thing they were entrusted."<sup>13</sup> "For they had been taught to keep the commandments of God and to walk uprightly before him."<sup>14</sup><br><br>Notwithstanding these remarkable attributes, and notwithstanding the tenacious faith and effort of these young men and their leaders, the record states:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that there were two hundred, out of my two thousand and sixty, who had fainted because of the loss of blood; nevertheless, according to the goodness of God, and to our great astonishment, and also the joy of our whole army, there was not one soul of them who did perish; yea, and neither was there one soul among them who had not received many wounds.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>They were delivered<br><br><i>because of their exceeding faith in that which they had been taught to believe--that there was a just God, and whosoever did not doubt, that they should be preserved by his marvelous power.</i><sup>16</sup><br><br>This is what Helaman said of them:<br><br><i>Now this was the faith of these of whom I have spoken; they are young, and their minds are firm, and they do put their trust in God continually.</i><sup>17</sup><br><br>So it must be with us. In life it is when the rains descend and the floods come and the winds blow and beat upon us and on our house that we determine whether our faith is strong and whether we put our trust in God continually. There simply is no test until there is adversity.<br><br>Some of you have served as missionaries. Some of you have your call and will soon serve the Lord for eighteen months or two years. Some of you are in the process of gathering the needed information for your missionary recommendation, and some of you are still preparing, and even repenting, so that you can serve. Some will not serve because you have chosen another direction, and, of course, the sisters (many of whom are blessing the entire Church through their missionary service) are not under the same obligation to serve as are the elders. However, when you serve, whether as a missionary or in any other capacity in the Church, we pray that you will have the kind of tenacity of which I am speaking.<br><br>Some years ago my wife, Mary, and I were called to serve together as I presided over the Japan Nagoya Mission. We saw many missionaries during those years. We saw miracle after miracle. We also saw great faith and tenacity in so many.<br><br>As I think back on those missionaries whom we loved so very much, I have thought that the terms <i>faithful</i> and <i>valiant</i> that describe those 2,000 stripling warriors also describe those with whom we served and all who put their faith in God and who choose to serve the Lord in whatever place and in whatever manner He may call. You know that God will bless you and even deliver you as you keep the commandments of God and walk uprightly before Him.<br><br>The other description of those 2,000 stripling warriors is also accurate. A mission is not easy. Life is not easy. Some faint. All will be injured in some way. Some of this hurt comes from unresolved transgression. Some comes by way of accident or illness. Some comes when we see those we love either reject the gospel or not be faithful to what they know to be true. Through all of this we come to know God, and we grow to become the Savior's disciples. Our very hearts change, and that change becomes permanent as we continue to choose righteousness over sin and doubt.<br><br>Those 2,000 stripling warriors were tenacious in their desires. They simply would not give up, even when their path was difficult. A generation earlier their fathers and mothers were taught by Ammon and his brethren. Those missionaries had great success, but they also had to hold on and not give up when their missions were difficult and discouraging. This verse describes those times:<br><br><i>Now when our hearts were depressed, and we were about to turn back, behold, the Lord comforted us, and said: Go amongst thy brethren, the Lamanites, and bear with patience thine afflictions, and I will give unto you success.</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>With patience and tenacity, Ammon and his companions worked through their afflictions and ultimately saw remarkable success.<br><br>Let me give you one example of tenacious faith in a missionary. In 1999, Sister Marci Barr came to the Nagoya Mission from Columbus, Ohio. She was a convert to the Church. Japanese was not easy for her, but she was tenacious. She was not going to give up or give in. In fact, early in her mission she was so determined to learn Japanese that she tried riding her bike and studying at the same time. This resulted in a painful bike accident and is not recommended. "Persistence, perseverance, and stubborn determination" characterized everything about Sister Barr. Once she learned how to communicate, she never stopped talking with people about the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>We know that in Japan, and in every other country of the world, there are those who are ready to hear the gospel. There are great promises made to faithful, persistent, and even tenacious missionaries who open their mouths with boldness and love and who work with all their might in the ways that the Lord has set forth. One such promise is that the Lord "will open the hearts of the people, and they will receive you."<sup>19</sup><br><br>Some missionaries become fearful of rejection and let their fears overcome the loving boldness that they once felt. Not Sister Barr! She found and taught and she taught and found all of her mission. She never gave up. She knew that God had sent her, and she knew that God would fulfill His promises made to those who would be faithful to the end.<br><br>On the very last day of her mission she was traveling by train and subway alone to the mission home in Nagoya. That is how we did transfers in those days. She had faithfully completed her mission. That night I would interview her and tell her that she had done a wonderful job--and she had!<br><br>As she traveled to the mission home, there was a group of high school–age Japanese girls talking together on the subway. She approached them and asked if she could visit with them. She spoke of the gospel and its restoration. She gave a missionary tract to one of the girls who seemed interested and told her of the sister missionaries who served in the area where she lived and who could teach her the gospel. One last time she began to share the gospel in Japanese to one who so needed it in her life.<br><br>She got off the train, came to the mission home, and had her interview, never telling me of her experience on the train. To her it was unremarkable. It was what she did as a missionary. Sister Barr was a young woman who had become a missionary and who would be a missionary every day and every minute she could. She was simply continuing to do what she knew was right, all the way to the end. Perhaps this is the best definition of gospel tenacity I know: No matter what, continue to have faith in God and His promises and do what is right, all the time, regardless of who knows.<br><br>You might be interested to know that Sister Barr--now Marci--returned home to Columbus. There in a student ward she met her future husband. They have been blessed with children and happiness and joy.<br><br>The girl on the train that Marci found--Hitomi Kitayama--was taught by the sister missionaries. It took time, but Hitomi persevered and displayed her own form of tenacity as she first learned the truths of the gospel and then embraced them, along the way overcoming opposition from family members and her own doubts.<br><br>We next met Hitomi nearly six years later at a mission conference in Tokyo, where she was serving as a missionary. It was at this missionary conference that she told us of her meeting Sister Barr on the subway and of her subsequent conversion to the gospel. She was a truly happy missionary. It had been a long journey from the subway in Nagoya to her being one of the Lord's missionaries in Tokyo. After her mission she met another returned missionary, Shimpei Yamashita. They were married in the Tokyo Japan Temple on December 20, 2008, and they now have three beautiful children. Interestingly, her husband, Shimpei, is the son of a man I taught in the summer of 1971 while I was on my first mission to Japan.<br><br>How grateful I am for those who have the tenacity to work through, hold on, continue doing right, and overcome. It is not just Sister Barr and Hitomi Kitayama, and it is not just in spreading the gospel that we need tenacity to do what is right. We need this same righteous tenacity as we seek to overcome personal sin and temptation, complete our education, and seek temple marriage and an eternal family. We will need love, tenacity, and resilience as we hold on to our spouse and children and work through the challenges that come to every marriage and family. We will need this same commitment, tenacity, and patience when the blessings we seek don't come in the time frame we anticipate. In all of this and in every other righteous thing, our commitment to do right and be right will be challenged by the world. Each of us will need to be one who just won't quit--who keeps trying until we reach our goal. That goal, ultimately, is eternal life with our husband or wife, with our children and their children and generations to come.<br><br>How do we gain this strength and commitment and how do we keep it?<br><br>First, let me suggest that we establish goals that are worthy of achievement and that are compatible with our ultimate goal of eternal life. This includes education and employment goals that will lead to and be compatible with family, personal growth, service, activity in the Church, and personal happiness. Part of the making of these goals will be our own personal choice, but another part must include prayer and personal revelation. Let me give you one example from my own life.<br><br>Since I was very young I wanted to be a physician. My uncle Ted was a physician, and he was my role model during my formative years. He treated me when I was sick as a child, and, as I got older, he was both a mentor and a friend. Not only was he a successful doctor, he also served in the Church, serving twice as a bishop. I admired everything about him, and I felt that I would like to pattern my life after his.<br><br>As I got older, I kept this goal and enrolled in college courses that would lead to medical school. After my freshman year I left for my mission to Japan and returned in the fall of 1972. Three months later Mary and I were married in the Salt Lake Temple, and a year later our first child was born. As we prayed, both Mary and I felt the desire and prompting to have children, and our second child, little Rebecca, was born in October 1975. Over the years we were blessed with six other children.<br><br>During the months preceding the birth of Becky, I had a constant feeling that the Lord was leading us in a direction that did not include medical school. I was confused and a little stubborn in holding on to my childhood desire of becoming a doctor. The J. Reuben Clark Law School had recently opened at BYU, and I felt a continuing impression--and growing desire--that this was where I belonged and where the Lord would have me continue my education.<br><br>I had a wonderful stake president who had been a prominent lawyer in Salt Lake and had given it all up to accept the position of secretary to the First Presidency. I went to visit him and told him of both my confusion and the feelings that I was having.<br><br>Rather than telling me the answer I was looking for, he said something that I have never forgotten. He said, "David, you know section 9 of the Doctrine and Covenants as well as I do. Go home to your wife, Mary. Study it out in your minds together and come to a decision that you can take to the Lord. Then pray and ask God if what you have decided is right. He will answer you."<br><br>He then said, "This revelation does not need to take months and months of agonizing. Rather, it takes the desire to find out what the Lord would have you do and the determination to do it."<br><br>Two weeks later I was back with my stake president. I told him that both Mary and I were settled and that we would be applying to law school instead of medical school. Once we knew what the Lord would have us do, we were absolutely determined to follow that course. After I told him of our experience, he told me that he had received that same witness when we had met two weeks earlier, but it was important for <i>me</i> to receive the witness rather than for him to just tell me what I should do.<br><br>For me it was the right answer. That same path may not be right for others. The way to know is through personal revelation. If you care enough to go through the process of seeking God's will, God will care enough to answer.<br><br>Among the many things you should pray about, you should pray to find a worthy companion with whom you can go to the temple and make sacred covenants. <i>If you want to make and keep sacred covenants and have the motivation to achieve your most righteous goals, prayerfully seek the blessings and responsibilities of marriage. </i><br><br>During this past general conference, Elder Tad R. Callister spoke of "the power of prayer, not just the routine of prayer," and told a story from his youth:<br><br><i>When I was about 17 years of age, I was kneeling by my bed, saying my evening prayers. Unbeknown to me, my mother was standing in the doorway. When I finished, she said, "Tad, are you asking the Lord to help you find a good wife?" </i><br><br><i>Her question caught me totally off guard. That was the furthest thing from my mind. I was thinking about basketball and school. And so, I replied, "No," to which she responded, "Well, you should, Son; it will be the most important decision you will ever make." Those words sunk deep into my heart, and so for the next six years, I prayed that God would help me find a good wife. And, oh, how He answered that prayer.</i><sup>20</sup><br><br>Knowing what God would have you do provides great motivation to do it and to do it without delay. Think of Alma outside of Ammonihah. After he had received his message from the Lord, he went about doing it "speedily."<sup>21</sup> There is nothing more discouraging than knowing what you should do and then procrastinating performance and missing the opportunity. There is nothing more invigorating than knowing what you should do and then getting about doing it.<br><br>Find out what God would have you do. Study it out. Make some decisions. Take them to the Lord and find out. Then get on with achieving those goals.<br><br>In all of this, if we are going to be tenacious in righteous things, we must stay close to the Lord through righteous living. Few things will distract us more from achieving our righteous goals than being unworthy of the blessings of the Spirit in our lives.<br><br>Brethren and sisters, if I may be straight­forward for a moment, avoid pornography completely. Habits--for good or for evil--that you form or deepen at this time of your life will likely stay with you for many years to come. Nothing will distract you more from achieving righteous goals, including marriage and family, than this or other sexual sin. If repentance is needed, you know what to do. Do not procrastinate. Forgiveness, healing, and even innocence will follow. Remember, "Let virtue <i>garnish</i> thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God."<sup>22</sup><br><br>The best measure we have of righteous living is the worthy holding and use of a temple recommend. President Thomas S. Monson said:<br><br><i>If you have not yet been to the temple or if you <b>have</b> been but currently do not qualify for a recommend, there is no more important goal for you to work toward than being worthy to go to the temple. Your sacrifice may be bringing your life into compliance with what is required to receive a recommend, perhaps by forsaking long-held habits which disqualify you. It may be having the faith and the discipline to pay your tithing. Whatever it is, qualify to enter the temple of God. Secure a temple recommend and regard it as a precious possession, for such it is.</i><sup>23</sup><br><br>Not every problem is solved quickly, and some problems have no earthly solution. Other problems are solved, but not when or as we would have solved them. But God is true to His word. Remember His promise from section 90 of the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>Search diligently, pray always, and be believing, and all things shall work together for your good, <b>if</b> ye walk uprightly and <b>remember</b> the covenant wherewith ye have covenanted one with another.</i><sup>24</sup><br><br>There are also patterns found in the scriptures for when we do not have clear direction from the Lord. Some things are left to our good judgment. When that happens, we can look to Nephi for a pattern as we move forward in faith. He said, "I was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which I should do. Nevertheless I went forth."<sup>25</sup> Don't become paralyzed waiting for the Lord to solve every problem. Rather, move forward in faith, knowing that there will be sufficient light along the way to provide the guidance that will be needed.<br><br>I close with words from Elder Jeffrey R. Holland. He spoke of a time when he and Sister Holland had small children and no money. They had a car that wouldn't work and a destination that was very far off. He was discouraged and felt a measure of real concern. Years later, as he reflected on that experience, he said:<br><br><i>In my mind's eye, for just an instant, I thought perhaps I saw on that side road an old car with a devoted young wife and two little children making the best of a bad situation there. Just ahead of them I imagined that I saw a young fellow walking toward</i> [help], <i>with plenty of distance still ahead of him. His shoulders seemed to be slumping a little, the weight of a young father's fear evident in his pace. In the scriptural phrase his hands did seem to "hang down" (D&amp;amp;C 81:5). In that imaginary instant, I couldn't help calling out to him: "Don't give up, boy. Don't you quit. You keep walking. You keep trying. There is help and happiness ahead. . . . You keep your chin up. It will be all right in the end. Trust God and believe in good things to come." </i><br><br><i>. . . Some blessings come soon, some come late, and some don't come until heaven; but for those who embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ, <b>they come.</b></i><sup>26</sup><br><br>I add my testimony to that of Elder Holland. Make righteous goals. Always pray and seek the Lord's guidance. Be worthy and avoid those things that will distract or hinder your progress. Have and use your personal temple recommend. Keep your covenants, especially when life is hard. Seek the blessings of eternal marriage and family. Then hold on. Don't give up. Don't quit. Keep walking and keep trying. There is happiness and help ahead. "Trust God and believe in good things to come." Be tenacious in every righteous thing. You will see your faith strengthened and you will see your strengths and talents that God has given you deepened and magnified as your faith increases. In all of this, remember, "Some blessings come soon, some come late, and some don't come until heaven; but for those who embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ, <i>they come. </i>" Of this I testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>David F.

<h1>t Forward - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My father was a builder of big buildings, some well known. So when I returned from my two-year mission to Japan and wanted summer work, I ended up forty feet down at the bottom of an air conditioning shaft, stripping forms from freshly poured concrete. My captive coworker, Chuck, made the mistake of asking why I would "waste two valuable years like that." I am sure he had no idea what he was in for, and I unleashed my abundance of missionary zeal.<br><br>At some point in our discussion I heard a noise overhead and saw the familiar silhouette of my father leaning over the shaft. What he said was a surprise: "Chuck, I don't know what he's saying down there, but I believe it is true. Now get back to work."<br><br>This is for me the most treasured testimony my father bore, but I hope we can surpass that level of communication today. I don't want you to go back to class thinking, "I don't know what he was saying down there, but I believe it is true." Instead I want to <i>persuade</i> you to rethink the way you communicate to others your feelings about your connections to heaven and the amazing blessings of what you know and what you feel.<br><br>Why persuade? Because "no power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood"--and I hold no position that grants me that kind of dominion over you anyway--"only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned" (D&amp;amp;C 121:41). I want to persuade you to consider another perspective that will help you follow the counsel of an apostle.<br><br>Elder David A. Bednar stood here in August and asked us "to sweep the earth as with a flood of truth and righteousness" in our online efforts ("To Sweep the Earth as with a Flood," BYU Education Week devotional address, 19 August 2014, lds.org/prophets-and-apostles/unto-all-the-world/to-sweep-the-earth-as-with-a-flood). His devotional was historic in many ways. I was so delighted.<br><br>Elder Bednar's first qualification for this effort was simple:<br><br><i>We are disciples, and our messages should be authentic. A person or product that is not authentic is false, fake, and fraudulent. Our messages should be truthful, honest, and accurate. We should not exaggerate, embellish, or pretend to be someone or something we are not.</i> ["To Sweep the Earth"]<br><br>Following his counsel to be authentic will be more difficult for us, as central-culture Mormons, because for decades we have desired to honor the Lord by always putting our best foot forward. Look down at your feet, if you will. The problem is that nearly every mortal has two feet, and most require both of those feet to stand properly.<br><br>Over the past ten years I have regularly had the punishment and privilege of watching through a one-way mirror as focus groups discuss Mormons. The people in these groups were not just any people; they were selected for these sessions because their beliefs and actions demonstrated that they were likely to respond positively to the message of the Restoration. They were people who believe in Christ, who have their prayers answered, and who believe their relationships will endure beyond death, even if their particular faith doesn't teach that. Quite possibly they were those "who are only kept from the truth because they know not where to find it" (D&amp;amp;C 123:12). And yet these amazing people of faith, when asked to characterize us, said, in no particular order: polygamous, sexist, racist, and exclusionary.<br><br>The first impulse in that situation was always to leap into the other room and correct the misperception, but we had all agreed not to do that, and the experience of the professionals was that the conversation would have quickly disintegrated into "No, we're not."<br><br>"Yes, you are."<br><br>"No, we're not."<br><br>And so on. So we calmed ourselves and went on.<br><br>Now, there are points of history and evidence that can at least be used to argue for these erroneous perceptions, and there has been an exceptionally authentic response of late by the Church to the issues of polygamy, race, and gender, but what is most troubling for me is not those perceptions. It is the widespread opinion that we exclude others from our faith, our communities, our sociality, and our love. How can that be an accurate viewpoint?<br><br>As we probed deeper into the experiences that generated this perception, we bumped into a very understandable cultural phenomenon. The first section of the Doctrine and Covenants identifies us as "the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth" (D&amp;amp;C 1:30). I believe that statement and embrace it. If we take it as a reminder that we are the grateful recipients of the blessings of access to all revealed priesthood keys and ongoing revelation from heaven to guide our actions, then it is a humbling and awe-inspiring statement of our faith. Often though, particularly in testimony meetings, it is used as a contrastive statement of pride, exclusion, and misunderstanding, as if we are more righteous than others, as if we can monopolize truth, and as if being chosen makes us more beloved.<br><br>The first African American family moved into our neighborhood in 1965. My mother, as was her custom, baked fresh bread and went to visit the new family. I peered out the window for her return, anxiously awaiting her report. To her great credit, the fact that they were black didn't make it into the conversation at all. With genuine pleasure she exclaimed that they seemed like "such nice people for being nonmembers."<br><br>In my suburban east side Salt Lake City neighborhood, our social circle mostly consisted of either active members or what we called Jack Mormons, since at the time the handful of Catholics or Presbyterians in the neighborhood had been kept pretty much within polite waving distance. We had little daily interaction with those not of our faith, and my mother's surprise at their goodness affected me. I spent my youth thinking that heaven was for Mormons and that all the other believers were destined for some other place. I told my Greek and Baptist schoolmates as much. I was a little Zoramite, climbing the Rameumptom in my Primary classes and praying, "And again we thank thee, O God, that we are a chosen and a holy people" (Alma 31:18), as if to add, "and the rest of Your children are not."<br><br>Imagine my awakening as my work over the last thirty years in fifty countries has acquainted me with thousands of our Heavenly Father's beloved children who are amazing and faithful souls. In Egypt I worked for months with Ahmed Sami, the producer of <i>Death on the Nile.</i> He was a devoted Muslim, a father, and a truly ethical businessman in a country ripe with corruption at its cultural and political roots. Without even knowing the word, he voluntarily tithed himself to the benefit of the poor. He spoke of many miracles and answered prayers. He often reminded me of Christ's injunction to be "wise as serpents, and harmless as doves" (Matthew 10:16). If I ever make it to the "entry queue" for the celestial kingdom, I expect him to be standing up there ahead, well in front of me, with the season-ticket holders.<br><br>While in Egypt we honored the promise the Church had made not to proselyte, but I have no worry for the state of Ahmed's soul. Why? Because apostles remind us often of the Lord's statement in 2 Nephi 27:20 that "I am able to do mine own work," and the last two sections of the Doctrine and Covenants reiterate that the Lord has a plan for the redemption and exaltation of those who have died without the gospel and its ordinances (see D&amp;amp;C 137 and 138).<br><br>All of God's children need to have an opportunity to hear the gospel, exercise their agency, and have access to the plan of salvation, or God would cease to be God. He lets us serve in our sacred responsibilities as missionaries both for our mortal trial and learning and to gather His elect, who hear His voice and doubtless have particular service to render here and hereafter. So as we seek authenticity, it would serve us to remember that all men are children of our Heavenly Father and all "come short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23).<br><br>Since the reality of <i>our</i> own weaknesses and continual striving to overcome our failings is obvious to all who observe us--trust me--others find us most authentic when we acknowledge that trailing foot as well and don't just champion the best foot forward, pretending we have two "right" feet. I like this quote:<br><br><i>I love that man better who swears a stream as long as my arm yet deals justice to his neighbors and mercifully deals his substance to the poor, than the long, smooth-faced hypocrite.</i><br><br><i>I do not want you to think that I am very righteous, for I am not.</i><br><br>This same person also said, "There was one good man and his name was Jesus" (<i>HC</i> 5:401).<br><br>Though this sounds like a focus-group participant talking, it was actually Joseph Smith who said those words. He understood the value of acknowledging what I like to call "the state of striving" in any effort to persuade, lest we hold ourselves to a standard--with our protestations or our posts or tweets or pins--that any observer could call pride in self rather than love for God and man.<br><br>Please don't assume that I am calling for a disclosure of all our personal failings anytime we desire to rejoice or for a mandatory review of our sins as a preface to our posts. We have all seen too much information online and cringed. I am simply asking that we make sure the pictures we present of ourselves have two feet walking toward God, reflecting His glory and not our own.<br><br>This has ramifications for the way we communicate to all those who share our values but not our membership. I was taught in Primary to interact with those not of our faith using what we called "the golden questions": What do you know about the Mormon Church? and Would you like to know more?<br><br>If we applied that advice in today's social climate, would it work? Imagine using it on a personal interactive basis. Let's say I boarded a plane, sat next to a fellow traveler, and declared: "Hi, I'm Scott Swofford. What do you know about me? Would you like to know more?" I am pretty sure a call button would be pressed and I would be relocated, if not removed from the plane.<br><br>The most authentic way to enter a gospel discussion is to first seek to understand. I have experimented with the following approach when seated on a plane: "Good morning. I like those shoes." The dialogue is now underway on a positive note.<br><br>Eventually it gets us to "Is this flight outbound or returning home for you?"<br><br>Inevitably they will ask me where home is, and I am lucky in that admitting I'm from Utah is like setting a timer on a predictable response. Three, two, one: "Are you Mormon?"<br><br>Now, I could launch into my memorized first discussion, but it is in Japanese, so instead I usually reply, "Yes. And you?" I then pay genuine attention to a lot of information about this new friend--their thoughts on faith, their struggles, and their current frame of mind. Then I am ready for the Spirit to direct the next move.<br><br>Am I encouraging timidity or restraint in opening our mouths? No. Am I celebrating weakness? Yes! The Lord said:<br><br><i>I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</i> [Ether 12:27]<br><br>Clearly, weakness and the recognition of it, the humility that follows, and the application of faith in Christ are essential to our eternal progression. Weakness is also the key to authenticity.<br><br>During the "I'm a Mormon" research we learned that the most powerful myth-dispelling force was personal exposure to the lives of our members. More powerful than any argument, firsthand knowledge was the secret weapon. When we met someone who held inaccurate beliefs, we would say, "Do you know any Mormons?"<br><br>The answer was usually something like, "Yes, one of our vendors is a Mormon."<br><br>"Well, does he have two wives?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"Does he behave in a discriminatory way toward women or people of different backgrounds?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"Has he invited you to participate socially in his life?"<br><br>"Yes. We've been out to dinner."<br><br>"So how do you explain this contradiction between your beliefs and your experience?"<br><br>"Well, he must be an exception."<br><br>We learned that people need five to ten exceptions in their lives before they will adjust their misperceptions of Latter-day Saints, thus the profiles on Mormon.org--thousands of virtual, relatable, striving followers of Christ.<br><br>After those experiences provided me with a valuable clue about what makes us relevant to others, I came to BYUtv. We knew from our research that good writing, good drama, and powerful television draw at their most inspired levels on the capability of flawed characters, whether real or imagined, to accomplish amazing things. That is our story as humans. The Atonement takes the small and simple beings that we are and makes us heirs to "all that [the] Father hath" (D&amp;amp;C 84:38). We began as a team to craft such shows, striving to "see the good in the world" amidst all of our human flaws. If I judge our success by the letters I receive from some well-meaning Saints, we have ruined the channel. We try to take these comments into consideration and then proceed carefully with our approved direction.<br><br>The most popular show when I arrived was a quilting show, Fons and Porter's <i>Love of Quilting.</i> The week I arrived it pulled 8,700 households. Now, following the counsel of our leaders and with an amazing creative and distribution family in place, some of our shows can be seen by a million-plus viewers in a week and receive sixty-three million digital views in a year. Many of those views are by those not of our faith, and we hear from thousands of them whose expectations of us were violated in the positive.<br><br>It is our weakness and our need to overcome sin that binds us to the Savior. In Luke we read:<br><br><i>Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.</i><br><br><i>The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.</i><br><br><i>I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.</i><br><br><i>And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.</i><br><br><i>I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</i> [Luke 18:10–14]<br><br>Often bitter and gnashing voices focus on some personal weakness of Church leaders, both general and local, in an attempt to justify refusal to follow their counsel. I find these protestations, whether historical or current, to have the opposite effect on me. If these leaders can accomplish such virtuous, lovely things as humans and therefore flawed characters, then there is hope for me, a sinner. I have myself witnessed members of the ruling councils of this Church make decisions that in no way aligned with what I knew their personal opinions to be because the Spirit of the Lord had wrought upon them otherwise. What more joyous witness can there be than knowing heaven is in charge? Those not of our faith resonate with the message of the gospel best when it is presented by messengers who jump in with both feet and acknowledge their striving state.<br><br>Authenticity also implies an attempt to speak in a situational language our audience can understand. A few years ago I had the opportunity to role-play with English-speaking MTC missionaries. I chose to play a husband who had just lost his wife. I decided to go easy on the missionaries, and after welcoming them to my "home," I spoke about my grief at the loss of my imaginary spouse and my sincere need to understand her whereabouts. I felt I had given them an obvious approach to take. "Man," I thought to myself, "I wish I had seen such a golden investigator on my mission."<br><br>Their fresh young faces looked up at me, and they opened their scriptures and began to enthusiastically launch into what was their most comfortable vehicle: the story of the Restoration. "In the spring of 1820 in upstate New York . . ."<br><br>I stopped them. "Now elders, listen to what I just asked and see if there is a more comforting approach." I repeated my deep yearning for knowledge about the state of the soul after death.<br><br>With even brighter smiles they began again: "In the spring of 1820 in upstate New York . . ."<br><br>And this time I just let them talk. You see, to them the story of the Restoration is so central, so relevant, that it was of course the answer. We would all agree that the words of Alma about the Resurrection that I wanted them to quote or the messages about the sealing power that I was hoping for would not be ours without the Prophet Joseph, but they were just a little too ready to use their new MTC squirt guns to squirt the gospel on me and feel that they had done their job. I wanted them to also take responsibility for the absorption of that message. Their testimonies of Joseph Smith would be critical to my understanding as an "investigator," but they were out of place in messaging hierarchy. If these elders had caught my situational questions and affirmed that their message had the answer I was seeking about my dear departed, I would have been happy to wade through any lesson on the Restoration, even in questionable Finnish or Tagalog or Swahili. Likewise, as we strive for authenticity, we need to listen and construct a message hierarchy.<br><br>The Savior could easily have taught "love your enemies" (Matthew 5:44) with a simple pronouncement, and He did so on occasion. He also used a much more engaging method: "A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves" (Luke 10:30). Now that is a terrific opening, of course belonging to the parable of the good Samaritan. Both approaches eventually arrive at the same place--love your enemies--but one follows a messaging strategy that I have seen work countless times in my career from behind the one-way mirrors.<br><br>I am aware that by advocating a change in our approach to the world I have perhaps created another "should," and the sad reality is that "you should" can become the enemy of "I would." I saw an effective illustration of this principle once. The presenter stood a life-size cardboard cutout of a Latter-day Saint in the front of the room and began to place Post-it notes on it to represent every commandment, responsibility, expectation, program, activity, area of emphasis, and worthy endeavor members of the Church are repeatedly asked to apply themselves to. The image of the person was quickly obliterated and overwhelmed. I feel that way often. The only way for me to find a way forward is to remember that the Savior found a way to make it all simple, as He was so adept at doing. He took the mass of instructions, policies, commandments, and traditions and made them only two:<br><br><i>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</i><br><br><i>This is the first and great commandment.</i><br><br><i>And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</i><br><br><i>On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</i> [Matthew 22:37–40]<br><br>When I need a gut check in the decision-making process, I don't always have with me the laminated card they handed out at the last leadership meeting. Instead I weigh my options against those two commandments.<br><br>It is clear that Jesus, for whom the answer to nearly all questions is love, surely loves us all. He loves the professor who came up with a perfectly good lesson plan thirty years ago and now that he is old "will not depart from it" (Proverbs 22:6). He loves the ineffective politician. He loves the guy who asks you out once and then never calls again. He loves the roommate who steals your milk. He loves the people who know Him by names we cannot pronounce, who chant to Him, who dance for Him, who kneel five times a day on little rugs, or who touch a mezuzah at their comings and goings. He loves the primitive Amazon natives who enact familiar rituals, the origin of which they do not understand (but I do). He even loves Pharisees, although to be honest He was sort of tough on them during His mortal ministry.<br><br>That love is the answer to any procedural question because it dictates through the Spirit how we are to approach each specific child of God and each specific audience. It is different for each encounter, and following that pure love of Christ under the direction of the Spirit is the ultimate communications trump card. It is divinely authentic.<br><br>I leave you with three guidelines for putting both feet forward. Feel free to laminate these for your wallet--or just put them on a sticky note on your forehead.<br><br>1. If your virtues must be extolled, it is always better to have a third party do it. Really.<br><br>2. If doing it yourself is unavoidable, start by expressing love and genuine admiration for your audience. What will follow is then less likely to be offensive.<br><br>3. When in doubt, follow dear Nephi's example:<br><br><i>Nevertheless, notwithstanding the great goodness of the Lord, in showing me his great and marvelous works, my heart exclaimeth: O wretched man that I am! Yea, my heart sorroweth because of my flesh; my soul grieveth because of mine iniquities.</i><br><br><i>I am encompassed about, because of the temptations and the sins which do so easily beset me.</i><br><br><i>And when I desire to rejoice, my heart groaneth because of my sins; nevertheless, I know in whom I have trusted.</i> [2 Nephi 4:17–19]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, I am a wretched man. My thoughts careen recklessly in and out of the appropriate path. My family, my coworkers, and my bosses will attest that I am often irreverent and annoying. When I served as a bishop, a sister told me in an interview that I was not only glib--a word I had to look up--but that I also had perhaps "the shortest attention span on the planet." Sometimes I think there is no hope.<br><br>It is not God who makes me feel that way in the middle of the night. Weakness and humility lead to hopefulness, not helplessness. But when I calm myself I know there is indeed a bright hope, because I know in whom I have trusted. I believe that if I just keep striving, keep repenting, and don't stop trying to love as He loved, then someday, maybe after a millennium of practice, I will be whole because of His atoning sacrifice for me.<br><br>Today, here in this gathering, I feel His love for you, though you are all also wretched in some way. I know His love will save you and me, and I know that about you because you know in whom you have trusted. I testify that you will go on, with both feet forward--the best foot and the real foot--to do mighty things in His name. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Scott Swofford was the creative director of BYU Broadcasting when he delivered this devotional address on 11 November 2014.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>sons from the Front - Mitt Romney - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is an honor to be here today and to address you. It seems like only a few years ago that I sat where you are sitting--actually, it was in the Wilkinson Center. Things were different then: the Beatles were the only boy band, Bell Telephone was the only telephone company in the country, BYU cafeteria food was all they served in the Cougareat, and Emma was Joseph Smith's only wife.<br><br>I was an English major, and that meant that I liked reading and writing. It also meant that I had no idea what I was going to do with my career. The self-help guides that I read said I was doomed, because they claimed that in order to have a successful life, you had to have a clear goal in mind and then work relentlessly toward that goal.<br><br>But that isn't how life worked out for me. As a matter of fact, almost nothing I have done in my career was planned in advance. I could hardly have predicted that I would get into politics, for instance. When I stepped into the auditorium to debate Ted Kennedy in Boston's famous Faneuil Hall, I turned to Ann and asked, "Sweetie, in your wildest dreams did you ever see me running for U.S. Senate?"<br><br>And she said, "Mitt, you weren't in my ­wildest dreams."<br><br>I have gotten some mileage out of that line, but the truth is she didn't really say that. That was a joke I bought from a campaign joke writer. And every time I hear some politician use that joke, I feel like demanding a royalty.<br><br>You probably know that the most remarkable of my life's journeys was the one I only recently completed, and that was having the honor of running for president of the United States. In case you haven't heard, I lost. Actually, I prefer to say that I won the silver medal. It is something that gives you perspective. After Walter Mondale had the misfortune of running against Ronald Reagan and ­losing badly--he got shellacked in that race--he remarked that he had always wanted to run for president in the worst way. And that is just what he did.<br><br>Despite the loss, the experience was extraordinary and revealing. I have come away more optimistic about the country. I have met people from across the nation--people who don't make the nightly news but who make daily innovations and discoveries that propel our economy and provide for our futures. Ihave met parents who sacrifice their resources and their careers, in some cases, for their kids, and I have met military men and women who willingly serve in some of the world's most hostile environments. And while it is fashionable in some circles to deny it, I firmly believe that America is the greatest nation on earth.<br><br>The experiences I had during my campaign also impressed upon me singular life lessons. Ithought I might share a few of them with you today.<br><h2><b>Reaching Out</b></h2><br>At the beginning of a campaign you experience a good deal of what I call unwelcome anonymity: nobody knows who you are. Occasionally someone would come up to me and say, "You look familiar. Who are you?"<br><br>I have a standard response to this. I reply, "I'm Tom Brady of the New England Patriots."<br><br>This evokes a predictable laugh. But there was one time, however, when a fellow said, "Oh, I'm a fan. Can I get a picture?"<br><br>And I said, "Sure." I can only imagine the guffaws when he proudly showed that picture to his friends.<br><br>There was another time when I was reminded of my anonymity. I was at a Marriott hotel in San Francisco, and I had arranged for a massage to loosen my back. After hundreds and hundreds of handshakes in a day, my back got tight on the right side. After the massage, the masseuse, who obviously was unaware of my political career, remarked to my assistant, "Mr. Romney has strong legs. He is a dancer, isn't he?" That's probably the best compliment I got during the campaign.<br><br>But the anonymity is soon lost, and in some remarkable ways. During my last campaign Iwas taken aside by one of our national security agencies, and I was informed that all my emails were being closely read by a foreign government. In fact, the same was true for all the people who had emailed me--my staff, friends, and family. Their emails were also being monitored by that government.<br><br>The words of a hymn came to mind: "Angels above us are silent notes taking Of ev'ry action; then do what is right!"<sup>1</sup> The government involved was no angel, but our words and deeds may well be recorded in heaven--and, I presume, so are the pages we open on the Internet and the sites we browse. Our anonymous surfing may not be recorded on earth, but it surely leaves an imprint in the book of life. Remember, every day you are writing your autobiography.<br><br>Early in a campaign it can be difficult to attract an audience to a political rally, particularly if it is during working hours. I remember one event we had scheduled in New Hampshire. We have a summer home in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, but the rally was at least an hour away from our home. I knew that the media that followed the campaign would read a lot into whether or not I had attracted a crowd to this event. So you can imagine how relieved I was to step onto the stage and see a large and enthusiastic audience greeting me. Looking closer, I realized I was looking at almost the entire Wolfeboro Branch of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Fortunately the media hadn't figured that out!<br><br>There may be times in your life when you feel that it is a bit of a burden being a member of the Church. Some folks will think you are not Christian, some may be insulted that you don't drink with them, and others may think you are trying to be better than them by not swearing. But based on that experience and many others in my life, I can affirm that your fellow members of the Church will be a blessing that far more than compensates. They will bless you when you are sick, lift you up when you fall, help you raise a teenager, counsel you about a job, and, yes, even move your unpacked junk into an apartment. We are not perfect. As a matter of fact, in many things we are probably no better than anyone else, but we are remarkably good as a people at reaching out our hands toone another in need. Decide to be one of those who does just that.<br><h2><b>Incomparable Worth</b></h2><br>A campaign can be a heady thing as well. At my first 2012 presidential debate, in Denver, the miles of interstate expressway from my hotel to the auditorium were closed to all ­traffic--for me. My motorcade was led by thirty or so police motorcycles and vehicles flashing their red and blue lights. I was accompanied by the Secret Service, which included not only the detail of agents that surrounded Ann and me in our bulletproof SUV but also the tactical unit that followed, armed with machine guns and sitting with an open tailgate, facing any vehicle that might come from behind us.<br><br>The Secret Service was only the icing on the adulation cake. Day after day, thousands of people were shouting my name, investing in me their hopes for victory. The day before the election, Kid Rock electrified a packed arena in New Hampshire for me, and when we were introduced, the crowd cheered for Ann and me for three solid minutes before we could speak.<br><br>The day after the election was different. TheSecret Service was gone. They had asked to stay on another week, but we felt that was an unnecessary imposition on them and the taxpayers. The cheers were gone as well, replaced by the agonizing reappraisal by others of what had gone wrong. I was back to driving my own car, filling my own gas tank, and buying groceries at Costco, just like I had been doing for several decades before.<br><br>Truthfully, Ann and I had never become caught up in all the flurry. I know that may be hard to believe, but throughout the journey we saw ourselves in exactly the same way we have throughout our marriage. We knew that win or lose, any acclaim would eventually be forgotten. As Jimmy Durante once sang, "Fame, if you win it, comes and goes in a minute."<sup>2</sup><br><br>What we treasure from the campaign was not the pomp and the popularity, it was the friends we made. We became very close with anumber of the Secret Service agents we spent time with. In fact, as we prepared to go onto the stage to concede the victory to President Barack Obama, more than one of those agents fought back tears. We miss them as friends--not as power candy.<br><br>Living life can be self-consuming: who youare can be overshadowed by what you door by what you have done. If you allow that to happen, the inevitable twists and turns of secular life can warp your self-­confidence, limit your ambition, test your faith, and depress your happiness. You are not defined by secular measures. You are a child of a Heavenly Father who loves you. Youare His work and His glory. And that statement confirms your incomparable worth. It also informs your life's most important work: to lift others, to lift your family and your spouse if you're married, and to remain true and faithful to the Almighty.<br><h2><b>Work Hard</b></h2><br>Now, I can't speak of my election loss without adding a few thoughts about how I think God works. I know that's well above my pay grade. But after five decades of adult life and many years of pastoring in the Church, I have come to some preliminary conclusions.<br><br>First, God does not always intervene in the affairs of men to make things work out the way we would like them to. In our heads we all know that. But I can't tell you how many members of the Church I have spoken with over my life who think God will help their business succeed or help them get the promotion they want or make their investments profitable. I don't think God will intervene to help you get rich. There may be exceptions, but I wouldn't count on it. What He does guarantee is written in Doctrine and Covenants 90:24:<br><br><i> Search diligently, pray always, and be believing, and all things shall work together for your good, if ye walk uprightly and remember the covenant wherewith ye have covenanted one withanother.</i><br><br>I once rode in a car with Elder F. Enzio Busche, then of the Seventy. As I recall the ­conversation--and it has been a while--he related that when he was a businessman in Germany, the company that he owned was in dire condition, on a path toward bankruptcy and liquidation. He was distraught. One night, in great pain and sadness, he went into a field, knelt in the cold and dark, and poured out his heart to the Lord, hour after hour. Miraculously, he actually heard a voice from heaven. But only one word was spoken: <i>work.</i><br><br>More often than not, our secular affairs are up to us. Don't count on God to save you from the consequences of your decisions or to arrange earthly affairs to work in your favor.<br><h2><b>Purpose and Perspective</b></h2><br>One of the things I think defines the great majority of Americans I met during the campaign and afterward is that they live for a ­purpose greater than themselves--their school, their university, their community, their nation, their church. During my campaign Ann and I were frequently reminded of our greater purpose.<br><br>You may find it hard to imagine what it is like to debate an opponent on national tele­vision. I was not a high school debater. In fact, until I got into politics, the only person I had ever debated was my five-year-old son Matt. And he usually won.<br><br>My 2012 campaign had twenty-three televised debates--twenty with fellow Republicans and three with President Obama. These guys were no debate slouches. Newt Gingrich had been Speaker of the House, and President Obama had been president for four years. He kind of had his facts nailed down by then.<br><br>You may have read that one of the candidates this year for governor of Florida put a fan under his podium when he debated. I know why: debating can be sweaty business.<br><br>Before every one of my debates I did something to keep things in perspective, to keep myself grounded. At the top of the sheet of paper that was always placed on the podium so we could make notes during the debate, I wrote one word: <i>Dad.</i> I also drew a small image of the sun. Throughout the debate, when I would glance down at that paper to look at the notes I had taken, I was reminded of my father's fearlessness in fighting for what he believed was right. And the sun? That reminded me of course of the familiar scripture "Let your light so shine."<sup>3</sup> Whether I won or lost that debate, I hoped I would never do anything that would dishonor or discredit the things I hold most dear.<br><br>During your life you are going to encounter circumstances that will make you sweat. For many of you the exams and tests won't be over when you graduate. You will all stand at podiums, stand in front of a boss to ask for a raise, or work on some critical project in your employment that will make a big difference in your life. At moments like those, perspective is a very powerful friend. You can welcome perspective through preparatory prayer, by considering the blessings of the temple, or by simply glancing at your CTR ring. Find ways to keep your life in perspective.<br><h2><b>Heroes Needed</b></h2><br>One of the most meaningful aspects of my campaign was meeting remarkable people. Imet Lech Wałęsa in Poland. When the Soviet Union invaded Poland, they rounded up thousands of that nation's most influential people, and then they shot them. There was to be no leader available for a revolt. And against that backdrop, this shipyard electrician said no--noto the oppression and no to the Soviets. Heformed a union--Solidarity--of fellow workers and created a barricade behind ship­yard gates. And the communists blinked. What followed was a movement that led to the freedom of an entire nation.<br><br>When I met this hero, I was honored. He welcomed me in and said, "You have come a long way. You must be tired. You sit, I'll talk, you listen."<br><br>And so I did. Time and again he implored, "The world needs American leadership. Where is American leadership?" He would go region by region of the world and say, "We need American leadership."<br><br>At the end of our meeting--and I had said almost nothing--he endorsed my candidacy for president. He taught me a lesson. I guess I don't recall being more humbled than Iwas that day with Lech Wałęsa.<br><br>I also met Cardinal Timothy Dolan in the rectory of New York City. His is a mighty voice for religious freedom.<br><br>I met Billy Graham at his mountain home. He prayed for me. His, of course, is a voice that has long called people to come to Jesus.<br><br>I met the former Lutheran bishop of Stockholm. His counsel on judging other religions was instructive. He said that he had three rules for understanding another faith: First, learn about that faith from one of its adherents, not from one of its detractors. Second, compare the best of one religion with the best of another, not the best of one with the worst of another. And third, leave room for religious jealousy.<br><br>I inquired what he meant by religious jealousy. He explained that in every religion he has encountered, there is something he wishes were also part of his religion. Among Mormons, he spoke of our missionary program; among Catholics, their reverence for the Pope.<br><br>From all the admirable and heroic people I met, I was impressed with the enormity of the influence of one single person. Time and again, one person makes all the difference in the lives of multitudes. One man ushered in the freedom of an entire nation. One man led an evangelical awakening. And, as we know, one man restored the Church of Jesus Christ to theearth.<br><br>Each of you here will influence other lives. Think of that. Perhaps you will shape history; perhaps you will shape one person's history. Consider with care how you act, what you say, and what you devote your life to, because, Iassure you, your choices will shape the lives ofother people.<br><br>I met others during my campaign I call heroes, though not quite so famous. At one of my first speeches in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, the applause from the audience seemed to be instigated by someone with a loud, piercing shout. "Isn't he wonderful?" she would yell, or "We love you, Mitt! You're the best!" I can assure you that I was as pleased as I was startled.<br><br>After my remarks, this delightful middle-aged woman named Joni Scotter made her way up to the stage and threw her arms around me. That was the first time I met Joni, but it was far from the last. Over the years of campaigning I have seen Joni dozens of times. She drove to wherever I was in eastern Iowa. And at every speech, her enthusiastic squeals of support energized both me and the audience. She is a hero to me.<br><br>One day, as my motorcade approached a rally in New Hampshire, I noticed that someone had gone way over the top in decorating his pickup truck. He had built a scaffolding of sorts in the back of his truck and had mounted enormous Romney posters on both sides of it. The rest of the truck was entirely decked out with my bumper stickers and flags and posters. There was a man standing next to it. He was tall and white haired; he smoked a pipe and wore Bermuda shorts and long white tube socks that came up to his knees.<br><br>A few days later when I was pulling into an event in Iowa, I saw the same truck. In fact, it seemed that wherever I went, that truck was parked out front and that man in the white tube socks was standing next to it. That may not seem so unusual, but I was flying from place to place and he was driving.<br><br>This man, Jim Wilson, turned out to be seventy years old. By the midpoint of my 2012 campaign, he had attended 150 of my events and had logged 40,000 miles on his 1998 GMC pickup. On one of his long drives, some guys ata fuel stop gave him some lip about his support for me. He left, but shortly thereafter he looked in the bed of his truck and saw that his posters and scaffolding were on fire. Soon the entire truck was engulfed--and totaled.<br><br>Of course we decided to help Jim get another pickup truck--how could I possibly goto a rally without Jim Wilson and his truck at the entrance?<br><br>This October I was in Iowa again to campaign for a candidate who was running for U.S. Senate, and there was Jim Wilson. Kindly he presented me with a brand-new pair of white tube socks. Jim is also one of my heroes.<br><br>By the way, running for president was a family affair, and I'm not just talking about my immediate family. Cousins and in-laws Ann and I had not seen for decades showed up at events and volunteered hundreds of hours at campaign offices. One niece painted my portrait for a poster. My family members are my heroes.<br><br>America needs heroes. You don't have to be larger than life to be a hero, just larger than yourself. We see heroes every day--Scoutmasters, Primary teachers, missionaries, campaign volunteers, parents. I hope you will choose to be a hero, because this world needs a lot more of them.<br><h2><b>Life Coach</b></h2><br>One of the best and worst things about a campaign is that you get a lot of advice. Usually several times a day someone in an audience would hand me a letter with their 100 percent surefire way for me to win the election. I was told to take bigger steps when Iwalked to show that I am young and athletic. Another person said I should stop shaving for a few days to look more sexy. As if I needed that!<br><br>Of course, the best advice comes from the people closest to you. Having been a frequent speaker in church, I figured I didn't need a lot of advice on giving a speech. Wrong. Political speeches are different than church speeches. My dad, when he was the governor of Michigan, joked that he had once ended a campaign speech with "in the name of Jesus Christ, amen." My error wasn't that obvious, but my chief strategist helped me shorten my long stories, find applause lines, and slow down.<br><br>Advice from your spouse can be a tricky thing. Ann is my best advisor, but I also look uniquely to her for affirmation and support. She has perfected the art of first heaping on the praise and then ever so gently ladling on a word of advice, because when it comes to marriage, "reproving betimes with sharpness"<sup>4</sup> is not a good idea. It can lead to many lone and dreary nights.<br><br>Just like I did during the campaign, you need to have a life coach. You need someone who will tell you the truth, tell you that the perfect mate you have been looking for is no more perfect than you are, tell you when you are wrong, and tell you what you need to do to make things right.<br><br>I can assure you that finding someone who cares enough about you to tell you the truth and then is willing to take time to give you their counsel and their coaching is invaluable. Look for it.<br><h2><b>Christ in the Foundation</b></h2><br>One of my fondest campaign memories is my trip to Israel. I had dinner at the home of an old Israeli friend whom I had come to know at my first job after business school at the Boston Consulting Group. At that time he called himself Ben Natay because his real name was too difficult for some Americans to pronounce. Today we know him as Bibi Netanyahu, and he serves as Israel's prime minister.<br><br>I also had the opportunity there to address an audience in front of the historic Jerusalem city wall.<br><br>Ann and I stayed at the beautiful King David Hotel, opened in 1931. Our room had a breathtaking view of the Old City. As we were unpacking, Ann remarked with dismay that she had left her Bible at home. A few moments later there was a knock at our door, and an Israeli security guard handed her a Bible. Apparently, he was listening to everything said in our room. Again, "angels ... are silent notes taking."<sup>5</sup><br><br>Our son Josh, who had joined us on this trip, noted a large leather book that sat on the coffee table in our room. It was the guest book for the hotel, and it was signed by many of the dignitaries who had stayed there. We saw the signatures of Margaret Thatcher, Jimmy Carter, President Obama, Richard Nixon, GeorgeH.W. Bush, Tony Blair, and alsoMadonna and Bono. We were duly impressed.<br><br>The next day Ann and Josh went to see the garden tomb believed to be Jesus's final earthly resting place. Of course His signature is not in the King David Hotel guest book. Unlike the hotel's famous guests, He was not only a visitor to Jerusalem, He was its very foundation.<br><br>We can never forget that we are His disciples. We may not hobnob with the famous, but in prayer we can speak with God every day.<br><br>I am so very thankful that I found The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Ithas informed who I am and to what my life has been devoted. It has provided the eternal ordinances of salvation and marriage. I love the Church. I love the members of the Church. I love the music of the Church. It is my witness to each of you that following its precepts and its prophets will bring incomparable happiness, now and forever. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Mitt Romney was the former governor of Massachusetts when this forum address was delivered on 18 November 2014.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1>You Envision in Life? - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear friends, what a privilege it is for Christiane and me to be here with you. As we discuss important and eternal matters today, you soon will recognize that I am German, not only because of my funny accent but also because of my very direct approach. In the German language we refer to the idiom <i>mit jemanden Deutsch reden,</i> which would directly translate to "talking German to someone." It means to express things in a simple, very clear, and direct manner so that no one can misunderstand. So now you know what you will have to put up with today.<br><br>The time between Thanksgiving and New Year's Eve is a very special time of the year. As the days get shorter, the nights grow longer, and the temperatures drop lower, we seek light and warmth. These elements are found in abundance in all the Christmas lighting that surrounds us. It is in these dark months that we enjoy the shining candles in the house, a romantic candlelight dinner with someone we love, or--if we find time--relaxing a little by just sitting and reading a good book close to a crackling fireplace.<br><br>Christmas lights, candles, and open fireplaces provide light and warmth. They not only make us feel cozy but also help us to direct our thoughts to the source of all light: the Light of Life, the Light of the World, even our Savior Jesus Christ. Celebrating His birth and pondering His life remind us of the dependency we have upon His light and the gratitude we feel for the mortal and eternal blessings of His Atonement. This season also helps us realize what matters most in life and often is a time of serious personal reflection and evaluation as we consider the past and contemplate the future.<br><br>Sadly and far too often this wonderful season of reevaluation becomes "the time of good intentions," when our resolutions to be better end in "sudden death" within a few days or weeks into the new year. As a boy I often set New Year's resolutions with great excitement and enthusiasm. My mother, observing my weaknesses and sometimes my failure to carry out these goals, used to say, "The road to hell is paved with good intentions."<br><br>I suspect all of us fall short in totally living up to our resolutions. But we ought to try to do better--especially those of us who know the importance of committing ourselves to follow the real Light of the World. To us the prophet Isaiah said, "Let us walk in the light of the Lord."<sup>1</sup><br><br>To walk in this light, our lives need a long-term orientation based on knowledge and conviction--knowledge of who we really are and the purpose of our creation as well as a conviction of our eternal destiny. We know that we are sons and daughters of a loving Heavenly Father. As such, we know He wants us to fill "the measure of [our] creation."<sup>2</sup> He wants us to find joy and happiness in this life and ultimately reach our destination of immortality and eternal life "crowned with glory, even with the presence of God the Father."<sup>3</sup><br><br>Now I am looking into your eyes and seeing your smiling faces. As I try to envision your dreams and feel your hopes, I think back to when I was as young as you are now. Just having returned from my mission, I was dating a beautiful girl who, after a short period of nervous resistance, fearful investigation, and doubtful anticipation, finally decided to put up with me and give me an honest try. She now is the mother of our seven children, is as beautiful as always, and is sitting here with us on the stand today.<br><br>In my youth and young adult years I often asked myself this question: "Erich, where will you be ten years from now?" (Now that I am getting older, I'm not so interested in that question anymore.) I remember well how my dreams and visions for my future had an important impact upon the decisions that I made.<br><br>For example, when I was a young boy our extended family often got together to celebrate birthdays. Among the families were nine children, and every birthday was like a mini family reunion. Aunt Anni was my favorite because she seemed to be the never-tiring playmate. She would wrestle with us, play funny games, and just spend time with us. We loved her laugh, her excitement, and her enthusiasm. She never seemed to be depressed or to have a bad day. I still get excited just thinking about her.<br><br>Because of her example I envisioned that my future wife would be like her. I wanted my wife to be lively and full of excitement and enthusiasm. In my dream I even saw her as a grandmother, running around with her grandchildren, never tired, and always happy. Somehow I had internalized that vision so much that this became the model I was looking for, and guess what? This is exactly what I was blessed to receive. Christiane is full of excitement and enthusiasm, and she loves to play with the children and grandchildren. They love her and I love being around her.<br><br>The lesson to be learned from this example is that dreams and visions are important. They determine the directions, goals, and priorities we are setting for our lives. The scriptures teach the following: "Where there is <i>no vision,</i> the people <i>perish. </i>"<sup>4</sup><br><br>Sometimes our understanding of a principle is enhanced if we reverse the phrasing, which in this case would read: "Where there <i>is a vision,</i> the people <i>flourish."</i> I truly believe this to be true because I have witnessed it in my own life and in the lives of many others around me.<br><br>The scripture then continues, "But he that keepeth the law, happy is he."<sup>5</sup><br><br>This brings me to ask you two very personal questions: What is your personal vision for your life? and What are you doing to fulfill it?<br><h2><b>A Vision of Joy and Happiness</b></h2><br>Something every one of us envisions is to be happy in our lives. One of the divine purposes of our very existence is to experience joy and happiness. Lehi taught, "Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy."<sup>6</sup> The prophet Joseph F. Smith saw in a vision that the resurrection of the righteous to eternal life will bring them "a fulness of joy."<sup>7</sup><br><br>In his famous dream the prophet Lehi beheld that the fruit of the tree of life "was desirable to make one happy."<sup>8</sup> This is why Alma described the plan God has for us, His children, as "the great plan of happiness."<sup>9</sup> Joy and happiness are inseparably connected with choosing the lifestyle God has in mind for us, making covenants with Him, and keeping His commandments with all our "might, mind and strength."<sup>10</sup><br><br>This joy is not to be confused with the pleasures of the world. Real happiness and joy have little to do with the amount of money in my bank account, the size of my home, the number of expensive (and, of course, German) cars registered in my name, or the most mind-boggling and ever-important question: "My dear, will the new boat fit into our garage?"<br><br>True happiness and joy arise from our relationship with the Father and the Son and our knowledge that we are completely in tune with Them. They also stem from the loving relationships we have with the people who surround us. Therefore, "in this life [we] shall have joy, and again in the flesh [we] shall see God."<sup>11</sup> The quality and congeniality in our relationships with our spouses, children, grandchildren, friends, and associates determine the level of joy in our lives. We will be increasingly happy if we and our loved ones are living "after the manner of happiness."<sup>12</sup><br><br>My dear young friends, have you already established a clear and strong vision for your life that includes the pillars of real happiness and joy? If not, I invite you to do so; if you have, I invite you to embrace your vision with all your heart. It will inspire and guide you in all the critical decisions that you are making during this wonderful season of your life.<br><br>Let me share with you a doctrine that will help you reach your righteous desire and yearning for happiness more than anything else. If clearly understood and applied, it will bring joy and tremendous security into your life, independent from any circumstances you may face. This doctrine reaches far beyond this earthly life right into eternity. I am talking about the doctrine of the family.<br><h2><b>The Doctrine of the Family</b></h2><br>The concept of family and family life as a true source for happiness has been terribly hollowed out in recent decades. The traditional family is under attack from many different sources worldwide. But there are other pitfalls and risks that even relate to some of us who know about the importance, divinity, and eternal destiny of the family. Influenced by the world and its enticements, the increasing desire for self-centered fulfillment, and the inclination for comfort or for making things easy, we put the family and our happiness under stress. All too often happiness in our life is defined by the quality of our "all-around carefree package," which we hope to achieve and retain in a "low-investment, high-return" mode.<br><br>But life does not work in this way. It was never intended to be easy. The Lord said to Joseph Smith: "For after much tribulation come the blessings. Wherefore the day cometh that ye shall be crowned with much glory."<sup>13</sup><br><br>The Lord has clearly revealed how to develop and retain strong families. We all are invited to study and apply the principles set forth in "The Family: A Proclamation to the World." Additionally, we need to recognize that drawing personal strength and happiness from family life requires some sacrifice and faith.<br><br>The family proclamation states "that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children." It further states "that God's commandment for His children to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force."<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1995/11/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>14</sup></a><br><br>Among many, the image and purpose of the family has drastically changed. Increasingly, society is adopting the so-called "soul mate" model of marriage, which focuses on the needs and feelings of the adults as opposed to those of the children. As a result, many enter marriage after a long-standing relationship rather than moving forward after an appropriate courtship. Finding the perfect match, testing a relationship by cohabitation without the benefit of marriage, or securing a lavish lifestyle that will be backed by a robust prenuptial agreement have become common practices among many before they even consider marriage.<br><br>Scripture and modern-day prophets teach us differently. We build our marriages on the foundation of chastity and fidelity, with the intent to establish and rear a family. The prophet of my youth, President Spencer W. Kimball, taught:<br><br><i>The lighted way, then, brings us to normal, clean courting of young men and women, coming eventually to a virtuous union at an altar where a fully authorized servant of God seals the union for eternity. The Hebrew Saints were properly taught, "Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge." (Hebrews 13:4.) </i><br><br><i>And to those who might decry marriage or postpone it or forbid it, Paul spoke, condemning them. It is generally selfishness, cold and self-centered, which leads people to shun marriage responsibility. </i><br><br>President Kimball continued:<br><br><i>There are many who talk and write against marriage. Even some of our own delay marriage and argue against it. . . . We call upon all people to accept normal marriage as a basis for true happiness. . . . Basically marriage presupposes a family. The psalmist said: "Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is his reward. . . . Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them." (Psalm 127:3, 5.) </i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1974/04/guidelines-to-carry-forth-the-work-of-god-in-cleanliness?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>15</sup></a><br><br>When Christiane and I were young, these were the words of our living prophet, and we trusted and followed his advice. We knelt across the altar of the Swiss Temple, being only twenty-two and twenty years of age. We were worthy of the covenant, we had no real clue of what to expect, we had no work experience or finished education, and we were as poor as church mice. All that we had in abundance was our love for each other and a lot of naïve enthusiasm. But we began building our world together. We did not postpone having children, and we needed to support each other in getting our educations. We strongly believed in the Lord's promise that "if ye do keep his commandments he doth bless you and prosper you."<sup>16</sup><br><br>And He did. When we married, Christiane was in nursing school. Our vision included having her finish her degree, but at the same time we also made a conscious decision to begin fulfilling our dream of having a family. As a result, our first child was born about two weeks before Christiane passed her final exam as a certified nurse.<br><br>However, we knew that even in our marriage there would be stumbling blocks, challenges, and some difficulties. But we had a simple oral agreement, which we often repeated with smiles on our faces: "If difficulties approach, no manslaughter and no divorce."<br><br>Now, thirty-six years later, we are grateful that we could build this family together. Our faith in God and our relationship with each other have become unshaken as we have seen the hand of the Lord guiding us through the process of building our kingdom in mortality, which at present consists of seven children and six grandchildren. This kingdom will continue to grow, forever and ever.<br><h2><b>The Importance of Sacrifice</b></h2><br>For this vision of happiness we both were ready and willing to sacrifice. We accepted the divinely appointed roles of the father "to preside" and "to provide" and of the mother to "nurture."<sup>17</sup> Sister Julie B. Beck, former general Relief Society president of the Church, stated:<br><br><i>The priesthood role of fathers is to preside and pass priesthood ordinances to the next generation. The priesthood role of mothers is to influence. These are essential, complimentary, and interdependent responsibilities. </i><sup>18</sup><br><br>Helping one another in a marriage and family as equal partners does not mean that we always do the same things or do everything together or in equal shares. We understand and accept different roles given to us by divine design as outlined in the proclamation on the family. We are not following the world in what is described as "emancipation," in which both husband and wife live only to fulfill their own self-interests. We are living the principles of complementariness and completion with respect to each other and to our children.<br><br>In a BYU devotional address given almost thirty years ago, President James E. Faust counseled the sisters to be careful not to do everything at once and to do first what is most important for the family, and then other desires can follow. He said, "To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven."<sup>19</sup> Then he said:<br><br><i>It seems that the new roles of women have not decreased their responsibility because, while the new roles are challenging, the old roles of wife and mother are in the soul and cry out to be satisfied. . . . Fortunately</i> [in most cases, I would like to add], <i>women do not have to track a career like a man does. A woman may fit more than one career into the various seasons of life. She cannot sing all of the verses of her song at the same time. </i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/james-e-faust_message-granddaughters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>20</sup></a><br><h2><b>Striving for the Ideal</b></h2><br>My young friends, some of you may say: "Well, our situation is different. The world today is not ideal. There must be room for exceptions." With regard to making exceptions, President Boyd K. Packer once told the following story:<br><br><i>As mission president, I attended a mission Relief Society conference. Our mission Relief Society president, a relatively recent convert, announced something of a course correction. Some local societies had strayed, and she invited them to conform more closely to the direction set by the general presidency of the Relief Society. </i><br><br><i>One sister in the congregation stood and defiantly told her that they were not willing to follow her counsel, saying they were an exception. A bit flustered, she turned to me for help. I didn't know what to do. I was not interested in facing a fierce woman. So I motioned for her to proceed. Then came the revelation! </i><br><br><i>This lovely Relief Society president, small and somewhat handicapped physically, said with gentle firmness: "Dear sister, we'd like not to take care of the exception first. We will take care of the rule first, and then we will see to the exceptions." The course correction was accepted. </i><br><br>President Packer continued:<br><br><i>Her advice is good for Relief Society and priesthood and for families. When you state a rule and include the exception in the same sentence, the exception is accepted first.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1998/04/the-relief-society?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>21</sup></a><br><br>Therefore I am attempting to teach you the rule or the divine ideal and let you deal with exceptions as you walk the course of your life. In the vision we had for our family, we wanted Christiane to stay home to rear our children. This meant sacrifice. Shortly after we learned that a baby was on its way, Christiane reminded me of the mutual decision we had made even before our wedding day that she would immediately stop working outside the home as soon as a baby was born. I tried to escape what I knew would be additional responsibility by mentioning that she was contributing one-third of our family income. Her simple answer was: "That is your problem. I will take care of the children and you take care of putting food on the table."<br><br>I knew she was right. We had discussed it long before, it was in tune with our vision of family life, it was in tune with the words of the living prophets, and it felt right. So she gave up her well-paying career as a nurse to be close to the children and to meet their daily needs, and I had to get my act together to provide food and shelter. The Lord blessed us to be able to fulfill this aspect of our vision.<br><br>Other important matters, such as parenting, teaching, mentoring, cleaning, or even diaper changing, we did together as often as circumstances allowed. This division of labor occurred because it had always been part of how we envisioned our family life.<br><h2><b>The Importance of Faith</b></h2><br>It requires faith to establish and act upon a vision. But it is only when we move forward in faith that we put ourselves in a position in which the Lord can bless us. A young couple recently shared an experience with me that illustrates this point.<br><br>As it had been with Christiane and me, their vision was to begin their family as soon as possible after they were married. They had two criteria for doing so: they needed health insurance and they wanted to be able to care for their baby without using child care.<br><br>Not too long after the wife graduated from college, she got a job that provided health insurance and would allow her to work from home. Their plans seemed to have fallen in place exactly as they had hoped, and soon they were expecting their first child. They felt they could both care for the baby between their work and school schedules.<br><br>In the summer, the soon-to-be father was looking for an internship in his chosen profession. He had several interviews, but none of them worked out. In October, when his wife was seven months pregnant, she got a call from her boss. The boss informed her that the federal grant that funded her salary would not be renewed. The agency was happy to offer her another job, but she would not be able to work from home. The couple was heartbroken. They thought they had planned well and that the circumstances were perfect for the wife to be able to stay home with the baby.<br><br>Several weeks went by, and they adjusted to the idea that they would need to use some form of day care. About three weeks before her December due date, the husband received a call out of the blue from one of the business owners who had interviewed him in the summer. The man said he had just made some new hires and had put a rejection letter in the mail to the husband. But then he had had a very strong feeling that he should hire the husband. The business owner told the young man to ignore the rejection letter, and he then offered him a full-time position with benefits.<br><br>In concluding her account of these events, the wife wrote:<br><br><i>We were overjoyed. We knew that the Lord had taken a special interest in our desire for me to be a stay-at-home mom. And the Lord's plan was even better than our plan. If things had gone our way, I would have had to work while caring for our child, but with this new situation I was able to devote my full time and attention to our new baby, which had always been our ultimate goal. </i><br><br>Like this young couple, Christiane and I have found that as we have acted in faith and have trusted the Lord, He has helped us to do His will in His way and according to His timing. Now I have to say that His way did not mean that everything turned out immediately the way we thought it would. Sometimes we had to be very patient, sometimes we had to put in some extra effort, and sometimes it even was as if the Lord was testing our seriousness. However, our vision always has inspired us and has been the foundation for our most important decisions.<br><h2><b>Look to the Temple</b></h2><br>One thing Christiane and I always envisioned was for us to be with our children in the celestial room of a temple as a prelude for the eternal joy and glory we hope one day to experience. Over the past several years we have taken one child after another to receive their temple ordinances, symbolically returning them to our Heavenly Father after teaching them the principles of righteousness.<br><br>We just had the last experience of that kind two months ago, when one of our youngest sons entered the temple. We have accompanied three of our children to temple altars as they have married their sweethearts, and we anticipate more temple weddings to come. Nothing has provided more happiness and satisfaction in our lives than the joy we have found in one another and in our posterity. Once we understood that these are just the beginnings of our eternal progression and therefore only the very first levels of our joy and happiness, we were and are continually willing to sacrifice all that we have to live the doctrine of the family and to see our vision fully realized.<br><br>I invite you, my dear young friends, to ponder this doctrine and come to know for yourselves what really matters most. This type of happiness is at the heart of our existence. And happiness that stems from congenial relationships among husband, wife, and children is always growing and increasing.<br><h2><b>Be Serious About What Matters Most</b></h2><br>There is one more thing that you need to do after you have studied the doctrine of the family and have established a vision for your happiness. You have to become serious about implementing your vision. I would like to share an additional lesson from my personal experience.<br><br>The first initial rejections I received in my courtship with Christiane made me a little discouraged. I had just about decided to begin a fruitful career as a young single adult in the Church. One day I had a special spiritual impression. I was participating in an ordinance in the Swiss Temple when I heard a voice in my heart saying something to this effect: "Erich, if you do not seriously strive to marry and enter into the new and everlasting covenant, all these teachings and promised blessings really make no difference for you." It was a wake-up call that I received at the very young age of twenty-one, and from that moment I tried even harder to be worthy of that blessing.<br><br>I invite you to set personal goals regarding your vision. In <i>Preach My Gospel</i> we read:<br><br><i>Goals reflect the desires of our hearts and our vision of what we can accomplish. Through goals and plans, our hopes are transformed into action. Goal setting and planning are acts of faith.</i><sup>22</sup><br><br>I invite you to be serious. Do not trifle with sacred things. Once you reach a marriageable age, don't just date for fun. Never compromise your eternal birthright by doing anything that would deprive you of making the most important covenants in the temple. As you treat every date as a potential eternal companion, you will never do inappropriate things that would physically or spiritually harm your date or compromise your own worthiness and darken your vision. Your spiritual perception will never be dimmed and you will always be entitled to the whisperings of the Spirit. He will encourage and confirm as you make these most important decisions in your life, even if at times you are scared to death.<br><br>Hold yourself accountable to the Lord with respect to your vision and goals in life. If there is something you need to repent of, don't hesitate a second to do so. Both this life and eternal life are too important to procrastinate the day of our repentance. Follow the invitation of the Savior, who encouraged us to<br><br><i>ask the Father in the name of Jesus for what things soever ye shall stand in need. Doubt not, but be believing, and begin as in times of old, and come unto the Lord with all your heart, and work out your own salvation with fear and trembling before him.</i><sup>23</sup><br><h2><b>The Principle of Finishing</b></h2><br>I would like to share a thought with those of you who are trying hard to implement these principles but have not yet succeeded. I recognize that some of you, given your circumstances, may need to adapt the ideal vision of a family to fit your personal situation. But I have learned that the Lord will help us as we act in faith and follow the ideal to the extent possible.<br><br>The gospel of Jesus Christ includes a most comforting component. It is the "finishing" or "completing" aspect of our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Moroni admonished us to always stay on the right way, "relying alone upon the merits of Christ, who [is] the author and the finisher of [our] faith."<sup>24</sup><br><br>Because of the faith that we have in Jesus Christ, we can pursue the course in life we need to take, but if we fail because of weakness or missing opportunities, He will either reach out to us or fill in the gap and become the finisher of our faith. It is He who stated, "For I, the Lord, will judge all men according to their works, according to the desire of their hearts."<sup>25</sup><br><br>And from the Church Handbook we read:<br><br><i>Faithful members whose circumstances do not allow them to receive the blessings of eternal marriage and parenthood in this life will receive all promised blessings in the eternities, provided they keep the covenants they have made with God.</i><sup>26</sup><br><br>I testify that the Lord meant what He said when He stated that "it is not good that the man should be alone"<sup>27</sup> and that His ultimate desire for all of His children is that they receive "a fulness of joy."<sup>28</sup> Therefore, always keep your vision before you and<br><br><i>strive for the ideal of living in an eternal family. This means preparing to become worthy spouses and loving fathers or mothers. In some cases these blessings will not be fulfilled until the next life, but the ultimate goal is the same for all.</i><sup>29</sup><br><br>Now, at the beginning of my remarks I promised you the direct "German approach." So please do not be offended at what I have said. I know there are as many different life circumstances as there are people in this room. I know there are differences in cultures, traditions, and expectations. However, the doctrines and principles outlined today are eternal and true, and they stand independent from our personal life situations. I have every confidence that as you sincerely ponder and prayerfully consider your personal vision in the context of these doctrines and principles, you will be able to develop a vision for your life that will be pleasing to the Lord and lead to your greatest happiness.<br><br>I testify of these wonderful truths. God lives; Jesus is the Christ. It is through the plan of the Father and the Atonement of Jesus Christ that we have access to such marvelous opportunities for happiness in this life and promises of a future in which our individual kingdoms will be expanded beyond our current capacity to fully understand. So, once more I ask you: What is your vision for <i>your</i> life? and What are you willing to do to achieve it?<br><br>I pray the blessings of heaven on you as you ponder these questions and strive to obtain sacred and eternal blessings. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Erich W.

<br>
<br>
I am grateful to be with you on this cold December morning. I pray that the warmth of the Spirit will bless us that we might be edified during our few moments together.<br><br>Today I want to talk with you about the greatest story ever told--and one of its less obvious but most important themes. You could probably recite much of this story by heart. It occupies little more than a page of scripture. It begins with the familiar duty of paying taxes. It continues with a journey that was not unusual for the time. The plot thickens when no room can be found "in the inns";<sup>1</sup> it culminates when the Son of God is born of Mary, "a precious and chosen" virgin.<sup>2</sup><br><br>We know little about the real people and few details regarding the true events. And yet, no matter how many times we read the story of the first Christmas, there always seems to be something new we can learn from it. That is because, as prophets have taught, "the word of God is quick," or living.<sup>3</sup> It takes on fresh and deeper meaning whenever we are spiritually ready to receive it.<br><br>Something that stands out to me in the account of the Savior's birth is that on four separate occasions an angel appeared with the message "Fear not."<br><br>When the angel Gabriel appeared to Zacharias with news that his wife would bear a son, the forerunner of the Messiah, he said, "Fear not, . . . for thy prayer is heard."<sup>4</sup><br><br>Later the same angel visited "beautiful and fair"<sup>5</sup> Mary to tell her that she would be the mother of the Son of God, assuring her with similar words: "Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God."<sup>6</sup><br><br>Shortly thereafter an angel appeared to Joseph the carpenter in a dream and said, "Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife."<sup>7</sup><br><br>And then, on that holy night, as all eternity watched in reverent silence, the angel came upon humble shepherds keeping watch over their flock. The shepherds, who "were sore afraid,"<sup>8</sup> heard the angel proclaim, "Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people."<sup>9</sup><br><br>So much of what happened during those pivotal moments in the nativity narrative depended upon the courage of people like Zacharias, Mary, Joseph, and the shepherds. God had a monumental task for each of them; their lives were about to change forever. Imagine if they had let fear overcome them. What if they had pulled back, doubted, and failed to do what God needed them to do?<br><br>This less obvious theme from the account of the first Christmas intrigues me because I, like you, have fears, and I need to be reminded at times to fear not. I don't know what your fears are. Like Zacharias, who feared that he would never have children, you may have fears about your family. Or maybe your fear isn't that you won't have children but that you <i>will</i> have children, whom you will have to raise in a toxic world increasingly hostile to families. Like Mary, you may have an assignment or responsibility that seems far beyond your abilities. Like Joseph, you may fear getting married--or that you will never get married. Like the shepherds, you may be "sore afraid" when your peaceful and simple life is disrupted because God has plans for you that are bigger than what you have for yourself.<br><br>Life presents endless opportunities to fear. We may fear what people think of us. We may fear failure or rejection. We may be afraid of changes we know we must make in our lives. Or maybe we are just afraid of next week's final exams. We may experience failure or rejection and wonder if we have what it takes. We may have financial fears, educational and career fears, or fears of public speaking, snakes, or spiders. Yes, we live in a beautiful world--but it can be scary out there!<br><br>I fear that so many of you have come this morning to be edified and inspired, and now I have gone and frightened you! Well, I did not come here to frighten you, and you did not come here to be reminded of your fears. We all long for more of God's peace and strength in the midst of the stresses and difficulties of life.<br><br>The Lord's message to you today is the same message He sent through His angels so long ago: "Fear not." He can say that because He knows more than we do. He sees what we cannot see. He knows what is coming, and, in the eternal scheme of things, it is not as bad as we may think. He knows that we can handle it with His help because He knows how to strengthen and succor us.<sup>10</sup><br><br>Most of all, He tells us not to fear because He knows that fear will paralyze us. It will keep us from knowing and doing His will; accepting His blessings, His love, and His light; and fulfilling His purposes. President Howard W. Hunter said:<br><br><i>Fear . . . is a principal weapon in the arsenal that Satan uses to make mankind unhappy. He who fears loses strength for the combat of life in the fight against evil. Therefore, the power of the evil one always tries to generate fear in human hearts. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . A timid, fearing people cannot do their work well, and they cannot do God's work at all. Latter-day Saints have a divinely assigned mission to fulfill that simply must not be dissipated in fear and anxiety.</i> <a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/howard-w-hunter_anchor-souls-men/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>11</sup></a><br><br>Satan wants us to give in to fear. God wants us to hold on to hope.<br><br>One of my favorite scriptures is 2 Timothy 1:7. It reads, "For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind." Using these words as a framework, let us explore together how power, love, and a sound mind serve as antidotes for fear.<br><h2><strong>Power</strong></h2><br>First, "God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power."<br><br>This "spirit of power" is not the world's sort of power. The Lord and His covenant people do not work the way the world usually works. The world tells us that power comes of wealth or popularity and that life is a competition in which we advance ahead of others by acquiring more or by brandishing words or weapons of destruction.<br><br>The Lord's way is deeper, higher, and holier. His power is governed "by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned; By kindness, and pure knowledge."<sup>12</sup> Where worldly power depends on dramatic demonstrations, the Lord's power distills upon us "as the dews from heaven"<sup>13</sup>--miraculously but quietly and humbly. Where worldly power is for the privileged few, the Lord's power is available to all. It is manifest in the ordinances of the priesthood.<sup>14</sup> We access it through making and keeping sacred covenants. We nurture it through sincere prayer, fasting, and feasting "upon the words of Christ."<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1986/10/the-book-of-mormon-keystone-of-our-religion?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>15</sup></a><br><br>Perhaps you know someone who has this kind of power and therefore seems fearless. It is probably someone who would not be judged powerful by worldly standards but whose spiritual power is undeniable.<br><br>My father, who died in an accident nearly thirty years ago, was such a man. Still today I meet people who say, "He was the kindest man I have ever known." He worked in a steel mill--not the most glamorous or prestigious of occupations--and I am embarrassed to say that when I was young, I wished he were smarter, cooler, richer. Thankfully I've grown up since then, and today there is no one I admire more.<br><br>I doubt any of you have ever spent a day at a steel mill, but let's just say that it is not the quietest or cleanest environment. Power, in that setting, is usually asserted through gruffness and crude language. And yet my father, in his more than three decades there, was never known to swear or to speak an unkind word. He never even raised his voice. After he died, his coworkers told us that they could always count on him to be pleasant and positive, regardless of the circumstances. We found curled up in his lunch box several Church pamphlets that he faithfully studied during his lunch break and often shared with his coworkers, many of whom became active in the Church because of his goodness and example.<br><br>That is fearless power. It is the kind of power that comes to those who trust God and have faith in Jesus Christ--faith to do things His way, even if it differs from the world's way. That faith is more than mere positive thinking or motivational rah-rah. As the Prophet Joseph taught, faith is power.<sup>16</sup> Faith inspires and empowers us to do remarkable and courageous things that we would not be able to do otherwise. Truly, this kind of faith gives us the power and confidence that will "wax strong in the presence of God"<sup>17</sup> and all people.<br><br>If you are fearful because you feel powerless, I invite you to turn to the Lord. Draw upon the power of the covenants you have made and are keeping. Trust in God's power, for it is mightier than any power on earth. God's words to ancient Israel are also His words to you: "I the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee."<sup>18</sup><br><h2><strong>Love</strong></h2><br>Next in Paul's list of fear-banishing virtues is love. As both Paul and Mormon taught, "Perfect love casteth out all fear."<sup>19</sup> Anyone who has served a mission knows what I am talking about. A full-time mission, if you think about it, would be a petrifying experience if it weren't for love--love for God and for His children. But tens of thousands of young men and women, including many of you, serve every year because God has granted them the gift of Christlike love.<br><br>We all know young missionaries who couldn't even spell Guatemala--let alone find it on a map--when they got their mission call. But by the time they returned, they had the Guatemalan flag hanging on their bedroom wall and memories of beloved Guatemalan people in their hearts. Some missionaries receive this gift of love before they even leave; others don't find it until well into their service. But every missionary at some point or another has to learn to love the people or else their mission will be miserable.<br><br>This was the greatest lesson I learned as a missionary in Argentina many years ago. Throughout my mission I did my best, and we were blessed with success, but my first year was different from my second year. The first year my motives were not completely pure. I wanted to lead the mission in baptisms, to move up the mission ladder, and to impress others. Thankfully, I was matched with a more consecrated companion, who showed me how to love and enjoy the people more, how to serve them with heart and soul, and how to forget myself and go to work with love. My focus and motives changed--I truly got a new heart--and I came home different than when I left.<br><br>Perhaps the most stunning example of the power of love to overcome fear comes from the sons of Mosiah and their remarkable mission to the Lamanites. I don't think we fully appreciate how courageous they were. The Lamanites weren't merely apathetic toward the gospel--they were openly hostile. They were sworn enemies who routinely killed Nephites just for being Nephites. They weren't exactly golden contacts! So why did the sons of Mosiah do it?<br><br><i>They were desirous that salvation should be declared to every creature, for they could not bear that any human soul should perish; yea, even the very thoughts that any soul should endure endless torment did cause them to quake and tremble.</i> <sup>20</sup><br><br>Their intense love was so powerful that they simply had to share the gospel with everyone. They couldn't bear not to. When we love with that kind of strength and sincerity, we overcome fear.<br><br>Of course, love conquers fear not just in missionary work but in all aspects of life. When young Gordon B. Hinckley and Marjorie Pay were engaged to be married, Gordon began to worry about the economic realities of marriage during the depression-ridden 1930s. He called his fiancée and said they needed to talk. They agreed to meet over lunch.<br><br>"I think you should know," he told her, "that I only have $150 to my name." He added that he only made $185 a month.<br><br>Marjorie put his fears to rest with her unexpected, optimistic response: "Oh, that will work out just fine; if you've got $150, we're set!"<br><br>Reflecting on her thoughts that day, Marjorie said, "I had hoped for a husband and now I was getting $150 too!"<sup>21</sup> Sister Hinckley's love and faith empowered her to "fear not" as they started their lives together--a marriage that would become nearly seven decades of love and faith and service.<br><br>Love gives meaning to life, even amid life's uncertainties. It is what keeps us going when we feel like giving up; it can be what gets us up in the morning and what settles us into sweet dreams at night. Love is the essence of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It has no end and no limits. It remains when all else fails. Love never quits and never runs out; it simply endures and overcomes. Indeed, it "never faileth."<sup>22</sup><br><br>We cannot look to the world for that kind of love. All you have to do is examine the ways popular culture uses the term <i>love</i> and it is obvious that Satan just doesn't get it. Always, love's counterfeits slip quickly into thinly veiled selfishness, lust, pride, and even hatred.<br><br>God, on the other hand, not only understands love, He <i>is</i> love.<sup>23</sup> In fact, our expressions of love are but echoes and approximations of the continuous and unlimited love of God. Our efforts to nurture love would fail were it not for infusions of divine love along the way. Ultimately, all love comes from God. The more we seek Him, the more we will feel His love working a mighty change in our hearts--and in the hearts of those we love. What could we fear when filled with such love?<br><br>Several years ago on a cold winter night, some of our extended family volunteered to serve dinner in a homeless shelter during the Christmas season. At first some of the younger children were a bit frightened by the sights, smells, and sounds of the inner-city shelter. They had never been so close to such distress before. But in time a little Christmas miracle took place.<br><br>As we served the hot meal we all began to interact with the homeless residents. We exchanged smiles, laughter, and small talk. Then the singing started. No one really remembers who began to sing first--perhaps one of the residents or one of the children--but before long everyone was singing Christmas carols. The room filled with the sweet spirit of Christmas. It became like a great party, almost a family reunion. They were no longer strangers but brothers and sisters, children of the same God. It was powerful, personal, and poignant--a night never to be forgotten.<br><br>It reminded me of a passage from Charles Dickens's <i>A Christmas Carol,</i> when Scrooge's nephew, Fred, rather boldly defends Christmas against his uncle's bah humbugs. He described Christmas as:<br><br><i>a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people</i> [around] <i>them as if they really were fellow-passengers . . . and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys.</i> <sup>24</sup><br><br>No heavenly angels sang that night at the shelter--at least not in the literal sense--but heaven seemed close. We felt love--love for God, each other, and all humanity. As the evening ended and we stepped back into the cold night, we each felt the joy and meaning of Christmas more deeply. The stars shone a little brighter, and we all felt a little closer to a few of our fellow passengers on life's common journey.<br><br>If you are fearful--whatever your fears may be--I invite you to turn to the Lord and trust in His love, His goodness, and His grace. It is mightier than any force on earth. His loving words to the early Saints are also His words to you: "Fear not, little children, for you are mine, and I have overcome the world."<sup>25</sup><br><h2><strong>A Sound Mind</strong></h2><br>Finally, in addition to power and love, God has given us the spirit of a sound mind to dispel fear. What does it mean to have a sound mind? The word <i>sound</i> means safe, secure, and reliable. How do we achieve a sound mind? By anchoring ourselves to the safest, most secure, and most reliable rock in the ocean: the Lord Jesus Christ and His restored gospel.<br><br>You and I and the rest of the world are in the midst of an intellectual storm, a hurricane of philosophies and ideologies, with winds of doctrine tossing many of us "to and fro."<sup>26</sup> Groups and individuals who are antagonistic toward religion in general, Christianity in particular, and Latter-day Saints specifically are gaining in influence and spreading their deceptive messages. Their goal is simple: to destroy faith. Sadly, we all have friends or loved ones who have become their victims. In such circumstances it is not easy to keep a sound mind or to avoid becoming fearful. Only those who have anchored their lives firmly to the Savior will survive.<br><br>To use imagery that perhaps is more familiar in landlocked Provo than hurricanes and anchors, consider the beautiful mountains that stand just outside this building--the phrase "the shadows of the everlasting hills" comes to mind. They seem pretty stable and permanent, don't they? They don't look like they are going away anytime soon. But as reliable as those mountains look, I would never stake my spiritual safety on them. I think that may be in part what Isaiah was trying to say when he prophesied, "Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low."<sup>27</sup> Isaiah continued: "The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever."<sup>28</sup><br><br>Do you remember how green the grass used to be on campus just a few months ago? Do you remember the colorful flowers that once adorned the courtyards? It seems like a distant memory on a day like today, doesn't it? Well, compared to the word of God, all of the dogmas, kingdoms, and institutions of man are about as permanent as the withering grass and the fading flower. If I had placed my trust in something so fleeting, I would definitely be fearful. That is certainly not the product of a sound mind. No, in this storm I would much rather take my refuge in the word of God.<br><br>This is what Jacob, the brother of Nephi, did. He feasted on the scriptures, delighting in them and cherishing them, so that when the charismatic and persuasive Sherem came along, seeking to "overthrow the doctrine of Christ,"<sup>29</sup> leading "away many hearts,"<sup>30</sup> and eventually targeting Jacob specifically, Jacob "could not be shaken."<sup>31</sup> He had simply had too many spiritual experiences with eternal truth to ever be deceived by any counterfeits.<br><br>If you and I can follow Jacob's example and build our lives on the firm foundation of the word of Christ, we will receive an additional blessing beyond immunity to deception. In moments when we need correction or when serious questions and doubts arise or when further revelation is necessary to spur us to greater action, we will not become offended, upset, impatient, or deceived. In fact, we will rejoice to meekly receive more of the divine word we love so much.<br><br>When Jacob had to speak reproving words to his people, he noted "that the words of truth are hard against all uncleanness; but the righteous fear them not, for they love the truth and are not shaken."<sup>32</sup> He observed that to those who "are pure in heart" the word of God is "pleasing" and they "feast upon his love" because their "minds are firm, forever."<sup>33</sup><br><br>Can you see how men and women with sound minds, anchored firmly to the gospel of Jesus Christ, have no need to fear? When testimony and true conversion burn in their hearts and in their heads, they are unfazed by the latest fads and philosophies of men because they recognize them for what they are. And they are unafraid to receive truth, even if it requires them to change. Nephi said of such humble yet rock-solid souls: "He that is built upon the rock receiveth [truth] with gladness [while] he that is built upon a sandy foundation trembleth lest he shall fall."<sup>34</sup><br><br>Let us take courage in these vigorous words from a favorite hymn. They are written as if from the Lord's own mouth:<br><br><i>Fear not, I am with thee; oh, be not dismayed,<br></i><i>For I am thy God and will still give thee aid.<br></i><i>I'll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand,<br></i><i>Upheld by my righteous, . . . omnipotent hand.</i><br><br>Truly, a firm foundation can uphold us as we face all kinds of difficulties in life--sickness, health, poverty, wealth, deep waters, fiery darts and fiery trials--for<br><br><i>The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose</i><br><i>I will not, I cannot, desert to his foes;</i><br><i>That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake, . . .</i><br><i>I'll never, no never, no never forsake!</i> <sup>35</sup><br><br>The Lord stands ready to help. I invite you to turn to the Lord and build upon His firm foundation. It is mightier and more permanent than any foundation on earth. The world needs your spiritual strength and power, your love and light, and your sound mind and heart. The Lord's words to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery are also His words to you:<br><br><i>Fear not, little flock; do good; let earth and hell combine against you, for if ye are built upon my rock, they cannot prevail. . . .</i><br><br><i>Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not.</i> <sup>36</sup><br><h2><strong>Good Tidings</strong></h2><br>I don't know if I was part of the heavenly choir that sang "glory to God" on the night of that first Noel, but I certainly can add my humble witness to that of the angels: I testify that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. And because "unto [us was] born [that] day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord," we have no need to fear, for He has indeed brought with Him peace on earth and goodwill toward men. I testify that these good tidings are for all people--including me and including you.<sup>37</sup> In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Lloyd D.
