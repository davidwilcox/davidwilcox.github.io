<br>
Good evening, brothers and sisters. Sister Burton and I are delighted to be with you this evening. We are grateful to the First Presidency for this assignment, although we feel overwhelmed both by the weight of the assignment and by the technology that allows us to join together while being physically ­gathered in a host of locations.<br><h2><b>Statistics and Forecasts</b></h2><br>Over the last forty-five days we have enjoyed a period of thanksgiving and a period of celebrating the births of the Son of Man and the prophet of the Restoration, Joseph Smith. We have survived, with little or no inconvenience, the much-discussed Y2K phenomenon. In the aftermath of this event, some people seem to be glad and relieved it's over, while others are a bit sad and disappointed that it turned out to be largely a one-hundred-billion-dollar nonevent.<br><br>We have concluded a year and are a few days into a new one. That is just long enough for most of us to have violated our New Year's resolutions. I think it is best to leave to others the debate as to whether we have concluded a decade, a century, or a millennium. I'll just note that the controversy is not new. Two hundred years ago, on 26 December 1799, the <i>London Times</i> declared that the nineteenth ­century began in the year 1801, not 1800, and in typical British fashion, said: "It is a silly, childish discussion, and only exposes the want of brains of those who maintain a contrary opinion." Despite that stinging statement, I will risk exposing my mental frailties by ­indicating that I find it easier to "go with the media flow" and adopt the odometer approach to the issue. When the numbers turn from 999 to 1,000, I say, "Let the celebration begin!" Besides, what's wrong with having two millennium parties?<br><br>The media has bombarded us with the results of polls designed to identify the best and worst of almost everything. For example, we've recently learned that Albert Einstein made the most important contribution to mankind during the past century,<sup>1</sup> and Michael Jordan was the century's best athlete.<sup>2</sup> We've learned more about the best, worst, most, least, top, and ­bottom than, I suspect, we ever really wanted to know. We have been inundated with trivia and comparative ­statistics.<br><br>I'm sure the cockles of your hearts have been warmed with the vital information that nearly 60 percent of Americans of all ages eat peanut butter at least once a week, and 83 ­percent prefer the smooth variety.<sup>3</sup><br><br>I was interested to read that the alumni of a prestigious university voted Bill Gates, a ­college dropout, the most influential business leader of the past seventy-five years.<sup>4</sup> They also identified the automobile as the most important consumer product of the period, explaining that the internal combustion engine beats the personal computer operating system Windows by a mile.<sup>5</sup> They gave the computer the nod for the best business innovation,<sup>6</sup> and Microsoft was the most influential company.<sup>7</sup> These same alumni selected World War II as the most significant event of the century because of the impact it had on most all segments of life on this planet.<sup>8</sup><br><br>Of much greater importance, this same group of intellectually upscale alumni were asked to make two forecasts. The first: What will be better twenty-five years from now than it is today? The second: What will be worse than we experience today? As to what they thought will be better, they identified race relations, health care, education, and the environment. We all look forward to these much-needed improvements in society. They thought, however, that the next quarter century would see a further loss of confidence in government, an increased ­economic disparity between the rich and the poor, and a continuation of the already precipitous decline in values and morality.<sup>9</sup> If the forecasts prove to be accurate, the predicted declines are very worrisome. Many would say that values and morality for a large segment of society have already hit rock-bottom levels.<br><h2><b>What the World Needs Is Jesus Christ</b></h2><br>I'm certainly not clairvoyant, nor do I have solutions for all of the maladies that plague society and mankind today. I go back to a ­popular song from my misspent youth. The song is entitled <i>What the World Needs Now Is Love.</i> The lyrics of the song explain that what the world needs now is love, sweet love. To that beautiful line of lyric, I add: "What the world needs now is love, sweet love--for the 'good news' of Jesus Christ." Certainly if we allow the gospel of our Savior and Redeemer to penetrate our souls, there will be no need to be concerned with forecasts of further declines in values and morals. There will be no poor among us. We will have confidence and faith in those who represent us in government. In fact, values and morality will be celestial.<br><br>I recently read with great interest a biograph­ical article in <i>Time</i> magazine. The article, "In Death's Throat," was written by Robert Hughes, an art critic for <i>Time</i>. It seems that Mr. Hughes was in Australia when he was involved in a ­devastating head-on ­automobile accident on a remote highway in Western Australia. Charlie Fishhook, an Aborigine, came upon the accident scene and sounded the ­critical alarm for help. A friend, Danny O'Sullivan, upon hearing of the ­accident, used his radio and cell phone to summon help from the nearest town, seventy-five miles away. He then raced to Robert's side to reassure him that assistance was on its way. Aborigines of the Bidyadanga people formed a semicircle around the car and chanted a prayerful song. A Filipina nurse from the Bidyadanga settlement comforted his badly broken body until police and medics airlifted him to the Royal Perth Hospital. Skilled physicians operated for thirteen hours to carefully restore his body. His loving and deeply concerned ­family arrived from the United States to keep vigil until he awoke from a thirty-day coma.<br><br>Robert Hughes, in writing about his near-death experience, said:<br><br><i>I am a skeptic to whom the idea that a benign God created us and watches over us is somewhere between a fairy story and a poor joke. People of a ­religious bent are apt, under such conditions, to see the familiar images of near-death experience--the tunnel of white light with Jesus beckoning at the end, as ­featured in the memoirs of a score of American K Mart mystics. Jesus must have been busy when my turn came: he didn't show. There was, as far as I could tell, absolutely nothing divine on the other side.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>Several weeks after Robert's story appeared, several letters to the editor of <i>Time</i> magazine were received and published. A perceptive ­gentleman by the name of Pedro Costa from Portugal wrote, wishing to ask Robert the following question:<br><br><i>I would like to ask</i> [Robert Hughes] <i>if he also ­didn't see Christ among the Aborigine family that found him, the Bidyadanga people who chanted to keep him alive, the Filipina nurse who wept for him, his friend Danny who raced to save his life, the police and the medics who got to the scene, the ­medical personnel who decided to fly him to Royal Perth Hospital, the people who operated for 13 hours--or in the midst of relatives and friends who gave him the ­support and affection he talks about in his article. Hughes just might have missed Jesus in such a crowd.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>From Stellenbosch, South Africa, Marius J. DeWaal profoundly wrote: "Robert Hughes said of his near-death experience that Jesus didn't show. But one cannot expect to find Christ in death if one has not known him in life."<br><br>&amp;gt;We know our loving Father in Heaven and our Savior, Jesus Christ, most often minister to our needs through the efforts of typical, ­garden-variety people like you and me. We too often look for dramatic, divine intervention in our lives and lose sight of Jesus in the crowd of ­marvelous, kind, thoughtful, and generous people who live the principles of the gospel of Him who is our Savior and Redeemer. Mr. DeWaal so ­gently reminds us that this mortal life is the time for us to find, serve, and know Jesus and the principles He taught in life. We will undoubtedly find it difficult to identify with Christ in death if we have not known Him in life.<br><br>I am reminded of the well-worn and often-told story of<br><br><i>a little crippled boy who ran a small newsstand in a crowded railroad ­station. He must have been about twelve years old. Every day he would sell papers, candy, gum, and magazines to the thousands of commuters passing through the terminal.</i><br><br><i>One night two men were rushing through the crowded station to catch a train. One was fifteen or twenty yards in front of the other. It was Christmas Eve. Their train was scheduled to depart in a matter of minutes.</i><br><br><i>The first man turned a corner and in his haste . . . plowed right into the little crippled boy. He knocked him off his stool, and candy, newspapers, and gum were scattered everywhere. Without so much as stopping, he cursed the little fellow for being there and rushed on to catch the train. . . .</i><br><br><i>It was only a matter of seconds before the second commuter arrived on the scene. He stopped, knelt, and gently picked up the boy. After making sure the child was unhurt, the man gathered up the scattered newspapers, sweets, and magazines. Then he took out his wallet and gave the boy a five-dollar bill. "Son," he said, "I think this will take care of what was lost or soiled. Merry Christmas!"</i><br><br><i>Without waiting for a reply the commuter now picked up his briefcase and started to hurry away. As he did, the little crippled boy cupped his hands together and called out: "Mister, Mister!"</i><br><br><i>The man stopped as the boy asked, "Are you Jesus Christ?"</i><br><br><i>By the look on his face, it was obvious the commuter was embarrassed by the question. But he smiled and said, "No, son, I am not Jesus Christ, but I am trying hard to do what He would do if He were here."</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>Mr. Hughes may not have been able to detect the Savior among the many who ministered to his needs, nor is he likely to find Christ in death without knowing Him in life. But this crippled boy readily recognized the Christlike demeanor of one of Jesus' disciples. I am convinced that we can find, know, and experience the tender, unconditional love of Jesus of Nazareth as we serve Him by serving our ­fellowmen.<br><br>Over the centuries people have been introduced to the Savior in many different ways. For the Apostle Paul it was during the miracle that occurred on the road to Damascus. Many have come to know Christ as they have been exposed to the written testaments of Book of Mormon prophets. Still others are extended introductions by the legions of missionaries who labor with devotion. Neighbors feel the Savior's presence as their souls are softened by the kindly deeds of others. Caregivers come to feel the warm glow of the gospel of Jesus as they unselfishly minister, often for extended periods, to the needs of family members and friends. For some, crises and disasters encourage them to reach for the security blanket offered by Him who offers perfect consolation. For most people, the discovery of Jesus comes by the method He authored Himself: "If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine" (John 7:17), and "Seek me diligently and ye shall find me" (D&amp;amp;C 88:63).<br><h2><b>Jesus Christ Offered Living Water</b></h2><br>Early in the ministry of the Savior, He and some of His disciples were traveling from Jerusalem to Galilee. At about noonday they found refuge from the heat, dust, and thirst of their travels at a well in Samaria. As the disciples sought nourishment in a nearby town, Jesus was alone at the well. He was joined by a Samaritan woman who had come to draw water. Interesting dialogue occurred between Jesus and the woman.<br><br><i>Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. . . .</i><br><br><i> Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</i><br><br><i> Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</i><br><br><i> The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast ­nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?</i><br><br><i> Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?</i><br><br><i> Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</i><br><br><i> But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</i><br><br><i> The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.</i> [John 4:7, 9–15]<br><br>It is this living water, freely offered by Jesus Christ, that we all seek to quench our own spiritual thirst and that is critically needed to end the gospel drought that continues to plague mankind. As His disciples, we are the primary distribution system for delivering the living water from its everlasting source to His cherished children in need. We largely determine who will receive the water as we, by our ­service, control the irrigation system headgates. We preserve the purity of the water as we reflect to the world the value of the ­living water in our own lives. If we irrigate when the living water is required, rather than when it is convenient for us, we determine its vitality. It is only the living water of Jesus Christ that can and will bring a happy, successful, and everlasting life to the children of men.<br><br>I spend a fair amount of time on airplanes. When I make a reservation, I always request an aisle seat. More often than not there is another person seated between me and the window of the plane. Airplane talk is most often very general, but one of the questions that traveling companions usually get around to is: What do you do for a living? When asked, I usually respond in a matter-of-fact way by saying, "Oh, thanks for asking. I'm in the business of saving souls." Usually a questioning expression comes on their face. Some respond by asking me to repeat my statement while they think about a suitable response, and others readily ask for an explanation. It is a marvelous opportunity to have a gospel-centered conversation with someone who, because they are enclosed between me and the window, finds it nearly impossible to move away. Think about it, my young brothers and sisters. By virtue of our membership in His church, are we not all in the business of saving souls? Of course we are. First our own, and we are to then assist our neighbors to do the same by offering them the living water of Jesus Christ.<br><h2><b>The Savior Taught in Parables</b></h2><br>Over the years I have desired to have been present when special events in the ecclesiastical history of the world have taken place. To be standing behind a large tree in the Sacred Grove when the Father and the Son appeared to young Joseph Smith would have been a supernal experience. To be present in the Kirtland Temple to witness the restoration of the holy priesthood to Joseph and Oliver would have been marvelous. To have been present among the eleven Apostles in Gethsemane while Jesus petitioned His Father one last time would have been, to use current terminology, awesome. In like fashion, I would have dearly loved to have trod the dusty roads of Judea, Galilee, and Perea to sit at the feet of the Savior as the Master Teacher taught with the aid of parables. During His earthly ministry, Jesus often used these thought-provoking short stories to convey a moral or spiritual truth. The short stories used real scenes or events that occur in nature or human life. Jesus' parables depicted true-life situations and have a vigorous moral and religious application. ­Under­standing comes with some contemplation.<br><br>Jesus was not argumentative. His teachings were delivered with the strength of plainness and simplicity. When the haughty, self-righteous Pharisees recalled the false doctrines and Jewish traditions of more than a thousand years, Jesus most often introduced His rebuttal with the simple phrase "I say." To the humble seeker after truth, He was gentle, even willing to dispense His living water with patience and simplicity. To the question "Who is my neighbor?" He responded with the forceful and absolutely clear parable of the good Samaritan. When repentance, mercy, or forgiveness needed to be taught, ­parables about the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the prodigal son were eloquently presented. The New Testament records forty-four of the Savior's parables.<br><br>We know not the depth of the reservoir of parables the Savior used, but we know that the disciples who consistently followed and traveled with Him, and who over time gained a degree of gospel sophistication, wondered why He repeatedly used simple parables. After hearing the parable of the sower, they inquired:<br><br><i>Why speakest thou unto them in parables?</i><br><br><i> He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given. . . .</i><br><br><i> Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.</i> [Matthew 13:10–11, 13]<br><br>If it were important for the disciples of Jesus to partake of the ­living water by understanding the principles presented in parable form, then per­haps we should consider it important as well as we ­minister in a Christlike way. Let me whet your appetite for parables by mentioning just a few.<br><br>In the fifteenth chapter of Luke, the Master Teacher counseled us about bringing living water to those who are lost. Luke recorded that a great multitude made up of publicans, sinners, Pharisees, and scribes gathered around the Savior. He took the opportunity to use parables and metaphors to teach the rather hostile group. He said:<br><br><i>What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?</i><br><br><i> And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.</i><br><br><i> And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.</i><br><br><i>I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.</i> [Luke 15:4–7]<br><br>Without wasting words, Luke goes from lost sheep to a lost piece of silver in recording another of Jesus' teachings: "Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it?" (Luke 15:8). She, like the shepherd, then rejoices with her neighbors. The Savior concluded His teaching with the widely quoted parable of the prodigal son:<br><br><i>A certain man had two sons:</i><br><br><i> And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living.</i> [Luke 15:11–12]<br><br>We all know that with his agency he managed to spend all he had been given in riotous living and then returned to seek forgiveness--all to the dismay of his brother, who had remained in the service of his father. The father, counseling the faithful son, said:<br><br><i>Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.</i><br><br><i>It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.</i> [Luke 15:31–32]<br><br>In perhaps the most personal of His parables, the Savior identified Himself with the hungry, the thirsty, the naked, the homeless, sick, and imprisoned. "I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: . . . I was a stranger, and ye took me in" (Matthew 25:35).<br><br>So many of our Father's children are ­burdened with earthly cares or with the stain of sin, poverty, pain, disability, loneliness, bereave­ment, or rejection. The living water of Jesus is sure and certain to those who find Him and trust Him. He who stilled the winds and waves can bring peace to the repentant sinner and to the suffering saint. We as His agents are not only to declare His word but also to deliver the living water unto the least of His brethren, just as He Himself would do if He were here.<br><br>A lawyer chose to challenge the Savior on a point of doctrine. Attempting to entrap Jesus, he asked, "Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?" (Luke 10:25). Jesus responded with a question of His own: "What is written in the law? how readest thou?" (Luke 10:26). The response of the lawyer, as recited from the law, was perfect: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself" (Luke 10:27). Jesus acknowledged the answer and then replied, "This do, and thou shalt live" (Luke 10:28).<br><br>Having failed to confound the Master, the lawyer seemed embarrassed. He sought justification by making a further inquiry: "And who is my neighbour?" (Luke 10:29). We should be very grateful for the lawyer's second question. From it came one of the most insightful of the Savior's parables.<br><br>You remember the setting: "A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, . . . leaving him half dead" (Luke 10:30). Since our Primary days, we have heard about this certain man. We wonder at the failure of the priest and the Levite to render aid, and we say: "Surely, I would have helped. Surely, I would have stopped. Surely, Iwould not have looked the other way."<br><br>The parable continues:<br><br><i>But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,</i><br><br><i>And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</i> [Luke 10:33–34]<br><br>Upon completing the parable, the Savior asked the lawyer, "Which now of these three . . . was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?" (Luke 10:36). The lawyer quickly identified the one who had shown mercy--the kind and caring traveler from Samaria. Jesus admonished him to "go, and do thou likewise" (Luke 10:37).<br><br>During His ministry the Savior used two wonderful parables regarding the requirement that we develop our God-given talents. The par­able of the entrusted talents was given directly to His Apostles. The Savior told about a man who was leaving on a long trip and wanted to distribute his possessions to his servants. To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one. To each man he gave according to his ability.<br><br>You remember the story--while the master was away, the one who received five talents put them to use and made five more ­talents. The one who received two talents put them to use and made two more talents, but the one who received one talent hid it in the ground. Upon his return, the giver of the talents called for an accounting.<br><br>Unto the servants who had doubled their talents, the master said, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord" (Matthew 25:21 and 23). To the servant who hid his talent and did not multiply it, the one talent was taken from him and given to the ­servant who had ten talents.<br><br>The parable of the pounds was given to a mixed multitude on the Savior's last journey from Jericho to Jerusalem (see Luke 19:12–26). Although there are some differences in the two parables, in essence they teach the same truths and principles.<br><br>From the men endowed with many talents, more was expected than from the men with lesser talents, yet all were expected to ­multiply whatever they were given. In each parable, however, although relatively little was expected of the men given one talent, each failed to use his talent. Good use of the talent on the part of the men given one talent was just as important and necessary as on the part of the men given two and five talents.<br><h2><b>A Modern Parable</b></h2><br>Although we have put the Christmas season to bed, may I share a modern parable entitled the "Parable of the Shopper." A woman tells the story of what occurred on a bus:<br><br>&amp;lt;p<i>I had been Christmas shopping all day long. When the bus finally arrived, it was packed with holiday shoppers in the same exhausted mood as I. I sank into the only vacant place, near the back, by a very handsome gentleman. He politely helped me to situate my packages and even held some of them himself. . . .</i><br><br>[After jovial conversation among the passengers, the gentleman] <i>began in a quiet, melodious voice, deepened with experience, to teach me a lesson that I have never forgotten.</i><br><br><i>"Hear now the parable of the shopper." . . . "A woman went forth to shop, and as she shopped, she carefully planned. . . . The hard-earned money was divided, and the many purchases were made with the pure joy and delight that is known only to the giver. Then the gifts were wrapped and placed ­lovingly under the tree.</i><br><br><i>"In eager anticipation she scanned each face as the gifts were opened.</i><br><br><i>"'What a lovely sweater,' said the eldest daughter, 'but I think I would prefer blue.' . . .</i><br><br><i>"'Thank you for the cassette player, Mother. It's just what I've always wanted,' said her son. And then aside, secretly to his sister, he continued. 'I told her I wanted the one with the automatic reverse and an extra speaker. I never get what I want!'</i><br><br><i> "The youngest child spoke out with the spoiled honesty of her age, 'I hate rag dolls! I wanted a china doll.' . . .</i><br><p class="p1"><i> "One gift still lay under the tree. The woman pointed it out to her ­husband. 'Your gift is still there.'</i></p><br><i> "'I'll open it when I have time,' he stated. 'I want to get this bike put together first.'</i><br><br><i> "How sad it is," continued his soft, beautiful voice. "When gifts are not received in the same spirit they are given. To reject a thoughtful gift is to reject the loving sentiment of the giver himself. And yet, are we not all sometimes guilty of rejecting?"</i><br><br><i> He was not talking only to me, but to all of those on the bus. . . .</i><br><br><i> He took a present from my stack.</i><br><br><i> "This one," he said, holding it up and pretending to open the card, "could be to you."</i><br><br><i>He pointed to a rough-looking, teenage boy in a worn denim jacket and pretended to read the gift card.</i><br><br><i>"'To you I give My life, lived perfectly, as an example so that you might see the pattern and live worthy to return and live with Me again. Merry Christmas from the Messiah.'</i><br><br><i>"The gift of example is a precious yet often rejected gift." . . .</i><br><br><i>"This one," he said, holding up a pure, white present, "is for you." He held out the gift to a worn-looking woman, who in earlier years must have been a real beauty and was still attractive in her slim black skirt, black tights, and heels. She . . . allowed her tears to slip without shame down her painted face.</i><br><br><i>"'My gift to you is repentance. This Christmas Iwish you to know for certain that though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow, and I the Lord will remember them no more. Have a happy New Year. Signed, your Advocate with the Father.'</i><br><br>&amp;lt;p<i>"Ah, repentance, something every Christian needs," said my seat mate.</i><br><br><i>"But that isn't all. No, here is a big, red package." He looked around the group and brought a ragged, unkempt, little child forward. "This big, red package would be for you if He were here. The card would say, 'On this Christmas and always, My gift to you is love. My love is pure! It is not dependent on what you do or what you look like. I love you as you have been, as you are now, and as you will be in the future. From your brother, Jesus.'" . . .</i><br><br><i>"And this silver package to you, madam," he said with a bow . . . to an aging grandmother two rows behind.</i><br><br><i>"Yes, it would be for you, because you would appreciate it most of the time. His precious gift to you would be the gift of salvation. The surety that you will rise from the grave and live again with a perfect, resurrected body. The card would read, 'I give this precious gift freely to you and all men, by laying down My life for you. Signed, your Saviour.'</i><br><br><i>"One final gift," said my seat mate. "The greatest of all the gifts of God. Eternal life! A chance to receive the same quality of life that Christ Himself lives. But though this gift is to all men, it must be assembled. He has given us the instructions. They are here in the scriptures." He tore off the paper to reveal a worn, well-used book. . . .</i><br><br><i>He stood up. He was leaving, making his way slowly down the aisle. He paused just as he reached the front and said, "One last gift. Peace! Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid."</i> [John 14:27]<br><br><i>With those words, he was gone.</i><sup>13</sup><br><br>How we receive these gifts, these precious gifts from the Babe of Bethlehem, is the telling point. Are we exchangers? Is there really ­anything else we would rather have? Is there a feature missing? It is what we do with a gift long after we have opened it that shows our appreciation. Have we used it, worn it, ­displayed it, or cherished it?<br><br>How does Christ feel when we don't even take time to use His gift of repentance, the one He purchased at such a great price? How sad it is when gifts are not received in the same spirit they are given.<br><h2><b>We Must Dispense the Living Water</b></h2><br>Principles taught by parable, if learned well and followed, help us to be dispensers of the living water of Jesus Christ. President Gordon B. Hinckley reminds us that "given what we have and what we know, we ought to be a better people than we are. We ought to be more Christlike, more forgiving, more helpful and considerate to all around us."<sup>14</sup><br><br>The following verse reminds us of simple, everyday things we can do to be sensitive to the needs of others. The scriptures remind us that it is by doing the small and simple things well that souls are saved.<br><br><i>There isn't much that I can do,</i><br><i>But I can share my bread with you,</i><br><i>And I can share my joy with you,</i><br><i>And sometimes share a sorrow too</i><br><i>As on our way we go.</i><br><br><i>There isn't much that I can do,</i><br><i>But I can sit an hour with you,</i><br><i>And I can share a story with you,</i><br><i>And sometimes share reverses, too,</i><br><i>As on our way we go.</i><br><br><i>There isn't much that I can do,</i><br><i>But I can share my flowers with you,</i><br><i>And I can share my books with you,</i><br><i>And sometimes share your burdens, too,</i><br><i>As on our way we go.</i><br><br><i>There isn't much that I can do,</i><br><i>But I can share my songs with you,</i><br><i>And I can share my mirth with you,</i><br><i>And sometimes come and laugh with you,</i><br><i>As on our way we go.</i><br><br><i>There isn't much that I can do,</i><br><i>But I can share my hopes with you,</i><br><i>And I can share my fears with you,</i><br><i>And sometimes shed some tears with you,</i><br><i>As on our way we go.</i><br><br><i>There isn't much that I can do,</i><br><i>But I can share my friends with you,</i><br><i>And I can share my life with you,</i><br><i>And ofttimes share a prayer with you,</i><br><i>As on our way we go.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>You may remember a story about a ship's captain who had a problem with his pride. One night at sea, this captain saw what looked like the light of another ship heading toward him. He had his signalman blink to the other ship: "Change your course 10 degrees south." The reply came back, "Change <i>your</i> course 10 degrees north." The ship's captain answered, "I am a <i>captain.</i> Change <i>your</i> course south." To which the reply came, "Well, I am a seaman first class. Change <i>your</i> course north." This so infuriated the captain, he signaled back, "I say change <i>your</i> course south. I am on a battleship!" To which the reply came back, "And I say change <i>your</i> course north. I am in the ­lighthouse."<sup>16</sup><br><br>Like the poor ship's captain, there are many who desperately need the living water of Jesus the Christ to nourish their souls. But they do not realize it. Unless they are assisted in changing their course, they may find themselves shipwrecked upon the shoals of life. President Hinckley said:<br><br><i>The time has now come to turn about and face the future. This is a ­season of a thousand opportunities. It is ours to grasp and move forward. What a wonderful time it is for each of us to do his or her small part in moving the work of the Lord on to its magnificent destiny.</i><sup>17</sup><br><br>May we enthusiastically respond to the needs of the down­trodden, rejoice in the repentant soul, magnify and use our talents to bless lives, identify with the hungry, and bring peace to the sinner. May we be worthy vessels to represent Him in doing unto the least of our brothers and sisters that which He Himself would do were He now here.<br><br>The apostles and prophets of our time have recently published to the world their testimony of the Living Christ. I use their words and join with them in their testament that<br><br><i>Jesus is the Living Christ, the immortal Son of God. He is the great King Immanuel, who stands today on the right hand of His Father. He is the light, the life, and the hope of the world. His way is the path that leads to happiness in this life and eternal life in the world to come. God be thanked for the matchless gift of His divine Son.</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>Of this great truth I too testify, in the holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1>nges Everything - Marilyn Bateman - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
One afternoon while driving around town, I had a CD playing in my car--a collection of Andrew Lloyd Webber songs sung by Sarah Brightman. I was preoccupied with the traffic, so the music mostly provided a soothing background. At one point, though, the lyrics of one of the songs caught my attention, and immediately I felt moved by the sentiment of these words:<br><br><i>Love,</i><br><i>Love changes everything:</i><br><i>Hands and faces,</i><br><i>Earth and sky.</i><br><i>Love,</i><br><i>Love changes everything:</i><br><i>How you live and</i><br><i>How you die.</i><br>["Love Changes Everything," lyrics by Don Black and Charles Hart,<i>Sarah Brightman: The Andrew Lloyd Webber Collection</i>(Really Useful Group, Ltd., 1997)]<br><br>I know these lyrics refer to romantic love, but I couldn't help reflect that in relation to the gift of charity, love really does change everything. When we are possessed of Christlike love, the way we feel about ourselves, the way we feel about others, even the way we experience reality is altered. But Christlike love isn't the giddy wave of affection we often associate with romantic love. It is something much more subtle, something deeper. It is a love that does not alter with our moods or with external circumstances.<br><br>One of the best and most well-known descriptions we have of Christlike love is found in Moroni 7:45–47. Here Mormon stated:<br><br><i>And charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</i>[Moroni 7:45]<br><br>When we really analyze all the attributes of Christlike love, achieving them can seem like a tall order. This passage may cause us to pause and ask ourselves if we manifest each of these qualities: Am I long-suffering? Am I kind? Am I humble? Do I think of others first? Do I hold my temper? But we need to remember that charity is a gift. These attributes are not simply a to-do list; they are a description of the way we will be if we are fully in possession of this gift. The gift of charity comes from the Savior. It is possible because of His atonement. It isn't necessarily something we develop. Rather, charity is something<i>bestowed</i>upon us. When we possess charity, all of our natural human tendencies are transformed, and we relate to others in a new way.<br><br>The prophet Mormon admonished us to earnestly seek this gift of love. He stated:<br><br><i>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath</i>bestowed<i>upon all who are true followers of his Son.</i>[Moroni 7:48; emphasis added]<br><br>The gift comes, then, through earnest supplication. It comes through our faith and hope in Christ. This kind of love builds in us over time. It grows gradually as our faith in Christ grows. When we are fully possessed of it, Mormon tells us, we become even as the Savior: "That when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is" (Moroni 7:48).<br><br>Christlike love helps us overcome our natural fear of others. We may fear difference; we may worry about being hurt or slighted. But Christlike love is a love beyond fear. It reaches across the divide of difference. It is in our nature to serve our own interests or the interests of those closest to us. But charity takes us beyond our comfort zone. Suddenly we are less worried about whether others will approve of us. Our concern flows toward them regardless of their feelings for us.<br><br>Our family has had the opportunity to live overseas. And at times I have felt estranged from those who speak a language other than my own. It can be difficult to relate to someone whose daily habits and customs are alien to us. The distance between us can seem wide. But then I see a mother hold and soothe her baby, and an impression of recognition comes over me. I realize she feels just as I feel. I realize we are the same. Likewise, on many occasions I have attended Church meetings conducted in languages other than my own. It amazes me that even though I do not understand what is being said, I feel the Spirit testify of God's love for these Saints. How remarkable it is to sit with a group of Saints singing a hymn in Japanese and realize that we share the same faith and hope in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. At these moments, in spite of our superficial differences, we are one.<br><br>Part of having Christlike love is this recognition of our affinities with one another. The gift of charity teaches us who we are. It teaches us who others are. The Apostle Paul testified that we are all God's children and that His desire for us is that we be exalted together:<br><br><i>The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:</i><br><br><i>And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.</i>[Romans 8:16–17]<br><br>Through the power of Christ's atonement we can come to recognize the powerful spiritual kinship we share with all the people of the earth. As we grow in this understanding, we can't help but be filled with a sincere love and concern for those we are asked to serve. But we need Christ to help us realize this love and perspective. We can't achieve it on our own.<br><br>Ken Mochizuki relates the story of Chiune Sugihara, a Japanese diplomat in Lithuania during World War II who, against the orders of his government, granted emergency visas to thousands of Jewish refugees fleeing from Poland (see Ken Mochizuki,<i>Passage to Freedom: The Sugihara Story</i>[New York: Lee and Low Books, 1997]). Shortly after the Nazis invaded Poland, hundreds of Jewish refugees gathered outside the embassy in Lithuania, entreating Mr. Sugihara for visas to give them safe passage out of Eastern Europe. Three times Mr. Sugihara petitioned the Japanese government for permission to grant the visas. Three times his government answered no. After the third time Mr. Sugihara told his wife, "I have to do something. I may have to disobey my government, but if I don't, I will be disobeying God" (Mochizuki,<i>Passage,</i>14). Over the course of a month Mr. Sugihara wrote out thousands of visas in his own hand so that no other person would be held responsible. Later, Mr. Sugihara and his family were imprisoned for 18 months in a Soviet internment camp. After he returned to Japan he was forced to resign from diplomatic service.<br><br>This man sought not his own safety or his own reward but sacrificed on behalf of people he did not even know. These people had little in common with him culturally, religiously, or racially. But they were people to whom he felt bound by a higher impulse, an impulse grounded in moral understanding and unselfish love. Are we willing to sacrifice personal position, comfort, and safety for our brothers and sisters? Do we pray for this kind of faith and love?<br><br>Mr. Sugihara's actions were prompted by extreme circumstances, and the personal implications of his choices were severe. We may never be called upon to make such dramatic sacrifices on behalf of others. But we, too, are daily met with choices that compel us to put aside personal comfort or gain for the sake of others. The gospel of Jesus Christ challenges us to be ready to make these choices well. All of us struggle with tendencies that would keep us from choosing to serve and love others as Christ would. It isn't easy to see past ourselves. It isn't always easy to open our hearts. We may find ourselves feeling envious of others or wishing we had more. But if truly we had love, we would see things differently. At times we may be blind to the feelings and needs of others and may need to be taught to see. We must pray continually for such discernment, conscientiousness, and humility. In short, we need to pray for charity, which is the pure love of Christ.<br><br>In 1 Timothy 1:5, Paul explained that God blesses us with the gift of charity when we have a pure heart, a clear conscience, and faith in the Savior. He explained: "Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned." The Lord will not bless us with charity without a pure heart. This means we must have righteous desires. The Lord will not bless us with charity without a clear conscience. This means we must be repentant and our thoughts must not be compromised by excuses, lies, or delusions. And, finally, He will not bless us with the gift of charity if we lack faith. This means we must believe steadfastly in Christ's atonement and its power to change us.<br><br>If we continue earnestly with faith and hope in Christ to seek the gift of charity, it will be granted to us. We will be filled with a love of God and of all people. Paul promised that as we attain this gift, so will we receive of a fullness of God's love:<br><br><i>That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,</i><br><br><i>May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;</i><br><br><i>And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.</i>[Ephesians 3:17–19]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, may we seek this fullness, this love, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Marilyn S.

<h1>, Temples, and the Dawn of a New Millennium - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The dawn of a new millennium and the dusk of an old provide an opportunity to review key events and accomplishments of the recent past and ask what the future may hold. I realize that some believe the transition from one century and millennium to the next will occur at the end of the year 2000. For others who like to celebrate good things twice, the trial run has just been completed. And for those who base their counting on a multiplicity of zeroes, the new millennium has arrived. Regardless of how one counts, we "stand on the summit of the ages." In the October 1999 general conference, President Gordon B. Hinckley spoke of standing "on the summit of the ages, awed by a great and solemn sense of history" ("At the Summit of the Ages,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1999, 74). With eloquence he said:<br><br><i>What an exciting and wonderful thing it is to step across the threshold of the centuries. . . . Even more exciting is our opportunity to bridge the millennium that is drawing to a close and greet a new thousand years.</i>[Hinckley, "Summit," 72]<br><br>He continued:<br><br><i>For some reason unknown to us, but in the wisdom of God, we have been privileged to come to earth in this glorious age. There has been a great flowering of science. There has been a veritable explosion of learning. This is the greatest of all ages of human endeavor and human accomplishment. And more importantly, it is the season when God has spoken, when His Beloved Son has appeared, when the divine priesthood has been restored, when we hold in our hand another testament of the Son of God. What a glorious and wonderful day this is.</i>[Hinckley, "Summit," 74]<br><br>There is an adage that says, "One does not see the future by looking in a rearview mirror." In contrast, there is another that declares: "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it" (George Santayana, "Flux and Constancy in Human Nature," in<i>Reason in Common Sense,</i>vol. 1 of<i>The Life of Reason</i>[New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1905–1906], 284). For a moment I wish to remind us of some of the spiritual and temporal high points since Joseph Smith's day and then look forward to the new century in anticipation of what lies ahead. We are fortunate to have prophets and apostles who are seers--servants who have provided us with a road map for the future. It is instructive to see what the Lord has said through them regarding the years ahead.<br><h2><b>Some Highlights from the Last Two Centuries</b></h2><br>Since the dawn of time, prophets have spoken of two special periods in the history of the earth. The first is the meridian of time, a time when the Son of God was born, ministered to His people, suffered death, and was resurrected. Moses, Samuel, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Zechariah, and numerous other prophets of the Old Testament foretold of this special season when the Son of God made the earth His footstool. It has now been 2,000 years since the Savior walked the earth, taught the gospel, healed the sick, raised the dead, and voluntarily gave His life that all of His Father's children could have the opportunity to overcome physical and spiritual death.<br><br>The second special period referred to by the prophets is called the dispensation of the fulness of times. According to the Apostle Paul, it is an age when the Lord will "gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth" (Ephesians 1:10; see also D&amp;amp;C 27:13). It is a period often referred to as the last days; a time just preceding the Lord's second coming; a time when He will restore the gospel to the earth, including all of the keys, powers, and authority previously bestowed in earlier days (see Bruce R. McConkie,<i>MD,</i>200, s.v. "dispensation of the fulness of times").<br><br>Isaiah referred to the last days on numerous occasions. He foretold the establishment of the Lord's house "in the top of the mountains" and said that all nations would "flow unto it" (Isaiah 2:2). Isaiah also told of a people whose voice would speak from "the dust," whose words would be in the form of "a book that is sealed"--the words of which could not be read by learned men. And in that day, the Lord would proceed to do "a marvellous work and a wonder" (Isaiah 29:4, 11–12, 14).<br><br>Daniel foresaw a day when the Lord would set up a kingdom that would never be destroyed nor given to another people (see Daniel 2:44). The kingdom was represented by a "stone . . . cut out of the mountain without hands" that would roll across the earth, breaking in pieces earthly kingdoms (Daniel 2:45).<br><br>Malachi spoke of a day just before the Lord's second coming when Elijah the prophet would be sent to "turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers," lest the earth be smitten with a curse (Malachi 4:5–6).<br><br>Peter spoke of the last days when he told the Jews to repent before "the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord" and explained to them that Christ's second coming would not occur until "the times of restitution of all things" (Acts 3:19, 21). Finally, John the Revelator foretold of an event shortly before the Lord's second coming when an angel would return the everlasting gospel to the earth so that it could be preached "to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people" (Revelation 14:6).<br><br>The dispensation of the fulness of times represents a winding-up period preceding the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is a time when the gospel will be preached to every nation, giving the Father's children an opportunity to prepare for the Son's second coming. It will be a day of judgment and the end of the world as we know it. The beginning of this dispensation was initiated by one of the greatest events in the course of human history--the appearance of the Father and Son to the boy Joseph Smith. To illustrate the majesty of the event in the Sacred Grove, can you think of another time when both the Father and the Son appeared on this earth? The scriptures tell of occasions when the Father's voice was heard from the heavens declaring His Only Begotten Son: e.g., at the Savior's baptism (Matthew 3:17), on the Mount of Transfiguration (Matthew 17:5), and to the Nephites in the land Bountiful (3 Nephi 11:3–7). But the Garden of Eden may be the only other place where both openly manifested Themselves on this earth.<br><br>Not only did the Father and the Son open the last dispensation, but John's angel proved to be Moroni, who returned the everlasting gospel so that it could be taken to every nation. The sealed plates Moroni revealed to Joseph Smith fulfilled Isaiah's prophecy that a people would speak out of the ground. The marvelous work and a wonder is the restoration of the gospel and the Book of Mormon's witness that Jesus is the Christ. Elijah returned the sealing keys to Joseph and Oliver Cowdery in the Kirtland Temple on April 3, 1836 (see D&amp;amp;C 110:14–16). Almost immediately the Spirit of Elijah began stirring the hearts of men and women to gather family records and histories so that temple ordinances might be performed. Isaiah's "mountain of the Lord's house" (Isaiah 2:2) has been established in the tops of the mountains in the form of the Salt Lake Temple, and people from all nations have flowed to it both temporally and spiritually.<br><br>Peter's "times of refreshing" refer to the fact that all knowledge that has ever been revealed plus knowledge reserved for the last days will come to light in this last dispensation. The Lord told Joseph Smith in Liberty Jail that no knowledge would be withheld, that "all thrones and dominions, principalities and powers" would be revealed, that the "bounds set to the heavens or to the seas, or to [the earth], or to the sun, moon, or stars--All the times of their revolutions . . . shall be revealed in the days of the dispensation of the fulness of times" (D&amp;amp;C 121:26–32). If one looks at the spiritual refreshing that has taken place through the prophets of this dispensation, plus the rapid discovery of temporal truths, can one doubt that the Lord is refreshing the earth, that the opportunity for men and women to be blessed both spiritually and temporally is vastly different today than at the turn of the 19th century?<br><br>To illustrate the change that has occurred, consider the field of transportation. From the beginning of time to the 19th century, the fastest mode of travel was the horse. Since the restoration of the gospel, new methods have been developed. Now we can travel on trains, automobiles, airplanes, and spaceships. Commercial air travel is so new that the first person ever to fly among my progenitors was my mother in 1947. Missionaries did not use air travel until the late 1950s. I left for England in 1956. The trip from Salt Lake City to London took 10 days by train and ship. Two years later, when I returned home, travel by air was allowed. It took 23 hours to fly from Scotland to Salt Lake City with stopovers in Greenland, New York, and Chicago. The flight across the Atlantic was 12 hours, including the refueling stop in Greenland. Fifteen years later I flew from London to Washington, D.C., on the Concorde in just over three hours. Today a spaceship travels around the earth in little more than one hour.<br><br>Consider the innovations and discoveries of the last few years that influence everyday life: cellular telephones, computers, fax machines, the Internet, new medical devices, genetic engineering, robots, and the sequencing of the human genome. The list is almost endless.<br><br>Unfortunately, the acceptance of temporal knowledge and its benefits has far exceeded the acceptance of spiritual truths. Although the gospel of peace is being taken to almost every corner of the earth, only a tiny fraction of the earth's population has accepted it. Nephi saw our day and said that the members of the Lord's church would be small in number, but they would be "upon all the face of the earth" (1 Nephi 14:12). We are 11 million people today--less than 1 percent of the earth's population. We are scattered across the earth in more than 150 countries. The world has been slow to accept spiritual truths. "For the [20th] century as a whole, warfare is thought to have taken the lives of three times as many people as were killed in 19 previous centuries combined" (David Gergen, "Roaring into 2000,"<i>U.S. News and World Report,</i>3–10 January 2000, 96).<br><h2><b>The 21st Century</b></h2><br>What of the future? What are some of the key developments that will occur in the 21st century? What is the destiny of the Church as the earth rolls forward toward the Lord's second coming?<br><br>First, let us consider the missionary program. Today there are 11 million members and approximately 60,000 missionaries in more than 150 countries. By the year 2025, estimates suggest that Church population will total 25 to 30 million if China remains closed to missionary work and an even larger membership if China opens. Today slightly less than 50 percent of the Church membership resides in North America, with just under 40 percent in Central and South America. By the year 2025, Latin American membership will rise to 15 million, whereas Church population in North America will total 8 million. The missionary force in 2025 will be more than 125,000. By 2025 the missionary program likely will be in every country with missionaries teaching every kindred, tongue, and people. The key variable that will determine the presence or absence of missionaries will be a nation's policies regarding religious freedom. Recent research indicates a strong movement toward freedom, especially in the last few years. A recent<i>Church News</i>article reported this progress as follows:<br><br><i>Researchers found almost 60 percent of the world's population live in free societies, where basic rights and religious freedom flourish. . . . Freedom House--a pro-democracy group based in Washington, D.C.--remarked that whereas 100 years ago, no nation on earth had universal voting rights for its citizens, now 119 of 192 nations have elected representatives. The group could find only 18 nations in which civil liberties were suppressed last year by the military or their rulers.</i><br><br><i>With newfound political freedom comes renewed hope that religious liberties are gaining ground, also. The apostle Paul in his epistle to the Corinthians wrote, "Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." (2 Cor. 3:17.)</i>[Viewpoint, "Blessing of Liberty,"<i>Church News,</i>8 January 2000, 16]<br><br>David Gergen, editor at large of<i>U.S. News and World Report,</i>reported on this same research, indicating that "when the Berlin Wall fell a decade ago, 69 countries were democratic; last week the Freedom House reported the number has grown to 120" ("Roaring into 2000," 96).<br><br>The trend toward freedom will continue during the 21st century. This will occur as the "stone . . . cut out of the mountain without hands" quietly, peacefully moves across the earth. It will occur so that the gospel message can be preached in all the world. Toward the end of Christ's life, His disciples, sitting with Him on the Mount of Olives, asked the following question: "Tell us when shall these things be . . . ; and what is the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?" (JS--M 1:4).<br><br>In response, Jesus told them He would come in a day when the elect would "be gathered from the four quarters of the earth"; a time "of wars, and rumors of wars"; a period in which there would "be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes"; a time when "the love of men shall wax cold"; and a time when "this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world, for a witness unto all nations, and then shall the end come" (JS--M 1:27–31). Then Jesus reminded His disciples that no one knows the hour of His coming, not even the angels of heaven, but His Father only (JS--M 1:40).<br><br>Although we do not know the exact time of the Lord's second coming, the signs of the times are gradually being fulfilled. We live in a day of wars and rumors of wars. Earthquakes are occurring with disturbing frequency. Famines dot the earth and invade parts of continents from one year to the next. An increasing divorce rate, the breakup of families, and larger and larger numbers of latchkey children are indicators that "the love of men [is] wax[ing] cold." The process of gathering the elect from the four corners of the earth has been underway for almost 170 years, and the number of countries enjoying the fruits of missionary work is approaching the full complement.<br><br>There are two other signs that clearly indicate the progress being made by the Church to take the gospel to the four corners of the earth. The first relates to family history and the influence of Elijah. The second relates to the increasing number of temples.<br><br>On May 24, 1999, the Church announced a new Web site for family history. The interest and activity on this site was phenomenal in the following seven months. Between May 24 and December 30, the site experienced 2 billion hits. The site also has a free, downloadable version of the Personal Ancestral File software. More than 300,000 people have downloaded the software during the last few months. Literally millions of people across the earth have accessed the site. Daily traffic is running at a rate of 7 million hits per day. More than 5 million names have been uploaded to the file. The file now contains 600 million names in all. (Data from Richard Turley, managing director of the Church's Family History Department.)<br><br>Can you imagine the progress that will be made during the next 25 years as members and nonmembers from almost every nation use the Internet to build family files and add to the names available for temple work? Family history is one of the most popular activities on the Internet and one of the leading avocations in the world. The Spirit of Elijah is alive and well. The developments in family history represent a miracle. No wonder the pace of temple construction has accelerated.<br><br>Now let me share a few thoughts regarding temples and their spread across the earth. Until recently, a phrase in an Isaiah passage dealing with the last days had escaped me. I have used Isaiah 54:2 many times to explain how the Church grows. In this passage Isaiah likened the Church to a tent, using the Mosaic tabernacle as a metaphor. He described how the tent will spread over the earth by lengthening its cords and strengthening its stakes. Stakes in the Church are special units whose officers are given distinctive priesthood keys and authority to authorize saving and exalting ordinances. The Church grows by establishing new stakes.<br><br>Recently I noticed another phrase that has suddenly taken on meaning. In this same passage, Isaiah's instructions are to "enlarge the place of thy tent, . . . and stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations." I suddenly realized that the phrase "the curtains of thine habitations" refers to temples, to houses of the Lord. In looking at the last days, Isaiah saw that a key feature of Church growth would be the building of temples. Temples will spread across the earth. In fact, President Brigham Young said:<br><br><i>To accomplish this work there will have to be not only one temple but thousands of them, and thousands and tens of thousands of men and women will go into those temples and officiate for people who have lived as far back as the Lord shall reveal.</i>[<i>JD</i>3:372]<br><br>For many years I thought President Young's statement would be fulfilled in the Millennium. Maybe it will, but it is incredible that we are living in the day when it has become apparent that thousands of temples will dot the earth. It is quite possible that there will be a thousand or more temples by the year 2025, with thousands more before you students pass through the veil. At the end of this year there will be at least 100 dedicated temples. If 36 temples per year were built for the succeeding 25 years, there would be one thousand temples. That number is quite reasonable, considering there will be 35 or more temples dedicated this year.<br><br>I remember sitting in the upper room of the Salt Lake Temple in March 1996 during a meeting of the General Authorities. The Church was preparing to dedicate its 50th operating temple after 166 years of this dispensation. At the end of the meeting, President Hinckley stated that he hoped there would be at least 100 temples operating before he completed his assignment on earth. I sat there stunned. The president was in his 86th year. It had taken 166 years for the first 50 temples to be built. I knew him as an optimistic man, but how could another 50 temples be built in the remaining years of his ministry?<br><br>About 18 months later, in another meeting in the Salt Lake Temple, President Hinckley announced the concept of the small temple. On a long summer trip, returning from the old Mormon colonies in Mexico, the manner in which these temples should be constructed was revealed to him. The temples would be of the same quality as the larger ones, they would be built of the finest materials, and they would be constructed to last for hundreds of years. Moreover, many of them would be built next to existing stake centers. The St. Paul Minnesota Temple was dedicated this past weekend, bringing the number of operating temples to 69. The 100th temple, expected to be in Palmyra, New York, will be completed within a few months. Brothers and sisters, we are witnesses of a miracle.<br><br>Do you understand the importance of temples in the Lord's plan? Do you understand how important it is to be worthy of entering a temple? Do you realize that temple work will be a key activity in the Millennium? It is clear that the Lord is preparing the earth for His second coming. May we appreciate the day in which we live. Our pioneer ancestors sacrificed everything they had in order that we might see this day. May we live each day as if the Lord had already come is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Merrill J.

<h1>eaders: The Lord Has a Work for You to Do - Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p class="p1">It is a tremendous blessing to be with you in the first month of a new century, the start of a new millennium. Notwithstanding any difficulties or challenges you may face in the coming years, I am confident you can look forward to unsurpassed opportunities for learning, growth, and service. It is an exciting time to be alive and to be a participant in building the kingdom of God. The Lord has a work for each of you to do, and we meet this morning in His name, knowing that all that is said and done is to honor Him. I pray for His spirit to direct my remarks.</p><br><p class="p1">Do you remember what President Gordon B. Hinckley said about this new millennium in last October's general conference?</p><br><p class="p1"><i>The centuries have passed. The latter-day work of the Almighty, that of which the ancients spoke, that of which the prophets and apostles prophesied, is come. It is here. For some reason unknown to us, but in the wisdom of God, we have been privileged to come to earth in this glorious age. . . .</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> We stand on the summit of the ages, awed by a great and solemn sense of history. This is the last and final dispensation toward which all in the past has pointed. I bear testimony and witness of the reality and truth of these things. . . .</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> . . . Say good-bye to a millennium. Greet the beginning of another thousand years.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> And so we shall go forward on a continuing path of growth and progress and enlargement, touching for good the lives of people everywhere.</i> [Gordon B. Hinckley, "At the Summit of the Ages," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1999, 74]</p><br><p class="p1">Twenty-two years ago I spoke at this devotional about the great need the world and the Church would have for prepared leaders. I repeat a similar message to you because the need for strong leaders is even greater today. Let me begin by helping you to understand the work the Lord has for you to do. I need to review with you some of the highlights in the development of the Church that occurred in the 19th and 20th centuries and then preview for you some of the exciting growth and opportunities for service you may expect as we enter the 21st century. First, let us look at the world as it was 100 years ago.</p><br><p class="p1">In January 1900 Lorenzo Snow was serving as president of the Church at 85 years of age. The previous year, during a visit to St. George, <span class="s1">President Snow was inspired to give a powerful</span> emphasis to the Church concerning the payment of tithing. Then in 1900 he sent one of the last of the wagon trains to the Big Horn Basin of northern Wyoming, asking 100 families to leave familiar surroundings to establish new homes there. As the age of wagon trains was ending, the automobile and aviation age was beginning. It was in 1903 that Wilbur and Orville Wright became the first men to fly.</p><br><p class="p1">In April conference of 1900, President Lorenzo Snow commented on the growth of the Church to that point. He said:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Seventy years ago this Church was organized with six members. We commenced, so to speak, as an infant. . . .</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> . . . But now we are pretty well along to ­manhood. . . .</i></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i> The Lord has prospered us amazingly, and we are doing large things at the present time. We are blessing the people of the world. We are sending . . . two thousand Elders out into the missionary field. . . .</i></span></p><br><p class="p1"><i> Now that we are approaching our seventy-first year, the Lord expects that we will do something--something that will cause the nations to marvel, as what we have done has caused them already to ­wonder.</i> [Lorenzo Snow, <i>CR,</i> April 1900, 1–2]</p><br><p class="p1">The Church began the 20th century with 271,681 members in 40 stakes. Four temples were in operation: St. George, Logan, Manti, and Salt Lake. The 2,000 missionaries described by President Snow were serving in 18 missions in 20 nations and four territories. The Prophet Joseph Smith's vision of the destiny of this Church was beginning to be ­fulfilled.</p><br><p class="p1">It was early in 1834 that a meeting was called by the Prophet Joseph in Kirtland, Ohio. At this time the Saints living in Missouri were suffering great persecutions. The Prophet had announced the intention to go to Missouri and had enlisted a number of volunteers to go as Zion's Camp to rescue the Saints there. Wilford Woodruff gave a vivid description of the Prophet's message to the elders who met in preparation for the Zion's Camp march:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>On Sunday night the Prophet called on all whoheld the priesthood to gather into the little log school house they had there. It was a small house, perhaps 14 feet square. But it held the whole of the priesthood of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who were then in the town of Kirtland, and who had gathered together to go off in Zion's Camp. . . . When we got together the Prophet called upon the elders of Israel with him to bear testimony of this work. . . . When they got through the Prophet said, "Brethren, I have been very much edified and instructed in your testimonies here tonight, but I want to say to you before the Lord, that you know no more concerning the destinies of this Church and kingdom than a babe upon its mother's lap. You don't comprehend it." . . . He said, "It is only a little handful of priesthood you see here tonight, but this Church will fill North and South America--it will fill the world."</i> [Wilford Woodruff, <i>CR,</i> April <span class="s1">1898, 57; punctuation and spelling modernized]</span></p><br><p class="p1">In the earliest years of the development of the Church, at a time when its enemies already were making great efforts to stop the work, the Prophet knew that no enemy, present or future, would have sufficient power to frustrate and stop the purposes of God. Even Joseph's closest associates in those early years did not understand that this Church would roll forth from small beginnings to fill the entire world as prophesied by the Old Testament prophet Daniel (see Daniel 2).</p><br><p class="p1">You may remember that the Articles of Faith first appeared in a letter that Joseph Smith wrote to Mr. John Wentworth, the editor of a Chicago newspaper. In the Wentworth ­letter, which was dated 1 March 1842, Joseph Smith wrote a vision of the destiny of this Church in a profound prophecy. He wrote:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>The Standard of Truth has been erected; no unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done.</i> [<i>HC</i> 4:540]</p><br><p class="p1">As early missionaries of the Church, both <span class="s2">Wilford Woodruff and Lorenzo Snow had helped</span> er<span class="s1">ect the Lord's standard of truth. Lorenzo Snow</span> had been a member of the Church for less than a year when he set out on his first mission in 1837. He told about his first experience preaching the gospel in the following words:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>I . . . traveled about thirty miles, and just as the sun was setting I made my first call for a night's lodging, as a "Mormon" Elder, and was refused; then another, and so on, until the eighth call, when I was admitted to a night's lodging--going to bed supperless, and leaving in the morning, minus a breakfast.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> The first meeting I held was in the neighborhood of my uncle, by the name of Goddard, near the county seat of Medina County, Ohio. The people were notified and a respectable congregation assembled. It was a sore trial to face that audience in the capacity of a preacher, but I believed and felt an assurance that a Spirit of inspiration would prompt and give me utterance. . . .</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> . . . I baptized and confirmed into the Church my uncle, aunt and several of my cousins.</i> [<i>Biography and Family Record of Lorenzo Snow,</i> comp. Eliza R. Snow Smith (Salt Lake City: Deseret News Company, 1884), 16]</p><br><p class="p1">Lorenzo Snow knew the Lord had a work for him to do. He and other early missionaries succeeded in the face of all opposition because they had the unwavering faith and courage to lead out in declaring the truth of the restored gospel by the power of the Spirit of the Lord.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Wilford Woodruff was also given a great work to do because of his faith in Jesus Christ and his willingness to submit to the will of the Lord. In 1840 Wilford Woodruff was sent as a missionary to England. He had been tutored by the Prophet Joseph Smith and was later ordained an apostle. The success of his missionary work in southern England in 1840 may be unparalleled. The following extract comes from his journal:</span></p><br><p class="p1"><i>In the morning I went in secret before the Lord, and asked Him what was His will concerning me. The answer I received was that I should go to the south; for the Lord had a great work for me to perform there, as many souls were waiting for His word.</i> [<i>Wilford Woodruff,</i> ed. Matthias F. Cowley (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1964), 116]</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Wilford Woodruff followed the directions he received from the Lord and was led by the Spirit to the farm of John Benbow in Herefordshire, a region in the south of England where no Latter-day Saint missionary had visited. TheBenbows accepted the gospel and soon introduced Wilford Woodruff to a group of 600 people called the United Brethren (see <i>Woodruff,</i> 116–19). This group had been searching for the truth and had been "calling upon the Lord continually to open the way before them" (<i>Woodruff,</i> 117). Wilford Woodruff recorded in his journal:</span></p><br><p class="p1"><i>T</i><span class="s1"><i>he first thirty days after my arrival in Herefordshire,</i></span><i> I had baptized forty-five preachers and one hundred and sixty members of the United Brethren, who put into my hands one chapel and forty-five houses, which were licensed according to law to preach in. This opened a wide field for labor, and enabled me to bring into the Church, through the blessings of God, over eighteen hundred souls during eight months, including all of the six hundred United Brethren except one person.</i> [<i>Woodruff,</i> 119]</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Last November 11, Sister Ballard and I, in company with Elder and Sister Spencer Condie, visited the Benbow farm, where we stood by the pond where Wilford Woodruff performed many of those baptisms. I had such a profound reverence and feeling of appreciation for this great leader. I thought to myself, "Elder Ballard, are you measuring up to the example of courageous leadership of the faithful first apostles of this last dispensation?" Many of you young men and women will someday be called to leadership responsibilities, and you may well ponder the same question: Are you living up to the example of those who preceded you in your stake, ward, or ­general Church callings?</span></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> O</span><span class="s2">n this same trip we visited the Gadfield Elm</span><span class="s1"> chapel that is being restored through the good work of the British Saints. This is the oldest chapel in the Church, a building where Brigham Young, Wilford Woodruff, and Willard Richards preached.</span></p><br><p class="p1">Again, the reflection back to those great leaders caused me to wonder, "Am I a leader worthy to stand among those early Brethren and feel secure in how I have handled my leadership responsibilities?" Brothers and sisters, please learn from me today that among those of you present, many will be called to positions of leadership in the Church in future years. You mu<span class="s1">st prepare now so you will be ready in every</span> way to lead with courage and faith.</p><br><p class="p1">Because of the great faith of Wilford Woodruff, Lorenzo Snow, and other mission­aries and because of their ability to follow the pr<span class="s1">omptings of the Spirit, the truth of God began</span> to sweep the nations and sound in manyears.</p><br><p class="p1">All of us need to remember that when we enter into the work of the Lord and choose to pursue a course that can bring about great good, we may expect, like Lorenzo Snow and Wilford Woodruff, to encounter some opposition, difficulties, or trials. This is not only because the adversary is very real, but also because such experiences help prepare us to become courageous and wise leaders.</p><br><p class="p1">In the past century, the truth of God has continued to go forth nobly as Joseph Smith prophesied. On September 3, 1925, President H<span class="s1">eber J. Grant announced that the First Presidency had decided to open missionary work in South America. Following the Lord's pattern for unlocking the door of the kingdom in all nations (see D&amp;amp;C 112:16–17, 19), the First P</span><span class="s2">residency called my grandfather, Elder Melvin J.</span><span class="s1"> Ballard, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, with Rulon S. Wells and Rey L. Pratt of the First Council of the Seventy, to go to South America. They were called to dedicate that land for the preaching of the gospel, to open a mission there, and to lay the foundation for establishing the Church in that vast continent. After a three-week journey by ship, covering more than 7,000 miles, the three missionaries arrived in Buenos Aires in December 1925.</span></p><br><p class="p1">On Christmas morning of 1925, at 7:00 a.m., Elder Ballard dedicated the land. The missionary work was slow and difficult in those early months. Of the 16 people attending the first Church meeting, almost all were German immigrants. In the first 10 months while grandfather was there, the missionaries saw only a small handful of converts join the Church; perhaps only one or two of them were native Latin people. In spite of this, the spiritual sensitivity of Elder Melvin J. Ballard caused him to make this remarkable prophecy:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>The work of the Lord will grow slowly for a time here just as an oak grows slowly from an acorn. It will not shoot up in a day as does the sunflower that grows quickly and then dies. But thousands will join the Church here. It will be divided into more than one mission and will be one of the strongest in the Church. The work here is the smallest that it will ever be. The day will come when the Lamanites in this land will be given a chance. The South American Mission will be a power in the Church.</i> [<i>Melvin J. Ballard--Crusader for Righteousness</i> (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1966), 84]</p><br><p class="p1">And as you are aware, brothers and sisters, there has been remarkable growth in the Church in South America.</p><br><p class="p1">B<span class="s1">eginning in 1930, national attitudes toward</span> members of the Church started to change. We entered a new stage under the leadership of President Heber J. Grant. Radio began carrying throughout the country broadcasts of the Tabernacle Choir. The Church's welfare system received national attention, and the press became more positive than negative.</p><br><p class="p1">In the decade of the 1960s, President David O. McKay's slogan "Every member a missionary" became a household theme. As members of the Church responded to President McKay's inspired leadership and counsel, they shared the gospel with more nonmember neighbors and associates. The pace of missionary work accelerated.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> During the four decades from 1930 to 1970, there were 106,799 full-time missionaries set apart. Worldwide Church membership increased fourfold from 663,000 to 2,807,456. More than one million new members were added just in the decade of the 1960s. One ­hundred and four stakes developed into 630 stakes. By 1970, missionaries were serving in 43 nations and nine territories. During this 40-year period, the South American nations of Uruguay, Paraguay, Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela were opened to missionary work. Church leaders reopened missionary work in Chile. In Central America, servants of the Lord unlocked the nations of Panama, Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua. In Asia, major new efforts began to bear fruit in Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and the Philippines.</span></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1">President Spencer W. Kimball led the Church</span> to new heights in carrying the gospel to the people of the world. The Church called many more missionaries, and a greatly increased number of missionaries from their native lands were enlisted in the work. President Kimball called for a widened vision of the work and asked members of the Church to lengthen their stride in moving the gospel across the face of the earth. He called upon the Church to use all of the media--newspapers, magazines, television, and radio--in their greatest power to ­convey the gospel message to unreached millions throughout the earth.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> During the 15 years from 1970 to the end of 1985 when President Kimball died, 230,195 missionaries were set apart to serve full-time missions--more than double the number set apart in the preceding 40 years. Worldwide Church membership grew from 2,807,456 to 5,919,481--three million additional members. The number of stakes increased from 630 to 1,582. Missionary work was opened or reopened in many countries, including India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Micronesia, Kiribati, and other island nations in the Caribbean and Pacific.</span></p><br><p class="p1">Then, during the nine years that President Ezra Taft Benson presided over the Church--that would be from 1985 to 1994--there was further fulfillment of prophecy. It was in this period that the Iron Curtain came down and the Berlin Wall fell. The Lord unlocked the doors so missionaries could serve in Russia, the Ukraine, Poland, Hungary, and other nations that had been behind the Iron Curtain. The Lord's servants also opened many nations of Africa, including Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Ghana, Zaire, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Swaziland, and Ivory Coast. Many others have been opened and will be opened to the preaching of the gospel in the future. Conversion miracles have happened in many lands, and I just share with you one example from my own ministry.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> During the last week of January 1988, 12 years ago, the First Presidency sent me to Lima, Peru, where we had 11 stakes of the Church. Because of the rapid and healthy growth of the Church in that city, I and the areapresidency had the privilege of organizing seven additional stakes in one weekend to make a total of 18 stakes. We held six stake ­conferences, all of which I attended, being shuttled very rapidly from place to place by a native who knew the roads of Lima. I truly saw Joseph Smith's and Melvin J. Ballard's prophecies being fulfilled.</span></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> In the continent of South America, the onemission organized in 1925 has now been divided into 69. The 16 people present at the original Church meeting now have multiplied into more than 1,800,000 members organized into 560 stakes of Zion. The three missionaries who arrived in Buenos Aires in 1925 have swelled into an army of over 12,000. (That's just in South America.) ­Five temples are now in operation, with seven moreunder construction.</span></p><br><p class="p1">As<span class="s1"> we begin the 21st century, we truly stand</span> on the shoulders of the spiritual giants who have preceded us as great leaders. Just as the early Saints were led 100 years ago, we are led by a mighty prophet filled with faith and great vision. President Gordon B. Hinckley will be 90 th<span class="s1">is year and is blessed with strength and energy</span> to lead the Lord's work in all nations and to personally travel the earth to teach and testify of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The Church begins the year 2000 with 10,700,000 members in 2,542 stakes. With just alittle over a quarter million members and 40 stakes in 1900, Church membership has multiplied nearly 40 times, and the number of stakes is more than 60 times greater. During the past century the missionary force has grown from 2,000 in 18 missions to approximately 59,000 serving in 333 missions. The missionary outreach has increased from 21 nations and four territories to 121 nations and 21 territories. In just the past 10 years we have reached 35 additional nations that had been closed to the Church. The Lord's Church has wards or branches in another 4</span>1 nations that do not yet have full-time missionaries. Because of the courageous, inspired leadership of President Gordon B. Hinckley and the faithful payment of tithing by the members of the Church, we now have 69 templ<span class="s1">es in operation around the world and 46 more</span> temples that have been announced or are under construction. We will have 100 temples dedicated by the end of this year. As you know, President Hinckley is interested in that.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The kingdom of God has developed worldwide in a miraculous manner because leaders, members, and missionaries entered into the Lord's work with humility, faith, and courage. Today we continue to face opposition, and we can expect it to accelerate as we endeavor to move this great work forward. Nevertheless, we see the fulfillment of Joseph Smith's prophecy that "the truth of God will go forth ... till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear" (<i>HC</i> 4:540).</span></p><br><p class="p1">With our united faith and efforts and your preparation to become leaders, this Latter-day miracle will continue in this century. Based on past growth rates of the Church, we can project a Church membership of 20 million by 2020 and 50 million by the year 2040. A membership of 50 million would mean more than 11,000 stakes and 130,000 wards and branches. Rodney Stark, a prominent non-Mormon social scientist who has studied the growth of the Church, projects that LDS membership will reach as much as 260 million by 2080 (Rodney Stark, "So Far, So Good: A Brief Assessment of Mormon Membership Projections," <i>Review of Religious Research</i> 38, no. 2 [December 1996]: 175). Some of you will still be alive. You won't be much good, but you'll be alive.</p><br><p class="p1">Who will manage this amazing growth and provide the leadership to bless the Lord's children? Who will keep pace with the exploding fields of technology? We had a remarkable presentation by President Bateman to the board of education just this past week, and what is happening on this campus with technology is overwhelming. Who's going to keep up with it? Who will know the doctrine and keep it pure? Brothers and sisters, it is your generation that will have this responsibility. In the wisdom of God, there is a reason that you are living at this time as we welcome a new century.</p><br><p class="p1">Each one of you is very dear to the Lord. He knows you, and He loves you. Today, as one of the Lord's apostles, I charge you to prepare spiritually and in every other way to be prepared for the important work ahead for you to do. The Lord could well say to you as he said to Moses: "I have a work for thee, . . . my son; and thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten; and mine Only Begotten is and shall be the Savior" (Moses 1:6). You, too, are made in the likeness of the Savior, and He invites you, as sons and daughters of God, to prepare spiritually to enter into His work. It will require your full energy, clear thinking, best efforts, and utmost faith.</p><br><p class="p1">Y<span class="s1">our mission from the Lord will be unfolded</span> to you day by day as you pray, search the scriptures, and diligently give of yourself in the Lord's work. You will come to know your work from the Lord more and more as you submit cheerfully to His will. Remember that it is small acts of service and devotion that bring about great things. The Lord said: "Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great" (D&amp;amp;C 64:33).</p><br><p class="p1">Make this year, this month, this day a new starting point in your life. The Prophet Joseph Smith stated, "If we start right, it is easy to go right all the time; but if we start wrong, we may go wrong, and it [will] be a hard matter to get right" (<i>Teachings,</i> 343). Joseph Smith used this statement to talk about the importance of starting with a correct understanding of God. But it may be applied to the new beginning you have the opportunity of making in your life today. If there is anything in your life that you need to repent of, then I call upon you in the name of the Lord to repent today. Why? Because we need you as faithful, courageous, and prepared leaders.</p><br><p class="p1">In closing, let me share a special experience that Sister Ballard and I had in connection with the announcement of the new PBS television presentation <i>American Prophet: The Story of Joseph Smith.</i> We were assigned to meet with the Vermont PBS leaders and others in Sharon, Vermont, the birthplace of the Prophet Joseph Smith. Time allowed us to visit the homestead of Joseph Smith, Sr., and Lucy Mack Smith in Tunbridge. Researchers have now found the location of the humble cabin in which my mother's great-grandfather Hyrum Smith was born. His brothers Alvin and Samuel and his sister Sophronia were also born in Tunbridge. Can you sense the profound feelings of humility and wonder that came into my heart as I stood at this special site? Two hundred years ago, on February 9, 1800, Hyrum came into this world, destined to become one of the most important and magnificent leaders of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. From very humble beginnings came the leadership power of Joseph, Hyrum, and many others.</p><br><p class="p1">In<span class="s1"> contrast to that experience, on the ­seventh</span> of this month, with several of the Brethren, I toured the magnificent new conference center, w<span class="s1">here 21,000 people will gather in April to attend general conference. From the humble beginnings in Vermont to the great conference center in Salt Lake City, tremendous progress has been made. We must never forget the price paid by the courageous, faithful leaders who had testimonies deeply rooted in the doctrine. They faithfully accepted the challenges of leadership. Our appreciation for their service is best shown by you and me in our willingness to prepare to do our part now and in the future.</span></p><br><p class="p1">I leave you my witness that Jesus Christ lives. He presides and directs this marvelous work. Great blessings await those who prepare now to lead the Church tomorrow.

The premise of all my remarks is that a glorious restoration has taken place in our time. We have come to understand that the history of the world is marked in dispensation units. The world has suffered through periods of relative darkness, ignorance, and error. It has also been blessed with periods of truth and light. You and I have the blessed privilege of living in the full light of day--the dispensation of the fulness of times. This, as they say, changes everything. The scripture in Isaiah 29:14 and repeated in 2 Nephi 27:26 concerning the "marvelous work and a wonder" of the Restoration is well known to all of us. We are not as familiar with the verse that follows. I quote from 2 Nephi 27:27, where the prophet spoke of those who are not enlightened nor made joyful at the news of the restoration of the fulness of the gospel. These people respond: "Surely, your <i>turning of things upside down</i> shall be esteemed as the potter&#39;s clay" (emphasis added). This is a powerful metaphor.<br><br>The implications of the restored gospel are dramatic and far-reaching. Elder Neal A. Maxwell and Elder Dallin H. Oaks have pointed out that a notable aspect of the Apostasy was the incorporation into the doctrine of the Church ideas and philosophies prevalent in that day, largely Greek in origin (Maxwell, "From the Beginning," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1993, 18–20; Oaks, "Apostasy and Restoration," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1995, 84–87). Since religion went significantly wrong in large part because of those ideas and presuppositions, we Latter-day Saints ought to be as wary of accepting them in our academic disciplines and social institutions as we are in our religion.<br><br>The restored gospel of Jesus Christ has the potential to redefine and redeem our understanding of faith, reason, knowledge, and truth in ways that liberate us from problems that, lacking the Restoration perspective, continue to vex and trouble the world and, too often, the souls of many of us.<br><br>Among all the factors contributing to the Apostasy, three are preeminent: first, the loss of the understanding of the true nature of God and thus of our own nature and purpose; second, the loss of apostolic authority and the special witness it provides; and, third, the loss of the fulness of the gifts of the Spirit. It is interesting to me that these three things were among the very first restored in our dispensation. These three essential characteristics of the true Church bear directly on our experience and understanding of faith, reason, knowledge, and truth.<br><h2><b>Faith and Reason</b></h2><br>Discourse about the relationship between faith and reason is centuries old, very sophisticated, and finely nuanced. What I have to say will be incomplete, but I hope not misleading. I believe that discussions of faith and reason have suffered over the centuries because they have not been informed by the truths of the restored gospel. When thus informed, the classic and timeworn tensions between faith and reason disappear. Faith is seen in a new light. In turn, the proper understanding of faith and reason casts new light on common understandings of knowledge and truth.<br><br>It seems unarguable that reason--our capacity and tendency to "make sense" and to engage in consistent, meaningful understanding and expression--is intrinsic to our nature. Scholars have had a tendency, however, to privilege reason over other expressions of our nature. The effect has been that reason has achieved unassailed authority in matters of knowledge and truth. In recent years various postmodern movements have mounted serious challenges to the hegemony of reason, noting that it is as capable of being deployed for oppressive as for noble purposes. In my own scholarly career I have enjoyed the luxury of using powerful postmodern arguments against the excesses of modern rationalism and then using powerful rationalist arguments against the excesses of postmodernism. Through this endeavor I have come to the conclusion that reason as we contemporaneously understand and experience it is fallible, but mostly not pernicious. It is like any other human language--good for certain things, not so good for others.<br><br>Early in the Christian era, attempts were made to reconcile the life-changing power of faith with the compelling persuasive power of reason. Most attempts at reconciliation during the apostate period had one of two results. One result was that faith and reason were reconciled because the foundations of faith were shown ultimately to be reasonable--as in those views that fold easily in a general "natural law" perspective. Those aspects of faith that were reasonable were retained, what was not reasonable was dismissed as mystical. Thus faith and mysticism became strongly connected. The second approach upheld both faith and reason as different approaches to knowledge, ultimately leading to different kinds of knowledge. Reason was thought to lead to certainty, scientific knowledge, and knowledge of the essential. Faith was thought to lead to knowledge of the religious, of that which, by implication, cannot be known with rational certainty. It is easy to see that these two approaches to reconciling faith and reason are essentially the same. Briefly put, reason trumps faith.<br><br>But the reconciliation thus achieved has never been a happy one. As the philosophy of mind progressed and as science and technology developed, reason came to be more and more powerful and persuasive, whereas faith came to be concomitantly less persuasive and the sort of knowledge it provided more mystical and ephemeral. Finally, with the Enlightenment, knowledge was grounded ultimately in what was intuitively perceived as true by the rational mind, and real knowledge became associated with rational certainty--grounded in that which was rationally and logically impossible to doubt. The unintended result of this powerful analytic approach to reason was that faith came to be understood in opposition to certainty, and was thus always vulnerable to doubt. In fact, faith, in a very real sense, came to be that which one believes in the face of doubt.<br><br>Thus it is fair to say that the modern view is essentially that reason and logic ultimately ground knowledge and truth, whereas faith is what we are forced to rely on when we lack indubitable certainty. Faith, on this view, is a sort of positive thinking, what we cling to when we do not know. It is a believing haunted from the fringes by doubt. This is the seemingly paradoxical stuff that many self-styled intellectuals exult in--a seedbed of tragic heroism characterizing the lives of thoughtful persons. This view has, unfortunately, even found its way into LDS culture. However, this understanding of faith and reason is unsatisfactory because it obscures the nature of and attenuates the power of faith. Furthermore, it does not square with the increased knowledge provided by the Restoration.<br><br>If we push the traditional understanding of faith and reason just a bit, we arrive at some rather odd conclusions. If faith is what we "settle for" in the absence of knowledge, then the more we know the less faith we need, or, indeed, the less faith we can have. The more faith we have, the less we know. God, who has all knowledge, has no faith at all. This line of thinking feeds the stereotype that only the ignorant need or have faith. Religion is a crutch, you know. Sometimes this view of faith provides fuel for faith crises, particularly for people who base their identity and worth on their intellectual powers of reason and logic. We Latter-day Saints are in a peculiar position vis-à-vis this understanding of faith because we often begin our most poignant expressions of our faith with the words "I know." I believe we can enrich faith and expand our view of knowledge and truth by entertaining an alternative conception of faith and its relation to reason. For example, the idea of faith as what we cling to in the absence of knowledge does not work very well scripturally. Permit me to paraphrase Hebrews 11:3–5:<br><br><i>Through</i> [what we cling to when we don&#39;t know] <i>we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God. . . .</i><br><br><i>By</i> [what we cling to when we don&#39;t know] <i>Abel . . . obtained witness that he was righteous. . . .</i><br><br><i>By</i> [what we cling to when we don&#39;t know] <i>Enoch was translated.</i><br><br>Nevertheless, this definition of faith and its presumed contrast with reason is so strong that it even moves us to translate the Doctrine and Covenants admonition to "seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118) into a proclamation of our belief in two types of knowledge--one coming by reason and one by faith. Often, even on this campus, we academics divide truth neatly into sacred truths and secular truths. In our reason-driven intellectual pursuits we are on the trail of what we call secular truths, and we even claim to have found some. Although this is a convenient way of speaking about our disciplines, we should ponder why the phrase "secular truth" is not found in scripture. In fact, my computer tells me that <i>truth</i> is never used in scripture in the plural except in two passages (D&amp;amp;C 52:17, 66:1), both referring to things the Lord had previously revealed and was recalling in the present. Rather than a scriptural distinction between types of <i>truths,</i> we find the Lord&#39;s proclamation that "all things unto [Him] are spiritual" (D&amp;amp;C 29:34). From Doctrine and Covenants 29:31–35 we learn that there are temporal (not secular) and spiritual created <i>things,</i> but this does not necessarily imply that there are secular <i>truths.</i> If the distinction between sacred and secular truth were a genuine epistemological watershed, we might reasonably expect in holy writ at least a mention of it. Indeed, most scriptural references to the secular are quite negative. Sometimes we may receive through spiritual means answers to temporal questions and problems. This would seem to imply that all things are indeed spiritual, even when their application is temporal. It may be that from the perspective of the Restoration, the categories of faith, reason, and truth do not have quite the same meaning we have received from our intellectual traditions.<br><br>In place of the common conceptual dimension anchored by faith at one end and reason at the other, I suggest that there are really two dimensions. It might be helpful to picture them as perpendicular to one another. One dimension is anchored on one end by reason and on the other end by its opposite: irrationality, promiscuous subjectivity, or even solipsism. The other dimension is anchored on one end by faith and on the other by the opposite of faith. I have pondered a bit about what the opposite of faith is. I believe the anchor opposite faith is darkness, nihilism, despair--that state of the soul that comes from living "without God in the world" (Ephesians 2:12). To portray faith and reason in this relationship leads us to the conclusion that faith is not what one settles for in the absence of reason and knowledge; it is a type of knowledge, sure and trustworthy and eminently attainable. Portrayed in this way, one could very well have great faith and be also entirely reasonable and rational. That is what we strive for most of the time.<br><br>The other three quadrants created by our axes are interesting. One can have faith and be irrational. This is one stereotype of religious people. Depending on what standards are used to judge rationality, this might be a positive or a problematic lifestyle. One can also have little faith and yet be very reasonable, rational, and logical. We meet many such persons in academic life and in the broader culture. Finally, there is a possibility of being both dark and despairing as well as beyond the pale of reason.<br><br>I want to consider briefly the scriptural case for the suggestion that faith is not merely a state of mind contrived to fill the void created by the absence of reasoned knowledge but rather a very important kind of knowledge. First, I want to consider chapters 30 to 35 of Alma in the Book of Mormon. These chapters, I believe, must be read as a whole. Chapter 29 brings the mission to the Lamanites to a close. Chapter 36 begins the account of Alma&#39;s blessing of his sons, and the account of the Lamanite wars follows. Chapters 30 to 35 have a separate message.<br><br>In chapter 30 we meet Korihor, the antichrist. He propounded insidious and destructive doctrine. However, he "had much success," and what he taught was "pleasing unto the carnal [that is, earthly] mind" (vs. 53). Much of Korihor&#39;s preaching centered on the nature of knowledge. His major premise was that we can only know what we can see. From this it followed that no one can know the future, so that prophecy is impossible and, thus, merely foolish tradition. From this line of analysis his other doctrines followed. His arguments were both reasonable and logical. If they were to be faulted or refuted, such refutation had to be aimed at the major premise--the starting point of the argument.<br><br>Significantly, this is always where reason shows itself to be finite and vulnerable. In chapter 30 Alma immediately responded to Korihor by challenging his starting point and offering an alternative major premise. This teaches us something very important about faith and its relation to reason and knowledge. Interestingly, chapter 31 introduces us to the Zoramites, who espoused religious doctrines similar to Korihor&#39;s. They, too, believed that the words of the prophets were foolish traditions, and they were proud "that their hearts were not stolen away to believe in things to come, which they knew nothing about" (Alma 31:22).<br><br>Korihor and the Zoramites so persuasively presented their view of faith, knowledge, and truth that Alma, as well as Moroni, sensed that it needed a powerful response. It is no coincidence then that what follows in chapter 32 is perhaps the most profound exposition on faith in all of scripture. It is a discourse on faith and knowledge. Time will not permit me to do it justice, but I have come to believe that Alma 32 is a discourse on two types of "perfect" knowledge. One type propounded by Korihor is knowledge grounded purely in sensory experience and reason. The other type of knowledge is grounded in a different kind of experience and is manifested in faith.<br><br>Alma begins the discourse by reminding us that "there are many [including, notably, Korihor] who do say: If thou wilt show unto us a sign from heaven, then we shall know of a surety; then we shall believe" (vs. 17). He then makes a subtle but important point bearing on the nature of faith, reason, belief, and knowledge. He says that this attitude is not faith because "if a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it" (vs. 18). We can easily read this as the old contrast between knowing and clinging to faith that we have come to expect. However, Alma might also be pointing out that what we see or otherwise experience sensorially--e.g., a visual fact or event--is not the sort of thing that requires belief or produces faith. If I meet a friend on the sidewalk, he will not ask, "Do you believe I am here?" If he were to do that, I would try to get him professional help. By the same token, when I bump my head, no one asks whether I believe I really bumped it or whether I believe I am in pain. Faith and belief are irrelevant to such experiences. What matters is what they mean for us and what we do about them. It is not by seeing a sign but by responding to it that we enter the domain where faith can be understood.<br><br>Alma goes on in verse 19 to point out that lacking this sort of sensory knowledge and residing in belief is a great blessing, a protection from the condemnation that comes from sinning against certain kinds of knowledge. The veil between this life and the next is, it seems, a great protection to people like me who might not be quite able to stop sinning, even in the factual and unarguable presence of God Himself. I am grateful to live in a world of belief and faith for now while I prepare to live better.<br><br>In that verse we all know so well, Alma teaches us that faith, like belief, is not to have this sort of "perfect knowledge" (vs. 21). Faith is like belief in this way, but Alma makes it clear that it is not merely belief. Faith grows into a knowledge that is, in its crucial attributes, perfect. In contrast to knowledge founded on what we see, and also subtly different from mere belief, faith is allied with "hope for things which are not seen, which are true." Faith thus is not a clinging to in the absence of knowledge of truth but a hope for what is true. A skeptic might well want to call Alma&#39;s bluff at this point: "Okay, how can you hope for what is true if you don&#39;t already know it?" (Korihor was a clever man.) The answer is that faith leads to and indeed already is just such knowledge because it is the hope of truth; if it were not, it would not be <i>real</i> hope. Faith is not a placeholder for truth. As we learn later in the chapter, it is more like the seed of truth--alive, growing, pushing upward. After reminding us that God speaks to us and after reiterating the importance of being humble, Alma asks us in verse 27 to begin not with mere belief but with a "desire to believe"--the first stirrings of faith. He invited us "to an experiment." Note that an experiment is not the same as sight or rationality. It engages the entire person.<br><br>If we exercise our faculties and develop the moral character necessary for the experiment to work, the seed, which is the true word of Christ, "swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow" (vs. 30). Alma then makes the crucial distinction: "Are ye <i>sure</i> that this is a good seed? I say unto you, Yea" (vs. 31; emphasis added). And in conclusion:<br><br><i>And now, behold, is your knowledge perfect? Yea, your knowledge is perfect in that thing, . . . for ye</i> know <i>that the word hath swelled your souls, and ye also know that it hath sprouted up, that your understanding doth begin to be enlightened, and your mind doth begin to expand.</i><br><br><i>O then,</i> is not this real? <i>I say unto you,</i> Yea. [Alma 32:34–35; emphasis added]<br><br>We have come a long distance in our understanding of faith. We have come from faith not being a perfect knowledge to a knowledge which <i>is</i> perfect. I believe that this entire process whereby we begin to experience the fruits of truth and to know one thing and then another is faith. As this process, faith leads us to a knowledge as sure and as perfect as any we could ever want. Faith could not become knowledge unless it already were knowledge. In a very real sense faith <i>is</i> knowledge--not the knowledge whose claim to perfection is in sensory experience or in rational argument but whose claim to perfection is in discernible and undeniable experience. Note the image Alma uses to describe the experience of this sure knowledge: "Ye have <i>tasted this light"</i> (vs. 35; emphasis added). There is nothing unsure about the experience of taste. Alma&#39;s use of <i>taste</i> is significant. Psychologists have discovered many visual illusions that demonstrate that what we see is often not what is really there. However, not a single "taste illusion" has ever been discovered.<br><br>Interestingly, after having told us that our knowledge is perfect in verse 34, Alma says in verses 35 and 36 that it is not perfect and that we still need faith. So we have a knowledge that is perfect and not perfect. I take this to mean that this entire process of faith gives us knowledge that is perfect in the sense of being sure, nothing lacking, but that it is not perfect in the sense of coming to an end. Here again the contrast with knowledge anchored only in reason is sharp. As reason is understood in our modern age, the point of reason or logical analysis is to bring a question or argument to a close. Having made the logical argument, there is nothing more to know on the matter--that is the goal of perfect reason. As children of the eternal God, with a destiny described as "eternal progression," what might we expect but a perfect knowledge that continues, a knowing that is a way of life--we might say eternal life--the rewards of which are fruit "most precious, . . . sweet above all that is sweet," so that we can be "filled, that [we] hunger not, neither shall [we] thirst" (vs. 42).<br><br>Chapters 33 and 34 of Alma are aimed at explaining how this faith experiment works, how we know by faith. Chapter 33 teaches of the role of scriptures and prayer. Chapter 34 reframes the question of faith. The question the Zoramites had was how to plant the seed and do the experiment. Amulek, no doubt moved upon by the Spirit, tells us what the real question of faith is: "And we have beheld that the great question which is in your minds is whether the word be in the Son of God, or whether there shall be no Christ" (Alma 34:5).<br><br>Faith is anchored in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and the knowledge of Him is both sure and possible. The contrast between faith as sure knowledge and the knowledge reason can provide is evident when we compare Amulek&#39;s testimony of Christ as the anchor to sure knowledge with the conclusion of many Nephites just before His coming:<br><br><i>And they began to reason and to contend among themselves, saying:</i><br><br><i>That it is not</i> reasonable <i>that such a being as a Christ shall come.</i> [Helaman 16:17–18; emphasis added]<br><br>Not "reasonable," but nonetheless true.<br><h2><b>Knowledge</b></h2><br>As I mentioned earlier, historically, faith and reason have been distinguished by the different types of knowledge each produces. This unhappy resolution meant that reason was granted preeminence over faith, laying claim to certain knowledge. Faith became the absence of knowledge. However, there is another distinction between the sort of knowledge associated with faith and that associated with reason. We can perhaps understand the distinction better by referring to a distinction made in Latinate languages between two types of knowledge. I will refer to the Spanish verbs <i>saber</i> and <i>conocer.</i> Although the difference is complex, at least it can be said that <i>saber</i> means to know such things as facts, to assert propositional knowledge, and to know that something is the case. <i>Conocer,</i> on the other hand, is "to be intimately acquainted with." It is used to express knowledge of persons, places, and experiences. I might say that I know my wife, and no one could reasonably ask, "Are you sure?" This kind of knowing is a type to which traditional issues of rational certainty do not apply. And yet it is no less sure than propositional knowledge. Indeed, in many ways it is more sure. We must remember that our faith is faith <i>in</i> the Lord Jesus Christ. Faith in a person is a very different thing from faith that some proposition is true.<br><br>The perfect knowledge of reason is only as perfect as its anchors--those premises from which all processes of reason must begin. If the premises are true, reason may take us to truth--a propositional truth giving us confidence that our sense of the world corresponds with what is. The problem is that all reason must begin with premises that reason itself cannot validate--except on other premises, thus begging the question. If Alma was right, faith leads us to another kind of perfect knowledge--to truth--and reason, in a way, leads us away. That is, once we know what is true, reason provides a wonderful tool for sorting out our obligations, anticipating consequences, and persuading others that what we know is true. Truth, I am convinced, can be rendered reasonable, but it does not arise from reason.<br><br>For example, the truth of Mormonism does not rest on reason. We do not draw our authority, our identity, or our mission from any set of propositions or from any interpretation of doctrine. We do not draw upon theology at all as justification for our truth claims. The truth of Mormonism rests on the occurrence of certain events. Chief among the founding events are these: the Father and the Son either appeared to Joseph Smith in New York or They did not; there either were gold plates holding a history of real people or there were not; apostles and prophets laid hands on Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery or they did not. We can go beyond this. The truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ itself rests on the occurrence of events. There was a Man, Jesus, or there was not; He overcame the whole of sin and darkness in the garden or He did not; the tomb was empty or it was not. The truth of an event is very different from the truth of a proposition. The truth of propositions is established by reason and argument, the difficulty of which I have just described. The truth of events is established by witnesses. Because of the restoration of the true gospel, we are blessed with an abundance of witnesses. This is why the apostolic authority of special witnesses and the restoration of the gifts of the Spirit are essential to the true church. Scriptures also witness of these things, and we Latter-day Saints have an embarrassment of riches where scripture is concerned. In this context, faith is not what we cling to when we do not know truth, faith is the knowledge of truth nourished by good acts. It is strengthened by witnesses capable of penetrating our very souls and culminates in the palpable fruits of sure and certain experience.<br><br>Faith is not a placeholder for knowledge or what we cling to in its absence. This common reading of faith has led me to misread a very important passage from Hebrews: "Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen" (Hebrews 11:1). I used to translate this scripture to mean faith is only evidence, not the real thing--it is only a hope that unseen substances are real. But I misread. Straightforwardly it says faith is substance, it is evidence--the evidence Alma talked about; the evidence God gives us by many witnesses; the evidence we give to each other; and what we evidence in our own lives. It is not the substitute for things hoped for but their very substance. Faith as this substance "maketh an anchor to the souls of men, which would make them sure and steadfast, always abounding in good works" (Ether 12:4).<br><br>One of the supernal blessings of the restored gospel is knowing that the anchor of faith is itself anchored in the embodied God whose existence is not established by reason but whose literal existence itself grounds our knowledge of Him. He only is the God who can say:<br><br><i>Arise and come forth . . . that ye may thrust your hands into my side, . . . feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world.</i> [3 Nephi 11:14]<br><br>Faith in Him is in every sense truth. It is knowledge perfect in every way.<br><br>It is true that in this life we must live by faith. We are consigned to live outside the presence of our God. The purpose of life is to be proven even as we prove God&#39;s promises. God declared:<br><br><i>We will make an earth whereon these may dwell;</i><br><br><i>And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.</i> [Abraham 3:24–25]<br><br>The test of life is to do the will of our God. Faith is not the part of the test designed to make it difficult to return to Him; it is what our God has given us to make it possible to return to Him. The trial of faith is not to see what we will do without Him but to see what we can do with Him. I believe we are asked to live by faith not so much to pass the test of being on our own but because we need to learn things of eternal and enduring import. We must learn to know how to respond to witnesses. We must learn to know in the very important way faith makes it possible to know--something that might not develop otherwise in God&#39;s presence. We must live by faith. For this I am most grateful, because to live by faith is to live with God.<br><br>The Savior has said, "I am . . . the truth" (John 14:6). He also warned us: "Wherefore, let all men beware how they take my name in their lips" (D&amp;amp;C 63:61).<br><br>Let us then be clear in our vision as we pursue and proclaim truth. After being involved for years as a scholar in issues of faith, reason, knowledge, and truth, I have learned that it is much easier for the Lord to make a good man or woman smart than it is to make a smart man or woman good. May we be protected from crises in our faith occasioned by the precepts of men. May we experience faith as a blessing and not as a burden, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Richard N.

<h1>anifestation from God - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for the beautiful prayer and the lovely music. I want to start today by expressing my appreciation to all who have made my experience at Brigham Young University such a sweet experience, starting with my time here as a student and including many years as a full-time faculty member. I know many of you have a deep appreciation for this institution and what it stands for and for the potential it has to influence the world for good. There are others who have not developed that appreciation, and it may take even years after you leave to realize what a blessing it was to be part of what we experience here. This institution is an example of God's love for us.<br><br>After President and Sister Bateman's devotional a few weeks ago, I had a concern. Sister Bateman and I are both vertically challenged. We are about the same height, and President Bateman, who is over six feet tall, is conducting today. I was concerned I would have a problem with the height of the podium and teleprompter. I was assured the problem would be taken care of. Thank you, President Bateman, for conducting today's devotional on your knees.<br><br>I hope you will allow me to thank individuals for the love and support they have given to me to this point in my life. Thank you to my mother, who is seated here in the front row. I know she will love me no matter what happens today. Thank you to my father, who, after a battle with a number of health problems, was called home by a loving Father in Heaven. I miss him. Thank you to my sister, brother, nieces, and nephews, who love me no matter how many times I have failed. And thank you to friends and other family members who have shown they care about me and who I am.<br><br>I have asked myself over and over what I can say that will motivate you to listen or comfort you or add to your testimony. I ask for your faith and prayers and pray the Lord will bless me so I can say something that will be of value to you.<br><br>President Howard W. Hunter said:<br><br><i>The world in which we live would benefit greatly if men and women everywhere would exercise the pure love of Christ, which is kind, meek, and lowly. ... It is selfless because it seeks nothing in return. ... It encourages diverse people to live together in Christian love regardless of religious belief, race, nationality, financial standing, education, or culture.</i> [Howard W. Hunter, "A More Excellent Way," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1992, 61–62]<br><br>An act of Christlike love and sacrifice occurred in Fayette, North Carolina, where Jane Smith was a junior high school teacher. In Jane Smith's school there was a rule against students wearing baggy pants. One day Jane was on hall duty when she noticed a student, whom she had never known before, wearing baggy pants. She approached him about the dress code violation. He looked at the teacher and said he wore the baggy pants to provide comfort for daily dialysis. Jane looked into the eyes of that young man and without hesitating offered him one of her kidneys. A month later, on December 16, 1999, the surgery was successfully performed, and Jane Smith donated one of her kidneys to this young male student. What an example of loving as Christ would!<br><br>Love is a manifestation from God, and, as Mary Ellen Edmunds stated, "It is the most gentle yet powerful force in the world" (<i>Love Is a Verb</i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1995], ix). President Howard W. Hunter told us that "we need a more peaceful world" ("Excellent Way," 63). The Prophet Joseph Smith said: "If we would secure and cultivate the love of others, we must love others, even our enemies as well as friends" (<i>HC</i> 5:498).<br><br>In John 15:13 we read, "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends." And John also taught us:<br><br><i>In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.</i><br><br><i>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us.</i> [1 John 4:9–10]<br><br>Jesus Christ laid down His life for us because He loves us. With this example of love, He became our advocate. An advocate is someone who believes in us, supports our efforts, and knows our strengths and weaknesses. An advocate will help us turn weaknesses into strengths. Elder C. Max Caldwell of the Seventy said:<br><br><i>By permitting his Son to make such a selfless and suffering sacrifice, the Father provided us with an ultimate expression of his love as his gift to the rest of his children.</i> ["Love of Christ," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1992, 29]<br><br>Elder Caldwell went on to say that sacrifice is an example of how much we love God.<br><br>God also manifested His love for us when He sent Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden. This was necessary for the exaltation of Adam and his posterity, and death is a prerequisite for resurrection. Without this example of love there would not have been the Atonement, no temporal and spiritual death. Salvation would not have been possible without the Fall and the Atonement. Truly the Fall of Adam is one of the greatest blessings and acts of love from God to mankind.<br><br>The Father and His Son have set the example of how we as family members should love one another. We need to be willing to sacrifice for one another. God sending His Son to atone for our sins is a manifestation of His love for us.<br><br>I would like each of you to think about your family for a minute and visualize in your mind the picture of your family you have in your apartment, home, or office where you work. You belong to that family unit, and the parents of that unit show their love for you. How do you show love for your parents?<br><br>If everyone in this beautiful building were seated in the chair-seat section and a picture was taken, it would be a picture of a large earthly family. The photographer taking this family unit picture would be our Father in Heaven. In 1 Nephi 17:36 we read, "Behold, the Lord hath created the earth that it should be inhabited; and he hath created his children that they should possess it."<br><br>Living in our expanded earthly family units at BYU and our individual family units at home is not always easy. Many of you were able to select who would make up all or part of your family unit while you are a student. Many did not know the members of their new family unit before becoming a part of it. These units have now expanded to a ward family and a family home evening group. Every day you are faced with problems that develop contention within your new families at BYU. Many of these situations are difficult, and sometimes it can seem difficult if not nearly impossible to make the situation right again. But these experiences provide opportunities to develop patience, understanding, tolerance, trust, and love. As we develop these qualities in a small family unit, we will be able to apply them in relationships we will have throughout our lives in our expanded earthly family units. We need to remember that we are each a spirit son or daughter of our Heavenly Father, who loves us and desires to bless us. As family members we should develop an attitude of loving and lifting each other up. President Howard W. Hunter said:<br><br><i>We need to be kinder with one another, more gentle and forgiving. We need to be slower to anger and more prompt to help. We need to extend the hand of friendship and resist the hand of retribution. In short, we need to love one another with the pure love of Christ, with genuine charity and compassion and, if necessary, shared suffering, for that is the way God loves us.</i> ["Excellent Way," 61]<br><br>Love is obedience. Adam and Eve demonstrated their love for God by obeying Him. Obedience is one way for us to show our love for Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and others. President James E. Faust said that obedience to God's commandments is "an expression of our love for God. Blessed are those who need no reasons other than their love for the Savior to keep his commandments" (in James P. Bell, <i>In the Strength of the Lord: The Life and Teachings of James E. Faust</i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1999], 410).<br><br>My point is illustrated in a story by an unknown author that has appeared under many titles:<br><br><i>Years ago there was a very wealthy man who shared a passion for art collecting with his devoted young son. Together they traveled around the world, adding only the finest art treasures to their collection. Priceless works by Picasso, Van Gogh, Monet, and many others adorned the walls of the family estate. The widowed elderly man looked on with satisfaction as his only child became an experienced art collector. The son's trained eye and sharp business mind caused his father to beam with pride as they dealt with art collectors around the world.</i><br><br><i>As winter approached, war engulfed the nation, and the young man left to serve his country. After only a few short weeks, his father received a telegram. His beloved son was missing in action. The art collector anxiously awaited more news, fearing he would never see his son again. Within days his fears were confirmed. The young man had died while rushing a fellow soldier to a medic.</i><br><br><i>Distraught and lonely, the old man viewed the upcoming Christmas holidays with anguish and sadness. The joy of the season that he and his son had so looked forward to would visit his house no longer.</i><br><br><i>On Christmas morning a knock on the door awakened the depressed old man. As he walked to the door, the masterpieces of art on the walls only reminded him that his son was not coming home. As he opened the door, he was greeted by a soldier with a large package in his hands. He introduced himself to the man by saying, "I was your son's friend. I was the one he was rescuing when he died. May I come in for a few minutes? I have something to show you."</i><br><br><i>As the two began to talk, the soldier told of how the man's son had shared with everyone his and his father's love of fine art.</i><br><br><i>"I'm an artist," said the soldier, "and I want to give this to you."</i><br><br><i>As the old man unwrapped the package, the paper gave way to reveal a portrait of the man's son. Though the world would never consider it the work of a genius, the painting featured the son's face in striking detail. Overcome with emotion, the man thanked the soldier, promising to hang the picture above the fireplace. A few hours after the soldier had departed, the old man set about his task. True to his word, the painting went above the fireplace, pushing away thousands of dollars worth of art. And then the man sat in his chair and spent Christmas gazing at the gift he had been given.</i><br><br><i>During the days and weeks that followed, the man realized that even though his son was no longer with him, the boy's life would live on because of those he had touched. He would soon learn that his son had rescued dozens of wounded soldiers before a bullet stilled his caring heart. As the stories of his son's gallantry continued to reach him, fatherly pride and satisfaction began to ease his grief. The painting of his son became his most prized possession, far eclipsing any interest in the expensive pieces for which international museums clamored. He told his neighbors the portrait of his son was the greatest gift he had ever received.</i><br><br><i>The following spring the old man became ill and passed away. The art world was in anticipation that with the collector's passing, and his only son dead, those paintings would be sold at auction.</i><br><br><i>According to the will of the old man, all of the artworks would be auctioned on Christmas Day, the day he had received his greatest gift.</i><br><br><i>The day soon arrived, and art collectors from around the world gathered to bid on some of the world's most spectacular paintings. Dreams would be fulfilled this day, and greatness would be achieved as many would be able to claim, "I have the greatest collection."</i><br><br><i>The auction began with a painting that was not on any museum's list. It was the painting of the old man's son. The auctioneer asked for an opening bid, but the room was silent.</i><br><br><i>"Who will open the bidding with $100?" he asked.</i><br><br><i>Minutes passed, and no one spoke. From the back of the room came a voice, "Who cares about that painting? It's just a picture of his son. Let's forget it and move on to the good stuff." Many voices echoed in agreement.</i><br><br><i>"No, we have to sell this one first," replied the auctioneer. "Now, who will take the son?"</i><br><br><i>Finally, a neighbor of the old man spoke, "Will you take $10 for the painting? That's really all I have. And since I knew the boy, I'd like to have it."</i><br><br><i>After more silence, the auctioneer said, "I have $10. Will anyone go higher?" Then the auctioneer said, "Going once, going twice, gone."</i><br><br><i>The gavel fell. Cheers filled the room, and someone exclaimed, "Now we can get on with it and we can bid on the real treasures!"</i><br><br><i>The auctioneer looked at the audience and announced the auction was over.</i><br><br><i>Stunned disbelief quieted the room. Someone spoke up and asked, "What do you mean, it's over? We didn't come here to bid on a picture of some old guy's son. What about all of these other paintings? There are millions of dollars worth of art here! I demand that you explain what is going on!" Other voices raised in agreement.</i><br><br><i>The auctioneer raised his hand and the room quieted. He then replied, "It's very simple. According to the will of the father, whoever takes the son gets it all."</i><br><br>Just as those art collectors discovered that Christmas Day, the message is still the same: Because of the love of the Father--a Father whose greatest joy came from His Son, who went away and gave His life rescuing others--whoever takes the Son gets it all!<br><br>The Father lovingly gave us His Son. We receive that gift by taking upon us His name, by striving to pattern our lives after His example, and by manifesting our love of Him and the Father through our obedience.<br><br>One aspect of obedience is to love our neighbors as ourselves, to care for one another. That sense of caring leads to godlike concern. Elder Marion D. Hanks said, "Tillich has spoken of God's love as 'ultimate concern'--that is, that God cares about as much as can be. We are here to learn to care that much about each other" (<i>The Gift of Self</i> [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1974], 61). This type of ultimate concern can be seen in the example of<br><br><i>the young bishop who, against pressures and problems and at considerable inconvenience, traveled to another city to visit a bereaved widow on the eve of her husband's funeral. The couple had long since moved from the bishop's area, but he had made the effort to be with his good, wonderful old friends at this tender time. He found the elderly lady standing alone beside the body of her beloved of more than half a century. As he comforted her, she said through her tears, "Oh bishop, I knew</i> you <i>would come."</i> [Hanks, <i>Gift of Self,</i> 61; emphasis in original]<br><br>The bishop showed obedience to the principle that our love and caring for others is a measure of our love of God. In Matthew 25:40 we find confirmation of loving others and obedience: "Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."<br><br>As individuals we are concerned with achieving our full potential, the potential that God knows we have. Christlike love is essential in achieving our potential. We need to view ourselves in an eternal perspective and see ourselves as our Father in Heaven sees us. We need to accept God's love for us and be obedient. If we do this, we will understand and recognize our eternal worth. There is a formula for learning to recognize this eternal worth: watching over and caring for one another, strengthening each other, serving one another, lifting up the hands and arms that hang down, and strengthening the feeble knees. The element that causes this formula to work is to bless individuals as the Savior did. This is only possible if we love unconditionally.<br><br>Do we take the opportunity to follow the examples of our Father in Heaven and Jesus Christ as to how we should love one another? Do we follow Their example as we interact with one another? If we follow Their examples, we will respect our differences and forgive our weaknesses and mistakes and love each other unconditionally. We should remember that our lives are shaped by those who love us and by those who fail to do so. Each day we should ask our Father in Heaven to help us have an understanding of and love for others.<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell stated, "Too often we behave as if we were in massive competition with others for God's love. But we have His love, unconditionally and universally; it is our love of Him that remains to be proven, such as through service to others" (<i>Even As I Am</i> [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1982], 63).<br><br>As individuals we need to learn that we are more important than our mistakes and that we are worthwhile, valuable, and useful. Most important, we need to learn that our Father in Heaven loves us. Thirty years ago I was a faculty member at the BYU--Hawaii campus, known at that time as the Church College of Hawaii. I was called to serve as a regional sports director. The members in the islands love their sports programs and were always anxious to host Young Women regional tournaments. The tournaments were traditionally held on the islands with the greatest population.<br><br>Each year the sports director from the small island of Molokai volunteered to host the Young Women regional volleyball tournament. Molokai was not only one of the smallest islands in both LDS and non-LDS population, but the island lacked gymnasium and housing space for the tournament. Nevertheless, I was impressed to investigate the possibility of holding the Young Women regional volleyball tournament on the island of Molokai. The tournament would be held in the month of March, a traditionally rainy month. This would not have been a concern on Oahu or the big island of Hawaii because everything would be housed inside. But on this small island, the area where meals would be served would be totally out-of-doors. The area where more than 100 young women would be housed would also be partially out-of-doors. The sites where the matches would be held were several miles apart, and the young women would be transported from their eating, sleeping, and tournament sites in large, open, green pineapple trucks.<br><br>I arrived on the island in early November to look at the sites and to determine if indeed they would be able to host such a large tournament. The small group of Saints were so excited to have someone believe as they did that they could host the tournament. They had in place all the necessary requirements. I still had a concern about the rain. If it rained, the tournament could not be held. I expressed my concern to the Molokai Church leaders, and their response was, "Sister Durrant, don't worry. Our Father in Heaven loves us, and we love Him." How do you question that answer?<br><br>When I returned to Oahu, my counselors were still questioning my decision to hold the tournament on Molokai. In December the rain started in the South Pacific, and it ended up being a year with history-making rain and hurricane-type weather throughout all the islands. Still, the Saints in Molokai insisted they would be able to host the tournament. The rain continued. I again visited the island in the middle of February, three weeks before the tournament. I was doubting my decision. How could this tournament happen? The weather forecast was rain through April. The members once again reassured me that they were loved.<br><br>I arrived on Thursday at the Molokai airport nine hours before the young women would arrive and the first round of the tournament would begin. Three hours after my arrival the rain stopped. The tournament was a success, and the Molokai Saints' dream came true--they had the opportunity to host a tournament. The tournament ended with a huge Hawaiian luau, a beautiful experience for all who attended. The young women and their leaders all bore their testimonies of their love for God, and they knew God loved them.<br><br>I was with the last group to leave the island. On our way to the airport, the rain started again. The Young Women president turned to me and said, "We told you that our Father in Heaven loved us." The rain continued until the first of April. The Saints on the island of Molokai were loved and loved unconditionally.<br><br>A more recent example of unconditional love was the African Saints' response to the visit of President Hinckley. I am sure you were touched as I was at the outpouring of love for the Lord's prophet. It started with the respect and reverence they showed by all being dressed in white and listening to every word from the mouth of the Lord's anointed. Tears welled in my eyes as the assembled African Saints waved white hankies or their hands as the prophet and other leaders left the building where the conference was held. It was also touching to see President Hinckley stop and wave back at them. They showed their unconditional love. That same love was evident in the Marriott Center two months ago when President Hinckley spoke to us. When President Hinckley stood to leave the building, a student started to sing "We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet." Do we in all our associations possess and give that unconditional love to all who are around us?<br><br>The turning away of individuals from feeling our Father in Heaven's love is a divisive tool shaped by Satan. The adversary is real, and he does not want us to love our Father in Heaven and His Son with all our hearts. The Lord's love is consistent--even when we turn away from Him through sin. That consistent love for us will help us through personal adversities. All of life's problems can be solved and turned into stepping-stones of progress if we love God with all our heart, might, mind, and strength and love ourselves and our neighbors. We need to remember our Father in Heaven looks upon our hearts. It is important to remember we are His children and are products of His workmanship. Trust in God's love for you with all your heart. Elder Marion D. Hanks assured us that "we are [Heavenly Father's] children, worthy of love, and we have in us the capacity to love" (<i>Gift of Self,</i> 282). The beautiful and tender hymn "I Am a Child of God" says it all.<br><br>Another tool that Satan utilizes to turn us against one another is in the form of contention. Love cannot survive in a situation where contention exists. The following scripture is a guide to eliminating contention in our lives: "And it came to pass that there was no contention in the land, because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people" (4 Nephi 1:15). Contention causes the Spirit of God to leave, and it does not matter who is right or wrong. If individuals will humble themselves and eliminate pride from their lives, they will see that contention is replaced with love for the individuals with whom they associate. Elder Neal A. Maxwell counseled us, "The men and women of Christ magnify their callings without magnifying themselves [and] seek to exercise power by long-suffering and unfeigned love" ("Put Off the Natural Man, and Come Off Conqueror," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1990, 16).<br><br>When we eliminate contention, the Spirit of God will return, and we will see each other in a different light and through different eyes. Our lives will once again become an expression of our gratitude for our Father in Heaven and Jesus Christ, which in turn will create a positive influence in the decisions we must make. President Howard W. Hunter said, "Those who are filled with the love of Christ do not seek to force others to do better; they inspire others to do better" ("Excellent Way," 63). Again, contention will not remain if we follow the counsel found in 1 John 4:21: "And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also."<br><br>Love is a manifestation from God and truly is the most gentle and powerful force in the world. We have been given the key to loving and respecting differences. We must obey our Father in Heaven's commandments and look at everything and everyone through Christlike eyes. We have been given the opportunity to share that powerful gift of God throughout the world through the gospel of Jesus Christ. Joseph Smith said, "Love is one of the chief characteristics of Deity. ... A man [or woman] filled with the love of God is not content with blessing his family alone, but ranges through the whole world, anxious to bless the whole human race" (<i>HC</i> 4:227; punctuation modernized).<br><br>Students who attend this university are part of that plan to extend love to all the world in the form of service. Can we be the kind of individual in the story told of the World War I soldier who asked his officer if he might go out into the no-man's-land between the trenches to bring in one of his comrades, who lay wounded.<br><br>"You can go," said the officer, "but it's not worth it. Your friend is probably dead, and you will throw your own life away trying to see him."<br><br>But the man went anyway. Miraculously he managed to reach his friend, hoist him onto his shoulders, and bring him back to their company's trench. As the two of them tumbled in together to the bottom of the trench, the officer checked the wounded soldier, then looked kindly at his friend.<br><br>"I told you it wouldn't be worth it," he said. "Your friend is dead, and you are wounded."<br><br>"It was worth it, sir," said the rescuer.<br><br>"How do you mean, worth it? I tell you, your friend is dead," said the officer.<br><br>"Yes, sir," the boy answered, "but it was worth it because when I got to him, he said, 'I knew you'd come.'"<br><br>As Elder Marvin J. Ashton has told us, "What we love takes our time. That to which we give time, we are apt to love" (<i>Ye Are My Friends</i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1982], 12–13).<br><br>I challenge each of us to remember we are part of our Father in Heaven's earthly family, and we should love each other as our Father in Heaven and Jesus Christ love us. Look around you and you will see examples of Christlike love in the form of obedience, sacrifice, trust, respect, commitment, loyalty, patience, and tolerance. It is manifested in your families--brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, grandparents, the earth, this university, our beloved prophet, the temples, and the gospel.<br><br>I testify that God and His Son truly love each of us the same. I pray that each of you will find and cling to that one consistent aspect in your life and that you will sense how valued each of you are in our Father in Heaven's eyes.<br><br>May God bless you with his choicest blessings. The gospel of Jesus Christ is true. Gordon B. Hinckley is a prophet of God. Joseph Smith is a prophet of God and indeed as a young boy experienced God's love in the Sacred Grove. The restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ is also a manifestation of God's love. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Earlene Durrant was chair of the BYU Department of Physical Education when this devotional address was given on 8 February 2000.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1> Love Thee? Charity and Romance - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am delighted to be with you the day after Valentine's Day and the day before Sister Holland's birthday. Guess what is on my mind! Guess what I am going to talk about! Yes, I am going to talk about love, because Shakespeare made me do it. You see, it is the fifteenth of February. If it were the fifteenth of March, it would be the ides of March. And everybody remembers what Brutus did to Julius Caesar on the ides of March--and it befell Mark Antony to get back at Brutus in the great funeral oration, the same Mark Antony who let Cleopatra take him for the proverbial trip up the Nile without a paddle. Never mind that the ides of February were actually the day before yesterday. I am certainly not going to let that stop me from speaking about love and romance and marriage--a topic absolutely foreign to the interests of those on the BYU campus and one scarcely mentioned here this entire month. Indulge me. Pretend you are interested--if only because Sister Holland is my valentine and it is her birthday tomorrow.<br><br>You know, winning Sister Holland was not an easy thing to do. I worked at it and worked at it and worked at it until I finally had the courage to ask for her hand. In a romantic setting I said as meekly and humbly as I could, "Pat, will you marry me?"<br><br>To which she said, "Oh, dearest darling, dearest loved one, yes. Yes, yes, yes. When shall we set the date? Oh, we have got to reserve the temple. I know exactly what colors I want for the bridesmaids. Should we have the reception indoors or out? And someone must be at the guest book. And I can just see in my mind the cake that we want...."<br><br>Then she stopped mid-sentence and said, "Oh, darling. You are so overcome you are speechless. Here I have just gone on and on. Wouldn't you like to say something on this night of nights?"<br><br>To which I replied, "I think I have said too much already."<br><br>She counters that story by reminding me that when I arrived for our first date, her little brother shouted to her, "Hey, dreamboat, your barnacle is here!"<br><br>Actually neither of those stories is true, but who knows? Maybe you can use them someday when you have to speak at BYU on love and marriage.<br><br>Do let me now be serious. What I have learned of romantic love and the beauty of marriage I have learned from Sister Holland. I am honored to be her husband and am happy for you that she is on this campus again this morning, if only for an hour or two. As I once said of her, paraphrasing what Mark Twain's Adam said of his Eve, "Wherever she was, there was paradise" (see "Adam's Diary").<br><br>I wish to speak to you this morning about Christlike love and what I think it can and should mean in your friendships, in your dating, in serious courtship, and, ultimately, in your marriage.<br><br>I approach the subject knowing full well that, as a newly engaged young woman said to me just last month, "There is certainly a lot of advice out there!" I don't want to add needlessly to this rhetoric on romance, but I believe that second only to your membership in the Church, your "membership in a marriage" is the most important association you will have in time and eternity--and to the faithful what doesn't come in time <i>will</i> come in eternity. So perhaps all of you will forgive me for offering, yes, more advice. But I wish it to be scriptural advice, gospel advice. Advice, if you will, that is as basic to life as it is to love--counsel that is equally applicable to men and to women. It has nothing to do with trends or tides of the time or tricks of the trade but has everything to do with the truth.<br><br>So may I put your friendships and dates and eventually your marriages in a scriptural context this morning and speak to you of what I will try to communicate as <i>true</i> love.<br><br>After a long wonderful discourse by Mormon on the subject of charity, the seventh chapter of Moroni tells us that this highest of Christian virtues is more accurately labeled "the pure love of Christ."<br><br><i>And it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him</i> [and her].<br><br><i>Wherefore, ... pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons</i> [and daughters] <i>of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; ... that we may be purified even as he is pure.</i> [Moroni 7:47–48]<br><br>True charity, the absolutely pure, perfect love of Christ, has really been known only once in this world--in the form of Christ Himself, the living Son of the living God. It is Christ's love that Mormon goes to some length to describe for us and that Paul the Apostle did as well some years before, writing to the Corinthians in New Testament times. As in everything, Christ is the only one who got it all right, did it all perfectly, loved the way we are all to try to love. But even though we fall short, that divine standard is there for us. It is a goal toward which we are to keep reaching, keep striving--and, certainly, a goal to keep appreciating.<br><br>And as we speak of this, may I remind you, as Mormon explicitly taught, that this love, this ability, capacity, and reciprocation we all so want, is a gift. It is "bestowed"--that is Mormon's word. It doesn't come without effort and it doesn't come without patience, but, like salvation itself, in the end it is a gift, given by God to the "true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ." The solutions to life's problems are always gospel solutions. Not only are <i>answers</i> found in Christ, but so is the power, the gift, the bestowal, the miracle of giving and receiving those answers. In this matter of love, no doctrine could be more encouraging to us than that.<br><br>I have taken for a title to my remarks Mrs. Browning's wonderful line "How do I love thee?" (Elizabeth Barrett Browning, <i>Sonnets from the Portuguese</i> [1850], no. 43.) I am not going to "count the ways" this morning, but I am impressed with her choice of adverb--not <i>when</i> do I love thee nor <i>where</i> do I love thee nor <i>why</i> do I love thee nor <i>why don't</i> you love me, but, rather, <i>how. How</i> do I demonstrate it, <i>how</i> do I reveal my true love for you? Mrs. Browning was correct. Real love is best shown in the "how," and it is with the how that Mormon and Paul help us the most.<br><br>The first element of divine love--pure love--taught by these two prophets is its kindness, its selfless quality, its lack of ego and vanity and consuming self-centeredness. "Charity suffereth long, and is kind, [charity] envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own" (Moroni 7:45). I have heard President Hinckley teach publicly and privately what I suppose all leaders have said--that most problems in love and marriage ultimately start with selfishness. In outlining ideal love in which Christ, the most unselfish man who ever lived, is the great example, it is not surprising that this scriptural commentary starts here.<br><br>There are many qualities you will want to look for in a friend or a serious date--to say nothing of a spouse and eternal companion--but surely among the very first and most basic of those qualities will be those of care and sensitivity toward others, a minimum of self-centeredness that allows compassion and courtesy to be evident. "That best portion of a good man's life [is] his ... kindness," said Mr. William Wordsworth (<i>Lines Composed a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey</i> [1798], lines 33–35). There are lots of limitations in all of us that we hope our sweethearts will overlook. I suppose no one is as handsome or as beautiful as he or she wishes, or as brilliant in school or as witty in speech or as wealthy as we would like, but in a world of varied talents and fortunes that we can't always command, I think that makes even more attractive the qualities we <i>can</i> command--such qualities as thoughtfulness, patience, a kind word, and true delight in the accomplishment of another. These cost us <i>nothing,</i> and they can mean <i>everything</i> to the one who receives them.<br><br>I like Mormon and Paul's language that says one who truly loves is not "puffed up." Puffed up! Isn't that a great image? Haven't you ever been with someone who was so conceited, so full of themselves that they seemed like the Pillsbury Doughboy? Fred Allen said once that he saw such a fellow walking down Lovers' Lane holding his own hand. True love blooms when we care more about another person than we care about ourselves. That is Christ's great atoning example for us, and it ought to be more evident in the kindness we show, the respect we give, and the selflessness and courtesy we employ in our personal relationships.<br><br>Love is a fragile thing, and some elements in life can try to break it. Much damage can be done if we are not in tender hands, caring hands. To give ourselves totally to another person, as we do in marriage, is the most trusting step we take in any human relationship. It is a real act of faith--faith all of us must be willing to exercise. If we do it right, we end up sharing everything--all our hopes, all our fears, all our dreams, all our weaknesses, and all our joys--with another person.<br><br>No serious courtship or engagement or marriage is worth the name if we do not fully invest <i>all</i> that we have in it and in so doing trust ourselves totally to the one we love. You cannot succeed in love if you keep one foot out on the bank for safety's sake. The very nature of the endeavor requires that you hold on to each other as tightly as you can and jump in the pool together. In that spirit, and in the spirit of Mormon's plea for pure love, I want to impress upon you the vulnerability and delicacy of your partner's future as it is placed in your hands for safekeeping--male and female, it works both ways.<br><br>Sister Holland and I have been married for nearly 37 years, just a half-dozen or so years short of <i>twice</i> as long as we have lived without each other. I may not know everything about her, but I know 37 years' worth, and she knows that much of me. I know her likes and dislikes, and she knows mine. I know her tastes and interests, hopes and dreams, and she knows mine. As our love has grown and our relationship has matured, we have been increasingly free with each other about all of that.<br><br>The result is that I know much more clearly now how to help her, and, if I let myself, I know exactly what will hurt her. In the honesty of our love--love that can't truly be Christlike without such total devotion--surely God will hold me accountable for any pain I cause her by intentionally exploiting or hurting her when she has been so trusting of me, having long since thrown away any self-protection in order that we could be, as the scripture says, "one flesh" (Genesis 2:24). To impair or impede her in <i>any way</i> for my gain or vanity or emotional mastery over her should disqualify me on the spot to be her husband. Indeed, it should consign my miserable soul to eternal incarceration in that large and spacious building Lehi says is the prison of those who live by "vain imaginations" and the "pride of the world" (1 Nephi 11:36, 12:18). No wonder that building is at the opposite end of the field from the tree of life representing the love of God! In all that Christ was, He was not <i>ever</i> envious or inflated, never consumed with His own needs. He did not once, <i>not ever,</i> seek His own advantage at the expense of someone else. He delighted in the happiness of others, the happiness He could bring them. He was forever kind.<br><br>In a dating and courtship relationship, I would not have you spend five minutes with someone who belittles you, who is constantly critical of you, who is cruel at your expense and may even call it humor. Life is tough enough without having the person who is supposed to love you leading the assault on your self-esteem, your sense of dignity, your confidence, and your joy. In this person's care you deserve to feel physically safe and emotionally secure.<br><br>Members of the First Presidency have taught that "any form of physical or mental abuse to any woman is not worthy of any priesthood holder" and that no "man who holds the priesthood of God [should] abuse his wife in any way, [or] demean or injure or take undue advantage of [any] woman"--and that includes friends, dates, sweethearts, and fiancées, to say nothing of wives (James E. Faust, "The Highest Place of Honor," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1988, 37, and Gordon B. Hinckley, "Reach Out in Love and Kindness," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1982, 77).<br><br>If you are just going for pizza or to play a set of tennis, go with anyone who will provide good, clean fun. But if you are serious, or planning to be serious, please find someone who brings out the best in you and is not envious of your success. Find someone who suffers when you suffer and who finds his or her happiness in your own.<br><br>The second segment of this scriptural sermon on love in Moroni 7:45 says that true charity--real love--"is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity." Think of how many arguments could be avoided, how many hurt feelings could be spared, how many cold shoulders and silent treatments could be ended, and, in a worst-case scenario, how many breakups and divorces could be avoided if we were not so easily provoked, if we thought no evil of one another, and if we not only did not rejoice in iniquity but didn't rejoice even in little mistakes.<br><br>Temper tantrums are not cute even in children; they are despicable in adults, especially adults who are supposed to love each other. We are too easily provoked; we are too inclined to think that our partner meant to hurt us--meant to do us evil, so to speak; and in defensive or jealous response we too often rejoice when we see <i>them</i> make a mistake and find <i>them</i> in a fault. Let's show some discipline on this one. Act a little more maturely. Bite your tongue if you have to. "He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city" (Proverbs 16:32). At least one difference between a tolerable marriage and a great one may be that willingness in the latter to allow some things to pass without comment, without response.<br><br>I mentioned Shakespeare earlier. In a talk on love and romance you might well expect a reference to Romeo and Juliet. But let me refer to a much less virtuous story. With Romeo and Juliet the outcome was a result of innocence gone awry, a kind of sad, heartbreaking mistake between two families that should have known better. But in the tale of Othello and Desdemona the sorrow and destruction is calculated--it is maliciously driven from the beginning. Of all the villains in Shakespeare's writing, and perhaps in all of literature, there is no one I loathe so much as I loathe Iago. Even his name sounds evil to me, or at least it has become so. And what <i>is</i> his evil, and Othello's tragic, near-inexcusable susceptibility to it? It is the violation of Moroni 7 and 1 Corinthians 13. Among other things, they sought for evil where none existed, they embraced imaginary iniquity. The villains here rejoiced not "in the truth." Of the innocent Desdemona, Iago said, "I turn her virtue into pitch; / And out of her own goodness make the net / That shall enmesh them all" (William Shakespeare, <i>Othello,</i> act 2, scene 3, lines 366–68). Sowing doubt and devilish innuendo, playing on jealousy and deceit and finally murderous rage, Iago provokes Othello into taking Desdemona's life--virtue turned into pitch, goodness twisted into a fatal net.<br><br>Now, thank heavens, here in Happy Valley this morning we are not talking of infidelity, real or imagined, or of murder; but in the spirit of a university education, let's learn the lessons being taught. Think the best of each other, especially of those you say you love. Assume the good and doubt the bad. Encourage in yourself what Abraham Lincoln called "the better angels of our nature" (First Inaugural Address, 4 March 1861). Othello could have been saved even in the last moment when he kissed Desdemona and her purity was so evident. "That [kiss] dost almost persuade / Justice to break her sword!" he said (act 5, scene 2, lines 16–17). Well, he would have been spared her death and then his own suicide if he had broken what he considered justice's sword right then and there rather than, figuratively speaking, using it on her. This tragically sad Elizabethan tale could have had a beautiful, happy ending if just one man, who then influenced another, had thought no evil, had rejoiced not in iniquity, but had rejoiced in the truth.<br><br>Thirdly and lastly, the prophets tell us that true love "beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things" (1 Corinthians 13:7). Once again that is ultimately a description of Christ's love--He is the great example of one who bore and believed and hoped and endured. We are invited to do the same in our courtship and in our marriage to the best of our ability. Bear up and be strong. Be hopeful and believing. Some things in life we have little or no control over. These have to be endured. Some disappointments have to be lived with in love and in marriage. These are not things anyone wants in life, but sometimes they come. And when they come, we have to bear them; we have to believe; we have to hope for an end to such sorrows and difficulty; we have to endure until things come right in the end.<br><br>One of the great purposes of true love is to help each other in these times. No one ought to have to face such trials alone. We can endure almost anything if we have someone at our side who truly loves us, who is easing the burden and lightening the load. In this regard, a friend from our BYU faculty, Professor Brent Barlow, told me some years ago about Plimsoll marks.<br><br>As a youth in England, Samuel Plimsoll was fascinated with watching ships load and unload their cargoes. He soon observed that, regardless of the cargo space available, each ship had its maximum capacity. If a ship exceeded its limit, it would likely sink at sea. In 1868 Plimsoll entered Parliament and passed a merchant shipping act that, among other things, called for making calculations of how much a ship could carry. As a result, lines were drawn on the hull of each ship in England. As the cargo was loaded, the freighter would sink lower and lower into the water. When the water level on the side of the ship reached the Plimsoll mark, the ship was considered loaded to capacity, regardless of how much space remained. As a result, British deaths at sea were greatly reduced.<br><br>Like ships, people have differing capacities at different times and even different days in their lives. In our relationships we need to establish our own Plimsoll marks and help identify them in the lives of those we love. Together we need to monitor the load levels and be helpful in shedding or at least readjusting some cargo if we see our sweetheart is sinking. Then, when the ship of love is stabilized, we can evaluate long-term what has to continue, what can be put off until another time, and what can be put off permanently. Friends, sweethearts, and spouses need to be able to monitor each other's stress and recognize the different tides and seasons of life. We owe it to each other to declare some limits and then help jettison some things if emotional health and the strength of loving relationships are at risk. Remember, pure love "beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things," and helps loved ones do the same.<br><br>Let me close. In Mormon's and Paul's final witnesses, they declare that "charity [pure love] never faileth" (Moroni 7:46, 1 Corinthians 13:8). It is there through thick and thin. It endures through sunshine and shadow, through darkest sorrow and on into the light. It <i>never</i> fails. So Christ loved us, and that is how He hoped we would love each other. In a final injunction to all his disciples for all time, He said, "A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; <i>as I have loved you"</i> (John 13:34; emphasis added). Of course such Christlike staying power in romance and marriage requires more than any of us really have. It requires something more, an endowment from heaven. Remember Mormon's promise: that such love--the love we each yearn for and cling to--is "bestowed" upon "true followers of Christ." You want capability, safety, and security in dating and romance, in married life and eternity? Be a true disciple of Jesus. Be a genuine, committed, word-and-deed Latter-day Saint. Believe that your faith has <i>everything</i> to do with your romance, because it does. You separate dating from discipleship at your peril. Or, to phrase that more positively, Jesus Christ, the Light of the World, is the only lamp by which you can successfully see the path of love and happiness for you <i>and</i> for your sweetheart. How <i>should</i> I love thee? As He does, for that way "never faileth." I so testify and express my love for you and for Him, in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Jeffrey R.

<h1> The Essence of True Religion - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The responsibility to care for the poor and needy lies at the very heart of the Christian gospel. The scriptures tell us that "pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world" (James 1:27). In addition to refraining from evil, true disciples of the Master wear out their lives in the service of others. It was Jesus Himself who said, "And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant" (Matthew 20:27). As always, Jesus, the Chosen Servant, showed us the way, capping His mortal ministry with the supernal sacrifice of His sinless life: "For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive" (1 Corinthians 15:22).<br><br>The ultimate measure of our discipleship is not to be found in professions of piety or in the number of Church positions we have held but rather in the extent to which we keep Christ's commandments. "He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them," Jesus said, "he it is that loveth me" (John 14:21). We cannot fully keep His commandments unless we serve others. Without that pure love of Christ which expresses itself in the care of the less fortunate, whatever else we do, or profess to be, is but "as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal" (1 Corinthians 13:1). "Why do ye adorn yourselves with that which hath no life, and yet suffer the hungry, and the needy, and the naked, and the sick and the afflicted to pass by you, and notice them not?" asked Moroni (Mormon 8:39).<br><br>The essence of service is found in words written on a commemorative tablet located in the southeast corner of the chancel in the cathedral at Peterborough, in Cambridgeshire, England. It is placed near the grave of a remarkable woman named Mary Deacon, who died in 1730 at age 73. Written with that peculiar genius for the language which marks the best of English usage, the felicitous phrase that commemorates her life reads as follows: "To the poor of this city gave she her daily bounty, so private as not to be told, so large as scarce to be equaled."<br><br>Those two concepts of<i>privacy</i>and<i>generosity</i>describe what should be the nature and extent of our service to others. Before discussing them, I mention in passing the importance not only of<i>how</i>we serve but also of<i>why</i>we serve. Though people serve for various reasons, some more noble than others, the highest form of service is that which flows from the pure love of Christ. Such service is given without thought of gain or reward in this world or the next, but simply because the giver loves God and His children. In that consecrated service is found the best of life, the surest road to heaven. Service to others, given in love, solves the divine paradox of Christ's gospel, that one must lose his or her life to find it (see Matthew 16:25). We lighten our own burdens by taking on those of another. In the process of losing our life in service to others, we find who we are and who Christ is. This is the promise of Jesus and the miracle of service.<br><br>I do not want to suggest in any way that service to others is the only virtue we are to cultivate as disciples of the Master. Far from it. But service to others<i>is</i>essential if we are to realize and retain the fullness of Christ's Atonement in our lives. Consider these words of King Benjamin:<br><br><i>For the sake of retaining a remission of your sins from day to day, that ye may walk guiltless before God--I would that ye should impart of your substance to the poor, every man according to that which he hath, such as feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and administering to their relief, both spiritually and temporally, according to their wants.</i>[Mosiah 4:26]<br><br>Now let us return to those two essential components of true charity: privacy and generosity. Jesus rebuked those whose charity was given ostentatiously, for the aggrandizement of the giver. He was saddened by those whose motives in giving were clouded by a worldly, selfish desire to receive public acclaim for their actions. He said:<br><br><i>Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.</i><br><br><i>Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men.</i>[Matthew 6:1–2]<br><br>We can and should be grateful for all who serve others, whatever the honorable motivation of the giver may be, but there is a quiet and gentle joy that comes to those who give anonymously, privately, without thought of or interest in public acclaim--or even of public knowledge of their benevolence. These are they who have conquered the selfishness of the natural man. As Elder Neal A. Maxwell has wisely noted, "There is a marked difference between the introspection that focuses on 'How did I do?' and the introspection that asks, 'Did I do enough?'" (<i>All These Things Shall Give Thee Experience</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1979], 63).<br><br>Though it happened more than four decades ago, my wife and I have never forgotten an occasion when we were blessed by an anonymous donor. It was Christmas of 1953, and I was a graduate student at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. In many ways it was the best of times. We had two small and much adored children and were deeply in love with each other, as we are to this day. Furthermore, I loved my studies and research at a world-renowned university. But we were very poor, with not a penny of financial reserves, and barely able to scrape by on my graduate stipend of two hundred dollars per month. Somehow my dear wife had managed to find a few dollars for modest Christmas presents for our two children, but that was as far as the money went. We weren't particularly troubled by the lack of funds, but, like the couple in O. Henry's classic tale "The Gift of the Magi," each of us had hoped to give the other some expression of our mutual affection.<br><br>On Christmas Eve our doorbell rang. When I answered it, I found on the front porch a package in Christmas wrappings. It was addressed to us but had no indication of who had sent it. When we opened the package on Christmas morning, we found a shirt for me and a blouse for my wife. Never were gifts more appreciated, not just for themselves, but most of all because someone cared about us. We still don't know the identity of the giver but bless his or her name to this day.<br><br>The second component of service that I wish to discuss with you today is that of generosity. As always, Jesus said it best:<br><br><i>Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.</i>[Luke 6:38]<br><br>Jesus commands us to be generous even with those who oppose us:<br><br><i>Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;</i><br><br><i>That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven.</i>[Matthew 5:44–45]<br><br>That commandment, to love those who hate us, is one of the most demanding requirements of Christian discipleship. It flies in the face of the "natural man," who demands blood, revenge, retribution; whose memory of wrongs real or imagined never dims; who sees compassion as weakness and holds forgiveness in contempt. But hard though it is, Jesus still requires such generosity of spirit as part of our service to Him. The Prophet Joseph Smith had a full measure of that spirit of benevolence and forgiveness. During a time of personal weakness and great troubles for the Saints in Missouri, William W. Phelps betrayed the Prophet Joseph to his enemies. Later, when Phelps in bitter sorrow and repentance wished to return to fellowship in the Church, Joseph freely forgave him. Wrote Joseph: "Come on, dear brother, since the war is past, For friends at first, are friends again at last" (<i>HC</i>4:164).<br><br>With what, then, are we to be generous as we serve others, in addition to our forgiveness? Certainly we are to be generous with our<i>time.</i>I can think of no one who gives of himself more fully all day every day than does our beloved prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley. His grueling schedule, which would wear out men many years his junior, along with his constant desire to reach out to all of God's children and a deep conviction that "all are alike unto God" (2 Nephi 26:33) combine to make him an extremely effective leader and superb example to all.<br><br>When I think of people who give willingly of their time in the service of others, my thoughts turn often to the example of our wonderful service missionaries who serve in the Salt Lake Inner City Pilot Project. This project, which has the goal of increasing the self-reliance of inner-city dwellers in Salt Lake City, will provide nearly 500,000 person-hours of voluntary service to thousands of receivers this year alone. The project is blessing the lives of thousands, in no small measure because of the consecrated service of hundreds of volunteers who wish only to help others as God has given them the strength and capacity to do so. I salute them for their benevolence!<br><br>Jesus commands us to give generously of our<i>talents</i>in the service of others. In His masterful parable of the talents in Matthew 25:14–30, Jesus spoke of three men to whom had been entrusted varying amounts of talents according to their differing abilities. Two of the servants magnified their talents, increasing that which had been entrusted to them, but the third, too frightened, and perhaps too slothful to act, hid his talent "in the earth" and did nothing with it. The first two were commended by their Lord, but the one who had been untrue to the trust reposed in him was strongly rebuked, and that which he had was given to another.<br><br>Jesus expects us to magnify our talents, to be anxiously engaged in our labors, to be more competent and qualified in our service.<br><br>A few years ago the<i>Wall Street Journal</i>recounted a heartwarming tale of one who magnified his talents in providing compassionate Christlike service to one of God's children. More than twenty years ago, Dr. Ian Jackson, a world-famous craniofacial surgeon, was on a charity medical mission from his native Scotland to Peru. There he met David Lopez, a tiny Indian boy just two years old who had virtually no face at all. A gaping hole covered the area where his mouth and nose should have been. There were no upper teeth or upper jaw. To drink, David simply tilted back his head and poured the liquid straight down. His lower teeth could actually touch his forehead. Most of David's face had literally been eaten away by a terrible parasitic disease called leishmaniasis.<br><br>Relief workers begged Dr. Jackson to help. He was leaving for Scotland the next day but agreed to try to rebuild David's face if the boy could come to Scotland. Eventually a way was found, and the Jacksons went to Glasgow Airport to pick up David. As he walked down the ramp, they saw a tiny boy wearing scuffed white boots and a hand-knit poncho. A woolen cap was pulled so low on his head that only his big brown eyes and the round hole beneath them were visible.<br><br>The Jacksons took David into their home and into their hearts. There followed long years of surgery--more than eighty operations in all--as Dr. Jackson attempted to give David a new face. All of the doctor's services were donated. Each summer, as other children played, David was in the hospital, his head swathed in bandages.<br><br>The painstaking, pioneering surgical efforts to rebuild David's face went on for fifteen years. Today David looks like a young man who has been in a serious automobile accident, but he is well-adjusted and fully functional. He used to be teased and tormented about his looks, but over the years that has died away.<br><br>In 1982 Mrs. Jackson flew to Peru to try to find David's parents. After a long journey downriver from a remote Catholic mission, David's father was found. He explained that the boy had been born healthy but that he developed leishmaniasis after having been bitten by an infected sand fly. The father took his son to the mission to seek treatment.<br><br>The father gave permission to the Jacksons--who had developed a deep love for David--to adopt him as their own. Since 1984 David Lopez has been David Jackson. (See Neal Templin, "Look of Love: As His Face Is Molded, Boy Finds His Surgeon Becoming His Father,"<i>Wall Street Journal,</i>13 November 1992, A1.)<br><br>I don't know whether Dr. Jackson is a Christian or not, but I do know he has magnified his talents in doing God's work. "When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God" (Mosiah 2:17).<br><br>Jesus commands that we be generous with our<i>substance.</i>How grateful I am that since its beginnings the Church has organized to assist its members to provide for themselves and others, ensuring their physical, spiritual, social, and emotional welfare. The Church also sponsors humanitarian relief and development projects around the world that benefit others not of our faith. These projects include emergency relief assistance in times of disaster and programs that strengthen the productivity and self-reliance of individuals and families and increase the capacities of communities and institutions to serve others. Hundreds of full-time volunteers with skills and experience in medicine, education, agriculture, business, social work, and so on serve throughout the world.<br><br>In 1999, just under 500,000 days of labor were donated to Church welfare facilities. That year, in the United States and Canada alone, the Church operated 108 bishops' storehouses, 97 canneries, and 79 priesthood-managed production projects. Nearly 80,000 people were placed in gainful employment worldwide in 1999.<br><br>During the period from 1986 to 1999, the Church provided humanitarian assistance in more than 104 major natural and man-made disasters, including the Rwanda conflict in 1994; the Kobe, Japan, earthquake in 1995; the Bosnia/Croatia/Serbia conflict in 1994 and 1996; U.S. Midwest flooding in 1993 and 1997; crop failure in North Korea in 1996 and 1997; Hurricane Mitch in Central America in 1998; and the Turkey and Taiwan earthquakes in 1999. Very recently the First Presidency announced that three million dollars would be used for relief in Mozambique, which has been ravaged, as you know, by terrible flooding. The total value of humanitarian service rendered from 1985 to 1998 was well over 220 million dollars.<br><br>Time does not permit a detailed presentation of the full extent of welfare and humanitarian service projects supported by the Church over the last several years. But I cannot refrain from mentioning a few, as follows:<br><br>• America's Promise, chaired by General Colin Powell, invited the Church to participate in its 1999 initiative. The organization serves, through volunteers and in-kind donations, some of the most needy youths and their families in six major metropolitan areas across the nation. The Church provided food, clothing, hygiene kits, school kits, and newborn kits valued at nearly one million dollars.<br><br>• On July 16, 1999, a letter requesting donations of quilts for the people of Kosovo was sent by the Presiding Bishopric to ecclesiastical leaders throughout the United States and Canada. The Relief Society was given responsibility for coordination of this effort. The letter originally requested 30,000 quilts. As of March 1 of this year, 121,962 quilts had been received from Latter-day Saints and others in the continental U.S., Canada, Australia, Taiwan, and Singapore. Five hundred quilts were made by women in the Utah State Penitentiary. Others were received from female inmates in one of the federal prisons. A woman from West Yellowstone, Montana, wrote: "I am 87 years old and cannot walk, but I can still quilt a bit. I have hugged these little blankets and have told them to 'fulfill the measure of their creation,' so I hope they keep a little one warm and give comfort." I could go on with quilt stories, but those mentioned illustrate the extent of this Christlike work of compassion.<br><br>• On July 11, 1999, a peaceful Sunday morning in Riverdale, Utah, an irrigation canal broke, flooding nearly one hundred homes with water and an estimated 350,000 cubic yards of sand and mud. Within a few hours priesthood leaders from more than forty stakes had met and agreed upon a course of action. The next morning, volunteers in the hundreds and then thousands began the onerous task of pumping and shoveling out basements, driveways, lawns, and roadways; disposing of the sand, mud, and water involved; and salvaging and restoring furniture, clothing, records, books, and all of the treasured accumulations of dozens of families. It was a huge task. But the willing work of thousands, striving together as friends and neighbors, lightened the load and dried the tears of those who had lost much they held dear. Latter-day Saints and those of other faiths worked side by side. Community organizations, local governments, and the American Red Cross filled vital roles. As community members worked together in Christlike service, their love and understanding for each other increased, and a spirit of unity filled every heart. In serving others, they found their own better natures, and, may I venture to say, some, at least, developed a better understanding of Christ and His place in their lives.<br><br>These few examples--and I could go on and on with others--will, I hope, convey to you something of the breadth and depth of the Church's great work of providing temporal service to others.<br><br>One of the miracles that happens when we give of our substance is that God provides more. As President Spencer W. Kimball reminded us, "What glorious consequences can flow from mundane acts and from small but deliberate deeds!" (<i>TSWK,</i>252).<br><br>President Brigham Young grew to know that God provides for those who give freely of their substance to others. He wrote:<br><br><i>The first year that I came into this valley I had not flour enough to last my family until harvest, and that I had brought with me, and persons were coming to my house every day for bread. I had the blues about</i>[it]<i>one day; I went down to the old fort, and by the time I got back to my house I was completely cured. I said to my wife, "Do not let a person come here for food and go away empty handed, for if you do we shall suffer before harvest; but if you give to every individual that comes we shall have enough to last us through.'</i><br><br><i>I have proven this many a time, and we have again proven it this year. I have plenty on hand, and shall have plenty, if I keep giving away. More than two hundred persons eat from my provisions every day, besides my own family and those who work for me.</i><br><br><i>I intend to keep doing so, that my bread may hold out, for if I do not I shall come short.</i><br><br><i>Do you believe that principle? I know it is true, because I have proven it so many times.</i>[<i>JD</i>3:332–33]<br><br>Jesus commands us to be generous with our testimonies of Him and His gospel. One of the most severe rebukes given by the Lord in this dispensation was uttered by the Savior to missionaries who would not fulfill their sacred obligations to bear testimony:<br><br><i>But with some I am not well pleased, for they will not open their mouths, but they hide the talent which I have given unto them, because of the fear of man. Wo unto such, for mine anger is kindled against them.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 60:2]<br><br>A tender story from our early pioneer days in the American South illustrates the power of testimony. A century ago, feelings of misunderstanding and intolerance toward the Latter-day Saints periodically erupted into senseless violence in the South, with eight murders and many brutal assaults on our missionaries or local priesthood leaders from 1879 to 1900.<br><br>During the summer of 1878, Elder Frank Croft, a missionary in northern Alabama, was forcibly taken against his will by "armed and vicious men" to be whipped. He was tied to a tree for that purpose. In the struggle a letter from his mother fell from Elder Croft's pocket. The leader of the mob picked it up and read from it:<br><br><i>"Surely, my boy, they who are mistreating you Elders know not what they do or they would not do it. Sometime, somewhere, they will understand and then they will regret their action and they will honor you for the glorious work you are doing. So be patient, my son; love those who mistreat you and say all manner of evil against you and the Lord will bless you and magnify you in their eyes and your mission will be gloriously successful. Remember also, my son, that day and night, your mother is praying for you always.'</i><br><br>[The leader of the mob read the whole letter to himself and then said to his companions:]<i>"Men, after reading this Mormon's mother's letter, I just can't go ahead with the job. Maybe we had better let him go."</i>["A Mother's Letter Saves Her Son's Life," in chapter 22 of Bryant S. Hinckley,<i>The Faith of Our Pioneer Fathers</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1956), 257–59]<br><br>They did indeed let Elder Croft go unharmed, his life spared by a mother's plea for her son.<br><br>This advice given by the Savior to the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1829 applies still in our day:<br><br><i>Fear not to do good, my sons, for whatsoever ye sow, that shall ye also reap; therefore, if ye sow good ye shall also reap good for your reward.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, fear not, little flock; do good; let earth and hell combine against you, for if ye are built upon my rock, they cannot prevail.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 6:33–34]<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball pointed out that "the most vital thing we can do is to express our testimonies through service, which will, in turn, produce spiritual growth, greater commitment, and a greater capacity to keep the commandments" (<i>TSWK,</i>254).<br><br>In the final analysis, then, the greatest testimony we can ever give to others is an exemplary life devoted to service. "Service," said President Marion G. Romney, "is not something we endure on this earth so we can earn the right to live in the celestial kingdom. Service is the very fiber of which an exalted life in the celestial kingdom is made" (<i>CR,</i>October 1982, 135; or "The Celestial Nature of Self-Reliance,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1982, 93).<br><br>Finally, Jesus asks us to be generous with our love. These simple words from a beloved hymn express that sweet sentiment well:<br><br><i>Because I have been blessed by thy great love, dear Lord,</i><br><i>I'll share thy love again, according to thy word.</i><br><i>I shall give love to those in need; I'll show that love by word and deed:</i><br><i>Thus shall my thanks be thanks indeed.</i><br>["Because I Have Been Given Much,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 219]<br><br>May each of us "be gentle and loving in deed and in thought, For these are the things Jesus taught" ("I'm Trying to Be Like Jesus,"<i>Songbook,</i>78–79).<br><br>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Alexander B.

<h1>n the Lord&#039;s Side of the Line - Sheri Dew - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
For someone who bleeds blue, it is wonderful to be back on this campus. I love BYU. But as much as I love this university, I love you more. For me, you embody the vitality of this magnificent Church. You are living, breathing evidence that righteousness<i>will</i>prevail in a cynical, seductive world. Every time I am in a gathering of men and women your age, I have the sense that I am surrounded by spectacular spiritual potential. I wonder how many future mission presidents, bishops, Laurel advisors, and Primary presidents are in this room. How many children will be reared in righteousness because of your devotion as mothers and fathers? Who in this audience will help unlock a nation or a people to the gospel? Who will develop technologies to spread our message more effectively? Who will stand up in communities and schools and countries for values essential to the stability of an intact society? In short, I can't help but wonder what place in this latter-day battlefront each of you will occupy, for of this I am sure: Every one of you has a unique mission to fulfill. It is about standing where you have been foreordained to stand that I would like to speak today.<br><br>When I was a student here, I took a year off from my studies to tour with a USO group that entertained at military bases around the world. One trip took us to the Far East, and before we left, my father gave me a strong warning. "I am worried about this trip," he said. "Be careful. Don't go anywhere you shouldn't go." His words caught my attention, but, frankly, as our adventure in the Orient began, I forgot about his caution.<br><br>One day we were scheduled to perform at a base near the Demilitarized Zone that separates North and South Korea. Our escort officer asked if we would like to go into the DMZ and visit Panmunjom, where the peace treaty ending the Korean War had been signed. It was a place of great historical significance. Relations between the two Koreas were strained at the time, and we asked if it was safe. The officer assured us it was, but then promptly furnished waivers we were to sign that absolved the military of responsibility in the event of accident or death. I suddenly remembered Dad's warning: "Be careful. Don't go anywhere you shouldn't go." But not wanting to be the killjoy, and being a little curious myself, I shrugged off my worry, signed the waiver, and headed into the DMZ, where we were no longer under the protection of the U.S. armed forces.<br><br>That reality was immediately evident as we drove past rows of somber North Korean soldiers sporting machine guns. "Don't look them in the eyes," we were warned. "Anything can set them off." As we joked about our bodies never being found, my stomach started to churn and my father's warning played in my mind in digital, Dolby sound. I knew that I had indeed gone somewhere I shouldn't have gone. The experience was nerve-racking. I felt as though I was behind enemy lines. And, as fascinating as the excursion was for a history major, I couldn't wait to get out of there. It wasn't until we crossed the border back into South Korea that I again felt safe. And, as it turns out, for good reason. Later that week three Americans were shot and killed in the Demilitarized Zone.<br><br>With this experience in mind, consider these words from George Albert Smith when he was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve:<br><br><i>There is a division line well defined that separates the Lord's territory from Lucifer's. If we live on the Lord's side of the line Lucifer cannot come there to influence us, but if we cross the line into his territory we are in his power. By keeping the commandments of the Lord we are safe on His side of the line, but if we disobey His teachings we voluntarily cross into the zone of temptation and invite the destruction that is ever present there. Knowing this, how anxious we should always be to live on the Lord's side of the line.</i>["Our M.I.A."<i>Improvement Era,</i>May 1935, 278]<br><br>I repeat, "If we live on the Lord's side of the line Lucifer cannot come there to influence us." What an offer of safety and security in a world that Lucifer has turned into enemy-occupied territory; a world where his enticements are more provocative and enslaving than ever; a world where he will resort to any tactic to lure us to his side of the line, where we are no longer under the influence and protection of the Holy Ghost. Fortunately, Satan can't<i>make</i>us do anything. Said the Prophet Joseph: "As well might the devil seek to dethrone Jehovah, as overthrow an innocent soul that resists everything which is evil" (<i>HC</i>4:605). The only power the adversary has is power we give him when we sin or break our covenants. And we have not been left to withstand the wiles of the adversary alone, for the power of Jesus Christ is stronger than the power of the devil. Hence we have the promise that Lucifer cannot influence us when we stay on the Lord's side of the line. No wonder we are counseled, "Pray always lest that wicked one have power in you, and<i>remove you out of your place"</i>(D&amp;amp;C 93:49; emphasis added). No wonder we have been admonished, "Stand ye in holy places, and<i>be not moved"</i>(D&amp;amp;C 87:8; emphasis added).<br><br>Very simply, our physical and spiritual safety lies in never even getting close to the line that separates light from dark, good from evil. Jesus Christ showed us how to deal with the adversary. When Satan tempted Him, there was no clever repartee, no battle of wills, just immediate dismissal--"Get thee behind me, Satan. ... Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God" (Luke 4:8, 12). If the omniscient Jehovah wasn't willing to debate the adversary, how quickly ought we to run for our lives--our eternal lives--when confronted with even the slightest hint of evil.<br><br>You're smart. You're even exceptional. President Gordon B. Hinckley has stated repeatedly that you are the finest generation this earth has ever seen. But that prophetic endorsement notwithstanding, you're not<i>that</i>smart. You are not resilient enough to tangle with the adversary. You can<i>never</i>match his cunning or his talent for deception and diversion. He will outsmart, outmaneuver, and outlast you every time you willingly consent to a duel. Lucifer is like the ultimate carnival barker: "Step right up. Come on in. Don't miss the greatest show on earth." But as soon as he has you inside his tent, he will leave you to twist in agony and isolation and darkness.<br><br>Happily, the choice about which side of the line we stand on is ours, for we "are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator ... , or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil" (2 Nephi 2:27). The choice is ours. If we will allow Him to, Jesus Christ will shield and deliver us from Lucifer, who because of his rebellion and arrogance and thirst for power forfeited his inheritance and is now bent on jeopardizing ours. How crucial it therefore is that we become steadfast and immovable on the Lord's side of the line, where we are not only protected but ultimately sealed up unto the Lord (see Mosiah 5:15).<br><br>The principle of being steadfast and immovable reminds me of the North Carolina Tar Heels. I am a basketball junkie, and as a product of the great basketball state of Kansas, I have watched many a ball game between the University of Kansas Jayhawks and the Tar Heels. Do you know what the Tar Heels' mascot represents? During the Civil War those tough Carolina farm boys refused to concede ground to the Union army, and it was said that they stood as though they had tar on their heels. They would not budge.<br><br>Being steadfast and immovable with our heels in tar on the Lord's side of the line is the only strategy that works long-term against Lucifer. Some of his enticements are blatant and cause those who succumb to take giant leaps into his territory.<i>Any</i>breach of morality is immorality. Anything that isn't honest is dishonest. Any exposure to pornography, drugs, alcohol, and even excessive materialism moves us to the adversary's side of the line.<br><br>But if he can't get us to succumb to blatant evil, the adversary tries to coax us onto his side of the line by resorting to strategies that slowly wear us down, weaken our resolve, and dim our memory of who we are. See if any of these sound familiar. Lucifer whispers that it doesn't matter what we do now, that there is plenty of time later to get our spiritual act together. It is the Sin Now, Pay Later Plan. He feeds our vanity with promises of popularity, power, and prosperity. He tells us what we want to hear: that life is supposed to be easy and fun and that if we experience pain or undeserved difficulties the gospel must not be working. He always promotes shortcuts, though there are no shortcuts to anywhere worth going.<br><br>He wants us to compare ourselves to others and then to criticize and judge one another. He numbs us to a sliding scale of morality so that we eventually embrace behaviors that repulsed us earlier. He wants us to believe that anything short of blatant immorality is just sport--no harm, no foul. He wants us so absorbed with school, dating, and careers that we don't have time to really<i>live</i>the gospel--to learn how to receive answers to prayer, to immerse ourselves in the scriptures, and to go to the temple. He rejoices in even small breaches in our integrity because he knows that unless checked they will ultimately lead us "away<i>carefully</i>down to hell" (2 Nephi 28:21; emphasis added).<br><br>When we succumb to the adversary's tactics, we experience what I did that day in the DMZ--fear and anxiety--because with all of his cunning, the adversary cannot duplicate joy or peace. That is why there is such safety on the Lord's side of the line, where the power of the priesthood and the Holy Ghost protect us.<br><br>So how do we stay on the Lord's side of the line? How do we stand in holy places and be not moved? In this the year 2000 there is a great deal we can learn from Helaman and his 2,000 stripling warriors. You know the story. Two thousand righteous young men stepped forward to fight in the stead of their fathers, who had made a covenant to never again shed the blood of their brethren (see Alma 24:18). These young men were ultimately victorious against a larger, more experienced Lamanite army for several reasons:<br><br>1. Before the sons of Helaman began their campaign, they entered into a covenant "that they never would give up their liberty, but they would fight in all cases to protect the Nephites and themselves from bondage" (Alma 53:17). It is the same with us. The first step toward consecration and total commitment to the Lord is making covenants with Him. That is what we do at baptism. That is what we do again, later, with powerful spiritual ramifications, when we enter the house of the Lord.<br><br>There is<i>power</i>in making covenants. Weekly, as we renew our covenants and promise to take upon ourselves the name of the Son, to always remember Him, and to keep His commandments, we receive in return a transcendent promise, one filled with heavenly power: that we "may always have his Spirit to be with [us]" (Moroni 4:3). Having the Holy Ghost with us--and learning to hear His voice--is a key, perhaps the single most profound key, to remaining steadfast and immovable on the Lord's side of the line. And it all begins by making a covenant.<br><br>2. The 2,000 stripling warriors not only made covenants, they kept them. "They were men who were true at all times in whatsoever thing they were entrusted" (Alma 53:20). Very simply, they did what they said they would do. They weren't always looking for ways to straddle the line between right and wrong.<br><br>After President Hinckley was interviewed by Mike Wallace for<i>60 Minutes,</i>I had occasion to talk with Mr. Wallace about their conversation. Do you know what Mike Wallace seemed most impressed with? That President Hinckley had done everything in connection with the interview that he had promised to do. When I later offered to show Mr. Wallace how I intended to quote him in President Hinckley's biography, he replied, "That's not necessary. You're a Mormon. I trust you." Do you really think this seasoned journalist believes every member of our Church is trustworthy? Sight unseen? He is not that naïve. But his expression was not a reflection of me, it was a reflection of his experience with President Hinckley. In effect, he was saying, "If you are associated with<i>that</i>man, then I assume that you, too, will do what you have said you will do."<br><br>Are we true at all times to the things with which we have been entrusted? Do we tell the truth? Are we true to those who have trusted us with their love and their confidence? Are we true to the knowledge that we are sons and daughters of God with an eternal future? Are we true to the whisperings of the Spirit? Are we true to our temple covenants? Are we doing what we promised we would do before we came here and promised again when we were baptized and endowed?<br><br>The stripling warriors not only kept their covenants, but they performed "every word of command with exactness" (Alma 57:21). In other words, they kept their covenants with precision. A half-hearted effort to keep the Sabbath day holy or be morally clean or tell the truth or dress modestly is really no effort at all. Joseph Smith didn't say that we<i>sort of</i>believe in being "honest, true, chaste, benevolent, [and] virtuous" (Articles of Faith 1:13). On Mount Sinai the Lord didn't declare, "Thou shalt not steal--unless you're in a real bind." He didn't say, "Thou shalt<i>rarely</i>covet." He didn't say, "Thou shalt not commit adultery--very often." He said,<i>"Thou shalt not,"</i>clearly delineating lines we are not to cross--lines that represent breaches in integrity or morality or virtue so serious that they drive the Spirit away and lead ultimately to the destruction of our souls; lines to stay away from lest we lose control of our thoughts, our motives, or our actions and step into Lucifer's territory where we come under his control.<br><br>Men and women who sell their birthright for a mess of pottage will tell you that their demise began with something small, with some seemingly insignificant breach of integrity that escalated. The little things<i>do</i>matter. It is not possible to profess righteousness while flirting with sin. Believe me, Lucifer wants you of the noble birthright. He wants your minds and your bodies and your souls. I daresay there is no greater smirking in the underworld than when he gets his chains around one of you.<br><br>It is as we keep the commandments and our covenants with exactness that the Lord strengthens us. The supreme example is the Savior Himself. In Gethsemane, after He renewed His covenant, saying, "Not my will, but thine, be done," "there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him" (Luke 22:42–43) so that He could endure what lay ahead. On the cross when He uttered the words "It is finished, thy will is done" (JST, Matthew 27:54; see also John 19:30), He became the greatest example in time or eternity of keeping covenants. There would have been no Atonement had the Lord not kept His covenant precisely as He promised. It is the same with us. As we recommit ourselves, the Lord strengthens us to withstand any temptation.<br><br>Living as Latter-day Saints is not easy. But it is easier than the alternative. The cost of discipleship, as high as it may be, is less than the price of sin--less costly than having the Holy Ghost withdraw or losing self-respect or jeopardizing eternal life.<br><br>3. The stripling warriors were believers. Their faith in Christ was active and dynamic. They believed that He could move mountains--not to mention battalions of bloodthirsty Lamanites bent on their destruction--if they had faith in Him. Thus, when asked to put their lives on the line, they responded without hesitation, "Our God is with us, and he will not suffer that we should fall; [so] let us go forth." They believed that "if they did not doubt, God would deliver them" (Alma 56:46–47).<br><br>There is a reason that faith is the first principle of the gospel, because it is our willingness to believe Christ, to believe that He will do what He has said He will do, that activates the power of the Atonement in our lives. The Lord has promised "to do<i>all things ...</i>for the children of men, if it so be that they exercise faith in him" (1 Nephi 7:12; emphasis added).<br><br>As our faith increases, we come to understand the magnificent promises He has made to those who live on His side of the line. He promised to heal our broken hearts and to set at liberty them who are bruised (see Luke 4:18, Jacob 2:8); to give power to the faint and to increase the strength of those who have no strength (see Isaiah 40:28–29); to help us bear our burdens with ease (see Mosiah 24:15); to succor us or come to our aid if we will seek after Him (see Alma 7:12); and to allow the devil no power over us if we will build our lives on His rock (see Helaman 5:12).<br><br>No doubt most of us here believe the Lord can do these things. But do we believe that He<i>will?</i>That He will heal our broken hearts and help us bear our burdens? The Lord has said that if we only "desire to believe," we should let this desire work in us and experiment upon His words (see Alma 32:27). Can't you almost hear the Savior pleading, "Try me. Put me to the test. See if I won't do for you what I have said I will do."<br><br>My testimony is that He will, and that He does. But we must first believe, as did the sons of Helaman, who hadn't been trained in warfare but who had been taught the things of the Spirit. Consequently, they "fought as if with the strength of God; yea, never were men known to have fought with such miraculous strength; and with such mighty power" (Alma 56:56).<br><br>Not only was their faith in the Lord strong at the beginning of their march, but it remained strong throughout their ordeal. Every one of these young men was wounded, and at one point they nearly starved to death (see Alma 57:25, 58:7). Yet instead of wavering, they turned to the Lord and pled for strength--which they received (see Alma 58:10–12). Having faith didn't make their challenges disappear. It didn't make marching in Helaman's army easy. It didn't disqualify them from pain. But their faith did enable them to draw upon the power of God, which sustained them through their test and ultimately delivered them.<br><br>We will not win the battle in which we are engaged if we do not fight as with the strength of God, for the voices of Satan are noisy, relentless, and celebrated. The gap between the way men and women of God and the way men and women of the world live will only grow wider. But that's okay, as long as we, as the Lord's covenant people, feel confident about who we are.<br><br>We have every reason to, for when Nephi foresaw the latter-day Church, he beheld<br><br><i>the power of the Lamb of God, that it descended upon the saints of the church of the Lamb, and upon the covenant people of the Lord, who were scattered upon all the face of the earth; and they were armed with righteousness and with the power of God in great glory.</i>[1 Nephi 14:14]<br><br>Nephi was seeing you and me. We may be small numerically, but the influence of those armed with righteousness and the power of God in great glory will be felt far beyond our numbers. We can't win this battle alone, but we aren't required to, for it is in the strength of the Lord that we can do all things (see Alma 26:12). And that process begins with our faith.<br><br>4. The stripling warriors' faith began at home, where "they had been taught by their mothers, that if they did not doubt, God would deliver them" (Alma 56:47). Not only did those righteous, faithful, dedicated mothers teach their sons the gospel, but the stripling warriors listened, which almost certainly prepared them to follow the prophet Helaman into battle when the time came for them to do so. The lesson for us is clear: Choose carefully who you listen to, and then listen. Choose carefully who you will follow, and then follow. With rare exceptions, no one cares more about your welfare than do your parents. Listen to them with confidence. But also listen to prophets, seers, and revelators whose counsel is motivated only by their desire to teach truth and by their belief in your divine potential--not because they want your money or your vote or your support. If we don't listen to the prophet, we might as well not have one.<br><br>Satan tries to confuse us about voices and heroes and role models. He encourages us to worship the bright and beautiful--regardless of their values or motives. He makes the lives of the rich and famous look intoxicating when in reality many are just intoxicated. Just because someone can shoot a ball through a hoop or record a hit song or launch a billion-dollar IPO doesn't mean that he or she deserves our respect, and it<i>certainly doesn't mean</i>their lives should be patterns for our lives. Jesus Christ gave us the one sure pattern. If we are wise, we will follow only those who lead us closer to Him. That is the litmus test for evaluating anyone's motives.<br><br>5. Happiness and lasting joy come only from living the gospel. Said Helaman after leading his 2,000 into battle, "I was filled with exceeding joy because of the goodness of God in preserving us" (Alma 57:36). Joy and righteousness are inseparably connected--though Satan would have us believe otherwise, that joy and worldly pleasures are one and the same. But they are not. Likewise, Satan would have us believe that happiness cannot be found in obedience, which he portrays as confining rather than liberating. But that is a lie.<br><br>Here is just one example. In today's world, where immorality is celebrated on nearly every world stage, succumbing to moral temptation is depicted as being easier and even more desirable than maintaining moral purity. But it isn't. The moment of sexual transgression is the last moment immorality is easy. I have never known anyone who was happier or who felt better about themselves or who had greater peace of mind as a result of immorality. Never.<br><br>As someone who has remained unmarried two-and-a-half decades beyond a traditional marriageable age, I know something about the challenge of chastity. It is not always easy, but it is far easier than the alternative. Chastity is much easier than regret or the loss of self-respect, than the agony of breaking covenants, than struggling with shallow and failed relationships. This is not to say there are never temptations. Even at forty-six, having long ago decided how I wanted to live my life, I have to be careful all the time. There are things I simply cannot watch, cannot read, cannot listen to because they trigger thoughts and instincts that drive the Spirit away and that edge me too close to the moral line. But those supposed sacrifices are well worth it.<br><br>It is so much more comforting to live with the Spirit than without, so much more joyful to have relationships of trust and true friendship than to indulge in a physical relationship that would eventually crumble anyway. Whereas Satan's lies lead only to enslavement, the Savior's promise is that if we will seek the riches our Father wishes to give us, we "shall be the richest of all people, for [we] shall have the riches of eternity" (D&amp;amp;C 38:39). In other words, we shall have joy in this life and a fullness in the life hereafter. Righteousness begets happiness.<br><br>There are many other lessons we could learn from the sons of Helaman. We could talk of service and selflessness, of obedience and consecration and endurance. But I turn now to the final and, perhaps for our purposes here today, most compelling point.<br><br>6. In this account in the book of Alma, it was the rising generation who bolstered and strengthened the body of the Church and who stepped forward to save the day. When their help was needed, these young men were ready, worthy, and willing to respond. Again and again they came to the rescue, often reinforcing the older Nephite army who tended to wear down as the battle wore on. The stripling warriors were like the cavalry in those old Westerns who arrived in the nick of time to save the day.<br><br>As with Helaman's young army,<i>you are the cavalry,</i>here to carry on the work of the Lord at an intense and vital stage of the battle--a battle that began with the War in Heaven and that rages to this very day. Helaman told Moroni that his "little force" had given the Nephite army "great hopes and much joy" (Alma 56:17). As compared with Helaman's 2,000, today there are nearly 2,000,000 of you in this Church between the ages of 18 and 25. Nevertheless, compared with the world's population and its escalating depravity, you are a "little force." But also, as in Helaman's day, we of older generations rejoice in your strength and in your goodness. You bring great hope and much joy to the body of the Church. You are latter-day reinforcements prepared during aeons of premortality to face the enemy, reinforcements who must now step forward to strengthen the body of the Church and help us keep moving forward--as President Hinckley often says, "without ever a backward step."<br><br>During the last four months Relief Society assignments have taken me to Southeast Asia and Africa, where, on two separate continents, I have witnessed a remarkable trend. In countries such as Cambodia, Indonesia, Ghana, and Kenya, where the Church is young but the Spirit is strong, it is young men and women your age who are recognizing the truth, joining the Church, and being called upon to lead. The district Relief Society and Young Women presidents in Phnom Penh are both scarcely twenty years old. And I will never forget a Cambodia district conference when thirty handsome young Cambodian men stood and sang, "We are as the army of Helaman. We have been taught in our youth" ("We'll Bring the World His Truth,"<i>Songbook,</i>172–73). They<i>are</i>the future of the Church in Cambodia. They will help save the day in their corner of the world--as will you, wherever your lives take you, if you live on the Lord's side of the line.<br><br>After President Hinckley's appearance on<i>60 Minutes,</i>a non-LDS viewer sent this note to CBS: "I enjoyed your Mormon segment Easter Sunday. ... These people do provide an anchor in a sea of ever-changing values. Fifty thousand chaste missionaries in 150 countries probably do more good for society than all the government social programs put together" (Tom Thorkelson to<i>60 Minutes,</i>8 April 1996). Imagine then what an army of 2,000,000 chaste, honest, dedicated young men and women filled with the power of God in great glory can do--and must do! There is no greater cause. There is no greater army for righteousness than you.<br><br>The Lord needs faithful, articulate, committed men and women who are undaunted by what lies ahead and who are willing to stand up for what is right again and again; who do not doubt what the Lord will do for them; who keep their covenants with exactness; who have decided that, at all costs, they will live on the Lord's side of the line.<br><br>My dear young friends, will you commit this very hour to be true to who you are? To plant your feet in tar on the Lord's side of the line? I invite you to begin by going home and taking inventory. There may be clothes or CDs or videos or magazines you need to throw out. Just do it. Toss out those movies with foul language and violence and sexual innuendo. If you can't resist adult Internet sites, unhook the Internet. No video or CD or Web site is worth crossing over into Satan's territory. No enticement is worth losing your exaltation. You will love how this kind of spiritual spring cleaning feels. But that is just part one, the easy part. Part two involves taking an inventory of your language, your integrity, your dedication, your virtue, and the way you treat others. One by one, will you begin to throw out thoughts and behaviors and habits that pull you toward enemy territory? I'll take the challenge. Will you? The Lord will help us, for if we will humble ourselves before Him and really believe in Him, He will bless us with strength we have never had before. He will help us turn our weakness into strength (see Ether 12:27). And every small victory over the natural man will be a victory over Satan and yet more evidence of the grand, sweeping, redemptive power of Jesus Christ. Let's begin today.<br><br>Make no mistake about it, you are the latter-day army of Helaman! You have been taught in your youth. The restored gospel will cover this earth. The battle will be rigorous, but the Lord will not concede and His kingdom will not fail. His power and glory will exceed anything we have ever seen in terms of dramatic finishes--and that is at least partly because of you who have been saved for this spectacular, culminating millennium. For each of you, then, only this question remains: Will you stand steadfast and immovable on the Lord's side of the line? The Lord will be on your side if you will stay on His, for He has promised: "I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up" (D&amp;amp;C 84:88).<br><br>Jesus is the Christ. This is His work. Every one of us was foreordained to stand where we stand in His kingdom. May we stand in holy places--on the Lord's side of the line--and<i>be not moved.</i>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Sheri L.

<h1>Shall Be Witnesses unto Me” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Most of you will have seen a picture depicting Christ instructing His apostles on the outskirts of Jerusalem prior to His ascension. The last words uttered by Christ on earth before He went to His heavenly home were: "And ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth" (Acts 1:8).<br><br>The Lord also proclaimed, in Joseph Smith's translation, that "this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world, for a witness unto all nations" (JST, Matthew 24:32).<br><br>In a 1978 regional representatives seminar, President Kimball said:<br><br><i>We have an obligation, a duty, a divine commission to preach the gospel in every nation and to every creature. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . What is the significance of the phrase, "uttermost part[s] of the earth"? He had already covered the area known to the apostles. Was it the people of Judea? Or those in Samaria? Or the few millions in the Far and in the Near East? Where were the "uttermost part[s] of the earth"? Did he mean the millions in what is now America? Did he include the hundreds of thousands or even millions in Greece, Italy, around the Mediterranean, the inhabitants of Central Europe? What did he mean?</i><br><br><i>Or did he mean all the living people of all the world or those spirits assigned to this world to come in centuries ahead? Have we underestimated his language or its meaning?</i>["The Uttermost Parts of the Earth," regional representatives seminar, 29 September 1978;<i>Ensign,</i>July 1979, 5, 6]<br><br>Today I would like to present three examples--all of which are personal testimonies to me of how the Lord prepares the way for the message of His restored gospel to be taken to the "uttermost part of the earth."<br><br>In the early part of 1972, the principal of a small, private elementary school in the Gilbert Islands (now known as Kiribati) sent a letter to the director of our Church schools in Tonga requesting the opportunity for some of their elementary graduates to attend the LDS Liahona High School in Tonga. The letter was forwarded on to me in the Church Office Building in Salt Lake City. Some quick research revealed that there were no members of the Church in Kiribati, and I set the letter aside. Several months later I received a large envelope containing approximately 30 personally handwritten letters from some of the students at the school pleading for the opportunity to continue their secondary education at Liahona High School. I was deeply touched by the sincerity of the contents of the letters and took the packet to Neal A. Maxwell, then Church Educational System commissioner, who in turn discussed the matter with the CES board of trustees. The immediate question was, "If we allow some of the Gilbertese students to go to Tonga, and if while there they join the Church and then later return to their home islands where there is no Church organization, what will become of them?" However, after careful consideration, the board decided to allow 12 students to go to Tonga on a trial basis. Brother George Pucket, the Church Educational System administrator in Tonga, was instructed to go to the islands and select the students. While at Liahona during that first year, all 12 were baptized into the Church.<br><br>As a result of the success of that first year, authorization was given to enroll 12 more, and most of them also joined the Church. It soon became clear that the question raised by the Brethren in the beginning was coming to pass. Some of the students were ready to graduate and, we hoped, would return to the islands. With this concern, I and Dr. Ken Beezley, then CES associate commissioner, were instructed to go to Kiribati and assess the situation.<br><br>As we flew over the group of 16 islands, it seemed as though the airstrip occupied half the landmass of the central island of Tarawa. Upon landing, we exited the small propjet plane not knowing what to expect or exactly where we were going. All we had was the name of the school. We climbed into the backseat of an old World War II Jeep held together by wire and whatever else was available. I handed the driver the letter identifying the name of the school and asked him to take us there. After traveling a short distance on a small coral road bordered by coconut trees and ocean on both sides, the driver suddenly stopped in front of several thatched huts and informed us that we had reached our destination. As we walked toward the huts, a young boy was standing nearby. I asked if the headmaster or principal was around, and he pointed in the direction of one of the thatched huts. Looking inside we saw a man sitting on a woven mat with his back toward us. As we entered, he suddenly turned and was surprised to see two strange Caucasian men. We quickly introduced ourselves and stated the purpose of our visit. He rushed over, gave us a big embrace, and began to cry.<br><br>Because the plane only arrived and departed every three days, we spent our time getting acquainted with the principal, Waitea, the students, and the circumstances under which the school was being conducted. Two of the huts were classrooms with coral floors, with nothing but mats to sit on and no teaching tools or materials of any kind except a few old hand-me-down textbooks and some paper and pencils. The other two huts were resident halls--one for the girls and one for the boys. Their beds were simple woven mats with a small wood-log pillow. In the late afternoon the girls went out looking for firewood and taro, and the boys fished in the bay. They then prepared their meals in an open earthen oven.<br><br>At the end of the three days we paid a final visit to the school. The students assembled out in the open under the palm trees dressed in white shirts and blue lavalavas. Brother Beezley and I each gave a short speech and expressed our gratitude for their hospitality. Before presenting us with native handicraft gifts, the students sang several songs of farewell. It was an emotional experience, and my life was changed forever by being in the presence of these students and their teachers.<br><br>We returned to Salt Lake City and submitted our report to Commissioner Maxwell. The Church Missionary Committee then asked President Ebby Davis of the Fiji Mission to look into the possibility of taking missionaries to the islands and establishing the Church formally in Kiribati. President Davis visited with the government officials and made the formal request. Much to his surprise, the governor granted his request, except there was one major condition. Any missionaries coming into Kiribati had to be Gilbertese citizens. The governor, prompted by the Catholic bishop, knew very well there were no Gilbertese members of our church and that the approval given to President Davis could not be put into effect. Of course, the governor didn't realize that the Lord was several years ahead of the situation. In April 1975, six of the first group of 12 students who enrolled at Liahona were graduated and had already served several months as missionary companions to Tongan elders. Three months later, accompanied by their new mission president, Ken Palmer from New Zealand, the six traveled back to their homeland. They went to an ocean inlet on the main island of Tarawa, where during World War II the first American amphibious assault against a fortified atoll took place, marking one of the major turning points of the Pacific war. Here, in a war memorial cemetery, President Palmer knelt with the elders and dedicated the land of Kiribati for the preaching of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>In March of 1976, President Palmer officially established the first branch of the Church in Kiribati on Tarawa. It was determined that the continued existence of the school was desirable to meet the educational needs of the young people and parents who were joining the Church. Waitea, the principal, who had also joined the Church, suggested that we should take ownership of the school. That suggestion was resisted for a period of time, but it became clear that if our members were to receive an appropriate education and if the Church was to continue to flourish, we would have to assume the responsibility. During one of my several trips to Kiribati in late 1976, Brother Paul Sorenson and I sat on a log next to one of the thatched huts and talked about the possible name of the school. During that discussion it was suggested that it temporarily be called Moroni High School. In June of 1976, Grant and Patricia Howlett and their family of eight children were called as special CES missionaries to direct the school. In September of 1978, Brother Richard Pratt and his wife Adeline were called as missionaries to Kiribati. Brother Pratt was a retired seminary teacher and also a master builder. He immediately started the process of replacing the thatched huts with brick classrooms and a chapel for use as a school building during the week and church on Sunday. Tongan teachers from Liahona High School and CES missionaries from the mainland were brought in to staff the school and to continue the construction process. In the meantime the missionary work continued, and several branches of the Church were established on the outer islands. Today Moroni High is the finest school in Kiribati, and the students are known as Moroni Warriors. It is staffed partially by former students who graduated, served missions, went on to earn their degrees from BYU--Hawaii, and are now back as teachers and administrators.<br><br>On August 13, 1996, I received a letter from Waitea, the original principal:<br><br><i>Dear Alton Wade,</i><br><br><i>It was a long time since you first came to Kiribati to give assistance to me for the plans and ideas in establishing the Church school and the Church itself as well. I am very happy that the Church in Kiribati at this time is not a branch but a stake, and the school is rapidly improving. It is now the most beautiful of any other church schools and even the government schools. I myself wish to give the greatest thanks to the Church in Utah for their financial aid for all the school needs and equipment at the beginning. Now parents on Tarawa and other sister islands wish to send their sons and daughters for schooling in Moroni. I thank our Father in Heaven for presenting me the long life to live so that I may see all the great and rapid changes. . . .</i><br><br><i>With many thanks.</i><br><br><i>Yours sincerely,</i><br><br><i>Waitea Ataria.</i><br><br>On August 9, 1996, Elder L. Tom Perry of the Quorum of the Twelve dedicated Moroni High School, and on August 11, 1996, the Tarawa Kiribati Stake was created. In February of this year, en route to Australia, President Hinckley made a stopover on the island and held a meeting for the Saints and government officials.<br><br>Now let me go back to what President Kimball said years ago:<br><br><i>We have an obligation, a duty, a divine commission to preach the gospel unto every nation and to every creature. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . If we could only make a small beginning in every nation, soon the converts among each kindred and tongue could step forth as lights to their own people and the gospel would thus be preached in all nations before the coming of the Lord.</i>["The Uttermost Parts of the Earth," regional representative seminar, 29 September 1978;<i>Ensign,</i>July 1979, 5, 8]<br><br>As some of you may know, the Church operates a number of elementary and secondary schools in the Pacific Islands. One of those schools located in Apia, Western Samoa, is called the Church College of Western Samoa. In 1975, during the time I was a Church Educational System zone administrator over that area, we found ourselves unable to fill two positions in the science department of the college with qualified Latter-day Saints. The positions were therefore advertised through the local paper. To our surprise, two highly qualified Indian women appeared at the college office dressed in colorful saris. They were interviewed and hired, and they started teaching the following week. As the school year progressed, their exposure to the Church through day-to-day contact with students, faculty, and staff heightened their interest in knowing more about the Mormon faith.<br><br>At this point in the story, it is important to understand how these two outstanding young women from India--one of the<i>most</i>densely populated countries in the world--happened to be in Samoa--one of the<i>least</i>densely populated countries in the world. In 1975 the Western Samoan government, working through the United Nations, requested the assistance of an internationally known tropical agricultural scholar to come to Samoa and assess their agricultural policies. Through an extensive international search, Dr. Edwin Dharmaraju was identified, and he consented to spend two years consulting with the Western Samoan government. On this assignment he was accompanied by Mrs. Dharmaraju and their two daughters, Lata and Asha. The Dharmarajus had arrived in Samoa just a few weeks prior to our advertisement for science teachers.<br><br>At the conclusion of each school day, Lata and Asha would go home to their apartment in Apia and share with their parents not only the experiences they were having in teaching at the college but also their intense interest in what they were learning about the Mormon faith. It was not long until the family requested missionaries to come to their home and teach them in more depth about the doctrines of the Church. In a few short weeks, all four members of the Dharmaraju family were baptized. Several months after their baptisms, Brother and Sister Dharmaraju traveled back India to celebrate the wedding of their daughter Lata.<br><br>The following is a quote taken from their report of that visit.<br><br><i>A typical Indian marriage is a unique occasion for all families to meet. Having experienced several choice blessings since joining the Church, we felt it was our duty to share the restored gospel with our families in India. We therefore took several copies of the Book of Mormon along with us. Lata's wedding took place in Hyderabad. The occasion provided us an opportunity to talk about the Church to all of our family members who had assembled. We also distributed the copies of the Book of Mormon. We found our family members taking an active interest in wanting to know more about the Church.</i><br><br>After their two-week visit in Hyderabad, the Dharmaraju family returned to Western Samoa and soon began receiving letters from their families in India requesting more information about the Church. Dr. Dharmaraju wrote a letter to Brother Arthur Haycock, secretary to President Spencer W. Kimball, informing him about his family in India and their desire to know more about the Church. Brother Haycock responded in a letter stating that President Kimball was aware of the request and that "the matter of the work in India is being very carefully considered."<br><br>During one of my frequent visits to Western Samoa, Dr. Dharmaraju informed me of his correspondence with the Church leaders in Salt Lake City and indicated he was eagerly awaiting word that a couple would be appointed by the First Presidency to go to India to work with members of his family. Several weeks later, and just prior to my again returning to Western Samoa, I was contacted by President Cannon of the International Mission and told that the First Presidency had authorized him to extend a three-month mission call to Dr. and Mrs. Dharmaraju to return during their normal leave of absence and serve a three-month mission to their family in India. Two weeks later, as I arrived back in Apia, I was met at the plane by a pale and extremely humble Dr. Dharmaraju and his wife. He rushed over to me, embraced me, and whispered in my ear, "Brother Wade, you will never in all the world guess what is happening to us!" Believe me, there were several moments of tears and extreme emotion as we stood there on the airport Tarmac. The Dharmarajus accepted the call and went on their three-month mission to their homeland.<br><br>Following are excerpts from their March 31, 1979, report to the First Presidency, which Brother Dharmaraju shared with me.<br><br><i>We left Apia for India on December 9, 1978. We had brief stopovers in Suva, Auckland, Sidney, Singapore, and Kuala Lumpur. We were now on the plane to India. Suddenly we realized the magnitude of our responsibilities as missionaries, and we were seized with fear. Anything wrong said or done by us would hurt the Church and damage its future. We had several doubts. Were we capable of providing all the answers to the questions that would be asked of us about the Church? How many of them would agree to be baptized? As these anxieties bothered us and the plane was nearing India, Sister Dharmaraju opened her Doctrine and Covenants for comfort, and these were the words that came to her:</i><br><br><i>"Lift up your heart and rejoice, for the hour of your mission is come; and your tongue shall be loosed, and you shall declare glad tidings of great joy unto this generation" (D&amp;amp;C 31:3).</i><br><br><i>"Yea, I will open the hearts of the people, and they will receive you. And I will establish a church by your hand" (D&amp;amp;C 31:7).</i><br><br><i>We read these verses again and again, and the words uplifted us and gave us courage as the hour of our mission was fast approaching. Whatever anxieties we had earlier slowly disappeared as we arrived in Hyderabad, India. My parents and our older son David had already arrived earlier by train, and also my sister and brother-in-law Ramish from Iran. All of the other families had already assembled at my brother's place. Without wasting any further time, we told all the members of our families that had assembled in my younger brother Henry's house the purpose of our visit. They were very happy that we had come and, therefore, we talked on several topics at great length. We spoke of God's kingdom in the latter days and the restoration of the gospel and how the Book of Mormon is a new witness for Christ and it fulfills the Bible prophecies. We mentioned to them the restoration of the priesthood authority and the ordinances of baptism. We also discussed the Sabbath day, the law of tithing, and the Word of Wisdom. Finally, we stressed to them the need to study the gospel, to strengthen their individual testimonies, and to enter into the waters of baptism.</i><br><br><i>On the suggestion of our families, we fixed the baptismal service for December 27, 1978. My younger brother, Henry, placed at our disposal the water pool in the compound of his house for the baptism. The pool was cleaned up and painted, and fresh water was let in. This was the day for which Sister Dharmaraju and myself were praying for and looking forward to. All of us were dressed in white--the ladies in saris and the men in loose-fitting Indian-style jackets and trousers.</i><br><br><i>The first to be baptized were my parents. It was a thrilling moment for me when I stood in the water with my father, holding his hand. I said, "Samuel David, having been commissioned of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen." And the thrill continued as I held my mother's hand and my son's hand and those of my brothers and sisters and repeated these words. I baptized a total of 18 members of my family on this day. Immediately after the baptisms, I conducted the confirmation service the same evening.</i><br><br><i>The next day Sister Dharmaraju and myself traveled about six hours by train and baptized four more persons of my family. These baptisms had to be done on the banks of a river that is about two miles away from downtown.</i><br><br><i>In all, I baptized 22 persons during the present visit to India. I also ordained four persons to the Aaronic priesthood.</i><br><br><i>From Hyderabad we went to see my wife's parents, who live approximately 16 hours away by train. Perhaps most of the Church members are unaware that, for the last 14 months, Sister Dharmaraju's father, Reverend P. Sreenivasam, has been engaged in the translation of the Book of Mormon into the local language of Hyderabad State, called Telugu. This language is spoken by nearly 50 million people. Reverend Sreenivasam is an ordained Baptist minister. While we were at his place, he showed us more than 500 full-scale, neatly handwritten sheets of the translation. He has been translating the Book of Mormon at the rate of a little more than a page per day and expects to complete the translation in another three to four months. Arrangements will be made with the Church to print the translated version of the Book of Mormon in India as soon as it is ready and approved. At this moment in time we just cannot visualize the impact this book will have on the more than 40 million people living in Hyderabad State. We consider this our greatest single humble contribution to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in India.</i><br><br><i>Before I conclude this report, I would like to submit in all humility that whatever work we did in India is just a minute droplet in the ocean. One must realize that India has a population of more than 610 million and is the most densely populated country in the world next to China. We have just sown the seed for the potential Church development in India. If my mission has been a success, it is primarily due to the hard work and the all-out support given to me by Sister Dharmaraju.</i><br><br>At the time of the Dharmarajus' mission there were no known members of the Church in the Hyderabad region of 40 million people. Even though proselyting is not permitted in India today, there are now approximately 3,500 members and 21 branches.<br><br>Selections from the 700-page partial manuscript of the Book of Mormon translated into Telugu by Sister Dharmaraju's father were printed in 1982. (See<i>Deseret News 1999–2000 Church Almanac</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret News, 1998], 335–36.)<br><br>A third example of the way the Lord is preparing the way for the opening up of nations is one that started in 1955 and is being fulfilled even today. I suggest you would find few Old or New Testament prophecies that have unfolded in a more dramatic or timely way than this modern-day prophecy made in 1955 by President David O. McKay during the dedicatory prayer at the groundbreaking ceremony for the establishment of the Church College of Hawaii on February 12, 1956:<br><br><i>We dedicate our actions in this service unto thee and unto thy glory and to the salvation of the children of men, that this college, and the temple, and the town of Laie may become a missionary factor, influencing not thousands, not tens of thousands, but millions of people who will come seeking to know what this town and its significance are.</i>[In Reuben D. Law,<i>The Founding and Early Development of the Church College of Hawaii</i>(St. George, Utah: Dixie College Press, 1972), 69]<br><br>To understand the significance and importance of this prophecy, we must study it in its time frame of 1955. First, the Church could hardly be referred to as an international entity in 1955 as there were only 1,197 members in Mexico, 3,679 members in all of South America, 367 members in Central America, 392 along the whole Asian Rim, and a total of only 82,000 members of the Church outside the United States, Mexico, and Canada (source: Church Statistical Department).<br><br>Second, although Hawaii was beginning to be recognized as an attractive tourist destination, only approximately 100,000 tourists came to Hawaii in 1955, and most of them from mainland USA. Third, the north shore of Oahu was not considered a must-see part of the island of Oahu by either residents or tourists. The temple was just a get-out-and-stretch stop for the occasional circle island tour. And fourth, the Polynesian Cultural Center had not even been conceived of in 1955.<br><br>This then was the setting when a stately, white-haired prophet stood in the middle of a sugarcane field in the least-visited part of the island and prophesied that the college, the temple, and the community would be missionary factors in influencing millions of people. I can imagine that even the most faithful follower and admirer of President David O. McKay must have wondered if he or she had heard the prophet correctly. Satan himself must have even had a few chuckles over it. "Millions of people coming to Laie? You've got to be kidding!" Nevertheless, the campus of what is now BYU--Hawaii was built and opened its doors to 150 students. Eight years later, in 1963, with little pomp and ceremony, but with a great deal of laughter and predictions of its total failure from the Waikiki entertainment community, the Polynesian Cultural Center opened its doors.<br><br>The PCC had a small and humble beginning with students occasionally standing along Kamehameha Highway flagging down the occasional circle island tourists and inviting them to visit the PCC. There were times during those first few years when the performers played to no more than 20 to 30 individuals.<br><br>As a member of the board of directors of the Polynesian Cultural Center, I attended our midyear board meeting just eight days ago in Hawaii and was informed that attendance at the PCC over the past 37 years has just exceeded 27 million guests from every corner of the world. Approximately one-third of those who have visited the Polynesian Cultural Center have also visited the temple visitors' center just a few blocks away. Amazingly, little Laie has become a destination for people worldwide, and the center has been the number-one paid tourist attraction in Hawaii since the mid-1970s.<br><br>Were he not a prophet, how could President McKay have possibly known in 1955 what we would be experiencing today?<br><br>However, there is another side of this wonderful story that may, in time, eclipse even the importance of the large number of people from around the world who attend the Polynesian Cultural Center on a daily basis. When I was appointed president of BYU--Hawaii in 1986, a cooperative Asian Executive Management Internship Program had just begun between PCC/BYU--Hawaii and several mainland China government agencies. The internship arrangement allows for eight to 10 midlevel government officials to spend one year studying at BYU--Hawaii and interning at the Polynesian Cultural Center.<br><br>These individuals live on campus in residence halls with regular BYU--Hawaii students. At the end of the year they are given certificates of achievement in the various academic disciplines and professional activities at the Polynesian Cultural Center.<br><br>Over the past 15 years, approximately 135 of these mature Chinese individuals have gone through this program and returned to full-time employment in the government and business agencies from which they came. On two occasions since the inception of the program, Sister Wade and I were hosted by these agencies in China. During these visits we met with the supervisors and employers to assess the program and to recommend any changes or improvements that should be considered. Over a period of two weeks we met with approximately 50 of the former interns in four major cities in mainland China.<br><br>The reception we received from the former interns, their supervisors, and the government officials was overwhelming. To those who had gone through the program, we were like long-lost friends, even family. They simply could not contain their emotions and wanted to spend most of our time together hearing about BYU--Hawaii, PCC, Laie, and all of the friends they had left behind. In every case, upon completion of the internship and their return to China, they had been advanced to positions above those they had previously held.<br><br>During their time on campus, each individual registered for and completed a Book of Mormon course and, in many cases, attended church on a regular basis. Some joined the Church knowing full well when they returned to China there would be no LDS Church unit with which they could affiliate. However, they also understood that in the Lord's due time, they will have an important and prominent role to play in spreading the message of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ, providing leadership and making friends for the Church. Even those who did not embrace the gospel expressed over and over again to us their admiration for the Church and the principles upon which it is founded. I am sure each one of them will be willing to speak in our defense if needed and when appropriate.<br><br>It is interesting to note the comparison of Church membership in stakes and missions from 1971 to 1998. I was in Korea in the mid-1970s when the first stake was established by President Hinckley. In 1971 there were 5,165 members, no stakes, and no missions. In 1998 there were 69,000 members, 17 stakes, and 4 missions. I was in the Philippines in the early 1970s when there were 9,700 members, no stakes, and only one mission. At the end of 1998 there were 389,000 members, 62 stakes, and 13 missions. I was working in Chile and Brazil in the early 1970s when the Church was struggling for identity. These two countries combined had 55,000 members, four stakes, and three missions (source: Church Statistics Department). As of 1998 these two countries have a combined membership of 1,102,000, with 300 stakes and 34 missions (see<i>Deseret News 1999–2000 Church Almanac</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret News, 1998], 280–86, 298–302).<br><br>I repeat again the last words uttered by Christ on earth before He went to His heavenly home: "And ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth" (Acts 1:8).<br><br>What I have described today is not unusual. Similar stories are taking place in other areas of the world. I bear solemn testimony that the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is rolling forth under His direction and in preparation for His second coming. This I testify to in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Alton L.

<br>
It is a pleasure for me to be here today and share a few of my thoughts with you. It is also overwhelming, and frightening, to be in front of such an audience--in front of you who already know so much about the gospel, you who have had many great and inspiring experiences of your own in your lives. Today I am going to talk about something in which I have a strong testimony. I firmly believe, without a doubt, that my whole life has been a miracle. I don't know why, to tell you the truth, but the Lord has been good to me. He has preserved me and guided me. I am thankful for this, and I want to communicate to you that I know for a fact that if we trust and rely upon the Lord, we will be blessed and guided toward that which is good for us and for all those with whom we come in contact.<br><br>In 1 Nephi 10:6 we read: "Wherefore, all mankind were in a lost and in a fallen state, and ever would be save they should rely on this Redeemer." Also, in 2 Nephi 22:2, we read: "Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid; for the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song; he also has become my salvation." I am very happy to have the Lord on my side. He is such an ally who loves me and cares for me. Had it not been for the Lord, I would not be here today.<br><br>The very day I was born some medical complications arose, and the doctors did not have any hope for my survival. Almost all of the other infants in similar situations had died a few days after birth, but I was a tiny little fighter and the Lord preserved me. My life began with a miracle, and a miracle it has been indeed ever since. I am sure that, if each one of you now pauses and thinks about your own life circumstances, all of you can think of many instances when you have been helped, preserved, guided, healed, or when you witnessed a miracle. We are all entitled to such blessings, and we receive them daily because we are children of a Heavenly Father who loves us and takes care of us. However, often we forget where these blessings come from, and we tend to believe that we succeed because we are strong, intelligent, or even handsome. We need to recognize more the Lord's hand in our life, to be worthy of His blessings, and to be humble in receiving them.<br><br>Often when I witness a miracle I don't immediately recognize it as such, and I think that it was a circumstance or my own ability in accomplishing a certain task. I am glad that the Lord humbles me and that He soon reminds me that it wasn't I who accomplished it, but that it was His own hand involved. When I think of this, I can't help but remember an experience, a frightening one, from many years ago. I had a two-year-old boy. That boy is now sitting with his sister in this audience today and has become a handsome young man. (At least<i>I</i>think he is handsome, but I am his proud mother!) That day, 12 years ago and early in the morning, I was busy getting ready to come to school and briefly stepped out of the room where we were. I left the room for just a couple of minutes. I was sure that Alessandro was safe; he was just playing with his toys.<br><br>I didn't know that he had gotten hold of a little candy container with a small plastic cap on it. As he put the container in his mouth, as toddlers do, the plastic cap came loose and lodged in his throat. He coughed a couple of times, then the cap went in deeper in his throat and clogged it completely. In the other room I was almost done doing whatever I was doing, and I heard him cough. I thought, "I'll give Sandro some cough medicine in a moment, as soon as I am done here," and I continued with my business.<br><br>Then I don't know what happened. Something, someone took me from the room I was in, and I found myself by my son's side. Up to this day I do not remember consciously deciding to go to him, going through the hallway, and approaching him. I simply found myself at his side. I saw that his lips had turned blue and that he was not breathing. I cannot forget the fearful look in his eyes, pleading for me to help him. I took him and gave him the Heimlich maneuver once, then twice. Nothing happened. I was shaking hard with apprehension. Sandro was becoming limp. I cried to the Lord: "Help me, Lord! Help me save my child!" I tried the maneuver a third time, with a strength that I did not have but the strength that the Lord gave me, and I pushed hard at the bottom of his sternum. The plastic cap came out with the speed of a bullet and dented the kitchen wall. I started crying, and Sandro started crying. He coughed again, spitting some blood. I thought that I had broken something inside his chest, for I had pushed so hard. I then attempted to call Dr. Willis, a dear friend of ours and our family physician. I took the phone receiver in my hand and tried to dial up the number. I could not do it. My hands were shaking so hard that I couldn't direct them on the right numbers. Finally I managed to call, and the doctor told me not to worry, that probably the cap had scratched the boy's throat and that the bleeding would cease. In fact, my son did stop bleeding. I sat down on the couch with Alessandro in my arms, crying and thanking the Lord for His help. For the following three days I had absolutely no strength in my whole body. I know that whatever was necessary to save my son never came from me. The Lord loved us so much and came to our rescue when we needed Him the most. I pray that I never, never forget the source of the strength that I needed that day and that I can always remember to be thankful for it.<br><br>We can trust the Lord. He never forgets any of us or any of our needs. Sometimes we do not get what we ask for. Then we must stop and think for a minute: maybe we are not supposed to get what we think we need. Even if our desires are just, maybe it's not the right time in our life or maybe it's never going to be the right time in this mortal life. We need to totally trust in the Lord, put ourselves in His hands, and accept our lot in life. This is not easy, but, if we are close to the Spirit, it will be easier for us to accept what comes to us. When my father was deathly ill with cancer, I earnestly prayed that he would be healed, that his life would be spared. He was such a good man; he did not deserve to suffer so. Then, as the illness progressed, the Lord touched my heart and my prayers changed. I asked that my mother and I would receive strength, patience, and an accepting attitude for whatever we were going to face. The Lord blessed us, and we were able to accept the passing of my dad. Even if the loss was great and the loneliness in our hearts deep, we felt peace in our souls.<br><br>Several years ago I had a dear friend, an older friend, who had many health problems. As she grew older, several physical ailments plagued her, and she often complained about her situation and became depressed. I tried to help her, but for some reason I couldn't really reach out and felt frustrated myself. I sought advice from my dear mother-in-law and expressed to her my inadequacy in helping my friend. Sister Noble was herself an older lady with several physical limitations. She listened to me, thought a little, and then said a few but very wise words: "Your friend should have more faith and trust in the Lord." It is true. If we give of ourselves freely to the Lord, our burdens will be lifted and our hearts will be consoled.<br><br>Several examples of hope and trust in the Lord have come to me from you, the young, beautiful, faithful students of this university. More than 10 years ago I had an excellent student in my Italian classes. Let's call her Debbie. If she is listening, she will recognize her story. Debbie was always punctual to class and in her assignments. She had always been an A student in the several classes she had taken from me. That semester she was again enrolled in another one of my courses.<br><br>One day she had not arrived by 10:00 a.m, when the class began. It was the first time that she had been absent. I thought that she was probably ill. At 10 minutes after 10:00 a.m., she walked into the class and quietly sat down at one of the desks. I noted in my mind that that was strange and then went on with my lesson. At the end of the class she waited for everyone to leave and then approached me. She said, "Sister Noble, I am sorry I was late for class today, but last night I had my third miscarriage in a row." Her eyes were glossy with tears for the sorrow of having lost a much-desired baby, and she was shaking a little. My dedicated, sweet, dear Debbie! I told her to go home immediately and to rest, and that we would worry about the assignments later. She was discouraged by the recurring problems in her desire to become a mother, but serene in her countenance and faithful in her attitude. She trusted in the Lord and knew that everything would be fine, that if she and her husband were faithful and strong the Lord would bless them--with or without children in this mortal life. I will never forget that day with Debbie. I admired her strength and faith and hoped that I could have a fraction of it myself. I told her "tongue in cheek" that I would fail her if I found out that she didn't take the day off and get some rest.<br><br>A few years later I received a phone call from Debbie. She told me that she had two children and that she and her husband were very happy. Debbie, wherever you are, I will never forget you and your example.<br><br>Our human knowledge is so very limited. I often wonder how we can ever trust it. As I teach Italian 20th-century literature, we read from many wonderful authors--men and women who have witnessed the horrors of two world wars, of Fascism and of Nazism. At the beginning of that century, Italy and Europe were going through a time of decadence when people didn't know the purpose of life. In Italy this sentiment was even more acute since the new country, united in 1861 after centuries of foreign servitude and the sacrifice of many patriots, had looked to the future with hopes of political renovation and technological enhancements. People soon found out how feeble the foundations of human strength were and began asking themselves the same eternal questions: "Who am I? Where do I come from? What am I doing here? Where am I going?" Luigi Pirandello and Eugenio Montale, recipients of the Nobel Prize for literature, asked themselves these same existential questions. Cesare Pavese searched for his roots, for his identity, for his purpose in life. Without the comfort of religion, this sensitive, gentle man felt alone and hopeless. These people wrote of their quest for a purpose and of their failure to find it. How much desperation we see in those who do not have faith, and how much hope there is in those who, even in the most dire circumstances, let the Lord comfort them.<br><br>In 2 Nephi 4:34 we read: "O Lord, I have trusted in thee, and I will trust in thee forever. I will not put my trust in the arm of flesh." One of the Lord's most chosen servants, our beloved Prophet Joseph Smith, tried for a long time to find the true church by himself. He inquired of many learned people and preachers but never got the right answer. He received perfect knowledge only when he gave himself to the Lord in the Sacred Grove. After that first vision his life was difficult for him; he was persecuted and finally murdered. Nonetheless, he was a forbearing and contented man, a man blessed in many ways even in adversity. He had faith and trust in the Lord, no matter what happened to him. His perspective was eternal. Let's all remember our eternal potential, and let's not be limited by our human dimension. We can do it, if we are in tune with the Spirit of the Lord and if we accept the guidance of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball has said:<br><br><i>The Holy Ghost is a personage of spirit and comes into our lives to lead us in the paths of righteousness. Each person on whom authoritative hands have been placed will receive the Holy Ghost. He will lead us unto all truth. And so we are a blessed people with all these special blessings. If one does not receive the great gift of the Holy Ghost, then it is his fault, that he hasn't been spiritual enough or close enough to Heavenly Father.</i>[<i>TSWK,</i>22–23]<br><br>And for those who are not yet baptized and confirmed, our prophets have told us that we all have a sort of a compass to guide us and to tell us what is right and what is wrong in an unmistakably clear way: it is the divine gift of our conscience (see<i>TSWK,</i>113). For us, in this estate, there is only one sure way, and I quote again from President Kimball: "Follow the Holy Spirit within you and follow the prophets, dead and living" (<i>TSWK,</i>114).<br><br>Another perfect example of complete trust in the Lord comes from the Old Testament. Who does not remember the faith of Abraham when he obeyed the Lord, even to the point of being willing to sacrifice his own son? I don't know if I would ever be able to go that far, and I am overwhelmed by the greatness of Abraham's faith. I don't believe that the Lord will ask me and you to go that far, but I know that we are all going to be tested in one way or another. We are here for this very reason, to be tested and to prove our faith.<br><br>This reminds me of another incident that happened in the life of my husband's mother. Just a couple of years before her passing, she was a worker in the Provo Temple. She loved attending the temple and working there. She had the early morning shift, and she usually left her home around five in the morning and, at age 80, drove to Provo from her Orem home.<br><br>One January morning her car would not start. It was snowing and very cold. She tried a few times to get the engine going, but to no avail. She was determined to fulfill her calling and to not disturb anyone at that early hour. After a short prayer to the Lord, she didn't lose courage and started walking, at age 80, at five in the morning, in January, while it was snowing hard. I assure you, I am not making this up; it is true in every detail.<br><br>This modern pioneer woman walked half a block, and a car stopped next to her. An older gentleman was driving and asked her if he could be of assistance. Sister Noble did not want to bother him too much and asked him where he was going, to see if their two destinations were nearby. Well, he was also going to the temple and offered her a ride.<br><br>When that afternoon she called us to take her back home and told us this story, we gently scolded her for not calling us that morning and urged her to promise us not to do it again.<br><br>Then, with her usual sweetness and calm, she answered back and said: "Okay, I'll call you next time, and I won't do it again. But you kids, you don't have enough faith. I knew that I would be all right." She said this simply, almost unbelieving of our concern. She was on the Lord's business, and He was going to help her. What were we worried about?<br><br>In today's world we are faced, every day, by many challenges and trials. Our modern, technologically advanced world will not be able to furnish all answers, all advice, all support. In an old little book I found the following words, which I believe are still true:<br><br><i>Astronomy has mapped the heavens and attempted to number the stars, but on its sky chart we find no star of Bethlehem, and in its sky no Sun of righteousness.</i><br><br><i>Geology has combed the stratified layers of earth's foundations, but it has found no Rock of Ages.</i><br><br><i>Physics, with its electric light, has illuminated cities until the night is banished, but it knows not the Light of the world.</i><br><br><i>Mineralogy has sifted the stones of the earth, and sounded the depths of the seas, but it has found no pearls of great price.</i><br><br><i>Oh, the unwisdom of this age of the wise! Men, now as never before, by wisdom know not God.</i>[Albert L. Zobell, comp.,<i>Story Sermons</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1954), 52–53]<br><br>It is up to us to know the Lord and to be in tune with His Spirit so that when we are faced with life's challenges we will be ready to ask for help and, more important, ready to listen and be open to the Lord's comfort. Laman and Lemuel witnessed many miracles and prodigies, yet they were blind to the Spirit and did not recognize the miracles poured upon them. I pray that we can all be ready to always accept the Lord in our lives and that when in five, 10, or even 40 years, when we are so discouraged that we want to say, "I give up, I can't go on like this anymore," we can be alert and responsive to the whisperings of the Spirit. Our whole life is a mission for the building of the kingdom, and we all need to feed our spiritual bodies as well as our physical bodies and our minds. We have to do this daily, because spiritual starvation is a constant danger today.<br><br>Many of you have gone on full-time missions, and many of you are preparing to go out soon. Relying on the Spirit is the best preparation for missionary work. In 1974 two missionaries who were in Italy came and knocked at my door. My mother was alone at home that day and, before letting them in, she looked through the peep hole of our door on the seventh floor of the apartment building in which we lived. You see, the week before one of her friends had been attacked in her home while she was alone. Two young men had introduced themselves as employees of a utilities company, and the woman allowed them in the home to check the gas lines. They seized her, hit her in the forehead with a gun, fired a shot in the air to scare her, and robbed her of all her jewelry. My mother had gone to visit that friend in the hospital just a couple of days earlier. Now, she was not going to let those two young men with a foreign accent into the house, especially when no one else was there. She told them that she was the maid and that she was not allowed to let anyone in.<br><br>The two missionaries left, marked my address with a check, and went on to the next home. A few days later they happened in my neighborhood again, and the same scenario followed. My mother was home alone, and the missionaries were not permitted to enter. All you returned missionaries can relate to this experience, and I am sure that you remember how disappointed you were in similar situations. Well, as you know, after two or three unsuccessful tries, missionaries usually don't go back to the same place. They look for friendlier people! Those two missionaries were later assigned to a different neighborhood and for awhile worked in another area of the town.<br><br>Some time went by, and one day my mother saw a missionary street board in the main square of our town. Her interest was immediately drawn by the pictures and the writings on the board, and she began talking to the missionaries. Suddenly it started to rain, one of those thick and abrupt rainstorms of central Italy that keep the country beautifully green but that also catch you by surprise. My mother ran away to take cover. She still had many questions in her mind but didn't have the time to give her name or address to the missionaries.<br><br>The next day or so, the same first two missionaries happened--and I emphasize "happened'--into my neighborhood. They were still working in another part of town, but that day they decided to take a different way home. As they were walking down my street, one of the missionaries asked the other one if they should try that building on 71 Carducci Street again--on the seventh floor. His companion told him that it would be a waste of time; they had already tried three times! The first missionary then replied, "I don't know why, but I know that we have to go back to that residence. I have no explanation, no reason--I just feel that we have to try again."<br><br>So they went up the stairs, rang the doorbell, and waited outside for a little while. My mother was alone again, but that day, that time, she did open the door, and she let them in. That missionary is the reason why I am here today, why I began attending this church, why I was baptized, and why now I have been married in the temple for time and all eternity, with a beautiful family and eternal blessings awaiting me. That missionary listened to the Spirit, and he could hear the Spirit because he was ready to listen. My life is a miracle, a miracle made possible by the faith of another, and by the love of the Lord for me.<br><br>The Lord is ready to pour blessings on us if we just let Him do it. He loves us; we are His children; He listens to our prayers. Jonathan Golden Kimball was born in Salt Lake City in 1853. He, with his father, Heber C. Kimball, and with President Brigham Young, visited the settlements of the early Saints. He served as a missionary in the southern United States and later was called as president of the Southern States Mission at Chattanooga, Tennessee. Recounting one of his life experiences, he recalled the words that President Wilford Woodruff spoke to him one day: "Now, Brother Kimball, I have had visions, I have had revelations, I have seen angels, but the greatest of all is that still small voice" (J. Golden Kimball,<i>CR,</i>April 1924, 70).<br><br>That is, indeed, the greatest gift of all: that still small voice to which we are all entitled if we search for it. Pray, stay close to the Lord, read the scriptures, attend Church, obey the commandments, and have hope and faith in the Lord. We have been taught to pray continually that we may receive the Spirit and that we will not be tempted beyond our strength. We must counsel with the Lord in all our doings, and we must not perform any action without praying to the Father in the name of Christ. (See Marion D. Hanks,<i>The Gift of Self</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1974], 173.)<br><br>We will have trials, but let's accept them as part of this earthly experience. Let's recognize that our lives are a miracle, a miracle of love and of innumerable blessings. The Lord loves us and will comfort and help us always. I know this for a fact, a fact as sure and real as I am standing here in front of you today. I echo the words of Elder John A. Widtsoe:<br><br><i>By this faith, which teaches me that I am eternal, with an existence before this life, and an ever active life hereafter, I am given full courage to battle against evil, whether in myself or in others. . . .</i><br><br><i>By this faith my joy in life is abundant, my sorrows are tempered, my trust in the ultimate triumph of good over evil is unshakable.</i>[In<i>Testimonies of the Divinity of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by Its Leaders</i>(Independence, Missouri: Zion's Printing and Publishing, 1930), 193]<br><br>I know who I am: I am a daughter of a Heavenly Father who loves me. Because of this knowledge, I know where I came from, what I am doing here, and where I am going. I am thankful to my parents, who have taught me good principles and have fed both my body and my spirit, unknowingly preparing me to receive the gospel when the right time came. As I mentioned before, I was not born in the Church, but the Lord prepared me to be a member when he saved me from death at my birth, when I was still a little girl, and when He instilled in my mind the right questions and, especially, the right spirit. I longed for a prophet, I prayed using my own words, and I needed more knowledge. It wasn't I who was looking for these things; it was the Spirit of the Lord who touched my soul. President Brigham Young said:<br><br><i>When true doctrines are advanced, though they may be new to the hearers, yet the principles contained in them are perfectly natural and easy to be understood, so much so that the hearers often imagine that they had always known them. This arises from the influence of the Spirit of Truth upon the spirit of intelligence that is within each person.</i>[<i>JD</i>9:254]<br><br>Dear brothers and sisters, I know that the Church is true, that President Hinckley is a prophet of God here on earth to guide and to direct us. I know that we are the children of a loving Heavenly Father. I know that if I am faithful and worthy, I will always receive the blessings of which I am in need. Finally, as I have read in one of those e-mails that bounce from computer to computer, originating from you don't know where: "May you have enough happiness to make you sweet, enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to keep you human, enough hope to bring you joy."<br><br>I say this in the name of our Savior, our older brother Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cinzia Donatelli Noble was chair of the BYU Department of French and Italian when this devotional address was given on 9 May 2000.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>er, Athletic Fervor - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
When the Savior appeared to the Nephites on this continent, He told them:<br><br><i>Those things which were of old time, which were under the law, in me are all fulfilled.</i><br><br><i>Old things are done away, and all things have become new.</i><br><br><i>Therefore I would that ye should be perfect even as I, or your Father who is in heaven is perfect.</i>[3 Nephi 12:46–48]<br><br>Later, emphasizing the importance of His theme, the Savior asked, "What manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am" (3 Nephi 27:27).<br><br>The Savior's advent did away with the outward appearances of the law and established a new law of a broken heart and contrite spirit. It is within the context of a broken heart and contrite spirit that I will address the Savior's question "What manner of men ought ye to be?" as it applies to our culture's preoccupation with athletics. Since I have been associated with BYU athletics for 36 years, much of what I will say comes as a result of my observation at BYU.<br><br>A sportswriter asked Val Hale, then BYU sports information director and now athletic director: "Does God care if BYU wins football games?" I've given this question a good deal of thought in the broader arena of all sports, but the question remains unanswered.<br><br>Indicative of some national interest in the question is the fact that this query was presented to President Gordon B. Hinckley by a member of the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., in March of this year. In a question-and-answer session, he was asked, "If you'll forgive the levity, someone here really wants to know whether God has forgotten about BYU football."<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley answered, "That comes from an alumnus. I don't know. I hope not." (From<i>Deseret News</i>transcript of Q&amp;amp;A after President Gordon B. Hinckley's 8 March 2000 speech at the National Press Club, Washington, D.C.) The president of the Church, in his good wisdom, refused to be suckered into a direct response.<br><br>You have heard the expression "Fools rush in where angels fear to tread" (Alexander Pope,<i>An Essay on Criticism</i>[1711], pt. III, l. 66). I suspect it is foolhardy to attempt to answer the question; nevertheless, I will express my feelings by sharing some events and personal experiences. I address these comments to all who have a loyal interest in a winning athletic program at BYU.<br><br>Because we are a religious institution yet nevertheless take winning seriously, do the media assume there is a godly interest in our performance or do they delight in needling us when we lose? Whether the Lord cares or not is unknown, but one thing is clear: athletics has become a religion. Some sports at BYU have been raised by fans to the level of idol worship. In the minds of these fans a winning program is more important than the principles upon which this institution was founded.<br><br>Although the audience at the National Press Club laughed about the question addressed to President Hinckley, to many BYU alumni and fans it is no laughing matter. In fact, so intense is the interest in athletics in general that many American families are hoping their sons and daughters will find the legendary pot of gold as professional athletes. It is for this reason I have entitled my presentation "Gold Fever, Athletic Fervor."<br><br>Today gold fever persists in the belief that almost every child can be raised to earn more than was ever dug out of the gold mines simply by signing a contract in a professional sport. Youth are ferried to sports camps throughout the summer--some hundreds, even thousands of miles apart. Moms run their kids from morning till night from one athletic activity to another. Parents fuss over their children's activities at these camps as if they were more critical to the children's future success than learning English, history, math, or even attending church.<br><br>I was fascinated recently when BYU golf coach Bruce Brockbank told me of calls from parents about his golf camps. One parent complained that her son does<i>not</i>shag golf balls. Coach Brockbank told her that kids at his camp<i>do</i>shag balls. Another parent called to complain that her son didn't walk the golf course; he rode the course in a golf cart. Funny, I thought golf pros walked the course.<br><br>At the 1996 BYU Annual University Conference, President Bateman quoted President Faust:<br><br><i>"Brigham Young University is a continuing experiment in whether a university whose board of trustees comprises prophets, seers, and revelators can remain a first-class university and not become secularized."</i><br><br>In response to this, President Bateman's thoughts were:<br><br><i>"Of course the test will be successful! The sacred and the secular have coexisted on this campus for more than 120 years. The merging of the two parts will not only continue but will improve."</i><br><br>President Bateman then cautioned:<br><br><i>The divine mission of BYU is always at risk. The experiment will succeed only as long as the vast majority of the BYU community believes in and is committed to the university's divine mission.</i>[Merrill J. Bateman, "The Mission of Brigham Young University," in<i>Addresses Delivered at the 1996 Annual University Conference,</i>Brigham Young University, August 26–27, 1996, 10]<br><br>I will not focus my remarks on academics at the university. My focus will be athletics at BYU. I echo President Bateman's comment that the divine mission of BYU is always at risk, and I add that this is especially so in athletics.<br><br>Why do I say this? Let me paraphrase President Bateman's words: Athletic programs will succeed as long as coaches, a majority of team members, and supporters are committed to the dual nature of BYU's mission. Coaches must not be so single-minded that they forget the sacred and spiritual nature of their endeavors. In recent years there have been some athletes who<i>have not</i>been committed to the dual nature of BYU's mission.<br><br>Sometimes coaches are convinced that one or two athletes are indispensable to their team's success. Can we be justified in overlooking flagrant violations of BYU standards in order to protect such athletes? If so, we make a mockery of the values that underpin the university.<br><br>Perhaps this can be put in perspective by an event that took place in 1954. BYU's basketball team was 3-11 in the early season and going nowhere. Our most outstanding player was dismissed from school. When this athlete left the team, attitudes changed, discipline was restored, and another player, Herschel "Bones" Pederson, replaced him. The season was turned around: the team finished second in the conference with a 10-4 record. How could this be? Interestingly, "Bones" was one of those, rare for his day, returned missionaries.<br><br>It is clear to me that it is appropriate at times to dismiss athletes who will not abide BYU's standards, notwithstanding the condemnation of the press. Upholding the Honor Code will not result in unsuccessful seasons. I remember when Coach Clarence Robison dismissed an All-American from our track team. This athlete's removal from school happened because a coach was committed to BYU standards. Coach Robison asked the young man to leave because his behavior clearly demonstrated he would not change.<br><br>President Hinckley wrote:<br><br><i>The problem with most of us is that we are afraid to stand up for what we believe, to be witnesses for what is true and right. We want to do the right thing, but we are troubled by fears.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley,<i>Standing for Something</i>[New York: Times Books, 2000], 168]<br><br>For coaches, this fear is the fear of losing.<br><br>President Faust has written that too many people expend precious energy protesting rules. Some feel that since they did not make the rules they should not be restricted by them. Protesters often express the feeling that they need to be "free of all ... confining standards ..., unrestrained by government or law." Although President Faust was not specifically addressing the conduct set by the Honor Code at BYU, an appropriate parallel can be seen here. He expressed the belief that "young men can learn to express themselves better through excellence in the classroom or on the playing field" than in testing the rules to see what they can get away with. "For each of us, a transcendent blessing is available when we make the right moral choices." (From James E. Faust, "The Need for Balance in Our Lives,"<i>Ensign,</i>March 2000, 2.)<br><br>Because there are so many distractions pulling at students, it becomes increasingly important that we have athletes who are committed to the dual aims of education at BYU. It is too easy for a pocket of noncommitted athletes, along with those on the fringes of the university, to violate the Honor Code. And eventually the facts become public knowledge.<br><br>In January of 1980, at a banquet given for the football team, President Dallin H. Oaks referred to football as the bellwether sport for BYU athletics. Football along with other sports provides important public relations programs that have the potential to bring positive publicity to the university.<br><br>President Hinckley, speaking to the priesthood session of general conference last fall, said that BYU "athletic programs have ... brought honor to the university and the Church" (Gordon B. Hinckley, "Why We Do Some of the Things We Do,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1999, 53).<br><br>As I've watched our teams perform, I've been impressed with the excellent level of play and generally impressed with the conduct of our athletes. However, in recent years I have been increasingly distressed by the inappropriate behavior of fans.<br><br>This season I attended a BYU basketball game and was very disappointed to hear our fans in the student section yelling "That sucks!" when they disagreed with the call of an official. The officiating didn't upset me, but I was disappointed by the jeers of our students.<br><br>I remember playing at BYU when then President Ernest L. Wilkinson took the mike and asked fans not to boo officials. This seems almost laughable today. Who in his right mind would challenge a crowd's behavior? Over the years the behavior of BYU fans has deteriorated and now mimics the behavior seen in arenas around the country--although it is a bit less obscene.<br><br>Sportswriter and columnist Lee Benson wrote:<br><br><i>Say what you want collectively about Mormons, but--and I think I speak here for the vast majority--we tend to reserve our anger for basketball.</i><br><br><i>We do not shine playing basketball, in church leagues especially, and even watching it we are capable of a fairly decent Latrell Sprewell imitation.</i>[Lee Benson, "Bush at BJU? LDS Only Get Mad in Hoops,"<i>Deseret News,</i>5 March 2000, B1]<br><br>Everyone is concerned about the behavior of athletes. Sportswriters rarely write about fan behavior, although they did write about a BYU fan who tackled the Ute cheerleader in last fall's football game. We should not only ask our coaches and athletes "What manner of men ought ye to be?" (3 Nephi 27:27); we should ask the same of our fans, both the students and the general public.<br><br>Athletic administrators on other campuses are also concerned with the increase in unruly crowd behavior. For example, Vern Keerbs, a superintendent in Corning, Iowa, said he was "tired of mean-spirited cheers and parents who yell, berate and challenge referees Dennis Rodman–style." The school board instituted a two-strikes-you're-out policy. Offenders would be barred from further attendance at school functions. "Every year [Vern Keerbs] has watched the crowds get a little ruder and heard more curses and negative remarks. [He] puts much of the blame on professional and college athletics. People see poor sportsmanship on television and bring it home." (From Rainbow Rowell of the<i>Omaha World-Herald,</i>"Sportsmanship Counts in Corning, Iowa," reprinted in<i>NCAA News</i>34, no. 16 [21 April 1997]: 4.)<br><br>Do BYU fans lose something as a result of poor sportsmanship? Yes! As we embrace the behavior of the secular world, we lose our distinctiveness regarding the sacred. More important, we individually lose the companionship of the Holy Spirit. We would do well to follow the counsel given by Steve Young at the recent women's conference:<br><br><i>If you aren't reminded you're a Latter-day Saint by the secular world at least three times a day, you should be worried. My suggestion is to embrace our peculiarity. I think we should relish being different.</i>[Steve Young, quoted in Jeffrey P. Haney, "Embrace Our Peculiarity,"<i>Deseret News,</i>28 April 2000, B1]<br><br>I believe this peculiarity should be evidenced in the sportsmanship of coaches, athletes, and fans.<br><br>I would like to illustrate this association with the Holy Spirit by using the example of Boyd Jarman, a former BYU basketball player who is now an LDS patriarch. He recently described his experience as a fan. He told me he went to basketball games, yelled at the officials, and got mad at them, the coach, and players. He then talked about trying to give a patriarchal blessing. There was no inspiration, because the Spirit would not come to a man who had been temporarily angry. He realized that because of the current atmosphere he had to either stop going to basketball games, change his attitude and behavior, or stop giving patriarchal blessings. He stopped going to the games. I don't believe it is necessary to stop attending games, but we must control our appetites and passions.<br><br>To demonstrate that athletic programs are at risk as we try to mesh the sacred and secular, let me review history. Years ago there were great All-Church Tournaments. They are no more. What happened? I was athletic director of Zone 22, which included much of Utah County. Every ward had a team. Recruiting by ward coaches became commonplace. Stake champions came to the zone tournament, and the tournament winners went to Salt Lake City for the big--and I mean big--All-Church Tournament. The last year the tournament was held we played the zone championship game in the Pleasant Grove High School gym. Prior to the tournament we emphasized sportsmanship and noted profanity would not be tolerated. During the championship game one of the players ripped off a loud oath, and it wasn't the oath of allegiance to the flag. I immediately forfeited the game to the other team.<br><br>The nonoffending team played in the televised championship game in the All-Church Tournament. I'm told the behavior was so inappropriate that if the game hadn't been on TV, it would have been stopped. That was the end of All-Church Tournaments. Over time it became apparent that these athletic programs provided physical activities but did little to foster Christlike behavior.<br><br>Although the Church's support of programs such as the All-Church Tournament changes, the basic tenets and doctrines of the Church are unchanging. President Gordon B. Hinckley noted that the Church's primary concern is with the worship of Jesus Christ and testifying of His reality. He went on to say that the Church does many things that on the surface do not appear to be associated with this overriding pattern. However, he said, some of these business interests directly serve the needs of the Church. (See Hinckley, "Why We Do," 52–53.) Some of the enterprises and programs of the Church clearly change as the meshing of the sacred and secular are evaluated.<br><br>Several changes come to my mind. The Church gave away the great hospitals it owned in many cities in Utah. The recent sale of ZCMI is further evidence of ongoing changes. BYU joined the national trend of downsizing men's athletic programs by dropping wrestling and men's gymnastics. All of this demonstrates that enterprises and programs can be viewed as experiments. They are subject to change as sacred and secular are in contact.<br><br>President Hinckley said:<br><br><i>We shall continue to support BYU. ... We shall keep these ... flagships testifying to the great and earnest commitment of this Church to education, both ecclesiastical and secular, and while doing so prove to the world that excellent secular learning can be gained in an environment of religious faith.</i>[Hinckley, "Why We Do," 53]<br><br>If we are to continue to merit the support of the board of trustees, it is our responsibility to hire coaches, field teams, and admit fans who are worthy of the title "flagship." There cannot be a great chasm between theory, practice, and reality.<br><br>It is implicit that administrative officials and admission officers, as well as coaches, athletes, students, and all supporters, not lose sight of the divine mission of BYU. No conference championship, no individual or team NCAA title, no bowl game is worth forfeiting the integrity, the goals, and the ideals of this institution. This would indeed be a hollow victory.<br><br>Elder Dallin H. Oaks wrote:<br><br><i>Jesus taught his disciples that their ways should be different from the ways of the world. "Ye are the salt of the earth," he told them. "Ye are the light of the world." (Matt. 5:13–14.) Again and again he taught that his followers should be different.</i>[<i>The Lord's Way</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1991), 8–9]<br><br>But are we different? Are we the salt of the earth or just salty!<br><br>At this point I'd like to address the appropriate use of language. Profane language, language with sexual innuendoes, and demeaning language should not characterize those who represent BYU. The Savior told His disciples:<br><br><i>Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man....</i><br><br><i>But those things which proceed out of the mouth come ... from the heart; and they defile the man.</i>[Matthew 15:11, 18]<br><br>I assume part of my duties at BYU include directing men in the paths of righteousness. I assume it is my responsibility to counsel individually with the athlete who profanes. I have told my team that profanity and vulgarity is totally unacceptable and will not be tolerated.<br><br>Elder Robert S. Wood of the Seventy noted in October general conference:<br><br><i>Our words and external expressions are not neutral, for they reflect both who we are and shape who we are becoming....</i><br><br><i>What we say and how we present ourselves not only betray our inner person but also mold that person, those around us, and finally our whole society. Every day each of us is ... called ... to sanctify ourselves and edify others.</i>[Robert S. Wood, "The Tongue of Angels,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1999, 83–84]<br><br>In his general epistle, James detailed the control of language and conversation. Improperly employed, the tongue "defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature" (James 3:6). How, he asks, can blessings and curses proceed out of the same mouth? (See James 3:10.)<br><br>Paul in his letter to the Corinthian Saints wrote, "Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners" (1 Corinthians 15:33).<br><br>What would we think if one of our athletic teams were known as the trash-talking champion in the conference? I believe most of us would be disappointed; some might be appalled.<br><br>Regrettably far too many high school players are in programs where profanity is a major way of communicating. When these young men come to BYU, they should find an atmosphere devoid of profane language.<br><br>If there is a scripture that should serve as a guideline for our behavior at BYU, it is the scripture "What manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am." "What we say and how we act will create an atmosphere welcoming or hostile to the Holy Ghost" (Wood, "The Tongue of Angels," 83). We must be spiritual, and at the same time we must not be lily-livered blobs of human flesh. We must become hardened from the physical rigors of a disciplined program that combines the secular and the spiritual. This gives to our athletes the strength of the arm of flesh combined with the ennobling power of spiritual strength and courage. We are too inclined to rely on the arm of flesh and act like the profane world. The fact is, we must work as hard as other men to develop physical strength. Indeed, we would do well to develop and look like the idealized drawings of Arnold Friberg and Tom Lovell.<br><br>Our athletes cannot be like the athlete who years ago told me he had served a mission and therefore didn't have to work as hard as we were working. The Lord would bless him. I need not tell you about his success or lack thereof. The last time I saw him he was kicking rocks down the road.<br><br>We must follow Brigham Young's example. He prayed, asking for the Lord to bless his endeavors, and then worked as if success was dependent on his own efforts.<br><br>I have come to envision an athletic program like unto Helaman's stripling warriors: an army of young men and women of all faiths characterized by "truth and soberness" who not only want to be great athletes but who are committed to keeping God's commandments (Alma 53:21). Helaman called them his sons, and they called him Father (see Alma 56:46). Yes, I envision coaches who would be to athletes like a second father. Am I caught up in a great fantasy? I don't think so.<br><br>Fikre Wondafrash is the type of nonmember I'm talking about. He was born in Ethiopia, a Greek Orthodox, and a member of the same tribe as Emperor Haile Selassie, descendant of Queen Bathsheba and King David. Fikre's mother moved to Belgrade, Yugoslavia, where she worked as an embassy cook. I learned of his athletic ability and contacted him. After great difficulties, he left Yugoslavia and with his fascinating story arrived at BYU. Time does not permit a greater account about this humble servant of God, but our youth would do well to emulate this young man who traces his origins to King David.<br><br>Again I ask the question "Does God care about BYU winning and losing?" The short answer is: I don't know that the Lord cares about us winning or losing, but He does care about the manner in which we conduct ourselves while winning or losing. Unequivocally He cares how athletes on the field and fans in the stands treat and influence each other. Although this fact is very important, I also believe there is another fundamental issue involved in "Does God care?"<br><br>The importance of the question can be seen if we ask: Does the Lord care about His church? Does the Lord care about BYU? Does the Lord care if BYU students live their Honor Code commitments? Does the Lord care if BYU alumni live and maintain the standards fostered at BYU? It seems to me that the answer is obvious.<br><br>Lest we be puffed up in our pride, I say the Lord is not indifferent to the efforts of other teams. In fact, among our fiercest competitors are members and nonmembers like Fikre. Remember the Lord has said that even the hair of our head is numbered and we do not lose a hair from our head nor does a sparrow fall from the sky without His knowledge (see Luke 12:6–7). Having said that, it cannot be overemphasized that God cares about all His children. He will and does bless athletes on both sides of the playing fields and courts.<br><br>At BYU we claim the fullness of the gospel. In claiming the fullness of the gospel, we claim a greater understanding of His laws. If we claim greater understanding, then we are held to a higher standard of conduct and behavior.<br><br>Further, just because some high government official claims there is no ruling legal authority, vulgar or boorish behavior is not justified. And, quite to the contrary, there<i>is</i>a higher ruling authority. It is the moral code found in the Ten Commandments and in the teachings of the prophets.<br><br>When I first enrolled at BYU in 1952, if a prospective student had the body temperature of a hibernating lizard, he was admitted. As I recall, only two members of the basketball team I played with for four years had served missions. Since that time more and more student athletes are serving missions. We have 55 athletes on our track team. Forty-four are returned missionaries, and seven are awaiting mission calls. Three are nonmembers. Isn't it reasonable to expect exemplary behavior from these athletes? I happen to think so. These men have spent two years in the world preaching of Jesus Christ. It is not unreasonable to expect them to be a positive influence on their teammates. It is not unreasonable to expect them to exert a leadership that lifts the behavior of all who are on the team. I know they can, and as coaches we ought to expect that they will assume this role.<br><br>It is said that where much is given, much is expected. There is no question in my mind that the Lord expects BYU athletes to live up to the principles of the Honor Code that they have signed. And He expects the coaches to exemplify these standards.<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley said:<br><br><i>There is great loneliness in leadership. This is so because we have to live with ourselves even if it means abandoning other relationships. ... We have to stand for the values and beliefs that we have embraced, adopted, and woven into our characters.</i><br><br><i>It was ever thus. The price of leadership is loneliness. The price of adherence to conscience is loneliness. The price of adherence to principle is loneliness.</i>[Hinckley,<i>Standing for Something,</i>168–69]<br><br>A coach at BYU is placed in a unique position. Although he is hired to coach, he is also required to support the Honor Code. In the latter role he becomes a spiritual watchman, or the watchman on the tower. The watchmen referred to in the scriptures watch over the Church. Coaches have been given a more definitive role. They are to watch over the small group of athletes they have recruited. They are to encourage and insist on appropriate behavior.<br><br>When things are not right, coaches have a duty to correct the problem. It matters not what the athlete's religious preference is. We don't teach doctrine to our teams, but we have a responsibility to hold all team members to the standard of behavior expected at BYU. If we do this, have we infringed on the teaching they received in their homes? Absolutely not! The parents of all BYU athletes expect that their children will not fall among thieves and cutthroats but will find a safe harbor at BYU.<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball said:<br><br><i>BYU exists to build character and faith. This institution [BYU] has no justification for its existence unless it builds character, creates and develops faith, and makes men and women of strength and courage, fortitude, and service. ... This institution has been established by a prophet of God for a very specific purpose: to combine spiritual and moral values and secular education.</i>[<i>TSWK,</i>395]<br><br>It is my view that athletics can and must foster the building of character, create and develop faith, and build men and women imbued with spiritual strength and courage. This is the role athletics at BYU can and does play. That the behavior of BYU fans, coaches, and athletes<i>can</i>become more Christlike is my testimony, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Willard M. Hirschi was the men's head track coach at Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 16 May 2000.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<i>At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?</i><br><br><i>And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,</i><br><br><i>And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</i><br><br><i>Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</i><br><br><i>And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . It is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.</i>[Matthew 18:1–5, 14]<br><br>The resurrected Savior also showed his great love for little children when He ministered to the Nephites:<br><br><i>He took their little children, one by one, and blessed them, and prayed unto the Father for them. . . .</i><br><br><i>And he spake unto the multitude, and said unto them: Behold your little ones.</i><br><br><i>And as they looked to behold they cast their eyes towards heaven, and they saw the heavens open, and they saw angels descending out of heaven as it were in the midst of fire; and they came down and encircled those little ones about, and they were encircled about with fire; and the angels did minister unto them.</i>[3 Nephi 17:21, 23–24]<br><br>And here is what our current prophet, Gordon B. Hinckley, has said about children:<br><br><i>Parents have not just a responsibility but a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness, to teach them to love and serve one another, to observe the commandments of God, and to be law-abiding citizens where they live. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . If our children are really our greatest treasures, it stands to reason that they deserve our greatest attention. . . .</i><br><br><i>Children are of far greater value than any kind of material wealth.</i>[<i>Standing for Something</i>(New York: Times Books, 2000), 146, 152–53]<br><br>We could fill this devotional hour with counsel from our Church leaders on our responsibilities toward the children in our lives. The messages in the scriptures and from modern-day prophets are consistent and clear. Children are to be highly valued and taught and protected. And, interestingly enough, in turn we need to develop some of their characteristics to enter the kingdom of heaven.<br><br>I have had the opportunity of spending many hours in the company of children in both school and church settings. It is a blessing to be in their company. I learned early in my teaching career the value of writing down what I was learning from my young students. They can be great teachers.<br><br>Today I will share a few experiences that illustrate lessons we can and cannot learn from children and also what caring adults need to do to provide a lifeline for children who are born into challenging families.<br><br>Let's start with the lessons children do not teach well. All of you who have daily contact with children will recognize some of these from the lighter side.<br><h2><b>Lessons We Cannot Learn from Children</b></h2><br>Young children say what they think without malice aforethought. A colleague who is a school media specialist in Las Vegas was doing a book-share with a kindergarten class about a man who was given three magic wishes.<br><br>When she paused to ask "If you had a magic wish, what would you wish for?" one wiggly five-year-old quickly responded, "I wish you'd stop talking so we could check out our library books."<br><br>Real danger areas with children are appearance and age:<br><br>"Miss Tuttle, do you think you look nice with your hair like that?"<br><br>"Mrs. Smith, why do you have black hairs on your lip? They look like a moustache."<br><br>And then there is the popular favorite: "Teacher, you look even older than my grandma."<br><br>Younger children also have their own perspective of time-honored proverbs. As adults we say:<br><br>--Better be safe than sorry.<br>--Never bite the hand that feeds you.<br>--You can't teach an old dog new tricks.<br>--A penny saved is a penny earned.<br>--If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.<br>--Laugh and the world laughs with you. Cry and you cry alone.<br><br>First graders say:<br><br>--Better be safe than punch a fifth grader.<br>--Never bite the hand that looks dirty.<br>--You can't teach an old dog new math.<br>--A penny saved is not much.<br>--If at first you don't succeed, get new batteries.<br>--Laugh and the world laughs with you. Cry and you have to blow your nose.<br><br>At a university you are required to take many exams. But test-taking is another example of a skill we cannot learn from children--at least not from this student in the Jordan School District. [A graphic of a math test was shown.]<br><br>Notice this child starts out with confidence on this math sheet. For those of you who find it difficult to read his handwriting, I'll read some of the responses for you. One of them says, "Stumped." Here's another: "Is it time to go home yet?" One of them says, "Uh-oh." My favorite is the last one: "Is there a teacher in the house?"<br><br>Children are great learners, but it takes time for them to grasp some gospel concepts.<br><br>[A video clip was shown.]<br><br>I appreciate T. C. Christensen for giving me permission to show those video clips from<i>Out of the Mouths of Babes.</i><br><h2><b>Lessons We Can Learn from Children</b></h2><br>Children can teach us humility and trust. First graders produce a high volume of paperwork. Miss Tranter enlisted some helpers to pass papers back. She told her helpers if they licked their thumb, they could pass the papers out faster. She looked back some minutes later to see one little girl dutifully following her directions by licking the thumb of one hand but passing the papers with the other hand.<br><br>That incident is both humorous and touching. What a responsibility it is to give directions to children, most of whom will try faithfully to do as they've been asked.<br><br>Every family has examples of the teachableness of children. My brother, Lynn, was teaching his son to bat a ball. He was little and was having trouble holding the bat tip up. Lynn kept saying, "Choke up and you can hit it." Despite his repeated counsel, his son did not slide his hands closer to the middle of the bat. When Lynn approached the batter to show him where to put his hands, he realized each time he called "choke up," his son was dutifully trying to choke and making gagging sounds.<br><br>Children can teach us perseverance. Children know that anything worth doing is worth doing poorly. They are not very skilled at most of the things they do, but they keep trying: tying shoes, riding bikes, roller-skating, reading, helping in the kitchen.<br><br>As adults we often develop a different attitude. If we can't do it well, too often we don't want to do it at all. We are less likely to participate in activities we are not good at. We become less and less willing to do that which is difficult for us, especially if someone else is watching our poor performance.<br><br>Children can teach us appreciation for little things. Children appreciate simple things such as our laughing at their jokes, calling them by name in church, and listening to their stories. They like a handshake, a pat on the back, a letter or card recognizing their achievements, their talk, or their baptism. Children want to save those notes and cards forever. If all the mail you ever got to open was a yearly birthday card from Grandma and the family mail addressed to Occupant, you would save the personal notes in your desk at school for a long time, too. All adults should attend a week of show-and-tell in the youngest grades. They would quickly see how their cards and notes of encouragement are especially valued by children.<br><br>Several weeks ago I attended meetings near Bryce Canyon and went for a walk in the forest with a few colleagues at the end of the day. We saw deer, wildflowers, and many kinds of trees. In a short time we covered a lot of ground because we didn't keep stopping to pick up rocks or look closely at a bug or select from a variety of walking sticks along the trail. Walking with a child in the mountains or in the park is a different and richer experience than walking with adults because of the detail children notice and appreciate.<br><br>Children can teach us about seamless perspective. They don't separate church from the rest of their life as easily as adults do. While observing a math lesson in the first grade, the student teacher held up a giant penny and said, "This is an important American president. Do you know which president is on the penny?"<br><br>Her first graders responded, "Abraham Lincoln."<br><br>"That is correct." She turned the penny and said, "On the back of the penny is a very important building that is a tribute to President Lincoln."<br><br>The children asked, "Is it the log cabin where Lincoln was born?"<br><br>The student teacher said, "That's a good guess, but this is a very formal building. It is white and it has big pillars and it was built in Washington, D.C., to honor President Lincoln."<br><br>One little girl called out, "That is the building where President Lincoln was resurrected."<br><br>When I shared that incident with a colleague, she related a similar experience:<br><br>"Do you know whose head is engraved on the penny?"<br><br>There was almost a unanimous choral response: "Gordon B. Hinckley."<br><br>The student teacher carefully explained the differences between Church presidents and national presidents and then confidently held up the nickel. She got another choral response of "Spencer W. Kimball."<br><br>In each general conference we are counseled to be sure the gospel is reflected in our lives daily--at home, at school, and in our work as well as in our Church responsibilities.<br><br>Children see the gospel with an elegant simplicity that teaches and builds testimony. Primary leaders through the years have been inspired to design programs and select music that continue to help us as adults.<br><br>I am touched by the number of CTR rings that are worn well after the Primary years. They continue to remind to "choose the right."<br><br>Students in my local elementary school coach each other with WWJD: What would Jesus do? That question is not an oversimplification. It is always a good question for adults as well as children to ask when faced with difficult decisions.<br><br>The time we spend in the company of children can make us better people.<br><br>I often read this poem by Bertha Klienman at our student teacher orientation:<br><br><i>If I would travel the holy land</i><br><i>I need not travel far</i><br><i>For the kingdom borders near at hand</i><br><i>Where the feet of the children are.</i><br><br>Scientists concur with prophets and poets that children influence us for good. Let me quote the psychologist Tom Lovett:<br><br><i>Because teachers are with youngsters and can witness their insights and their revelations, teachers are relatively sane, non-violent and honest. Most of the people I know who work day to day with children do not rape, pillage, plunder or get involved in extortion plots. Perhaps the reason they don't engage in such high powered wrong doing is that they are too tired from teaching. . . . But I would contend that the primary reason that teachers are adequately socialized is that their children have helped them. Their pupils have kept them honest by challenging some of their values and by providing them with fresh strategies for viewing the environment.</i>[Bonnie Benard,<i>Fostering Resilience in Children,</i>ERIC Digest, EDO-PS-95-9, August 1995, ERIC Clearinghouse on Elementary and Early Childhood Education, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Children's Research Center, Champaign, Illinois]<br><br>Now let us go from lessons to lifelines. Years ago, while waterskiing with a friend, Bruce, we found ourselves in trouble as a thunderstorm with high winds moved over the lake so quickly that we had no time to seek the shore. A large wave broke over the motor, and the boat slid backwards into the water. Our swamped boat continued to float just under the surface with only the windshield visible above water. We held onto the side of the submerged boat as we waved for help to other boaters making their way to shore in the storm. As luck would have it, the first boat to arrive held three young boys--so young I was surprised to see them navigating a boat on their own. They moved in as close as they could and immediately shut off their motor. This was a mistake. Again and again they attempted to throw us a rope, but they were not strong enough and the wind prevailed. When they couldn't restart their motor, they, too, were in trouble. I remember saying as I shivered in the water, "I hope those kids don't drown because they stopped to help us." Just a few minutes later two larger boats appeared, and we were encouraged when we saw they both had adult occupants. About the same time, the wind began to subside almost as quickly as it had begun. One man threw a towline to the boys, called out a few instructions, and headed for the dock. As they were being towed, the boys whooped and hollered--obviously enjoying the adventure more than we were.<br><br>A man in the other boat threw Bruce a line. He said he'd seen our boat go under and had immediately altered his course to help us. Gratefully we collected the floating items from our boat and passed them to our rescuers. A short time later we were headed to shore in their boat--towing a windshield attached to a submerged boat--and definitely not whooping.<br><br>I think of that ill-fated trip when I see children in trouble, particularly those riding the waves in troubled homes. I know the importance of a line thrown to a child by a concerned adult inside or outside the family circle.<br><br>There is such a need for more of these lifelines. Some children have families very different from those typically profiled in the<i>Friend</i>or the<i>Ensign.</i>They live in conditions that are far from the nurturing, safe environment we try to provide for our children.<br><br>Marion Edelman penned the following:<br><br><i>Loving God,</i><br><i>We pray for children</i><br><i>who put chocolate fingers everywhere,</i><br><i>who sneak Popsicles before supper,</i><br><i>who can never find their shoes.</i><br><br><i>And we pray for those</i><br><i>who stare at photographers behind barbed wire,</i><br><i>who can't bound down the street in a new pair of sneakers,</i><br><i>who are born in places we wouldn't be caught dead.</i><br><br><i>We pray for children</i><br><i>who bring us sticky kisses and fistfuls of dandelions,</i><br><i>who hug us in a hurry and forget lunch money,</i><br><i>who cover themselves in Band-Aids and sing off-key.</i><br><br><i>And we pray for those</i><br><i>Who never get dessert,</i><br><i>Who can't find any bread,</i><br><i>Who don't have any rooms to clean up.</i><br><br><i>We pray for children</i><br><i>Who spend all their allowances before Tuesday,</i><br><i>Who pick at their food,</i><br><i>Who squirm in church and synagogue.</i><br><br><i>And we pray for those</i><br><i>whose nightmares come in the daytime,</i><br><i>who will eat anything,</i><br><i>who go to bed hungry and cry themselves to sleep.</i><br><br><i>We pray for those</i><br><i>who want to be carried and for those who must,</i><br><i>For those</i><br><i>we never give up on</i><br><i>and for those who don't get a second chance.</i><br><br><i>For those</i><br><i>we smother with love,</i><br><i>and for those tho will grab the hand of anybody kind enough to offer it.</i><br>[Marion Wright Edelman, "Loving God," Children's Defense Fund]<br><br>Some children live in homes with neglect, alcoholism, and abuse or with family members in trouble with the law.<br><br>Some children live without the supervision of an adult for long periods of time each day.<br><br>Some children simply live in homes where parents don't know enough about how to be good parents.<br><br>All children receive many incorrect messages from media in the 4,000 hours of TV they watch before starting elementary school (U.S. Department of Education). In contrast, approximately 800 hours are spent in Primary. In most families in America, only sleep consumes more of a child's time than watching TV.<br><br>I recently listened to presentations by Ronald Slaby and James Barbarino, both of whom study youth violence in America. They reported there is increasing aggressive behavior in children across the nation. A desensitization to violence is evidenced in the popularity of professional wrestling and other shows with violent content. Young boys become fascinated with and mimic what they see on TV, on the playgrounds, and in the backyard (Learning and the Brain Conference [Boston: Public Information Resources, Inc., April 2000]).<br><br>Our local Division of Family Services also reports an increase of child-against-child violence at younger and younger ages and an alarming increase of children accessing pornography on the Internet during unsupervised time. There are many children in need of rescue today. They are in our neighborhoods, our ward boundaries, our communities. Their rescuers will be caring adults like you.<br><br><i>Some longitudinal studies, several of which follow individuals over the course of a lifespan, have consistently documented that between half and two-thirds of children growing up in families with mentally ill, alcoholic, abusive or criminally involved parents or in poverty-stricken or war-torn communities do overcome the odds and turn a life trajectory of risk into one that manifests . . . resilience.</i>[Bonnie Bernard, "Fostering Resilience in Children," <i>ERIC Digest,</i> February 1992; seeericdigests.org/1996-2/fostering.html]<br><br>One of the three key factors in reversing the expected negative outcomes is the presence of at least one caring person. If that person was outside the family circle, he or she was most frequently a favorite teacher (see Bonnie Benard,<i>Fostering Resiliency in Kids: Protective Factors in the Family, School, and Community</i>[San Francisco: Far West Laboratory for Educational Research and Development, 1991]).<br><br>Most of us grew up with the phrase "every member a missionary." Missionary work is a shared responsibility, with full-time missionaries working in a complementary role with members of the Church, who have a call to be lifetime missionaries.<br><br>In the new edition of<i>Teaching, No Greater Call,</i>"every member a teacher" is stressed. This excellent resource not only gives ideas for home and visiting teaching but also offers strategies to mothers and fathers for family teaching, even advising how brothers and sisters and extended family can better teach the gospel in the family (see<i>Teaching, No Greater Call: A Resource Guide for Gospel Teaching</i>[Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1999]).<br><br>The resurrected Savior taught the Nephites: "Hold up your light that it may shine unto the world. Behold I am the light which ye shall hold up--that which ye have seen me do" (3 Nephi 18:24).<br><br>How do we as university students, neighbors, or ward members throw a line to a struggling child? I have a few suggestions. First, we look at the example we are currently providing to the children in our lives and we remove the negatives. Do we engage in teasing and belittling and put-down humor that sows seeds of anger in children? What model do we provide for our younger brothers and sisters? Do we correct children by reteaching, or do we embarrass them by pointing out their mistakes in the presence of other family members or friends? This is a strategy most of us wouldn't dream of using with co-workers but use without thinking with children. Where did we ever get the crazy idea that to help children do better we first have to make them feel worse?<br><br>We must increase the positives. Do we understand the powerful example we are to younger brothers and sisters? Do we value a note, a card, or some quiet time together? Remember, these are little people who pick up and save sticks and rocks from the driveway and consider them treasures. We must remind ourselves of how much is taught in our families when we think no one is watching.<br><br><i>When you thought I wasn't looking, I saw you hang my first</i><br><i>painting on the refrigerator, and I wanted to paint another one.</i><br><br><i>When you thought I wasn't looking, I saw you feed a stray cat,</i><br><i>and I thought it was good to be kind to animals.</i><br><br><i>When you thought I wasn't looking, I saw you make my favorite</i><br><i>cake just for me, and I knew that little things are special things.</i><br><br><i>When you thought I wasn't looking, I heard you say a prayer, and</i><br><i>I believed there is a God I could always talk to.</i><br><br><i>When you thought I wasn't looking, I felt you kiss me goodnight,</i><br><i>and I felt loved.</i><br><br><i>When you thought I wasn't looking, I saw tears come from your</i><br><i>eyes, and I learned that sometimes things hurt, but it's OK to cry.</i><br><br><i>When you thought I wasn't looking, I saw that you cared, and I</i><br><i>wanted to be everything that I could be.</i><br><br><i>When you thought I wasn't looking, I looked--and wanted to say</i><br><i>thanks for all the things I saw when you thought I wasn't looking.</i><br>[John W. Schlatter, "A Simple Gesture"]<br><br>So first we set a good example. Second, we must seek the Spirit to guide us. Who are the children in our families, neighborhoods, or wards who are caught in stormy situations? Can we identify a child today who needs another caring adult in his or her life? Most of us have little experience with children in crisis, and we'll need inspiration to know how to show our love and our willingness to help in the most effective ways.<br><br>Third, we must alter our course to help others. We must listen, show kindness, recognize their good efforts, and teach them by example. And we must widen our circle to include them whenever we can.<br><br>There are no quick fixes here. Like children, we'll need to persevere and celebrate small improvements. Children who have learned to be survivors may at first rebuff those who try to help them. I am reminded of Dale, a third grader I had in Las Vegas who took three days to accept a pair of shoelaces.<br><br>On the first day I told Dale I had an extra pair of laces he could have. I told him I had noticed his sneakers coming off when he kicked the ball or ran the bases.<br><br>"Nope," he replied. "I like my shoes this way."<br><br>One the second day he asked, "Teacher, do you still have those shoelaces?"<br><br>When I answered yes, he said, "Well, I still don't want them."<br><br>On the third day he said, "Teacher, I guess I'll take those shoelaces, but I don't really need them."<br><br>I said, "You're welcome to have them."<br><br>Fourth, we must enlist the help of others for a network of support. We should contact our bishop and request his help. He is in the best position to know what is already being done by others in the ward. Reaching out to families often requires the coordinated efforts of many ward members. We can do some social engineering with other children and teach them how to friendship children in need. Children in challenging family situations will keep riding the swells until someone alters their course to help or until they are lost. The lifelines can't all be thrown by agencies and school teachers.<br><br>As a parent, son, daughter, husband, wife, brother, sister, Church leader, classroom teacher, home teacher, visiting teacher, co-worker, neighbor, or friend, you have opportunities to reach children. Many of you have expended great effort to send sons and daughters or brothers and sisters on missions to foreign countries while at the same time younger priceless converts--the children within our ward boundaries and communities--are slipping away.<br><br>In his closing remarks in the October 1996 general conference, President Gordon B. Hinckley asked us to "resolve to seek those who need help, who are in desperate and difficult circumstances, and lift them in the spirit of love into the embrace of the Church" ("Reach with a Rescuing Hand,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1996, 85, 86).<br><br>I am grateful to live in a ward where I see families who have the gospel in their lives reach out to children in need. I know all children are precious to our Heavenly Father. As caring adults we have a responsibility to love, to reach out to, and to teach them as our Father in Heaven instructs us to do. I pray that each of us will reexamine our influence upon the children in our family circle and then reach out "with a rescuing hand" to children we know who do not live in the "light of his love" (see "Teach Me to Walk in the Light,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 304). I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Marie Tuttle was a BYU assistant professor of education and associate dean of the David O. McKay School of Education when this devotional address was given on 30 May 2000.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1> of Happiness - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It seems most appropriate that we should not pass this day without recognizing the remarkable gift given to us some 56 years ago today. It was on that day that Allied forces, some 175,000 strong, fought their way ashore in Normandy to begin the final phase of the worst worldwide conflict in recorded history. That generation of young men, living and born during the Great Depression, gave of themselves in a way we almost seem to have forgotten. These soldiers portrayed a selflessness so dramatic and powerful that journalist and author Tom Brokaw has represented them as "the greatest generation" in his biographical account of their lives. He wrote:<br><br><i>They left their ranches in Sully County, South Dakota, their jobs on the main street of Americus, Georgia, they gave up their place on the assembly lines in Detroit and in the ranks of Wall Street, they quit school or went from cap and gown directly into uniform.</i>[Tom Brokaw,<i>The Greatest Generation</i>(New York: Random House, 1998), xix]<br><br>Indeed, as the noted biographer/historian Stephen Ambrose wrote concerning these men who offered so much:<br><br><i>None of them wanted to be part of another war. They wanted to be throwing baseballs, not hand grenades, shooting .22s at rabbits, not M-1s at other young men. But when the test came, when freedom had to be fought for or abandoned, they fought. They were soldiers of democracy. They were the men of D-Day, and to them we owe our freedom.</i>[Stephen E. Ambrose,<i>D-Day, June 6, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World War II</i>(New York: Simon and Schuster, 1994), 26]<br><br>And so we pause today to honor those of another generation, those who gave their service and even their lives so that we might have our generation and be privileged to worship God in deed as well as in our hearts.<br><br>That great war, as have others, broke upon the world as a result of man's propensity for greed, lust for power, and absolute disregard for the lives and happiness of others.<br><br>Elder W. Eugene Hansen of the Presidency of the Seventy noted:<br><br><i>From the beginning of recorded history, mankind has been constantly searching for happiness. I believe it's fair to say that most of us are influenced greatly in our daily lives by what we perceive will result in happiness or joy for ourselves, as well as for others.</i>[W. Eugene Hansen, "The Search for Happiness,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1993, 81]<br><br>And the Prophet Joseph Smith stated:<br><br><i>Happiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it; and this path is virtue, uprightness, faithfulness, holiness, and keeping all the commandments of God.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>255–56]<br><br>This seems to be such a simple recipe, yet men and women, young and old, in and out of the gospel kingdom, appear to devote much of their time and energy toward obtaining this goal--seeking, always seeking, and seemingly never finding that grail of their quest.<br><br>As I have considered the paths leading so many to what was thought to bring happiness, I have come to realize that many, if not most, have simply been pursuing the wrong thing. Often the quest has been a relentless search, not for happiness, as they intend, but for a lesser state, even that of pleasure. For happiness is near unto joy and often far from pleasure. Though elements of pleasure may be and often are included as important components, these two experiences, pleasure and happiness, are neither synonyms nor even essential components of the other.<br><br>I am reminded of the experience of a young friend. He played a major role on his high school basketball team, a team that after a long season won the state basketball championship. After the celebrating, after the congratulations, he lay talking in the quiet of the night in his parents' room.<br><br>He said, "You know, it just doesn't get any better than this."<br><br>To which his wise father replied, "That is not true. Just wait until you have the opportunity to serve a mission."<br><br>Now, recently returned from two years of service in the mission field, he understands what his father meant. He has been able to separate the pleasure of winning an important athletic event from the happiness that attends significant service in the Lord's kingdom. Both events were worthwhile and justified the use of his time and energy. Both required diligence, commitment, skill, and personal sacrifice, but the final result of one was mostly pleasure and the result of the other was happiness.<br><br>Unfortunately, even knowing that these two are not equivalent outcomes of our time or effort, we sometimes--if not consciously, at least subconsciously--assume that happiness can be the result of increasing pleasures. Or we may assume and therefore act as if there is some form of progression that leads from pleasure to more pleasure to even greater pleasure with the final outcome ultimately being happiness. This is not the path described by the Prophet Joseph.<br><br>In a small book entitled<i>Tuesdays with Morrie,</i>the author, Mitch Albom, recounts his experience as he visited with a former college professor, Morrie Schwartz, who was dying from ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease. The book recounts a series of Tuesday visits as Morrie learns to deal with a disease that slowly but surely leads from increasing incapacitation to the death of the patient. Morrie reminded his friend:<br><br><i>So many people walk around with a meaningless life. They seem half-asleep, even when they're busy doing things they think are important. This is because they're chasing the wrong things. The way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning.</i>[Mitch Albom,<i>Tuesdays with Morrie</i>(New York: Doubleday, 1997), 43]<br><br>Surely the enjoyment of pleasure may be the result of many worthwhile activities or events in our lives, such as a good or even great movie. For example, perhaps you have been privileged to see the current presentation at the Legacy Theater entitled<i>The Testaments of One Fold and One Shepherd,</i>or perhaps you have derived pleasure from a kindly remark given by a respected acquaintance. Pleasure may be found in a particularly enjoyable food, from an unexpected good grade on an examination, a swim in the ocean, or a carefully sought-for possession. Such things, and hundreds more, are the source of seemingly endless pleasures. But these exciting experiences, pleasures, and possessions are not the basis of true happiness.<br><br>An interesting philosophy regarding the things we possess was given to Mitch Albom by his friend Morrie:<br><br><i>"We've got a form of brainwashing going on in our country," Morrie sighed. "Do you know how they brainwash people? They repeat something over and over. And that's what we do in this country. Owning things is good. More money is good. More property is good. More commercialism is good.</i>More is good. More is good.<i>We repeat it--and have it repeated to us--over and over until nobody bothers to even think otherwise. The average person is so fogged up by all this, he has no perspective on what's really important anymore."</i>[Albom,<i>Tuesdays,</i>124–25; emphasis in original]<br><br>The reality of this loss of perspective was illustrated in the statement of the former baseball great Dale Murphy, who is currently president of the Massachusetts Boston Mission. President Murphy made a similar observation regarding highly paid athletes who have difficulty dealing with life off the playing field: "It makes you sad. I see people looking for something. I saw people who weren't happy. Money isn't a determining factor" (Dale Murphy in Who's News,<i>USA Weekend,</i>30 April 2000, 2).<br><br>There seems to be the illusion and even a great anticipation that if we could somehow fill our lives with sufficient pleasure, we would be happy--not that pleasure is either wrong or undesirable, but the risk, of course, is that as we seek pleasure it may be found in a hundred enticing forms, always ready to titillate the senses, and pleasures often seem so anxious to please that we may even discontinue the quest for happiness and simply settle for its self-indulgent imitation.<br><br>The poet William George Jordan was frequently quoted by President David O. McKay:<br><br><i>Happiness does not always require success, prosperity or attainment. It is often the joy of hopeful struggle, consecration of purpose and energy to some good end. Real happiness ever has its root in unselfishness--its blossom in love of some kind.</i>[William George Jordan,<i>The Crown of Individuality</i>(New York: Fleming H. Revell, 1909), 78–79]<br><br>One of the seeming paradoxes of life is that it is possible to be happy, truly happy, in the midst of significant trial. You may not be happy because of the circumstance of trial--because of such things as financial loss, injury, the low score in a game, rejection (such as when you were sure that she would say yes, only to discover that her hand was given to another), a grade curve lower than you expected, disappointment in a hundred ways, or just anytime that you have a flat tire on the road to success. But such trials need not--indeed, should not--take away from happiness.<br><br>It is as much a mistake to assume that difficulties destroy happiness as it is to assume that pleasures bring happiness. This is one of the great messages repeatedly taught in the scriptures. It is in this context that I would like to share several illustrations.<br><br>Consider, if you will, the experience of Helaman and his 2,000 stripling warriors. Thrown into the apex of the battle, each of them suffered many wounds--such that 200 of them fainted because of the loss of blood (surely not a situation conducive to pleasure). But Helaman recorded, "And to our great astonishment, and also the joy of our whole army, there was not one soul of them who did perish" (Alma 57:25). "And they had fought as if with the strength of God; yea, never were men known to have fought with such miraculous strength; and with such mighty power" (Alma 56:56).<br><br>We are also taught this lesson by Job, who, having lost his wealth, his children, his health, and his friends, said, "Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty" (Job 5:17). And Job concluded with one of the great testimonies of all time when, in the midst of his affliction, he added, "And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God" (Job 19:26).<br><br>A latter-day evidence of this principle is provided from several well-known experiences. President John Taylor stated that the Prophet Joseph, knowing full well the implications of his journey to Carthage, wrote the following: "I am going like a lamb to the slaughter; but I am calm as a summer's morning; I have a conscience void of offense towards God, and towards all men" (D&amp;amp;C 135:4). Such peace of soul is true happiness. It is an expression of the inner assurance that our actions and desires are acceptable to the Lord. This peace is an expression of the promise given by the Lord to the Prophet Joseph at a time he was in most difficult circumstances during an earlier imprisonment at Liberty, Missouri. In section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants we read, "Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God" (D&amp;amp;C 121:45). Not only in times of ultimate trial, but in our day-to-day activities, of what value is the peace of good conscience toward God? It would seem that the value of this happiness is truly more precious than rubies.<br><br>The idea that both peace and happiness can be found in times of significant trial is wonderfully illustrated by the experience of Francis Webster, who journeyed west with the Martin Handcart Company. Most of you know the story, how having departed from Winter Quarters late in the season, and because of delays, the company was caught in early winter snows on the high plains of Wyoming. Some years later, members of a Sunday School class were openly critical of the Church and its leaders for agreeing to allow both the Martin and the Willie Companies to travel under such circumstances. William R. Palmer, who was in that Sunday School class, recorded the event as follows:<br><br><i>An old man in the corner</i>[Francis Webster]<i>sat silent and listened as long as he could stand it, then he arose and said things that no person who heard him will ever forget. His face was white with emotion, yet he spoke calmly, deliberately, but with great earnestness and sincerity.</i><br><br><i>In substance</i>[he]<i>said, "I ask you to stop this criticism. You are discussing a matter you know nothing about. Cold historic facts mean nothing here, for they give no proper interpretation of the questions involved. Mistake to send the Handcart Company out so late in the season? Yes. But I was in that company and my wife was in it. . . . We suffered beyond anything you can imagine and many died of exposure and starvation. . . .</i>[Yet] every one of us came through with the absolute knowledge that God lives, for we became acquainted with him in our extremities. . . .<br><br><i>"Was I sorry that I chose to come by handcart? No. Neither then nor any minute of my life since.</i>The price we paid to become acquainted with God was a privilege to pay, and I am thankful that I was privileged to come in the Martin Handcart Company." [In David O. McKay, "Pioneer Women,"<i>Relief Society Magazine,</i>January 1948, 8; emphasis in original]<br><br>Some understanding of this seeming paradox--that tribulation can bring happiness--is given through the writings of Jacob and in the words of Nephi in 2 Nephi. Some 30 years after leaving Jerusalem, Nephi recorded, "And it came to pass that we lived after the manner of happiness" (2 Nephi 5:27). And we read his brother Jacob's account written but a few years later:<br><br><i>The time passed away with us, and also our lives passed away like as it were unto us a dream, we being a lonesome and a solemn people, wanderers, cast out from Jerusalem, born in tribulation, in a wilderness, and hated of our brethren.</i>[Jacob 7:26]<br><br>Does this sound as if they had found happiness? It is important to note that in the midst of these trials noted by Jacob, they were living as Nephi recorded: "after the manner of happiness." It appears that Jacob recounts the conditions of the people (there surely weren't many pleasures), whereas his prophet brother simply recorded the quality of their lives. Further understanding of these seeming contradictions is given by Alma in his instruction to his son Corianton when he said, "Behold, I say unto you, wickedness never was happiness" (Alma 41:10). Thus we see that even though the way was hard and lonely, difficult and trying, the people of Nephi were happy because they lived according to the principles of righteousness.<br><br>It is of interest that one of the terms used to describe our Father's plan for the exaltation of his children is "the plan of happiness" (Alma 42:16). This process leading to happiness was recorded by a much younger Nephi writing the history of his people following the visit of the Savior among them:<br><br><i>And there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor whoredoms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor any manner of lasciviousness; and surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God.</i>[4 Nephi 1:16]<br><br>No happier people, he wrote, yet interestingly, none of them had seen an airplane, used a computer, been to a movie, owned a sports car, played professional ball, tasted chocolate, had a mobile phone, or done a thousand other things we so often confuse for the sources of happiness in our lives. In spite of such obvious limitations to their pleasures, Nephi rejoices with his people as being so happy that no people ever to live were happier.<br><br>It is clear from the examples given that the vicissitudes of mortality, the limitations, sorrows, frustrations, and trials of our lives are often given so that we can actually find happiness. Even though the circumstances were very different for the early Saints in the Missouri days, the principle is true for us wherein the Lord said:<br><br><i>Therefore, they</i>[meaning the Saints]<i>must needs be chastened and tried, even as Abraham, who was commanded to offer up his only son.</i><br><br><i>For all those who will not endure chastening, but deny me, cannot be sanctified.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 101:4–5]<br><br>"For after much tribulation . . . cometh the blessing" (D&amp;amp;C 103:12). It is also apparent that happiness does not necessarily result from personal independence; that is, the ability to not only choose one's path but to do one's thing, a means whereby we are able to always satisfy personal preference, interest, and desire. Heaven, which is a place of continual happiness, is such because personal obedience to eternal laws and principles leads to this end. This is also true in mortality, where obedience to eternal laws and acceptance of true principles are the basis for all blessings. By wisely using our independence, bridling our desires, and channeling our interests, we will assure that they become a continual source of righteousness and blessing in our lives.<br><br>Speaking of the necessity for the control of our desires and independence, C. S. Lewis wrote:<br><br><i>The terrible thing, the almost impossible thing, is to hand over your whole self--all your wishes and precautions--to Christ. But it is far easier than what we are all trying to do instead. For what we are trying to do is to remain what we call "ourselves," to keep personal happiness as our great aim in life, and yet at the same time be "good." We are all trying to let our mind and heart go their own way--centred on money or pleasure or ambition--and hoping, in spite of this, to behave honestly and chastely and humbly. And that is exactly what Christ warned us you could not do.</i>[C. S. Lewis,<i>Mere Christianity</i>(New York: Macmillan, 1952), 168; book 4, chapter 8, paragraph 7]<br><br>When considering the importance of our willingness to modify our independence to create happiness in our lives, Lewis used the George MacDonald imagery of remodeling a house:<br><br><i>Imagine yourself as a living house. God comes in to rebuild that house. At first, perhaps, you can understand what He is doing. He is getting the drains right and stopping the leaks in the roof and so on: you knew that those jobs needed doing and so you are not surprised. But presently he starts knocking the house about in a way that hurts abominably and does not seem to make sense. What on earth is He up to? The explanation is that He is building quite a different house from the one you thought of--throwing out a new wing here, putting on an extra floor there, running up towers, making courtyards. You thought you were going to be made into a decent little cottage: but He is building a palace. He intends to come and live in it Himself.</i>[C. S. Lewis,<i>Mere Christianity,</i>174; book 4, chapter 9, paragraph 10]<br><br>Yes, the Savior is willing to make of each of us a mansion, but this He will not do without our permission.<br><br>Given that Joseph Smith considered happiness to be both the object and design, or purpose, of our existence, how is it that we so frequently fail to recognize the elements of true happiness in our lives? Lehi, that great patriarch of the Nephite people, provided for us an understanding of the nature of happiness, its source, and its cause. While teaching his son Jacob the necessity for opposition in our lives, Lehi said, "If ye shall say there is no sin, ye shall also say there is no righteousness. And if there be no righteousness there be no happiness" (2 Nephi 2:13). It is clear then that happiness comes into our lives not through pleasure but through righteousness. It is obvious why it was possible for Alma to clearly teach that "wickedness never was happiness" (Alma 41:10). Happiness exists in being freed from wickedness. Indeed, if we accept the concept that there is no wrong, we deny ourselves and perhaps others an opportunity for the opposite--that is, righteousness and, therefore, happiness.<br><br>Because we live in a world limited in both perspective and opportunity by the Fall, all except the Savior Himself have been partakers of wickedness (which in its broadest sense is simply a violation of the law of righteousness), and, as such, we have removed ourselves from a state of true happiness. Such removal is a just outcome because of the demands of eternal law. That is, if we violate an eternal principle, or law, we become unworthy to live in a state of pure happiness. It is therefore apparent that without the Atonement of the Savior, all mortal beings would find themselves both in a state of unrighteousness and unhappiness.<br><br>The work of Jesus Christ, to answer the demand of justice in our behalf, is the great message of Amulek in the Book of Mormon:<br><br><i>And behold, this is the whole meaning of the law, every whit pointing to that great and last sacrifice; and that great and last sacrifice will be the Son of God, yea, infinite and eternal.</i><br><br><i>And thus he shall bring salvation to all those who shall believe on his name; this being the intent of this last sacrifice, to bring about the bowels of mercy, which overpowereth justice, and bringeth about means unto men that they may have faith unto repentance.</i><br><br><i>And thus mercy can satisfy the demands of justice, and encircles them in the arms of safety, while he that exercises no faith unto repentance is exposed to the whole law of the demands of justice; therefore only unto him that has faith unto repentance is brought about the great and eternal plan of redemption</i>[or happiness]. [Alma 34:14–16]<br><br>Payment for a broken law demands sacrifice. The sacrifice made by God was the Atonement, and it is broad enough to cover all of our sins but also requires a sacrifice on the part of the recipient. This sacrifice is beautifully illustrated by the words of Lamoni's father when he prayed, "I will give away all my sins to know thee" (Alma 22:18). This is indeed the cost of happiness, and the sacrifice that must be made by all humankind--to give away all of our sins. The Atonement of Christ does not satisfy justice in our behalf on a piecemeal (sin-by-sin) basis, but requires that we become new creatures, born again, that we "lay aside every sin . . . which doth bind you down to destruction" (Alma 7:15).<br><br>It is apparent that to the repentant, the law of justice is a positive aspect of the gospel. It is because of this arrangement that we can have hope for happiness and for freedom from our own sins and acts against the law. It is only the wicked and unrepentant who fear justice and look for mercy without price. The law of justice brings opportunity for obedience to God's laws and, ultimately, joy. The corollary is that disobedience brings unhappiness. We learn from the scriptures that the law of justice is not optional and must be accounted for in our lives.<br><br>There seem to be only two ways to satisfy justice: either we must keep the law perfectly (do no sin) or we must pay the penalty for the broken law. Significantly, the Savior did both--in Him there was no sin, and yet though Him the price demanded by justice for the sins of all mankind was paid. The prophet Alma taught, "The Son of God suffereth according to the flesh that he might take upon him the sins of his people, that he might blot out their transgressions according to the power of his deliverance" (Alma 7:13). This divine act, the Atonement, is available to any and all of those who are absolutely submissive to the will of God.<br><br>Through the Atonement of Christ we come to know happiness because we become free from worldliness and are therefore able to enter into a state of happiness where the vicissitudes of life are not only endured but are endured well.<br><br>This demands not just<i>some</i>sacrifice but a<i>total</i>sacrifice on our part. The sacrifice of Christ was complete, ultimate, and infinite. Our sacrifice must likewise be complete. We must "offer a sacrifice unto the Lord . . . in righteousness, even that of a broken heart and a contrite spirit" (D&amp;amp;C 59:8).<br><br>Elder James E. Talmage wrote:<br><br><i>Happiness leaves no bad after-taste, it is followed by no depressing reaction; it calls for no repentance, brings no regret, entails no remorse; pleasure too often makes necessary repentance, contrition, and suffering; and, if indulged to the extreme, it brings degradation and destruction.</i>[James E. Talmage, "A Greeting to the Missionaries,"<i>Improvement Era</i>17, no. 2 (December 1913): 173]<br><br>In reflecting on the meaning of happiness in my own life, I have come to equate that feeling with peace--not just calmness or freedom from conflict or quiet but true peace, the kind that the Savior promised when He told his disciples, "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you" (John 14:27).<br><br>Of all the people in the world, we have reason to be the most happy and to have the greatest measure of peace in our lives because of the hope within us. We know the Lord and understand His example--an example of happiness. He was not steeped in pleasure for, as noted by Isaiah, He was "a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief" (Isaiah 53:3). True happiness is born of our understanding that in the midst of joy or trial He is "the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6). It is possible, because of Him, to have peace deep within our souls when all about there is confusion, tumult, and temptation. It is possible because of Him to be truly happy.<br><br>I close with these words of the Savior from the Doctrine and Covenants: "Learn of me, and listen to my words; walk in the meekness of my Spirit, and you shall have peace in me" (D&amp;amp;C 19:23). Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Donald N.

<h1>rine of Christ - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am honored and humbled to be here to share these few moments with you. I am honored because it has been my privilege to be a faculty member at this very special place for 41 years. I am humbled because I feel that during those years I have been associated with some of the finest young people in the world. I hope that you can hear and feel my heart when I say that I genuinely care about your well-being and have earnestly asked for the Lord's blessing to be with us this morning. I pray that we might communicate by and feel the affirmation of the Spirit of the Lord as we visit about some important teachings of the Book of Mormon and how they have personal application in our lives today. There is much that I would like to say, so I would ask for your very best efforts as we visit together.<br><br>During my years on the faculty I have had the privilege of serving in ecclesiastical positions on this campus for approximately 15 years. Those experiences have had a profound impact on me as I have become more aware of the challenges faced by many of the students at BYU. It is has been my experience that the majority of these challenges fall into at least three different areas.<br><br>The first of these has to do with our relationships. By this I mean our sense of connectedness with deity, with spouses, with friends, and with roommates. For some, being at a large university can be a very lonely experience.<br><br>The second area of challenge, I believe, is one of maintaining balance. How do we meet all of the demands that are placed upon us by school, family, church, and work? I have said on other occasions that the good news is that you will eventually graduate, but the bad news is that the challenge of maintaining appropriate balance will continue and perhaps intensify as you move into your careers and family life.<br><br>The third area of concern for most students is that this is the time in your life when you will be making the most important decisions of your entire life--decisions concerning marriage, careers, family, and where you live. These decisions are stress producing and require divine guidance.<br><br>I wish we had time to visit about each of these areas in depth. My overarching theme this morning though is that answers and direction to each of these general dilemmas can be found in sacred places and in sacred records. This morning I would like to discuss counsel given by Nephi in the Book of Mormon that I believe has application to all three areas of challenge. I will briefly discuss the counsel found in 2 Nephi 31 and 32 and conclude with some specific suggestions based upon the doctrine of Christ that will help us to find increased joy and a sense of spiritual connectedness that will provide direction in meeting the concerns and challenges of our life.<br><br>As Nephi was about to pass from this mortal sphere, he concluded his life and his teachings with a few words concerning what he called "the doctrine of Christ" (2 Nephi 31:2). Notice the singular use of the word<i>doctrine.</i>This is Nephi's final testimony not only to his generation but to us as well. I don't know how many of you have had the experience of spending the final hours with or hearing the final expressions of one who was on the verge of death. But if you have, as I have, you know that they speak of those things that are most important to them as they distill from their life's experiences their most important learnings. That was Nephi's situation as he taught us these profoundly important principles.<br><br>The first principle included in the doctrine of Christ is to follow the Son. In 2 Nephi 31:10 we read:<br><br><i>And he said unto the children of men: Follow thou me. Wherefore, my beloved brethren, can we follow Jesus save we shall be willing to keep the commandments of the Father?</i><br><br>Quoting Christ Himself, Nephi appeals to all who would be disciples of Christ to follow Him in obedience to the first principles and ordinances of the gospel. To have faith in Christ ultimately means believing Him, trusting Him, obeying Him, and following Him. It is my heartfelt witness to you that as you live obediently and work proactively, doors of professional and family opportunity will be opened for you. Without going into specifics, I witness to you that I have observed for more than 40 years with students, missionaries, and my own family that obedience to the principles being taught here will open doors of opportunity. Christ knows you and understands your personal challenges today. You will not be left alone. "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you" (Matthew 6:33). Have faith in that promise.<br><br>Elder Bruce R. McConkie said the following:<br><br><i>To be valiant in the testimony of Jesus is to "come unto Christ, and be perfected in him"; it is to deny ourselves "of all ungodliness," and "love God" with all our "might, mind and strength." (Moro. 10:32.) ...</i><br><br>... [It]<i>is to take the Lord's side on every issue. It is to vote as he would vote. It is to think what he thinks, to believe what he believes, to say what he would say and do what he would do in the same situation. It is to have the mind of Christ and be one with him as he is one with his Father.</i>["Be Valiant in the Fight of Faith,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1974, 35]<br><br>I would add my own testimony that as I attempt to follow Christ and draw closer to Him, I am a better husband, a better father, a better teacher, and a more accomplished professional. I have said on a number of occasions that I love my wife, Janet, and our children, but I love them more when I love Christ first.<br><br>The second step in the doctrine of Christ is to "follow the Son, with full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God, but with real intent (2 Nephi 31:13). Nephi's plea to have faith in and follow Christ would be compelling if it ended there, but it didn't. Perhaps he had seen the various demands of our lives and the need for clear priorities as he added that we need to have "full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God," and we need to do so with "real intent." These are not passive or casual descriptors. We are required to be clear about our priorities, and we need to consistently follow them in our sacred as well as our secular life.<br><br>I am deeply concerned about what I observe to be a casualness among some of us in living the commandments and serving God with full purpose. How can we follow Christ with full purpose of heart and witness to the world that we are His disciples if we participate in the forms of moral decay that we see in our society, including movies, music, and pornography in all of its forms? The counsel of the Lord and His prophets is clear, and has been for generations: "Let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly" (D&amp;amp;C 121:45).<br><br>I have a stake president who talks passionately about being a full home teacher as well as a full-tithe payer. Are we full or partial home teachers and visiting teachers? Are we full or partial temple attenders? Are we full livers of the law of chastity as we keep our minds and thoughts as well as our bodies clean, or do we participate in inappropriate movies, music, or other forms of entertainment that would pollute our thoughts? I will talk more about priorities and the importance of having them made very clear as I conclude these comments.<br><br>The third element of the doctrine of Christ is found in the continuation of verse 13 of 2 Nephi 31: "Follow the Son, ... repenting of your sins, witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take upon you the name of Christ, by baptism." Notice the word<i>repenting--</i>suggesting it is a continuous process. In these chapters of 2 Nephi, repentance is mentioned four times. Added importance to this instruction is given by the fact that Nephi quotes the Father. The voice of the Father has, for the most part, been limited to the introduction of and praise of His Son. I should like to share just one experience that emphasizes some counsel regarding repentance that is applicable to us as we face today's challenges.<br><br>A number of years ago, when I first came to this campus, I was called to be a bishop of a student ward. One day a young man walked into my office--a young man I had never seen or met before. He was obviously distraught. He paced back and forth in front of my desk, finally stopped, then looked at me and asked, "Are you Bishop Daines?"<br><br>I said, "Yes, I am."<br><br>He then said, "I want you to excommunicate me."<br><br>I said, "Well, we'd better talk."<br><br>So he closed the door, and for the next two hours I heard the story of the most disturbed, distorted life I had ever heard of before or since. For the first and only time in my life, I felt as I visited with this young man that if I had ever met somebody who was a lost soul, this was one of them. One of his transgressions was that of homosexuality. He was a student at the university, and at the time the recommended procedure was to visit with either Elder Mark E. Petersen or Elder Spencer W. Kimball of the Council of the Twelve. We were assigned to visit with Elder Kimball. What a profoundly instructive experience that was for me.<br><br>As we talked with Elder Kimball, he heard the same story I had heard. His response, however, was different. He looked at that young man and asked him three questions.<br><br>Calling him by name, he first asked, "Would you like to be forgiven of all of your sins and transgressions?"<br><br>The young man said yes.<br><br>The second question was, "Would you like all of the blessings the Lord has in store for you?"<br><br>The young man said yes, he would.<br><br>The third question was, "Would you like to be married in the temple for time and all eternity and have a family and raise them up unto the Lord?"<br><br>The young man broke down and said, "I would."<br><br>Then Elder Kimball gave this simple but profound advice. He said, "Then let me tell you how to do it. You get up in the morning, you fall to your knees, and you ask God for strength to live clean for one day. Then when you go to bed at night, you fall to your knees and express gratitude for the strength to have been clean for that one day. You get up on the second day and you do the same thing. You fall to your knees and you ask for strength. You go to bed at night and you express gratitude. And two days will become a week, and a week will become a month, and a month will become six months, and six months will become a year. However long it takes, you can be forgiven."<br><br>The interesting sequel is that for the next three months Elder Kimball called this young bishop in Provo to ask how his friend was doing. He cared enough that he made those phone calls.<br><br>It is my testimony to you that God delights in forgiving us. We are told that He descended below all things. I believe that to mean that He has felt all of the concerns and burdens you and I have felt and more. There is not one of us here who can fall further than Christ can reach.<br><br>The next two steps in the doctrine of Christ are baptism by water and baptism by the Holy Ghost. Let us continue in verse 13:<br><br><i>Witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take upon you the name of Christ, by baptism--yea, by following your Lord and your Savior down into the water, according to his word, behold, then shall ye receive the Holy Ghost; yea, then cometh the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost; and then can ye speak with the tongue of angels, and shout praises unto the Holy One of Israel.</i>[2 Nephi 31:13]<br><br>We are told in verse 5 of 2 Nephi 31 that Christ was baptized "to fulfil all righteousness." Because He lived without sin, there must then be a difference between "sinlessness" and "righteousness." I believe that our righteousness is the active seeking of the mind and will of the Lord in responding to all our challenges and decisions as well as our willing submission to all priesthood ordinances. Nephi spoke of the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost in verses 13, 14, and 17. As we read these verses along with other parts of the Book of Mormon--namely, in Mosiah and in Alma 5--it is clear that coincident with baptism of the spirit, there is forgiveness of sin, a peace of conscience, joy, spiritual witness, enlightenment, and a change of heart so that we desire only to do right and have a willingness to covenant and obey God and all His commandments. These elements seem to be common for those who have had the baptism of fire. Because we are taught that being born again is a process, I find the following from Elder McConkie to be instructive:<br><br><i>With most people, conversion is a process; and it goes step by step, degree by degree, level by level, from a lower state to a higher, from grace to grace, until the time that the individual is wholly turned to the cause of righteousness. Now this means that an individual overcomes one sin today and another sin tomorrow. He perfects his life in one field now, and in another field later on. And the conversion process goes on, until it is completed, until we become, literally, as the Book of Mormon says, saints of God instead of natural men.</i>[Bruce R. McConkie,<i>Be Ye Converted,</i>Brigham Young University Speeches of the Year (11 February 1968), 12]<br><br>As we consider the issue of career and our life's profession, one of the tests of whether we have been converted or not is indicated by our motives and the longings of our heart. All too frequently I have dealt with students who seem to hunger and thirst after the things of the world while dutifully performing things of God. I have heard students say, for instance, "I desire to make a lot of money so that I can pay a large tithing." Or, they say, by making a lot of money they can better serve the Lord. That rationale sounds a little to me like doing the right thing for the wrong reasons. Rather, I suggest that the longing of the heart of one who has been born again is to hunger and thirst after things of the Spirit while dutifully performing necessary worldly things.<br><br>The next step in the doctrine of Christ is to endure to the end:<br><br><i>And I heard a voice from the Father, saying: Yea, the words of my Beloved are true and faithful. He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.</i><br><br><i>And now, my beloved brethren, I know by this that unless a man shall endure to the end, in following the example of the Son of the living God, he cannot be saved.</i>[2 Nephi 31:15–16]<br><br>The doctrine of faithful endurance is infinitely serious. It is included here as a basic principle of the gospel by the God and Father of us all. Enduring to the end is an integral part of the doctrine of Christ, and without it the scriptures are clear that it would have been better not to have known Him (see Alma 24:30). Although I believe that enduring to the end has reference to the end of the path of eternal life, I believe there is another dimension of enduring. It has to do with enduring our trials and present challenges with faith and courage.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph was a great exemplar, not only of this principle but also of having total faith and confidence in the promises of the Lord. I should like to share with you an entry from the diary of my great-great grandmother. This is a record of a little-known experience of the Prophet Joseph--little known because this diary was lost for 30 to 40 years in my mother's home in New Jersey. It was only rediscovered as they were preparing to move back to Utah in the late 1970s. This is a diary entry of Sister Sarah Stoddard. Her son Charles, my great-grandfather, as a boy of 14, was asked by the Prophet Joseph to serve as a houseboy for William Law, an enemy of the Prophet, and to inform him of any of the Laws' devious plans. It was, I guess, an early form of counterintelligence.<br><br>Note the date of the diary entry: April 1844. It was just two months before the Martyrdom of the Prophet.<br><br><i>Dear Diary,</i><br><br><i>Charles had another faith-promoting experience last night.</i><br><br><i>Early this morning, even while the darkness still hemmed out the light of the day, Mr. Law, after he had been drinking and planning with his associates through the night, got Charles out of bed to clean and oil his gun. He said he was going to shoot the Prophet, only William Law called him "old Joe Smith." Poor Charles was frightened beyond description, but Mr. Law stood over him and prodded him with his foot when Charles hesitated through fright and anxiety. Finally, when Mr. Law was satisfied with the way the gun was working, he put one bullet in. (He boasted he could kill the Prophet with one shot.) He sent Charles to bring the Prophet.</i><br><br><i>He ran as fast as he could and delivered the message, but he begged the Prophet not to go to Mr. Law's as Mr. Law was drunk and Charles was afraid he would carry through on his threat to shoot the Prophet in cold blood.</i><br><br><i>As they walked the few blocks from the Mansion House to the Law residence, the Prophet assured Charles that no harm would come to him that day. Charles was frightened, and he said that it kept racing through his mind, "I am the one that cleaned the gun that is going to be used to kill the Prophet," until he was sick with fear. The Prophet in a final attempt to calm my dear son uttered the fateful words, "Mr. Law may someday kill me, Charles, but it won't be today."</i><br><br><i>As they approached their destination, Mr. Law came staggering out of the house shouting out what he intended to do.</i><br><br><i>The Prophet said kindly and unafraid, "You sent for me, Mr. Law?" to which Mr. Law replied with oaths that now he was doing the whole a favor by disposing of the Prophet with one shot.</i><br><br><i>Calmly the Prophet unbuttoned his shirt and bared his chest, then said, "I'm ready now, Mr. Law." Charles said at this point he nearly fainted. Sick fear strangled him until he was speechless and paralyzed, unable to move a muscle.</i><br><br><i>Mr. Law paced a few steps, turned, aimed, and pressed the trigger. There was complete silence. Then the air rang with profanity, and Mr. Law turned on Charles, accusing him of fixing the gun so it would not go off and threatening to kill even Charles--my innocent, frightened, but faithful son.</i><br><br><i>The Prophet, to divert Mr. Law's blame of Charles, suggested that a can be placed on a fence post for Mr. Law to take a practice shot. Relieved, Charles ran for a can and laid it on its side on the post. Mr. Law paced back, took aim, and fired. His "one shot" streaked through the exact center of the can.</i><br><br><i>Even Mr. Law was quiet, as if stunned.</i><br><br><i>The Prophet buttoned up his shirt, gave Charles a meaningful look, and then said, "If you are finished with me now, Mr. Law, I have other things needing to be done. Good morning.</i>[Diary of Sarah Stoddard; text modernized]<br><br>I shall ever be grateful for the remarkable example of the Prophet Joseph Smith. He endured faithfully not only to the end of his life but to the end of each one of his many trials. He also demonstrated in this situation total faith and confidence in the promises that the Lord had made to him as well as to righteous men and women everywhere that they would not be taken before their work was completed.<br><br>I am saying to you today, have confidence in the promises the Lord has made to you.<br><br>Finally, the doctrine of Christ tells us in verse 20 of chapter 31:<br><br><i>Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.</i><br><br>In chapter 32, in verse 3, we read:<br><br><i>Angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, they speak the words of Christ. Wherefore, I said unto you, feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do.</i><br><br>There, my brothers and sisters, is one of the important answers and applications of the doctrine of Christ to our current challenges. But to feast on the words of Christ is different than to snack on or even to read them. The scriptures will lead to personal revelation that will tell us all things that we must do to solve the problems and challenges that we face as university students, but only if we truly feast and study and meditate upon them. The Lord will affirm our decisions regarding family, career, and important relationships.<br><br>I have always found the following statement from President Spencer W. Kimball to be encouraging and instructive:<br><br><i>I find that when I get casual in my relationships with divinity and when it seems that no divine ear is listening and no divine voice is speaking, that I am far, far away. If I immerse myself in the scriptures the distance narrows and the spirituality returns.</i>[TSWK, 135]<br><br>In the few moments that remain, I should like to suggest the following program patterned after the doctrine of Christ to help us meet the challenges of relationships, maintain balance in our lives, and make major decisions. I suggest to you--indeed, promise you--that if you will follow this program for even one week, you will find major comfort and direction. Please note that these suggestions are derived from the principles as well as the<i>order</i>of these principles as taught by Nephi.<br><br>For this program, I would encourage you first in an attempt to become one with Christ in full purpose of heart to clearly establish your priorities, put them in writing, and review them regularly. Have them guide the decisions that you make as if they were your personal constitution. This should not be a casual effort but one that you think about carefully.<br><br>A number of years ago, I listed mine, which I will share with you now. Notice the sequence.<br><br>1. Gather spiritual manna daily to establish a relationship with God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.<br><br>2. Relate to and nurture my family.<br><br>3. Magnify my Church callings by serving others.<br><br>4. Meet the demands of my profession.<br><br>5. Develop hobbies and other personal interests.<br><br>The order is important: Take care of my spiritual relationship, take care of my family, fulfill my Church obligations, then my professional obligations, and then have personal hobbies and experiences.<br><br>The second exercise of this weekly program would be to repent of your sins--one day at a time. I would like to ask you the question "What one thing could you do now to bring you closer to Christ?" I invite you to stop and listen carefully to your conscience. What one thing could you do now? I would like to suggest that every morning you fall to your knees and ask the Lord for help and strength and support in accomplishing that one thing. As you go to bed at night, express gratitude for the ability for that one day to make progress. One day will become two, and two days will become four, and a week will pass by, and if you will continue that practice, it will be possible for you to become "perfect in Christ" (Moroni 10:32).<br><br>The third exercise relates to water baptism. The Lord has commanded us to renew our covenants and commitments every Sunday by partaking of the sacrament. At the sacrament table we renew not only our baptismal covenants but all of our covenants, including those of the temple. The sacrament hour can become a time to totally recommit. When we eat an ordinary meal, we ask God to bless it to the use of our bodies. When we partake of the sacrament, we ask God to bless it to the use of our souls. We eat and drink in remembrance of Jesus Christ. May I suggest for this week, as a spiritual exercise, that we intensify our focus and concentration at this most sacred moment of the week as we partake of the sacrament and concentrate on the changes that we can make to improve our sense of connectedness with the Savior and thus with others.<br><br>The next exercise has to do with baptism of the spirit. One of the important ways to feel the Spirit of the Lord is to give service. Thus I commend to you in this exercise program that you commit a daily act of selfless service. You may want to try a fast in conjunction with this service--not necessarily a fast from food. What if you were to fast from negative or critical or worldly talk? Or maybe you could fast from a habit that you are trying to change. As you engage in service and in the fasting from the behavior that takes you away from the Spirit, you will feel a renewal of the Spirit of the Lord.<br><br>The last exercise would be to feast upon the Word. Would you try for 30 minutes each day to feast from the scriptures? Do not set a target for reading a chapter a day or a specific number of verses a day, but, instead, set your targets in terms of time. Feast, meditate, reflect, apply.<br><br>Our time is gone, and I should like to conclude by bearing my testimony that life will continue to place before us trials and tests and important decisions. I bear testimony that answers and support will come to us from sacred places and sacred records as we actively seek them.<br><br>I want to affirm my love and concern for you. You are the children of promise. The Lord has made specific promises to those of you of this generation. Have faith in those promises.<br><br>These principles we have talked about today are central to our salvation. It is not sufficient to just understand them. It is necessary to practice them. Let us establish clearly our priorities in life. Let us go to the sacrament table repenting of our sins and renewing our covenants on a weekly basis. Let us serve others. Let us fast from critical talk and worldly behavior. Let us feast upon the Word.<br><br>I bear testimony that the Book of Mormon is the word of God. It is another testament that Jesus is the Christ. This is as important to us today as it was to the people in the days the prophets wrote. I bear this testimony, and express again my appreciation for the wonderful privilege that has been mine to be at this special place, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Robert H.

<h1>Joseph - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I have entitled my discussion with you today "But for Joseph," which is appropriate since on this day, the 27th of June, we commemorate each year the end of the Prophet Joseph Smith's earthly mission. However, let me preface my remarks with a little background information.<br><br>First, I must say that I'll never again complain about being given an assigned topic for a talk. Any restrictiveness is far outweighed by the overwhelming feeling of having the entire universe of gospel subjects laid out before you. When I heard the date of this devotional, I knew that the Prophet Joseph would be a part of what I would address today, most likely as an excellent illustration of qualities we should cultivate in our lives. However, since I am not a Church historian, I didn't plan to have Joseph be<i>the</i>topic. But I am a convert to the religion Joseph Smith restored, and today I will be speaking unabashedly about that conversion. If you are not a Latter-day Saint, I invite you to listen with an open mind and heart.<br><br>It is that firsthand journey from the Prophet being an example to the entire focus of this talk that I will try to describe to you today. As I researched and read, interviewed and soul searched, my testimony of the Prophet Joseph moved from the factual to the very personal. So instead of discussing in a general way "But for Joseph, how different would the world be?" I have asked myself and I am asking you to consider now, "But for Joseph, how different would<i>my life</i>be?"<br><br>I first heard the name Joseph Smith during the summer after my sophomore year in high school. I had attended a conference with a group of teenage girls, and we were returning from Galveston to our homes in El Paso, Texas. It was a long bus ride, and I think more to preserve our chaperones' sanity than to give us an educational experience, we stopped in San Antonio, where the HemisFair, an event akin to the world's fair, was being held. The adults turned us loose for several hours to visit the various pavilions, and my group of six soon found its way to one entitled "Man's Search for Happiness." When we discovered we had accidentally stumbled into a religious presentation, we tried to exit the side door--but those clever missionaries had locked it! We were stuck, so we feigned attention until the audience moved into the next room and we could escape through some unlocked doors. When we boarded the bus later that afternoon for what was still a long ride home, I noticed that the only piece of reading material I had managed to hold onto--not coincidentally, I believe now--during our dash through the fair was a pamphlet with Joseph Smith's picture on the front. I read through it, motivated only by a need to pass the time, and mentally categorized it as "curious."<br><br>The following spring, in my American history class, I was searching for an engaging topic for a term paper. It was a time when newspaper headlines spoke of civil rights and of legally atoning for past injustices. I would have preferred to do a paper on current events and discrimination against groups the majority labeled as "different," but it was a history class. As I looked at a time line of the 1800s in one of the reference books, the persecutions against the Mormons captured my attention. I chose to take an objective (which turned out to be far more sympathetic) look back at the events that forced this peculiar religious group westward. The name Joseph Smith turned up again as I researched the topic in history books and encyclopedias.<br><br>Over the years when someone has asked about my conversion, I have not typically included these previous two experiences. My story usually began with the events that immediately preceded my hearing the missionary lessons. I think I had discounted these two experiences because of my resistance to the message in the first instance and my factual, even sterile, approach in the second. I feel differently today. I am convinced that these incidents provided background for my later acceptance of the gospel. They were an introduction to the concept of a recent prophet and a factual placement of events in time. Without this context I feel I would not have been sufficiently primed to accept, relatively quickly, the missionaries' message about what God revealed to a 14-year-old boy in the spring of 1820. I believe these were preparatory steps, and the Lord, knowing me, was customizing my instruction.<br><br>For about two years prior to that evening when I sat in my living room and listened to the missionaries present the first discussion, I had been on a "spiritual quest." I had grown up in a family that valued Christian ideals such as honesty, fair treatment of others, and kindness, but I did not have a spiritual dimension in my life, and I longed for one. I felt a growing need, an urgency, really, to fix my mind and heart on the divine, so I began to study about and visit different churches. I approached each new introduction to the members of a congregation and the denomination's beliefs and doctrine optimistically. I didn't understand it completely at the time, but I had a two-part screening system in place: First I would try to take a spiritual reading, a check of how I was feeling, early in the visit; then I would turn to the doctrinal aspects and ask questions about the true purpose of life, the hereafter, and how these affected the way one lived now. None of the churches I visited passed even the first part of my test, and I was getting discouraged.<br><br>Now back to that evening in 1970: After a brief discussion of the Apostasy, the missionaries reverently explained the Restoration brought about through the Prophet Joseph Smith. They presented in some detail that curious story I had quickly read about in the pamphlet two years earlier. I felt my initial optimism that this church could be my spiritual destination slip away, and doubts crowded into my mind. Did they actually believe that God had appeared to someone just last century? And to a boy younger than I was rather than to a wise, aged prophet? While I formed my questions, the missionaries moved on to a flannel-board presentation with circles and lines that depicted the plan of salvation. Before long I felt that their explanation was somehow familiar to me, and they had my full attention. I was certain that they were speaking the truth in this part of their presentation, and I felt some hope return. As the missionaries were leaving, they scheduled our next appointment, handed me a copy of<i>The Joseph Smith Story,</i>and asked me to commit to read it carefully and pray about it. I agreed to do so.<br><br>Later that night, my roller coaster of emotions hit a low point. As I thought back on all I had heard and felt during the evening and weighed the positives and negatives in my mind, I believed that I would cancel the next appointment I had set. But first I decided to keep my promise to the missionaries. After I had read the Prophet's narrative of the First Vision and beyond, I offered up an awkward, short prayer. Sleep came quickly, so I was not left to ponder the message for long. The next morning, as I knelt again in prayer, I found that the Spirit had eased my doubts about Joseph Smith's account and confirmed the truths of which he testified. I kept the appointment with the sister missionaries, and that decision has made all the difference in my life. But for Joseph, I would not have found my spiritual home in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>At the time, that level of understanding and testimony was sufficient for me to go forth with my study, baptism, and confirmation. When the Lord told the members of his newly formed church, "For his word ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth, in all patience and faith" (D&amp;amp;C 21:5), He most likely was admonishing some whose faith was at such an early stage as mine was then. Patience and faith are essential elements in the development of our testimonies, but our progression must be accelerated in these latter days. After visiting the Sacred Grove on one occasion, President Gordon B. Hinckley wrote in his journal that he felt an "ever-growing compulsion to bear testimony of the divinity of the Lord and of the mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith. I think this world needs this more than any other thing" (in Sheri Dew,<i>Go Forward with Faith</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1996], 326).<br><br>Preparing this talk has forced me to assess the testimony I began to build 30 years ago of the Prophet Joseph and the eternal truths he restored. I know that this initial and essential conviction has been strengthened by study, prayer, and life's experience; but I needed to draw closer, to look deeper at his mission. The Prophet Joseph served as a divine conduit in bringing to light marvelous and precious truths. In his eyewitness account of the Martyrdom, President John Taylor summed up Joseph's contribution:<br><br><i>Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it. . . .</i>[He has]<i>left a fame and name that cannot be slain. He lived great, and he died great in the eyes of God and his people; and like most of the Lord's anointed in ancient times, has sealed his mission and his works with his own blood.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 135:3]<br><br>In a space of approximately 24 years, the Prophet Joseph accomplished much that has eternal, historical, and personal implications for each of us. As I attempt to list the following four of his contributions and the ways each has particular meaning in my life, I encourage you to make your own list.<br><h2><b>1. Joseph Smith opened up communication with the heavens.</b></h2><br>Because he was willing to ask God directly, the Prophet Joseph--and each of us through him--learned eternal truths about the nature of God and the current status of God's kingdom on earth. He learned that the forces of the adversary are real and combat all that is righteous and pure. Joseph also learned that the Father and the resurrected Lord are separate beings who knew him and spoke to him by way of instruction. He learned that none of the churches on the earth at that time had the truth and that he should join none of them. In his book<i>Here We Stand,</i>Joseph Fielding McConkie underscored the personal implications the First Vision holds for each of us:<br><br><i>The way we answer questions about our faith ought to be by finding the quickest and most direct route to the Sacred Grove. That is our ground. It is sacred ground. It is where the heavens are opened and the God of heaven speaks. It is where testimonies are born and the greatest truths of heaven are unveiled.</i>[<i>Here We Stand</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1995), 6]<br><br>But for the Prophet Joseph's experience in the Sacred Grove, I would not have an understanding of the loving nature of God and my literal claim to divine heritage, described in Doctrine and Covenants 25:1: "All those who receive my gospel are sons and daughters in my kingdom." The God I had learned about before I accepted the gospel was removed, ever-judging, and powerful. However, I had an experience as a young child that was not consistent with this unapproachable image of deity. At that time I was living in rural Arkansas. Because I had no brothers or sisters, I had adopted an agreeable farm dog as my constant companion. One afternoon as we were walking home along a single-lane road, she was struck and killed by a truck as I looked on. That night, as I tried to fall asleep, my grief overwhelmed me. Before long that grief turned into fear that I, too, might die suddenly. No one was near enough in the house to console me, so I offered up a prayer, and my pleading was heard. I felt encircled by warm, loving arms and instinctively knew I was being comforted by my Father. As the missionaries explained the nature of a loving Heavenly Father who answered young Joseph Smith's prayer, my experience 13 years earlier came immediately to my mind and validated their words.<br><h2><b>2. Joseph Smith translated ancient scripture and recorded modern-day revelation.</b></h2><br>With the assistance of his scribes, Joseph's unceasing efforts resulted in the translation of the Book of Mormon, another testament of Jesus Christ; the Pearl of Great Price; and the publication of the Doctrine and Covenants. Can you imagine your life without the precepts, the images, and the understanding that the Book of Mormon lends? We know that "the Book of Mormon [is] the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man [can] get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book" (<i>HC</i>4:461). But for Joseph, we would not have this book of scripture. Think how limited our understanding would be if we did not have Father Lehi's vision of the tree of life. What a loss if we did not have the opportunity to know Nephi, Alma, Moroni, and others through their own words. How incomplete our view of the Savior's ministry would be if we did not have at our fingertips the tender account in 3 Nephi of Him with His "other sheep" in America. And how lacking our understanding of the creation would be without the accounts recorded in the books of Moses and Abraham. Without the intensive instruction in Church history and covenant-making and -keeping in the Doctrine and Covenants, would we be able to truly appreciate the legacy of our faith's past and be prepared to serve in the kingdom?<br><h2><b>3. Through his persistent and resilient efforts, Joseph Smith brought people to their Savior Jesus Christ.</b></h2><br>In this dispensation the Prophet Joseph literally brought heaven closer to earth as he lifted the darkness of apostasy, banished it, and brought to light the Savior's plain and precious doctrine. He was the chosen instrument of the Lord who was called both to distinguish the true, restored church from other denominations and to bring forth the power and purity of Christ's true doctrines. Joseph F. Smith stated in<i>Gospel Doctrine:</i><br><br><i>I believe in the divinity of Jesus Christ, because more than ever I come nearer the possession of the actual knowledge that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, through the testimony of Joseph Smith . . . that he today stands before the world as the last great, actual, living, witness of the divinity of Christ's mission and His power to redeem man from the temporal death and also from the second death. . . . Thank God for Joseph Smith.</i>[<i>GD,</i>495]<br><br>Thus the Prophet Joseph provided the needed linkage to the Savior who, as the Great Mediator, connects us to the Father (see D&amp;amp;C 76:22–24). Indeed, Joseph taught that<br><br><i>the fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>121]<br><br>But for Joseph, my understanding of the Atonement still would be theoretical and abstract. I would not have the information that tells me that the Savior's sacrifice was, yes, infinite and all-encompassing, but also very specifically<i>for me.</i>Understanding the personal nature and application of the Atonement allows me to know that, after all I can do, my Savior and Redeemer in His mercy can complete my circle of repentance and growth and lift my soul. He can and has changed my heart when no amount of study, willpower, or well-intended advice could affect my need. I am thankful to know that this greatest of gifts can make me, in spite of my weaknesses, more fit for His service.<br><h2><b>4. Joseph Smith established the kingdom of God on earth today.</b></h2><br>Under divine tutelage, the Prophet Joseph organized the Church. He directed the construction of the Kirtland and Nauvoo Temples and restored the ordinances of the house of the Lord for the benefit of individuals and families. He was ordained to the holy priesthood, and, through him, its powers and blessings were restored to the earth. Joseph saw that missionaries were sent forth to take the gospel not only to surrounding areas but also to Europe and the isles of the sea. He established the Relief Society for the sisters that they might have opportunities to extend charity to those in need and to save souls.<br><br>But for Joseph, I could not be a participant in the building of the kingdom of God today. Without the fellowship of my brothers and sisters in the gospel, I would not be strengthened and sustained. Since my baptism I have had only a few times when I was unable to associate with the Saints, and then it was for only a short period of time. But how I missed their kind counsel and that communication from spirit to spirit.<br><br>I can't imagine my life without the refuge and perspective of the temple. If the sacred ordinances that are performed therein were not on the earth today, I would not have the understanding of eternal marriage that stands firm in the face of trials and challenges. I am so grateful that our son, Brandt, and his wife, Lori, currently have the privilege of serving in the Washington D.C. Temple. Brandt recently wrote in an e-mail:<br><br><i>Last night was our night to work in the temple, and while I was officiating, I heard myself speaking the incredible blessings that are promised, and was overwhelmed by the great mercy and love that our Father shows us by extending those blessings to us and giving me the opportunity to help pronounce those blessings upon others who are anxiously waiting for them on both sides of the veil.</i><br><br><i>What a wonderful blessing it is to live when the fullness of the gospel, the fullness of the priesthood, and the fullness of the blessings of our Savior's Atonement are here and waiting for all!</i><br><br>I, too, marvel at the blessings that are ours because temples are now among us. In a little over a month, our son Micah will be sealed for time and all eternity to a beautiful daughter of God in the Lord's house. All of our sons, the two daughters they have added to our family, and other loved ones will witness that all-important moment in eternity. Today my heart nearly bursts with gratitude just thinking about the occasion. But for Joseph, those priesthood keys could not be exercised in our behalf.<br><br>And without the priesthood, and a husband worthy and willing to call down blessings of comfort, healing, and strength upon our family, the world's "three Ds'--distraction, discouragement, and despair--would never be far away from our door. And without the selfless sacrifice of missionary work, I literally would not be with you today. In addition, my husband and sons would never have had the privilege of seeking out and bringing into the fold people who at first appeared so different in language and custom but soon became quite literally their brothers and sisters.<br><br>Recently our oldest son Travis traveled to Florida to be at Miami International Airport when Elder Franklyn Tavarez returned from his mission in Michigan. When he was serving in the Fort Lauderdale Mission, Travis had the privilege of baptizing Frankie when he was a young teenager. How I wish I could have witnessed the embrace that they shared as brothers and fellow missionaries upon his arrival!<br><br>Our missionary son, Taylor, who is completing his mission in Chile next month, recently shared his testimony with us in a letter:<br><br><i>I know this work is true. I know that the standard of truth has been erected. I feel the power of the priesthood when I humbly use it. I know that Jesus is our Savior. I will forever be grateful for the gospel in my life and will forever defend the truth and this, the Lord's Church.</i><br><br>Having the privilege to serve full-time and never-ending missions that bring souls unto Christ through the gospel that Joseph restored is the sweetest work to which we can devote ourselves.<br><br>But for Joseph, the Relief Society would not have been divinely organized. I love this organization and the privilege it affords me to serve with the exceptional sisters of the Church. That is another talk for another day, but let me just say that when Joseph told his beloved Emma and the sisters gathered in 1842 that he "turn[ed] the key" in their behalf, under the direction of the priesthood of God, Heavenly Father provided a structure for his daughters to have firsthand experience with both extending and receiving Christlike service (see page 32 of "Minutes of the Nauvoo Female Relief Society," 28 April 1842, LDS Church Historical Department, Salt Lake City).<br><br>Thus we are all eternally indebted to the Prophet Joseph Smith. How do we demonstrate that gratitude? Let me suggest three ways.<br><h2><b>1. We can seek to love and honor the Prophet Joseph as we learn more of his life and his mission.</b></h2><br>After spending this time researching the Prophet, I realized that I did not know enough about him as an individual. The first quality that comes to my mind now when I think of him is humility. From his earnest plea in the Sacred Grove to his nobility in Liberty Jail and at Carthage, Joseph set aside all pride and sublimated his will to the Father and His work. In his book<i>Mere Christianity,</i>C. S. Lewis described a humble man not as someone with downcast eyes who is always underrepresenting his worth and contribution. Rather, he said, if you were to meet a humble man,<br><br><i>probably all you will think about him is that he seemed a cheerful, intelligent chap who took a real interest in what</i>you<i>said to</i>him.<i>If you do dislike him it will be because you feel a little envious of anyone who seems to enjoy life so easily. He will not be thinking about humility: he will not be thinking about himself at all.</i>[<i>Mere Christianity</i>(New York: Macmillan, 1952), 114; book 3, chapter 8, paragraph 13; emphasis in original]<br><br>This was the Prophet Joseph.<br><br>And the Prophet did enjoy life. President Joseph F. Smith described Joseph:<br><br><i>O, he was full of joy; he was full of gladness; he was full of love. . . . And while he could play with children and amuse himself at simple, innocent games among men, he also communed with the Father and the Son and spoke with angels, and they visited him, and conferred blessings and gifts and keys of power upon him.</i>[Joseph F. Smith, in Brian H. Stuy, comp.,<i>Collected Discourses,</i>5 vols. (Burbank, California: B.H.S. Publishing, 1987–92), 5:29]<br><br>Wouldn't it have been wonderful to spend time with this man, this prophet? I believe that we would each have loved him in a very personal way. President Brigham Young expressed his feelings for Joseph with great enthusiasm:<br><br><i>I feel like shouting hallelujah, all the time, when I think that I ever knew Joseph Smith, the Prophet whom the Lord raised up and ordained, and to whom He gave keys and power to build up the kingdom of God on earth and sustain it.</i>[<i>JD</i>3:51]<br><br>The Prophet inspired love in those who knew him best. The Prophet's nephew, President Joseph F. Smith, also stated, "Where [Joseph Smith's name] is spoken of for good, . . . they revere him, and they love him, as they love no other man" (<i>GD,</i>481). At the dedication of the Joseph Smith Memorial Building, President Gordon B. Hinckley summed up his feelings for the Prophet by simply exclaiming , "I love the Prophet Joseph Smith. I love the Prophet Joseph Smith!" (in "A Heroic Figure,"<i>Ensign,</i>September 1990, 38). Brothers and sisters, I can now join these brethren and say I love this man, this prophet.<br><h2><b>2. We can bear testimony of Joseph Smith's crucial role in this dispensation.</b></h2><br>The Prophet reminded all members of the Church, "When you joined this Church you enlisted to serve God. When you did that you left the neutral ground, and you never can get back on to it" (Daniel Tyler, in "Recollections of the Prophet Joseph Smith,"<i>Juvenile Instructor</i>27, no. 16 [15 August 1892]: 492). Our testimonies cannot be generic; they cannot be neutral on the subject of the life and mission of the Prophet. We are instructed in Doctrine and Covenants 31:4, "You shall declare the things which have been revealed to my servant, Joseph Smith." And we should never testify of revelations without acknowledging the revelator. Brigham Young's logic on this point was direct and profound:<br><br><i>If Jesus lives, and is the Saviour of the world, Joseph Smith is a Prophet of God, and lives in the bosom of his father Abraham. Though they have killed his body, yet he lives and beholds the face of his Father in heaven; and his garments are pure as the angels that surround the throne of God; and no man on the earth can say that Jesus lives, and deny at the same time my assertion about the Prophet Joseph.</i>[<i>JD</i>1:38]<br><br>In section 122 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord told Joseph:<br><br><i>The ends of the earth shall inquire after thy name, and fools shall have thee in derision, and hell shall rage against thee;</i><br><br><i>While the pure in heart, and the wise, and the noble, and the virtuous, shall seek counsel, and authority, and blessings constantly from under thy hand.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 122:1–2]<br><br>And in section 6 the Lord admonished us, "Therefore be diligent; stand by my servant Joseph, faithfully, in whatsoever difficult circumstances he may be for the word's sake" (D&amp;amp;C 6:18). May we demonstrate by the testimonies we bear that we are diligently standing by him and can be counted among those who revere Joseph's name and essential role.<br><h2><b>3. We can serve continuously and faithfully in building the kingdom</b>.</h2><br>In the<i>Lectures on Faith,</i>Joseph charged us to live as he had:<br><br><i>Let us here observe, that a religion that does not require the sacrifice of all things never has power sufficient to produce the faith necessary unto life and salvation; for, from the first existence of man, the faith necessary unto the enjoyment of life and salvation never could be obtained without the sacrifice of all earthly things.</i>[<i>Lectures on Faith</i>6:7]<br><br>In the Church we experience different seasons of service. In each calling we have the opportunity to sacrifice more of ourselves than we ever have before. We honor Joseph by serving well, literally consecrating our efforts in doing that which no one else can accomplish at that time and in that place to serve the Master.<br><br>As I close today, I want to thank those two sister missionaries and their stake counterparts who, 30 years ago, challenged me to read and pray about the Prophet Joseph's story. I also am immensely grateful to those who, in recent months, have helped me know Joseph better as a man and a foreordained prophet. My family and friends have expressed unwavering support and encouragement. At a moment of despair when a significant part of my text for this talk had somehow "evaporated" into cyberspace, Heidi Swinton, who wrote last year's amazing PBS production<i>An American Prophet,</i>took time she didn't have to lend me perspective. I also appreciate Liz Lemon Swindle, the gifted artist, who has brought Joseph closer to our hearts through her paintings and has allowed me to share some of them with you today.<br><br>On this occasion we are gathered here as Saints in a building that bears the Prophet's name because of what happened in that Sacred Grove. And on this anniversary of the Martyrdom, I join with President Hinckley in reminding us that the accomplishments of the life of the Prophet Joseph Smith will never be blurred. The testimony of Joseph lives on.<br><br><i>Now, my brothers and sisters, most of you will not be asked to make such sacrifices or to respond to such calls. But what you do with your lives as you live them from day to day is no less important.</i>["Let Us Move This Work Forward,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1985, 85]<br><br>Whatever our present calling or opportunity, may we carry on his work. By so doing, we honor Joseph's memory and bring glory to our Savior and our Father.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, I challenge all of us, at whatever level--even if we are at a very early stage in our journey of faith--to deepen our understanding of the Prophet Joseph and his divine mission, to acknowledge before our Father and all who will listen that, but for the Prophet's role in this dispensation, our lives would be barren and our hope would fail us. I speak from personal experience when I say to you that seeking this new level of testimony will not come easily; the adversary will attempt to block your progress. It will require a letting go of pride and the things of this world that confuse and distract you. You will need to make a higher level of commitment to the work that the Prophet Joseph died to further. But all the effort is worth it, and it is essential that you commit yourself to it. For me, the strengthening of my testimony of the Prophet Joseph seemed to come together in a single moment. All of the historical and spiritual pieces fell into place as I read the simple, direct statement of the Lord to his beloved servant Joseph--and to each of us--in Doctrine and Covenants 5:10: "But this generation shall have my word through you."<br><br>I have glimpsed his earnest desire, unstoppable faith, the discouragement he made productive, and his feelings of enveloping joy, and I can now testify, with a conviction born of love for the Prophet Joseph and inexpressible gratitude for his mission, that he is a prophet of God. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Katherine D. Pullins was associate dean of the J.

<h1> on Competition and the Gospel - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a delight to greet you this beautiful morning from the Joseph Smith Building, a wonderful structure bearing the name of the greatest person to live on the earth in the past 1,900 years or so. It is a privilege to bear witness in this place that Joseph was a prophet of God, that he was chosen to reestablish the original church founded by the Savior of the world and to reestablish among men a sound understanding of the Atonement and how it can exalt women and men.<br><br>I am grateful for the privilege of discussing with you this morning some principles that I believe young men and women about to enter the professions need to understand. Much of what we learn from gospel teachings encountered earliest in life inculcates in us an appreciation for the functions of nurturing, supporting, and serving those who are near to us. On the other hand, when we encounter the teachings of social science or enter into the daily business of life, we encounter processes that seem strictly opportunistic, that seem to render us impervious to the well-being of those with whom we are forced to interact, often on a competitive basis.<br><br>Frequently heard voices teach that the former processes of cooperation and brotherhood are gospel processes, whereas the latter processes, those that are competitive, are selfish and worldly and should be avoided by honorable people. This response finds resonance with many, but its specious appeal often proves unsatisfying to us when we stop to realize that most of us must almost always function in environments that demand competitive performance of one sort or another.<br><br>What, then, should BYU students--future leaders not only in the Church but also in society and in the professions--think about competition? Does the gospel teach us that competition is morally reprehensible?<br><br>In a broad sense, competition is life, and competition is about how we live. President Hugh B. Brown said that young people such as BYU students "are entering the greatest competition of all, the serious pursuit of life itself, the abundant life, eternal life. In this competition you must cultivate a sensitivity to the things of mind and spirit" (<i>The Abundant Life</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1965], 341). This might be thought of as gospel competition.<br><br>Parents compete with forces outside the family for the hearts of their children as they try to teach them to pursue education, activity in the Church, and other family values. Missionaries compete for the time and attention of potential investigators with the ideas and teachings they wish to impart. You compete to get into BYU, you compete for grades, you compete for jobs, and, having embarked on a career, you must compete for promotions and for about every kind of success. Is this competition a curse that you must constantly strive to overcome?<br><br>In my profession, competition is generally a very positive word. It is contrasted with monopoly, a situation in which a firm is empowered because it has sole dominance of a given market and can restrict its sales and charge a high price. Those who rail against large corporations or "multinationals" should be more friendly to the notion of competition; when corporations face competition, they must charge more reasonable prices and be more consumer friendly in their comportment or they lose market share as clients abandon them to purchase from more competitive firms.<br><br>One of the prophets who understood the workings of the economy and the impact of government policy was President Ezra Taft Benson, who taught that "freedom of individual choice inspires competition. Competition inspires shrewd and efficient management, which is conducive to the production of the best product possible at the lowest price" (<i>TETB,</i>629).<br><br>President Benson understood how important competition is for our economy. He noted that early in U.S. industrial history:<br><br><i>The governments--both state and federal--by making grants and giving exclusive licenses to railroads, banks, and public utilities, created artificial government monopolies. Free competition in these fields was prohibited by law. One had to possess a certificate of convenience and necessity</i>[i.e., a franchise]<i>to enter business, and these were given to only a select few.</i><br><br><i>The results were only to be expected. With no competition to keep these monopolies in line, prices and rates were raised until the public clamor to halt these abuses brought about the antitrust laws. The correct remedy, of course, would have been to withdraw all exclusive privileges and allow anyone who had the desire to enter into these fields of economic activity.</i><br><br><i>If every member of society and every group is allowed to compete, and if the consuming public is left completely free to select those with whom they do business, the public will always be served by those who offer the best product at the cheapest price.</i>[<i>TETB,</i>680–81]<br><br>But let us go back and address the issue of competition from a more general viewpoint. Let us ask four questions about how competition relates to us. Should we as Church members compete? If so, how should we compete? Against whom should we compete? When should we compete?<br><h2><b>I. Should We Compete?</b></h2><br>Of course. If I were to say no, this talk would already be over and far too short. Competition is as essential to personal growth as, for example, interdisciplinary studies are to the progress of humankind. It can help us to expand our mental capacities as though we were, for example, majoring in international or area studies at the Kennedy Center.<br><br>The Apostle Paul used the notion of competition to describe how we should live our lives and how he had lived his. Toward the end of his mortal probation, he compared his life to a battle and a race in the same sentence:<br><br><i>For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.</i><br><br><i>I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:</i><br><br><i>Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.</i>[2 Timothy 4:6–8]<br><br>Competition has received a bad name in part because it is so intense and, too often, so unprincipled. In the world, the opportunistic drive for material advantage can become--I am told by those who engage in the struggle--even vicious and immoral. It is imperative that we do not lose our spiritual balance, our spiritual foundations, and be caught up in the worldly race for wealth and power. I suppose that far too many of us do, and having some measure of success in this endeavor, we then delight to engage in conspicuous consumption to demonstrate our worth. But those who bear the material burdens of excessive success are not for us to judge. We do not know the hearts of the rich, who almost certainly do not have a monopoly on sin.<br><br>Life offers us the opportunity to choose our material objectives and how we will compete as we pursue them. Even our spiritual leaders have not been asked to leave the race to withdraw behind cloistered bastions of hallowed retreat. They, too, hear Paul's challenge: "Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain" (1 Corinthians 9:24).<br><br>King Benjamin teaches the same principle. For him, life is a marathon rather than a sprint, and we should persevere in that race:<br><br><i>And see that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength. And again, it is expedient that he should be diligent, that thereby he might win the prize.</i>[Mosiah 4:27]<br><h2><b>II. How Should We Compete?</b></h2><br>You, my young friends, are the promise of the Church. You are the promise of the world. As the world's forces render virtue and integrity ever more scarce, you are and will be in great demand. Leadership and labor markets will increasingly value the character, talent, integrity, and capacity you are acquiring. As you magnify yourself, you also magnify the Church. Living your life properly is the way you can help build the kingdom.<br><br>An officer of Goldman Sachs, a leading investment brokerage company, recently called me, and because I was out of town, he left a voice mail message with a name I recognized as one of my former missionaries. I called the man back and offered to provide a reference for this individual but was informed that that was the last thing he needed. The young man had been hired about four years ago as he graduated from BYU. The Goldman Sachs manager called me merely to update me and report how this young, new employee was doing. And what a report it was. I was told that this former missionary was a "star of Wall Street," the "brightest young man we ever hired." I thought this businessman was simply given to superlatives until I heard more of the story. This BYU graduate had gone to work for Goldman Sachs, then had been hired away by Merrill Lynch. After about a year Goldman Sachs managed to hire him back, but it cost them about as much as the university pays for three or four finance professors. Now, the manager told me, they were really worried because this young man will be taking a leave to get an MBA at Harvard this fall, and they are afraid some other firm will hire him away when he completes his degree.<br><br>How impressed I was to get this report. I suspect a big part of this young man's bright future is not only his talent but the fact that he is trustworthy. How important it is that he be not only professionally good but morally so as well. How impressed I was that he would walk away from the kind of money he was making to pursue further education. Too many young people come to believe that education's sole value is in providing a good job with a substantial income. These things are obviously not his motivation; he seeks education because he is anxious to improve himself. He is in fierce competition with himself.<br><br>Many of you anxiously seek some of the same rewards that have come to this young man. I remind you that you needn't take shortcuts to such rewards. They will come to you as you do the right things and do honor to your family, to your community, to this university, and to the Church.<br><br>As you go forward, pursuing your place in life, I would encourage you to remember the covenants that you have made and will make in the temple. Of those, let us ponder for a moment the idea of consecration:<br><br>Consecration is a current obligation, not a promise to wait for the reestablishment of the United Order. It can be lived today as you dedicate your life to the Lord's service. You can do this by<br><br>*choosing a service-oriented career that you enjoy;<br><br>*using your profession first of all to serve your fellowman;<br><br>*acquiring resources to build your family and the kingdom of God; and<br><br>*finally, by being prepared to share not only your money but also your time, using it to pursue the kingdom-constructing activities of nurturing and cooperation.<br><br>What a difference you can make in this world by competing--where competition is called for--with honor and integrity and by serving in the kingdom with the kind of excellence that competition engenders. It is important that you do so, without worrying about the scale of the service. If you are able to serve diligently and well, even if only in what appear to be very modest places, that will suffice.<br><h2><b>III. Against Whom Should We Compete?</b></h2><br>We are really competing against ourselves, and we should do our best. Contrast the Lord's system to that of the world. Because the world can give away only the wealth and privileges that it has, it must confer its rewards upon the competitor's productivity.<br><br>The student says, "I did my best on this test and I only got a C!"<br><br>"Sorry," says the professor.<br><br>The salesman says, "I worked weeks trying to convince this client we should get his account."<br><br>Says the boss: "I really appreciate your effort, but, sorry, you failed to get the account and I'm going to have to let you go."<br><br>When we serve the Lord, He can actually judge our hearts, so the intent of our hearts can be His measure of our performance. Because men cannot accurately measure inputs, in the face of scarce resources we must base rewards on outputs. Since God knows our hearts and thoughts, He asks only that we do our best. His system of monitoring is perfect. His choices are not troubled with the imperfect or asymmetric information that distorts human transactions, or the "moral hazard" that comes from opportunistic actions taken by those whose activities are not transparent. When some people cannot be monitored, they then begin to pursue their own interests rather than those of the individuals they represent, and then they sometimes undertake activities without proper moral values.<br><br>As we serve the Lord, remember that He requires our hearts. In July of 1837, the Lord told Thomas B. Marsh: "I know thy heart, and have heard thy prayers concerning thy brethren. ... Let thy love abound unto all men" (D&amp;amp;C 112:11).<br><br>The Lord had already informed the Saints of this last dispensation that such a heart was required: "Behold, the Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind; and the willing and obedient shall eat the good of the land of Zion in these last days" (D&amp;amp;C 64:34).<br><br>David, a king of great power and wealth, once gave some advice to his most blessed and wise son, Solomon. He said: "And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him<i>with a perfect heart</i>and with a willing mind: for the Lord<i>searcheth all hearts,</i>and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts" (1 Chronicles 28:9; emphasis added).<br><br>It is true that life constrains us, almost continually, to compete in various ways with many other individuals. If we retain the right attitude toward others, such competition need not be destructive to our feelings toward or our relationships with them. Competition can be professional rather than personal. Those with whom we compete can become our friends, and with mature attitudes we can compete in a positive and healthy way. Our primary concern must not be the victory but only that we do the best we are capable of doing. Placing the victory first tempts us to use opportunistic means to extend our natural capacities. Placing personal excellence first permits us, on occasion, to lose the battle to more talented competitors but places us in good stead, if we endure to the very end, to win life's war.<br><br>In the world we measure success by rankings. During the cold war the technology competition between the U.S. and the Soviet Union called forth, among other things, an automobile race to see which of the two countries could build the faster car. The day after the two-car race, the headline in the Soviet party newspaper,<i>Pravda,</i>proclaimed: "Soviet Car Comes in Second in Major International Competition." The subheading read: "American Car Next to Last." Beware of basing your life on rankings.<br><h2><b>IV. When Should We Compete?</b></h2><br>Unfortunately, we may and must compete--or at least often compete--when we are on the job and in certain other competitive activities. There are times to cooperate and there are times to nurture. Within a team we cooperate, and when our team is competing, we are both cooperating and competing.<br><br>In some institutions we don't compete: we cooperate, build, uplift, strengthen, encourage, and nurture. The family and the ward, for example, should never be thought of as highly competitive places.<br><br>In the Church, in the family, sometimes even in a well-crafted business organization, we win only when we win together. When one person excels, we shouldn't be jealous or feel defeated because we did not personally have the victory. With the right perspective, we can share in the victory as we rejoice in the achievements of our brothers and sisters in the family, in the ward, and in the human family.<br><br>We need not feel that there is only so much room for good in the world and that we are in competition with everybody in producing it. There simply cannot be too much good in the world, too much productivity, or too much creativity. We need not feel envy for the successes of others.<br><br>If we are glad when others go wrong because that improves our competitive position, we need to heed what Elder Boyd K. Packer has said:<br><br><i>"We get conditioned to the idea that only one team or one person can win. This is not true of spiritual things. There is plenty of room in the Celestial Kingdom for everyone. We are not in competition for some few spaces. The only one we are in competition with is our former self."</i>[Quoted by Neal A. Maxwell in<i>Wherefore, Ye Must Press Forward</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1977), 107]<br><br>The world has limitless demand for productive and creative workers, citizens, and people. Every good act makes the world better, and we should be grateful for and appreciative of every individual thus contributing. Seeing competition in this way, we should always compete, we should always be striving to improve the human situation--spreading the good effects of our endeavors across a broad spectrum of humankind.<br><br>We should remember that it is winning the war that is really important. Many individual battles can be lost without permanent damage. In fact, some of life's greatest lessons and most dramatic personal progress come from losing some of life's individual battles.<br><br>In 1976 I was at the University of Arizona and so was in a position to notice a sports drama that taught a valuable lesson. The University of Arizona had an excellent baseball team, but Arizona State was to them what a certain northern stepsister institution is to us. That year the University of Arizona Wildcats were able to beat about every team they played, with the exception of the team they wanted to beat most of all. They played a three-game series against Arizona State University before the conference season began, losing all three games. They lost another three games on enemy turf in Sun Devil country. Finally, when they got their nemesis on their own field, they lost three straight again. By beating everyone else, however, they got into the College World Series. But they promptly suffered the first of two possible losses to Arizona State. They won other games and ultimately had to face the Sun Devils again in the same tournament. And, of course, this time they beat those Devils 5-1, after having lost to them 10 straight times previously. They thus advanced to the championship game, where they beat Eastern Michigan 7-1. This says something very clear about enduring to the very end.<br><br>Let us return for a moment to the question of how we should compete. When we must leave home and go into the harsh world, it is open to us to go with the Savior of the world, a willing partner in all righteous endeavors. When we do our best, maintain our honor and integrity, and still simply don't have the success we have longed for, we need not worry or let it get us down. If our partner permits us to suffer defeats, it is because He has the ability to focus on longer-term plans or because He wants us to learn some additional lessons. When He is our partner it doesn't matter whether we win all the battles. We will win the war.<br><br>We see this all through the history of man's relationship with deity. When Israel faced the apparently impossible task of defeating the hosts of the peoples of the promised land, one of the first lessons they learned under Joshua was that the Lord would fight their battles with them and that whatever temporary setbacks might be experienced, they would win the war. "And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the Lord fought for Israel" (Joshua 10:14).<br><br>But don't forget that you can't win them all. Said Solomon:<br><br><i>I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.</i>[Ecclesiastes 9:11]<br><br>When we remember that the war may extend beyond mortality and the rewards may be far greater than the short-term recognition, income, or influence we may have sought, we will not lose the eternal perspective we need to keep.<br><br>Competition can be won with the endurance and perseverance Paul described. Most people can compete intensely for short periods of time but cannot stay strong and patient year after year. Continuing without wearying, or even when we are very weary, we may be surprised at the harvest we shall reap by and by. It is my prayer that ours may be the race and the victory, but that it will be the right race and the right victory. I say this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Phillip J.

<h1>ives on Change - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In my devotional address today I am going to take the dangerous tack of speaking on a subject that everyone in the audience is already thoroughly familiar with and may even dislike. I am going to talk about change and offer a few perspectives on coping with change as individuals and as a university community. Since I am a librarian, some of you probably came today expecting me to talk about books--and so I will, but perhaps not in the context you anticipated.<br><br>When I say that everyone in the audience is already familiar with change, I am referring to what each of us experiences as the natural consequence of aging, although the experience is quite different for young people than it is for those in later stages of life. For example, a teenager looks forward to aging as an exciting adventure during which he or she will mature into a man or a woman and be entrusted with new responsibilities like driving, dating, and holding down a part-time job. The young adult looks forward to leaving the protective confines of the family to serve a mission or attend school. Those in their early twenties discover the difference between attraction and love, make eternal covenants in the temple, and then begin families of their own.<br><br>So many changes come so quickly for young people, and yet for them time seems to move very, very slowly. This is partially because in our youth we dream extravagantly and anticipate eagerly the progress of our lives. Aging before 25 is like being aboard a roller coaster slowly climbing up toward its first exhilarating peak. The majority of the ride still lies in front of us as an unknown adventure.<br><br>Unfortunately, the metaphor of the roller coaster rings true for aging after 25 as well. After 25, life rushes forward at blinding speeds with unexpected twists and turns that threaten to throw us off the track. Some of the ride is exciting, some of it is disappointing, and other parts are positively nauseating. And as the roller coaster speeds toward the conclusion of the journey, the car in which we are riding gets more and more rickety. After 30, the physical consequences of aging, the increasingly routine but hectic pace of our lives, and the growing weight of family and job responsibilities can leave us fearing change and longing for an earlier and seemingly more carefree time of life.<br><br>However, the inescapable truth is that whether we welcome change or dread it, change will occur. Understanding this, how can we cope with those changes that are so stressful? In answer to this question, I would like to offer a short story--a parable if you will.<br><h2><b>The Caterpillar and the Butterfly</b></h2><br>Here is my version of the parable of the caterpillar and the butterfly:<br><br>There were once two caterpillars, one brown and one green, who lived in the same tree and became extremely close friends. Each morning they would find each other and then settle down on a large leaf where they could eat and talk throughout the day. Munching on leaves in the cool shade of the tree, they were as happy as two friends could possibly be.<br><br>Then one morning the brown caterpillar awoke to find his friend missing. He crawled frantically from one branch to another looking for the green caterpillar, but his friend was simply nowhere to be found. Sad and lonely, the brown caterpillar finally gave up his search and selected a leaf to eat for breakfast. The next day and the day following that, the brown caterpillar spent each morning looking for his friend but with no success. Gradually he forgot about the green caterpillar altogether.<br><br>Then, one late afternoon just as the sun was setting, a beautiful butterfly landed on the same leaf where the caterpillar was resting. The caterpillar had, of course, seen butterflies before, but he had never been so close to one of these beautiful creatures. He couldn't help but contrast the delicate body and wings of the butterfly with his own thick and clumsy appearance. To his surprise, the butterfly spoke to him.<br><br>"Oh, it's so good to see you again, old friend!" said the butterfly.<br><br>"What?" responded the caterpillar in surprise. "Are you talking to me?"<br><br>"Well, of course I am," responded the butterfly. "Don't you recognize me?"<br><br>The caterpillar, puzzled and embarrassed, said: "I'm sorry, but I really don't remember having met you before. Perhaps you're mistaking me for someone else."<br><br>"No, there is no mistake," said the butterfly, "but I suppose that I have changed a lot and so I shouldn't be surprised that you don't recognize me anymore. I was once a green caterpillar, and you and I spent many days together in this very tree."<br><br>Looking at the beautiful butterfly, the caterpillar was astonished and asked, "You were once my friend the green caterpillar? But how could that be? How could a caterpillar become a butterfly? That seems impossible."<br><br>"Well, it wasn't easy," admitted the butterfly, "but when I was a caterpillar I always believed that I had the power to change if I really wanted to. And to tell you the truth, changing into a butterfly wasn't even the hardest part. The hardest part was giving up being a caterpillar." (See also Trina Paulus,<i>Hope for the Flowers</i>[New York: Paulist Press, 1972].)<br><h2><b>Personal Change and the Plan of Salvation</b></h2><br>From the gospel perspective this short story offers several important messages. First, change should not be viewed as a harsh and unrelenting enemy in our life because it is, instead, a necessary part of the plan of salvation. The opportunity to change is the great gift of our Savior, and endeavoring to change must be our lifetime's work. The reward after years of struggling to change will be a transformation more complete and wonderful than that of the caterpillar becoming a butterfly. Our transformation will be the affirmative answer to Alma's question:<br><br><i>And now behold, I ask of you, my brethren of the church, have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?</i>[Alma 5:14]<br><br>Our reward after a lifetime of struggling to be obedient to eternal laws will be to receive in our hearts and in our faces the image of Him who never changes, our Savior Jesus Christ.<br><br>Another important message from the story can be found in the butterfly's observation about changing: the hardest part is giving up being a caterpillar. The hardest part of changing for you and me is giving up who we are today. Each of us harbors in a dark corner of his or her life weaknesses with which we have become so comfortable that they now seem to be a natural part of us. And they may be, for, as Alma warns, the natural man is "carnal, sensual, and devilish" (Alma 42:10). A caterpillar becomes a butterfly by being true to its nature; change is possible for us only by overcoming our nature. The secret of our transformation lies not in genetic coding but in the power of a free agent to act for him- or herself--choosing good over evil in the hour of temptation, choosing to respond to anger or mistreatment with love, choosing to serve when service is inconvenient.<br><br>A last message from the caterpillar story is that in order to be transformed, we must endure experiences that are very, very difficult. It cannot be otherwise. I believe I can best illustrate this point by describing my experience as a parent. All of my children are grown now, and I am tremendously proud of each one of them and love them with all of my heart. But I can still remember clearly and painfully those turbulent teenage years during which my sons and daughter were struggling toward maturity. Like all young people, they faced many temptations and occasionally made decisions that disappointed me--sometimes terrified me.<br><br>I can still remember wandering around the house late at night, unable to sleep because of worry and frustration. I recall pleading with my Father in Heaven to change my children's attitudes and alter their behavior. From my perspective at the time my prayers seemed unanswered, because after a night on my knees, the next morning my kids were still the same teenagers. It was a frustrating, anxiety-ridden period of my life. My faith didn't waver, but my endurance was sometimes poor.<br><br>Over time, however, each child emerged from the trials of youth to become a responsible adult committed to keeping eternal covenants. And with the passing of time--seemingly the passing of a great storm--I have been able to look back and come to three important realizations:<br><br>First, there were times that I can clearly identify now that my Father in Heaven did intercede in the lives of my children to protect them from harm. Today I have an absolute testimony that our Father in Heaven answers prayers and that He is a God of miracles.<br><br>Second, the temptations and trials that my children experienced were a necessary part of their progress within the plan of salvation. It was never within my power nor according to my Father in Heaven's will for me to protect my children from having to make difficult choices. It is only by making those choices that any of us experience the mighty change of heart.<br><br>Third, during my children's teenage years I was in need of refining change more than they were. I have come to understand that it was only in the middle of anxiety-ridden nights that I began to love my children as much as my Savior does and that I caught a small glimpse of what it will mean to be a parent in the eternities. I have come to believe that it was in the middle of the night when I was praying for one of my children, with my heart filled with love for them, even though their behavior had disappointed me, that I began to comprehend my Savior's love for me and His extraordinary patience.<br><br>I was impatient for my children to become perfect in a short four- or five-year period of their lives whereas my Savior has been waiting half of a lifetime for me to become perfect in observing my covenants. How often has He yearned for me--and how often has He yearned for you--to overcome whatever it is that holds us back from experiencing more fully the transforming power of His Atonement. For as we are told in 2 Corinthians 5:17, "Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new."<br><h2><b>Change and the University Community</b></h2><br>I would like now to shift my focus away from the need for personal change and offer a perspective on change relative to our university. I have worked at BYU for almost 28 years. I love this school and am committed to its mission. In many respects I feel that every year at BYU is critical because every year a new group of young men and women come here seeking to strengthen their testimonies and gain an education. I have a growing sense, however, that we now are entering a particularly crucial period when our employees and our students may be required to face new challenges and reach for new opportunities.<br><br>Because I am a librarian, the most effective way I have of introducing my perspective on these new challenges and opportunities is to talk about the library. Our library is one of the nation's finest, a remarkable repository of knowledge and human expression. In our collections are 4,000-year-old clay tablets, papyrus more than 1,000 years old, manuscript books produced in monasteries over 600 years ago, and printed books from the great epochs of the Renaissance and the Reformation. All of these works--whether composed of cuneiform symbols in clay or of ink and gold leaf on vellum or of printed text on paper--have survived for hundreds of years to enable great men and women of the past to speak, in Moroni's words, as voices "out of the dust" to the students of BYU today (Moroni 10:27).<br><br>Also well preserved in our library's collections are books from the age of the Enlightenment and from the centuries that followed--the periods during which Europe and America were shaped by the Industrial Revolution and by new ideas about self-governance and religious freedom. In his fascinating work<i>Books That Changed the World,</i>Robert Downs observes that it was during these centuries that the idea of progress was linked to scientific discovery and technological innovation. Increasingly it was believed that science and technology could overcome all of the world's problems.<br><br>Evidence of the great accomplishments, as well as the unintended consequences of this reliance on technology, can be found in our library. For example, a new paper-manufacturing process introduced during the 19th century to meet the growing demand for books left the pages of those books filled with acid. Today, many works of the 19th century are turning to dust on library shelves around the world, literally silencing their authors.<br><br>The invention of the camera and sound-recording devices during the 19th and early 20th centuries made it possible to preserve not only written text but also the sights and sounds of progress. The media produced by these recording devices, however, have proven to be no more durable than acid paper. For example, a photograph must be stored in the dark and at near freezing temperatures in order to survive much more than 100 years without deteriorating.<br><br>During just the last few decades of the 20th century, enormous strides were made in the ability to record and store large volumes of text, images, and sound in digital formats. Increased emphasis was also placed on the capacity to deliver this information across high-speed networks, leading ultimately to the birth of the Internet and the World Wide Web. I can illustrate quickly the enormous potential of these developments from a library perspective.<br><br>I hold here one volume of Emmeline B. Wells' handwritten diary. Sister Wells' diary begins in 1847, when she was 18 years of age and joining the pioneer trek as they exited Nauvoo and headed across the West. The diary continues into the 20th century, when Sister Wells served as the general Relief Society president of the Church. Her diary is an inspiring record of a lifetime of faith and courage that is made freely available to any student, faculty member, or other researcher interested in the history of the Church. Because of the age and fragile nature of the diary, however, the library is somewhat cautious about how frequently it is used, and the diary cannot, of course, be taken out of Special Collections.<br><br>This CD-ROM contains a digital reproduction of Sister Well's diary and a typescript as well of each volume's text that is somewhat easier to read than the original handwriting. The digital versions on this CD-ROM will be made Web accessible so that they can be read by anyone connected to the Internet anywhere in the world, any time of the day or night. Our library is now digitally reformatting about 59 other pioneer diaries that will also be made available on the Web. Libraries throughout the world are engaged in digitizing their unique collections, which include diaries, photographs, musical recordings, and even television footage. With this global effort underway, and given enough time and goodwill, there is the real possibility that the unique holdings of every research library in the world, including our library at BYU, could become the common property of students and scholars everywhere.<br><br>With such possibilities before us, it is no wonder that many are proclaiming that we have entered a new era: the information age. Some suggest that this age will transform our world much like the Industrial Revolution did earlier. There are some dangers, however, that threaten this vision of the future. They are embedded in the very technology that makes digital libraries possible.<br><br>One of these dangers is that the media for storing digital records is remarkably fragile--far more fragile in fact than acid paper or photographs. For example, we can't be certain how long the digital version of Sister Wells' diary will survive on this CD-ROM, but it will certainly be less than 100 years--possibly less than 50. Of even greater concern is the viability of the computer hardware and software required to read the CD-ROM. Given the rapid evolution of computer technology, I suspect that CD-ROM hardware and software could be obsolete and no longer available within 20 years.<br><br>And it isn't only libraries that worry about the danger of relying on rapidly changing technology. In a recent issue of<i>Time</i>magazine dedicated to the future of technology, Stewart Brand observed that some technologies have now become self-accelerating, meaning that one generation of advance, such as a new computer chip, will be used to design its own replacement. According to Brand, self-accelerating technologies<br><br><i>create conditions that are unstable, unpredictable and unreliable. And since these particular . . . technologies drive whole sectors of society, there is a risk that civilization itself may become unstable, unpredictable and unreliable.</i>[Stewart Brand, "Is Technology Moving Too Fast?"<i>Time,</i>19 June 2000, 108]<br><br>Taking a related point of view in an article for the<i>Futurist,</i>Stephen Bertman notes that it has been 30 years since Alvin Toffler first warned in his book<i>Future Shock</i>of the psychological and biological dangers of exposing people to "too much change in too short a time." Yet during those 30 years the rate of technological and social change in our world has increased dramatically. In Bertman's opinion, we are fast approaching a rate of social change that, in his words, "can warp our behavior and our most basic values even as it desensitizes us to the metamorphosis" (Stephen Bertman, "Hyperculture: The Human Cost of Speed,"<i>The Futurist</i>32, no. 9 [December 1998]: 20). The issue of<i>Time</i>I mentioned earlier contains a shocking example of Bertman's point. In that issue an article by Joel Stein explores, without apology, the hope for technology to improve the quality of pornography (Joel Stein, "Will Cybersex Be Better Than Real Sex?"<i>Time,</i>19 June 2000, 62–64).<br><br>With Bertman's warning in mind, we have to wonder whether the information age, with all of its astounding scientific advances, will be the precursor to a new period of enlightenment during which the benefits of education will spread over the face of the earth, or will the information era usher in a new dark age during which society surrenders its ethical and moral standards in the pursuit of entertainment and pleasure. The answer is, of course, that change will occur in both directions. From a personal perspective, whether we use new technology for self-enlightenment or self-indulgence is a matter of choice, the very choice to which I referred earlier in this talk.<br><br>I believe that from a university perspective, the information age may open new opportunities for BYU to fulfill its mission more effectively than ever before. Remember that the university's mission "is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life." And "to succeed in this mission the university must provide an environment enlightened by living prophets and sustained by those moral virtues which characterize the life and teachings of the Son of God" (<i>The Mission of Brigham Young University,</i>4 November 1981, 1). Of all the great institutions of higher education in the world, BYU and the other CES schools are unique in espousing this mission, being guided by living prophets.<br><br>Our prophet today, Gordon B. Hinckley, addressed a number of questions relative to BYU in the priesthood session of the October 1999 general conference. Speaking about the limitation on how many students can be accommodated on our Provo campus, President Hinckley said:<br><br><i>If we cannot give to all, let us give to as many as we can. The number who can be accommodated on campus is finite, but the influence of the university is infinite. Tremendous efforts are being made to enlarge and extend that influence.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley, "Why We Do Some of the Things We Do,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1999, 52]<br><br>During our 1999 Annual University Conference, President Merrill J. Bateman announced four institutional objectives for the university, the third of which was to "Extend the blessings of learning to members of the Church in all parts of the world" ("From Pioneer Roots to a World-Class, Worldwide Institution," Brigham Young University, 23 August 1999, 10; at http://speeches-dev.byu.edu/auc/99AUC_Bateman.pdf).<br><br>In the library, we will work to increase BYU's influence and extend the blessings of learning by using new technologies to make available those materials that support education and testify of eternal truths--materials like the diaries of our pioneer ancestors. In a world where the Internet is all but overwhelmed by trivia and pornography, our library's contribution will be to make available materials of enduring value. I am confident that BYU's faculty will use technology to further new modes of teaching that will both improve the quality of education on our campus and make education more broadly accessible to young people throughout the world. The unique contribution of our faculty will be to make secular learning available within the light of the restored gospel.<br><br>I believe that the impact of BYU on a world in danger of losing its ethical and moral foundations will be inestimable. Progress should never be measured in terms of scientific and technological advancement but only in terms of the human condition. The solutions to mankind's problems will be found by applying gospel principles, not through technology. I also believe that extending BYU's influence will be one of the most complex and difficult tasks ever undertaken at the university. It will require that every employee search for ways of performing his or her assignment more effectively, including using new technology. And it may be that as we seek to change the way we work we will need to remember the observation of the butterfly: the most difficult part of changing is giving up being a caterpillar.<br><h2><b>A Challenge to BYU Students</b></h2><br>In the few minutes remaining, I would like to offer one more perspective on change for the students of the university by relating an experience from the life of my grandmother, Thelma Bean Waddoups. My grandmother grew up in the small Idaho town of Herbert. About 20 miles south of Rexburg, Herbert consisted of nothing more than widely separated farmhouses--typically log cabins--and two town buildings. One of the town buildings was the post office. The other served as a one-room schoolhouse from Monday through Friday, as a dance hall on Saturday, and as an LDS meetinghouse on Sunday.<br><br>My great-grandfather, Charles Bean, was a man of tremendous imagination and industry who did whatever was required to support his wife and children. At this point in his life, Charlie Bean was homesteading new farmland with the hope of improving his family's living circumstances. In 1910 my grandmother Thelma began school in Herbert at the age of six. Since transportation near the turn of the century was limited to riding a horse, driving a buggy, or walking, she typically walked the two miles to and from her schoolhouse.<br><br>The schoolteacher sold Bibles as a part-time job. In hopes of motivating his students, he offered to give one of his Bibles at Christmastime to the child who had the best attendance record and the best grades. In a poor Idaho farm community in 1910, it would have been a magnificent thing for a young child to own a book of her own, particularly if the book were the Bible. Thelma determined that the Bible would be hers, even though she was much younger than most of the other children in the school.<br><br>That fall, in the small isolated town of Herbert, she attended school without missing a day. Those of you familiar with the weather around Rexburg will be more impressed by the accomplishment of this young girl who walked four miles a day during the storms of November and December. Excited by the opportunity of learning, Thelma found that she was naturally a good student. By applying herself, she earned the best grades in the school. As Christmas approached, she was confident that the coveted Bible would be hers.<br><br>Finally, when the day arrived for the teacher to award his prize, my great-grandparents were reluctant to let Thelma make the journey to school. There had been a particularly severe storm the night before, and the snow was so deep that it was nearly impossible for a man or a horse to travel. However, the crust on the snow was firm enough that a small girl could walk on top without falling through. And so my great-grandfather had the choice of either letting his young daughter make the journey alone or keeping her home--undoubtedly causing her to lose the Bible. He finally conceded to let her try it on her own, and my great-grandmother, Agnes Leatham Bean, sat by the window and watched her daughter with a spyglass for as long as she was in sight.<br><br>After a long, cold journey, little Thelma eventually arrived safely at school, eager to receive her reward. When the time came, however, the teacher told her that even though she had the best attendance record and the highest grades in school, he had decided not to give the Bible to her because a young girl her age couldn't read well enough nor fully appreciate the scriptures. The teacher gave the prize to another student.<br><br>As you can imagine, Thelma made the long journey home through the snow that day in tears. It seemed that all of her walking and all of her studying had earned her nothing. Great-grandfather Bean was overwhelmed with pity for his daughter, and even though he, like most farmers of that time, had almost no cash, he scraped together enough to buy my grandmother a Bible--from her teacher, no less--for Christmas. It was this Bible that she has kept to this day and passed down to our family as a testimony of how important the scriptures of our Lord are and how hard we must work to earn them.<br><br>In the many years that followed, my grandmother lived to watch on television as a man walked on the moon. She endured two world wars and raised a family during the Great Depression. With no more than a high school education from Ricks, she became the registrar for Utah State University and sat in councils with deans and university presidents. Having hardly ventured out of Idaho as a girl, she served missions with my grandfather in Canada and New Zealand. I believe that through this life of enormous change, she was sustained by the physical, emotional, and spiritual strength she gained as a young girl walking through the snow to school in pursuit of the word of God.<br><br>It seems likely, given the pace of our world today, that virtually every student in this audience will experience more change during their lifetime than my grandmother has during hers. How you react to those changes will determine whether you view your life as an ever-expanding set of opportunities or a never-ending series of disappointments. The choice will be yours.<br><br>If, like my grandmother, you set high expectations for yourself and work with energy and discipline toward achieving those goals, then you will be transformed into a person that you can scarcely imagine today. If, like her, your guiding desire is to obtain the word of God, then, even though you experience some disappointments in life, your Father in Heaven will make up the difference. Now is the time, while you are a student at BYU, to develop the physical, emotional, and spiritual strength that will sustain you through all of the changes to come. I testify to you that your Father in Heaven is aware of your desires for the future and your struggles to become more obedient. I testify to you that your Father in Heaven loves you and that His spirit will strive with you always, and I bear this testimony in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Randy J.

<h1>t Person, the Right Place, the Right Time: Guidelines for Wisely Choosing a Spouse - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In January of 1972, after eating at a nice restaurant and attending the Osmonds in concert, I asked my wife to marry me. She said, "No." A little over a month later, as I was walking her home from Church, she said, "Well, are you going to marry me or am I going to have to get a job?" I wisely agreed to marry her. She had, very sensibly, not accepted my invitation too quickly and been careful to make sure she had chosen the right man. She understood President Gordon B. Hinckley's counsel: "This will be the most important decision of your life, the individual whom you marry. ... Marry the right person in the right place at the right time" ("Life's Obligations,"<i>Ensign,</i>February 1999, 2).<br><br>Where is the right place? Who is the right person? When is the right time? Fortunately, President Hinckley and others have given us inspired counsel concerning these questions, and more than 60 years of research in the social sciences adds another witness to their counsel. Although the guidance I am going to share today is primarily for unmarried individuals, much of what I say can help married couples continue to strengthen their marriages.<br><h2><b>The Right Place</b></h2><br>The right place is, of course, the temple. "There is no substitute for marrying in the temple," counsels President Hinckley. "It is the only place under the heavens where marriage can be solemnized for eternity. Don't cheat yourself. Don't cheat your companion. Don't shortchange your lives" ("Life's Obligations," 2).<br><h2><b>The Right Person</b></h2><br>A person committed to temple marriage must then ask: "Whom should I marry?" "How do I identify the right person for me?"<br><br>Everyone has advice for single people considering marriage. The Beatles sang: "All you need is love, love; love is all you need." Newsstand magazines claim: "Good communication is all you<i>really</i>need." Television and film media seem to shout: "Find someone who is good looking, someone who really 'turns you on'; then you'll be happy!"<br><br>We actually have a great deal of advice from sources a lot better than the Beatles, magazines, or television and films. The words of the Savior in the scriptures and the teachings of inspired ancient and modern prophets set us on the right path. This divine and prophetic counsel is supported by more than 60 years of social science research on premarital predictors of later marital quality and stability. First let us look at what the scriptures and General Authorities teach about spouse selection. Then let us see how the results of research on premarital phenomenon that influence later marital success can be a "second witness."<br><br>Let me make two things clear about what is meant by "the right person." First, movies, plays, and fiction sometimes lead us astray with the idea there is a "one and only" somewhere out there with whom we made a covenant to marry in the premortal existence. We think finding a mate is simply a matter of waiting for "some enchanted evening," locking eyes with someone "across a crowded room," heading off hand-in-hand to the closest temple--probably singing the rest of the score from<i>South Pacific--</i>and then living happily ever after. No matter how romantic this idea is, it is not supported by prophetic counsel. President Spencer W. Kimball said this:<br><br><i>"Soul mates" are fiction and an illusion; and while every young man and young woman will seek with all diligence and prayerfulness to find a mate with whom life can be most compatible and beautiful, yet it is certain that almost any good man and any good woman can have happiness and a successful marriage if both are willing to pay the price.</i>["Marriage and Divorce," in<i>Speeches of the Year, 1976</i>(Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University, 1977), 146]<br><br>Evidently, seeking for a mate is not a matter of waiting for that "one and only" to walk by and grab you.<br><h2><b>Being the Right Person</b></h2><br>Second, one of the most important principles we learn from the scriptures to help us choose an eternal companion is articulated by the Savior in Matthew 7:3–5:<br><br><i>And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?</i><br><br><i>Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?</i><br><br><i>Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.</i><br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell spoke more specifically to those in families, including those in the courtship stage, when he said:<br><br><i>If the choice is between reforming other Church members</i>[including fiancés, fiancées, spouses, children]<i>or ourselves, is there really any question about where we should begin? The key is to have our eyes wide open to our own faults and partially closed to the faults of others--not the other way around! The imperfections of others never release us from the need to work on our own shortcomings.</i>["A Brother Offended,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1982, 39]<br><br>Thus, as you think about the prophetic counsel and the research I will now discuss on choosing a spouse, you need first to apply the ideas and counsel to yourself. Then you can more appropriately critique another's rightness for you.<br><h2><b>Finding the Right Person</b></h2><br>The first quality many young people look for in a potential spouse is someone with whom they can "fall in love," which often means someone for whom they feel a strong physical attraction. Although love is more than physical attraction, being physically attracted to a potential spouse is not bad. Indeed, Elder Bruce R. McConkie said, "The right person is someone for whom the natural and wholesome and normal affection that should exist does exist." Then he went on to add: "It is the person who is living so that he or she can go to the temple of God and make the covenants that we there make" (<i>CR,</i>October 1955, 13).<br><br>Being "in love" and attracted to a person is a good start, but clearly not enough. President Gordon B. Hinckley suggested several other factors we should keep in mind:<br><br><i>Choose a companion of your own faith. You are much more likely to be happy. Choose a companion you can always honor, you can always respect, one who will complement you in your own life, one to whom you can give your entire heart, your entire love, your entire allegiance, your entire loyalty.</i>[Hinckley, "Life's Obligations, 2]<br><br>Elder Richard G. Scott suggested that in a potential spouse we should look for<br><br><i>essential attributes that bring happiness: a deep love of the Lord and of His commandments, a determination to live them, one that is kindly understanding, forgiving of others, and willing to give of self, with the desire to have a family crowned with beautiful children and a commitment to teach them the principles of truth in the home.</i>["Receive the Temple Blessings,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1999, 26]<br><br>More than 60 years of research proposes several factors that both witness and complement the attributes outlined by President Hinckley and Elder Scott. That research suggests what my colleague Dr. Jeff Larson has called "the marriage triangle" that we need to look at in choosing a spouse (see Thomas B. Holman and Associates,<i>Premarital Prediction of Marital Quality or Breakup: Research, Theory, and Practice</i>[New York: Plenum, in press]). These factors are: first, the individual attributes and core values of the person; second, the quality of the relationship we are able to build with the person; and third, the person's past and present circumstances and environments. Let's consider each of these.<br><br>First, we need to know a lot about the person we are thinking of marrying. As Elder Scott notes, the beliefs the person has about family life matter, and research confirms this. The more the person values marriage and family life, the better the marriage will be. President Hinckley admonishes us to choose a person we can honor, respect, and give our whole heart, love, allegiance, and loyalty to. The research shows that this kind of person will have a healthy sense of self-respect, maturity, self-control, and good mental and emotional health.<br><h2><b>The Right Relationship</b></h2><br>President Hinckley suggested you choose a person "who will complement you," and Elder Scott says our choice should be a person who "is kindly understanding [and] forgiving of others." Thus, we need to find a person not only of good character, but a person with whom we can have a good relationship.<br><br>Two hallmarks of good premarital relationships that Church leaders have stressed are love and communication. These two things help couples solve problems, resolve differences, and increase agreement on important issues. President Spencer W. Kimball helped a young couple on the verge of marriage with this counsel:<br><br><i>The love of which the Lord speaks is not only physical attraction, but also faith, confidence, understanding, and partnership. It is devotion and companionship, parenthood, common ideals, and standards. It is cleanliness of life and sacrifice and unselfishness. This kind of love never tires nor wanes. It lives on through sickness and sorrow, through prosperity and privation, through accomplishment and disappointment, through time and eternity. ... Today it is a demonstrative love, but in the tomorrows of ten, thirty, fifty years it will be a far greater and more intensified love, grown quieter and more dignified with the years of sacrifice, suffering, joys, and consecration to each other, to your family, and to the kingdom of God.</i>["An Apostle Speaks About Marriage to John and Mary,"<i>Improvement Era,</i>February 1949, 76; also "John and Mary, Beginning Life Together,"<i>New Era,</i>June 1975, 7–8]<br><br>Researchers have also found that the greater the love couples have in their relationships before they marry, the more successful their marriages. However, one researcher reviewed dozens of studies on love and found that there is both "immature love" and "mature love." Mature love, she declared, is the kind of love needed for successful marriage and family life (Patricia Noller, "What Is This Thing Called Love? Defining the Love That Supports Marriage and Family,"<i>Personal Relations</i>3 [1996]: 97–115). Love, whether immature or mature, has three aspects--how love feels; how you think about love; and how you behave, or act, when in love.<br><div align="left"><br><h2><b>Aspects of Love in the Social Sciences</b></h2><br></div><br><i>I.

But the love of which Church leaders speak goes beyond the love even the best social science research has discovered. It includes, as President Kimball noted, a "consecration" to partner, to family, and also to the kingdom of God. This kind of love is intimately connected to covenants and to our love of the Lord. It is a love between couples "that binds them to each other and to the Lord" (Bruce Hafen, "Covenant Marriage,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1996, 28). This kind of love eschews the lust and selfishness of premarital sex and unlawful cohabitation. This kind of love cares more about the other person than the self.<br><br>The way we communicate in dating and courtship usually influences how our partner will feel about us and our relationship. Relationships are established upon the comfort and trust created by sincere communication. Research notes that positive communication, practiced in dating and courtship relationships, increases the likelihood of greater commitment, better conflict resolution, and more love between partners in their marriage.<br><br>Good communication begins with a righteous heart. "Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh," said the Lord Jesus Christ (Matthew 12:34). On the other hand, communication from a selfish heart is generally just manipulation. Elder Marvin J. Ashton adds:<br><br><i>If we would know true love and understanding one for another, we must realize that communication is more than a sharing of words. It is the</i>wise<i>sharing of emotions, feelings, and concerns. It is the sharing of oneself totally.</i>["Family Communications,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1976, 52; emphasis in original]<br><h2><b>Past and Present Circumstances</b></h2><br>Besides checking out the person's character and your ability to create a good couple relationship with them, you need to consider past and present family relationships. President David O. McKay taught: "In choosing a companion, it is necessary to study the disposition, the inheritance, and training of the one with whom you are contemplating making life's journey" (<i>GI,</i>459).<br><br>Research supports President McKay's counsel. Good family environments and family relationships tend to lead to good quality marriages by the children; poor family environments and family relationships often result in poor marriages by the children from these homes. Young adults from divorced families, for example, may experience more depression and anger and have trust or commitment issues as a result of the trauma of parental divorce. Some individuals--whether their parents divorced or not--may have been exposed to poor models of communication and conflict resolution in their families. Individuals from families that were emotionally cold and distant, chaotic, dangerous, unpredictable, detached, full of conflict, or where addictions or violence were chronic problems may need special help in overcoming such an upbringing.<br><br>However, one whose family background is less than perfect must never feel that he or she is "damaged goods" and cannot have a good marriage. Nor should such a person be automatically eliminated from another's "pool of eligible spouses." We are not doomed to suffer the consequences of our parents' iniquities "unto the third and fourth generation." The very scriptures that warn of wickedness being passed on to the third and fourth generation also show the way out of a troubled family background. Doctrine and Covenants 124:50 tells us that the iniquities of the fathers will be visited upon the heads of the children "so long as they [the children] repent not, and hate me." Thus repentance and loving the Lord help free us from the sins of our parents. What is most important is that the person has turned from the "wicked traditions" of the parents and is striving to keep the Lord's commandments (Alma 23:3).<br><h2><b>The Right Time</b></h2><br>When it comes to determining "the right time," at least two questions need to be asked and answered. First, when is the right time of life to get married? Second, how much time should I spend in the process of going "from first date to chosen mate"? Let me briefly address these issues.<br><br>Years of research suggest that marriage has the fewest risks of later problems when people marry in their twenties. Marrying in your teens or into your thirties simply increases the risk factors associated with poorer marital quality and stability.<br><br>President Harold B. Lee helps us understand when the best time in life is to marry. He said:<br><br><i>Now don't misunderstand me. I am not trying to urge you younger men to marry too early. I think therein is one of the hazards of today's living. We don't want a young man to think of marriage until he is able to take care of a family, to have an institution of his own, to be independent. He must make sure that he has found the girl of his choice, they have gone together long enough that they know each other, and that they know each other's faults and they still love each other....</i><br><br><i>Please don't misunderstand what we are saying; but, brethren, think more seriously about the obligations of marriage for those who bear the holy priesthood at a time when marriage should be the expectation of every man who understands</i>[his]<i>responsibility.</i>["Priesthood Address,"<i>Ensign,</i>January 1974, 100]<br><br>Sisters also need to wait until they are mature enough to assume the responsibilities of a wife and mother, without waiting too long while pursuing less important things.<br><h2><b>The ABCs of Courtship</b></h2><br>How much time does it take to move through the process of finding the right person and preparing to marry him or her in the temple? Two research projects involving largely BYU students show what couples believe or have found to work for them. These two studies show that the average time from first date to temple marriage is about nine to 10 months. Some couples move much faster, some considerably slower. On average, three to four months of that nine to 10 months is the engagement. In a study of LDS couples married eight years, and in another study of single BYU students asked what the ideal length of an engagement should be, the vast majority think that three to four months is about right. Don't take these numbers as goals you must meet. What the Brethren and the research do seem to suggest is that you can go too fast or too slow through the process. There are, for example, discernible stages that most couples need to go through on the path from first date to chosen mate. We might call these stages the "ABCs of courtship," and there are certain tasks you need to accomplish in each stage (George Levinger, "Development and Change," in Harold H. Kelley et al.,<i>Close Relationships</i>[New York: W. H. Freeman, 1983], 321).<br><br>A is the Attraction and Acquaintance stage. Research on LDS students by my colleague Dr. Craig Ostler, in the Department of Religious Education, shows initial attraction usually consists of physical attraction, attraction to the person's personality, and/or attraction to their perceived spiritual qualities. According to Brother Ostler's research, LDS young people are most able to move from initial attraction to acquaintance and the start of a relationship if both the male and female are seeking, sending, and receiving what he called "interest cues and attraction strategies" (Craig J. Ostler, "Initiating Premarital Heterosexual Relationships: A Qualitative Study of Mate Selection Process from a Religiously Conservative Population" [Ph.D. dissertation, Brigham Young University, 1995]). Thus relationships generally develop only when you are seeking to know if a person is interested; sending interest cues appropriately; and receiving back, or understanding how to interpret the other person's interest in you, or lack thereof. One who is deficient in one or more of these processes finds that relationships tend not to develop, and one or both partners can become very frustrated. Dr. Ostler found that the females especially understood what they needed to do--and they were willing to teach roommates who were frustrated. They said, "What you do is touch him on the arm, look him in the eye, and laugh at his jokes. Within a few days he will be asking you out."<br><br>When the seeking, sending, and receiving is done in sync--in other words, both people are seeking, sending, and receiving the same messages--the couple moves to the B or Build-Up Stage. At this point the couple gets to know each other and checks out the person to see if he or she is the right person for them. Research by two of my master's students--EmRee Pugmire and Nancy McLaughlin--has shown that, generally speaking, LDS males and females move through this stage best when a friendship is developed first; when both persons feel they are full and equal partners in the growing relationship; when this friendship happens before much, if any, physical involvement has occurred; and when both people are relaxed and not worrying about whether this particular relationship is "the one" and just kind of let things happen.<br><br>If all these things happen, then the couple is ready to move to the C stage, the stage of Consolidation, Continuation, and mutual Commitment to the eternal relationship.<br><h2><b>Making the Decision</b></h2><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley has some counsel about this stage:<br><br><i>I hope you will not put off marriage too long. I do not speak so much to the young women as to the young men whose prerogative and responsibility it is to take the lead in this matter. Don't go on endlessly in a frivolous dating game. Look for a choice companion, one you can love, honor, and respect, and make a decision.</i>["Thou Shalt Not Covet,"<i>Ensign,</i>March 1990, 6]<br><br>We must finally "make a decision," as President Hinckley says. In doing this, most Latter-day Saints want a spiritual confirmation that they are making a wise commitment. As you seek a spiritual confirmation, you need to keep at least five things in mind.<br><br>First, be worthy to receive the inspiration you need. Elder Boyd K. Packer reminds us that if we "desire the inspiration of the Lord in this crucial decision, [we] must live the standards of the Church" (<i>Eternal Love</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1973], 11).<br><br>Second, understand the balance between agency and inspiration. As Elder Bruce R. McConkie said, "We make our own choices, and then we present the matter to the Lord and get his approving, ratifying seal" ("Agency or Inspiration?"<i>New Era,</i>January 1975, 42).<br><br>The experience of one young man illustrates this:<br><br><i>There are two things in my life that I've always felt would be important: a career and marriage. Yet at the time I didn't feel like I was getting a response. I prayed, "Heavenly Father, this is so important, I need to know whether or not it's right." Then, toward the end of our courtship, I went to the temple. I was so frustrated because I wasn't getting an answer either way. After praying and waiting for an answer, I got more frustrated and gave up. That was when an impression came to me: "You already know the answer." Then I realized that God had answered my prayers. The decision to marry Becky always made sense and felt right. I can see now that God had been telling me in my heart and in my mind that it was a good decision. And later, at the time of the ceremony, I had another confirmation that what I was doing was right.</i><br><br>Third, seek multiple witnesses. The scriptures teach us that "in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established" (2 Corinthians 13:1; D&amp;amp;C 6:28). A spiritual witness can be confirmed a second or greater time at the altar in the temple, as noted above; in prayer by the Spirit again; in discussions with parents, a bishop, or a trusted friend; while partaking of the sacrament; or in any number of circumstances.<br><br>Fourth, learn to discern between inspiration, infatuation, desperation, and a desire to please others. Inspiration comes as explained above: when one is living worthy, when one is exercising agency and studying it all out carefully, and when one's decisions are confirmed by multiple spiritual enlightenments and peaceful feelings (see D&amp;amp;C 6:15, 22–23). Infatuation is usually manifest by the immature "love" I discussed earlier--that including great anxiety, possessiveness, selfishness, clinging, and overdependence. Infatuation may be more likely with individuals who lack emotional and spiritual maturity. Desperation is often associated with social or cultural circumstances that create an atmosphere (at least in the person's mind) of "now or never." Pressure from peers, family, and cultural norms may create a sense of desperation that leads to an unwise decision. A desire to get away from an unpleasant family situation or fear of failure in school or work situations can also cause someone to look desperately to marriage as a way out of a problem. On the other hand, pressure from peers, family, and cultural norms may create a situation where you put off marriage for fear that others will think you are just a "Molly Mormon" or a "Norman the Mormon" who doesn't "understand" that marriage is "old-fashioned" and can "ruin your career." Such pressures to marry or not marry often create fears and anxieties that "speak" so loudly in our minds that we cannot hear the still, small whisperings of the Spirit.<br><br>Fifth, the spiritual confirmation needs to come to both parties involved. A person should not feel that if his or her partner receives a confirmation, that he or she is therefore released from the necessity of seeking a similar confirmation. Elder Dallin H. Oaks discussed this issue:<br><br><i>If a revelation is outside the limits of stewardship, you know it is not from the Lord, and you are not bound by it. I have heard of cases where a young man told a young woman she should marry him because he had received a revelation that she was to be his eternal companion. If this is a true revelation, it will be confirmed directly to the woman if she seeks to know. In the meantime, she is under no obligation to heed it. She should seek her own guidance and make up her own mind. The man can receive revelation to guide his own actions, but he cannot properly receive revelation to direct hers. She is outside his stewardship.</i>["Revelation,"<i>1981–82 BYU Fireside and Devotional Speeches</i>(Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University, 1982), 25]<br><h2><b>The D and E of Relationship Development</b></h2><br>Not all relationships end in marriage, and rightly so. Therefore we need to understand not only the ABCs of courtship but also the D and E stages of courtship: Deterioration and Ending. The D and E phases of relationship development are possibly the most difficult to deal with. Relationships, of course, can "deteriorate" and "end" very quickly--after only a few minutes of acquaintance or at any stage of development. But breaking up a relationship that has grown toward a sense of interdependence and possible thoughts of marriage are particularly difficult to end.<br><br>If it is right to break off a relationship, how can that be done so as to cause the least hurt? The revelation given by the Lord to Joseph Smith and contained in section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants provides excellent counsel not only for strengthening but also ending a relationship. Especially helpful is the counsel contained in these verses:<br><br><i>No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned;</i><br><br><i>By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guile--</i><br><br><i>Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy;</i><br><br><i>That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords of death.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:41–44]<br><br>Verses 41 and 42 teach us that we should not attempt to continue a relationship by any unrighteous means. A partner should not be coerced into staying in a relationship, nor should we ever feel coerced. Furthermore, when a relationship should end, the principles articulated in verses 41 and 42 can be a guide for dealing with the hurt and emotion that may result. One may need to be very long-suffering, gentle, meek, and kind with a partner who does not understand or resists the change. The counsel given in verses 43 and 44 may seem extreme, but when considered carefully, it is some of the best counsel we can get for ending a relationship. To reprove means "to correct," and betimes means "early on." Thus, when "pure knowledge," received by the Holy Ghost, helps us understand that a relationship must end, we should "correct" the situation (end the relationship) quickly and not let it drag on. The word<i>sharply</i>can mean "with clarity"--think of a sharp picture--rather than "with severity," as it is most often interpreted. Thus, while being as loving and kind as we can, we should make it clear that the relationship is ending and why--rather than "beating around the bush," hoping the partner will get the message. Again, this should be done with kindness, meekness, and love unfeigned; recognizing that even if the partner has hurt us in some way, she or he is a beloved child of God who must be treated in a Christlike manner.<br><br>If one is the "breakee" rather than the "breaker," the same counsel applies: This partner you believe you love should not be coerced or forced in any way to continue if she or he does not want to continue. Even if the emotional hurt you feel is strong, you need to back off, not try to hurt the partner back in some way, and allow yourself time to heal.<br><br>Breaking up is not the end of the world. Great learning and maturity can come from surviving a premarital breakup. If one initiates or goes through a breakup with as much Christlike behavior and feelings as possible, and allows himself or herself to be healed by the peace of the Spirit, that person is then more ready to move on to a relationship that can result in an eternal marriage--but not too quickly, mind you.<br><h2><b>Helps for Choosing the Right Person, the Right Place, and the Right Time</b></h2><br>The Church and BYU have some wonderful resources to help you choose the right person, the right place, and the right time. Let me note three of them:<br><br>1. Most institutes of religion and Church universities will have a religion course numbered 234 and titled Preparation for a Celestial Marriage. It is my understanding that a new student text for the course is coming out this fall. I encourage you to take this course.<br><br>2. The Family Studies Center at Brigham Young University has a Web site designed specifically to provide resources for couples preparing for marriage. It is the Before Forever site. Its URL is http://marriageinfo.byu.edu. Before Forever provides comprehensive and ready-to-use information online to help LDS couples better plan their future marriage. Before Forever is not a dating service or a counseling center. The site offers publications such as<i>Ensign</i>articles, books, and speeches about various marital and premarital topics; work sheets about different premarital and marital issues; and news and information about marriage and family events.<br><br>3. Another Family Studies Center Web site contains a survey called the RELATionship Evaluation, or RELATE, which you and your partner can complete online. Within minutes you will receive feedback online regarding the strengths and work areas in your relationship. RELATE is designed for unmarried and newly married couples, and we will soon have adolescent, remarriage, and mature adult versions available. Also, it will soon be available online in Spanish and Portuguese. RELATE's URL is http://relate.byu.edu.<br><h2><b>The Right Person Is Not Perfect--Yet</b></h2><br>Our son Matt recently married a wonderful young woman from Oregon, and as my wife, Linda, and I were driving to the reception in Oregon, we reminisced about our own courtship and marriage. The more we talked, the more I remembered how immature I had been when we married.<br><br>Finally, in bewilderment, I asked Linda, "Why did you marry me?"<br><br>Her simple answer was, "I saw potential."<br><br>As we search for a mate with whom we can spend the eternities, therefore, we would do well to remember Elder Richard G. Scott's counsel that mirrors my wife's comments:<br><br><i>I suggest that you not ignore many possible candidates who are still developing these attributes, seeking the one who is perfected in them. You will likely not find that perfect person, and if you did, there would certainly be no interest in you. These attributes are best polished together as husband and wife.</i>["Receive the Temple Blessings,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1999, 26]<br><br>That you may "marry the right person in the right place at the right time" is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Thomas B.

<h1>ounded in Light and Truth - Henry B. Eyring - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am grateful to be with you at the start of this Education Week. All those who have made the arrangements and those who will teach and perform deserve our praise and thanks. I am grateful for your attendance, which for many required substantial sacrifice. And I offer my thanks and admiration to those who have taken time to participate at a distance through what seems to be an unending stream of the miracles of electronic communication. We welcome you warmly.<br><br>One glance at the newspaper or at the television tells us that we live in stormy times. One thought of our families grips our hearts with concern for the forces of error that beat upon them. All of us know that we must build our lives on a solid foundation of truth to be safe. And we are under covenant to be witnesses of truth to others as long as we may live. It won't protect them just to have our witness of truth unless they build their lives on it. So there are few questions as important as this one: "How does a person build a life founded on truth?" It won't surprise you that the answer is simple enough for a child to understand, but that applying it is easy only for a person who has the heart of a child.<br><br>Jesus Christ answered the question of how to build on a foundation of truth with a story. You not only can remember it, but you can visualize it--especially if you've ever lived in a floodplain or in tornado country:<br><br><i>Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:</i><br><br><i>And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.</i><br><br><i>And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:</i><br><br><i>And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.</i>[Matthew 7:24–27]<br><h2>A Foundation of Truth</h2><br>Obedience to commandments is the way we build a foundation of truth. Here is the way that works, in words that are so simple a child could understand. The truth of most worth is to know God our Heavenly Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and Their plan for us to have eternal life with them in families. When God communicates that priceless truth to us, He does it by the Spirit of Truth. We have to ask for it in prayer. Then He sends us a small part of that truth by the Spirit. It comes to our hearts and minds. It feels good, like the light from the sun shining through the clouds on a dark day. He sends truth line upon line, like the lines on the page of a book. Each time a line of truth comes to us, we get to choose what we will do about the light and truth God has sent to us. If we try hard to do what that truth requires of us, God will send more light and more truth. It will go on, line after line, as long as we choose to obey the truth. That is why the Savior said that the man who obeyed His commandments built on a rock so solid that no storm or flood could hurt his house.<br><br>In another place in the scriptures, the Lord described in a beautiful way how that foundation could be built so that we could finally come to know all He knows and become like Him and our Heavenly Father. Listen to His words. His words are truth. And listen to see if something comes into your mind that you should do, because these words are true.<br><br><i>I give unto you these sayings that you may understand and know how to worship, and know what you worship, that you may come unto the Father in my name, and in due time receive of his fulness.</i><br><br><i>For if you keep my commandments you shall receive of his fulness, and be glorified in me as I am in the Father; therefore, I say unto you, you shall receive grace for grace.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 93:19–20]<br><br>And then a few verses later the Lord says:<br><br><i>And truth is knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come;</i><br><br><i>And whatsoever is more or less than this is the spirit of that wicked one who was a liar from the beginning.</i><br><br><i>The Spirit of truth is of God. I am the Spirit of truth, and John bore record of me, saying: He received a fulness of truth, yea, even of all truth;</i><br><br><i>And no man receiveth a fulness unless he keepeth his commandments.</i><br><br><i>He that keepeth his commandments receiveth truth and light, until he is glorified in truth and knoweth all things.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 93:24–28]<br><br>Now you can understand why President Joseph F. Smith made building on a foundation of truth sound like a long list of things to do. He seems to be describing work rather than the exciting adventure that it is. I remember President Benson saying with a smile about his service, "I love this work. And it is work." Here is President Smith's description of the work it takes to build an imperishable foundation of truth. You will notice that the work is simple obedience. It is not complicated things--it is not fancy things or getting great spiritual manifestations. This is work within the abilities of the most humble and the least educated. Here is his list:<br><br><i>But the men and the women who are honest before God, who humbly plod along, doing their duty, paying their tithing, and exercising that pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father, which is to visit the fatherless and the widows in their afflictions and to keep oneself unspotted from the world, and who help look after the poor; and who honor the holy Priesthood, who do not run into excesses, who are prayerful in their families, and who acknowledge the Lord in their hearts, they will build up a foundation that the gates of hell cannot prevail against; and if the floods come and the storms beat upon their house, it shall not fall, for it will be built upon the rock of eternal truth.</i>[<i>GD,</i>7–8]<br><br>It sounds so simple to build on a foundation of truth that you may wonder why everyone doesn't succeed. For one thing, it takes great humility. It is hard to repent, to admit you are wrong on faith alone, before the coming of the evidence of a feeling of being forgiven and the appearance of light. But that is the way it has to be. First comes obedience, and then come the confirming assurances, the revelation of truth, and the blessing of light.<br><br>That is so because God gave us agency--not just as a right, but as a necessity. We must choose with our agency to obey in faith that the promised blessing will come, that the promise is true because it comes from God. You remember the words of the scripture in Ether 12 that tell us both why that is hard and why it is necessary:<br><br><i>Wherefore, whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a better world, yea, even a place at the right hand of God, which hope cometh of faith, maketh an anchor to the souls of men, which would make them sure and steadfast, always abounding in good works, being led to glorify God.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that Ether did prophesy great and marvelous things unto the people, which they did not believe, because they saw them not.</i><br><br><i>And now, I, Moroni, would speak somewhat concerning these things; I would show unto the world that faith is things which are hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith.</i>[Ether 12:4–6]<br><br>There is another reason why it is not easy for the proud to build on a foundation of truth. It is because the enemy of righteousness also works in little steps--steps so small that they are hard to notice if you are thinking only about yourself and how great you are. Just as truth is given to us line upon line and the light brightens slowly as we obey, even so, as we disobey, our testimony of truth lessens almost imperceptibly, little by little, and darkness descends so slowly that the proud may easily deny that anything is changing.<br><br>I have heard the boast of a man who walked away from the Church slowly. At first he just stopped teaching his Sunday School class, then he stayed away from Church, and then he forgot to pay tithing now and then. Along the way he would say to me: "I feel just as spiritual as I did before I stopped those things and just as much at peace. Besides, I enjoy Sundays more than I did. It's more a day of rest." Or, "I think I've been blessed temporally as much or more as I was when I was paying tithing." He could not sense the difference, but I could. The light in his eyes and even the shine in his countenance was dimming. He could not tell, since one of the effects of disobeying God seems to be the creation of just enough spiritual anesthetic to block any sensation as the ties to God are being cut. Not only did the testimony of the truth slowly erode, but even the memories of what it was like to be in the light began to seem to him like a delusion.<br><br>More than a few of those slides down the path of disobedience come in the years of transition from childhood to maturity. How often have you heard a parent describe a child's tragic journey into years of sin and sorrow by saying, "It began when he was 16" or "It began when she was 14." And yet in those same years the young man or the young woman who chooses obedience can build a foundation of truth to last in the years ahead, and many do. It is not by accident that seminary across the world is offered to young Latter-day Saints in those years. They are at risk in that time of transition, yet the very source of that risk creates an opportunity for them and for us who serve them.<br><h2>Understanding Agency</h2><br>Agency is the source of the risk. It is so priceless a gift from our Heavenly Father that the War in Heaven was fought to defend it. Lucifer sought to take it from us and with it take for himself the honor and glory of our Father. The teenager you love may well have been one of the valiant warriors on the side of agency and truth. Satan seems to feel he can win a double victory by drawing that teenager into sin. He can destroy one of his antagonists and in the process try to prove the Father wrong, prove that the risk of agency was too great.<br><br>We can help by seeing clearly the opportunity. The teenager who begins to say, "It's my life to live, my choices to make," is speaking the truth, a wonderful truth. The choice to do good is the only way to build a life on the foundation of truth and light. Yet those words can strike fear into a parent or a bishop or a Young Women leader who loves the teenager. That outburst of independence usually comes when a rule is announced or something is forbidden. It may come with the mere appearance of authority, with anyone telling them what they must do, or even with just a look at a hemline.<br><br>Our opportunity lies in their seeing a simple truth. And their seeing this is their opportunity, too. It is their life to live, and yet they live it with two powerful opposing forces pulling on them in different ways. One is God, who loves and will not compel and who offers eternal life through the plan of salvation. That plan depends on the Atonement made by the Savior, Jesus Christ, and the teenager's choice to follow Him. The other, a terrible power, will use deception, force, and hatred to bring someone into bondage and misery. And the teenager is free to choose.<br><br>The opportunity is in their seeing that reality, but that is also the problem. It takes the revelation of truth from God to the teenager for those opposing forces to be seen as real. Once seen, the choice will be obvious. But many young people have little experience with persisting in obedience when the truth must be taken on faith alone until it is revealed to them. The opportunity lies in their sensing what they once knew, that the power to choose is a gift from God to bring them happiness in life and in the life to come with Him.<br><br>We can help in the way we react to their determination to choose for themselves. They will sense whether we see them as if they could well have been one of the faithful warriors from the premortal existence, committed still to the defense of moral agency and aware of its great value to bring them happiness. If we can see them as faithful warriors from the premortal existence, we may also see their claims of independence as a sign of their potential, a sign that they are testing the power of agency that will bring them happiness. That is hard, because we know the risk should they choose sin. But when fear for them comes, as it does, it helps for us to remember and take comfort that there are opposing pulls. There is an influence of evil in the world, but there is also in the world, and across all creation, the powerful Light of Christ.<br><h2>The Light of Christ</h2><br>They were born with access to the Light of Christ. Because of that, they have in them the power to apply for themselves the test given in the book of Moroni--if they believe they can and if they choose to do it. Unless they have gone so far as to make that light imperceptible, it is not beyond them to apply this sure promise:<br><br><i>Wherefore, all things which are good cometh of God; and that which is evil cometh of the devil; for the devil is an enemy unto God, and fighteth against him continually, and inviteth and enticeth to sin, and to do that which is evil continually.</i><br><br><i>But behold, that which is of God inviteth and enticeth to do good continually; wherefore, every thing which inviteth and enticeth to do good, and to love God, and to serve him, is inspired of God.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, take heed, my beloved brethren, that ye do not judge that which is evil to be of God, or that which is good and of God to be of the devil.</i>[Moroni 7:12–14]<br><br>And then a few verses later:<br><br><i>But whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do evil, and believe not in Christ, and deny him, and serve not God, then ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of the devil; for after this manner doth the devil work, for he persuadeth no man to do good, no, not one; neither do his angels; neither do they who subject themselves unto him.</i><br><br><i>And now, my brethren, seeing that ye know the light by which ye may judge, which light is the light of Christ, see that ye do not judge wrongfully; for with that same judgment which ye judge ye shall also be judged.</i>[Moroni 7:17–18]<br><br>The warning not to judge what is of God as evil nor what is from the devil to be good is a helpful caution to those of us who would help the young learn to choose the right. They will see some choices as good, or at least neutral, that we may see at first as evil. Before we begin to force a choice with what authority we may have, it will be wise to apply the test in Moroni ourselves. More than once I have been restrained and more than once I have been energized to action by those practical rules. What I at first thought was evil came clear to me as being neutral. And what I had thought was neutral was revealed to me as inviting to do evil. And by the teenager knowing that I would apply the test myself in humility, I could make it more likely that they would try the test for themselves.<br><br>Our best hope is that they will follow our example of humbly seeking to know if the choice they are considering will draw them nearer to God or away from Him. If they do what we have done and pray in faith, light and truth will come to them. And if they obey, not only will more truth come, but they will have learned how to build their lives on a foundation of truth.<br><br>The teenager most likely to have that happy experience will have been given earlier, in childhood, the chance to gain self-discipline enough to persist in obedience even when at first no good result seems to come. I know now why my mother had me weeding on my knees for what seemed like hours in a wet garden with rows that seemed to stretch to the horizon while the weeds broke off in my hand with roots still in the ground. I know now why she smiled so happily when she saw me trying to dig those roots out with my fingers in tearful frustration. She knew something about teenage years that were coming and what it would take in dogged persistence to build a foundation on light and truth. I don't necessarily recommend weeding or hard labor for little children, but I offer the thanks to my mother now that I was not wise enough to give when I was in the garden.<br><br>It would be wrong to suggest that it is easy to help young people obey long enough to qualify for the revelation of truth. Nor can I possibly suggest all that you may be led by the Spirit to do to help them. But I can give this counsel: Above all, you can love them. You can believe and follow the truth in the encouraging view of President Gordon B. Hinckley:<br><br><i>I love the youth of the Church. I have said again and again that I think we have never had a better generation than this. How grateful I am for your integrity, for your ambition to train your minds and your hands to do good work, for your love for the word of the Lord. ...</i><br><br><i>I have tremendous respect for fathers and mothers who are nurturing their children in light and truth, who have prayer in their homes, who spare the rod and govern with love, who look upon their little ones as their most valued assets to be protected, trained, and blessed.</i>["This Is the Work of the Master,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1995, 70]<br><br>There is a connection between nurturing people in light and truth and the way we teach obedience. Wise mission presidents learn that early. Obedience is essential in a mission--for the safety of the missionaries if for no other reason. There are rules for staying with a companion. There are rules about where you can go. There are rules about driving cars. There are rules about when to be out of the place the missionary lives and when to be back at night and when to go to bed.<br><br>The great opportunity in teaching obedience to missionaries is to help them see the connection between the Savior, the companionship of the Spirit, and love. It is to teach them that obedience to the commands of the Father and His Son out of love for Them brings the Spirit. The companionship of the Spirit will bring light and truth, the foundation of successful missionary work and of a happy life. It can be taught in simple matters. A missionary can put on a seat belt because he or she remembers the safety video from the last zone conference. Or they can do it because they love the mission president and he told them to do it. It is a completely different experience to do it because they think of the Savior's love and that He cares so much for their service and that He loves them so much that He wants them safe. The truth is that He needs us. He loves us. When a missionary feels that love of the Savior as he buckles up, he is more than safer in the car. He will be safe against the power of evil in his ministry and he will be safe in his life against more dangers than traffic accidents. He will have learned obedience to the Lord. He will encounter other rules and there will be other presidents, but the loving Savior will not change and He will always be there.<br><br>You can test what we have talked about today. What you do in the classes you attend, and even what you do in this devotional, can build your foundation more solidly on truth. Just try two things: listen for the whisperings of the Spirit and then commit to obey. You've noticed in this meeting that from time to time your mind wandered away from what I was saying. God will take advantage of that wandering if you let Him.<br><br>When the Spirit is invited into a meeting by those in it, truth is communicated beyond what is said aloud. Write down impressions or thoughts that you feel came from God. And, remembering what we have said about building a foundation, think carefully about whether the truth you received requires action. It is by obedience to commandments that we qualify for further revelation of truth and light. In this hour you may have committed to act on something you felt was true. Then more truth came to you. That process may slow or stop, if as you go out into daily life you fail to keep the silent commitments you made with God. God not only loves the obedient, He enlightens them. I fear that more people make promises to God than keep them, so you will please Him when you are the exception and you keep your promise to obey. You should test those impressions of what you should do against a simple standard: Is it what the Master has commanded in the accepted revelations? Is it clearly within my calling in His kingdom?<br><br>Keeping some commandments gives you greater power to build your foundation on truth and light. You could think of those as enabling commandments, because they build your power to keep other commandments. Whatever invites the Holy Ghost as your companion will bring you the greater wisdom and the greater ability to obey God.<br><br>For instance, you are promised that if you always remember the Savior you will have His Spirit to be with you. You are commanded to pray that you may have the Holy Ghost. You are commanded to pray that you might not be overcome by temptation and so be clean and worthy of the Holy Spirit. You are commanded to study the word of God that you may have His Spirit. I would not set one commandment above another, but I might put some earlier in my efforts if they carry with them the promise of the companionship of the Holy Ghost. The Comforter will lead us to truth and light and will help us obey our Father in Heaven and His Beloved Son. We will come to love Them and those around us as we serve, and thus we will keep the great commandments.<br><br>Life will have its storms. We can and must have confidence. God our Heavenly Father has given us the right to know the truth. He has shown that the way to receive that truth is simple--so simple a child can follow it. Once it is followed, more light comes from God to enlighten the understanding of His faithful spirit child. That light will become brighter even as the world darkens. The light that comes to us with truth will be brighter than the darkness that comes from sin and error around us. A foundation built on truth and illuminated by the light of God will free us from the fear that we might be overcome.<br><br>I leave you my witness as an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ that God the Father lives. He knows us. He knows you. He knows me. We are His beloved children. His Son, Jesus Christ, is the Savior of the world. He came down into mortality, where we would become forever lost without Him, to give us the incomprehensible gift of the Atonement that we might someday be with Him and with our Father. He went below all things so that we might be exalted if we choose to follow Him. I testify that I know He lives. I know that we will all be resurrected and stand before Him. I know that we can be washed clean if we repent and do what we are commanded to claim the precious gift of forgiveness. I know that the keys of the holy priesthood are on the earth, that Gordon B. Hinckley is the Lord's prophet and exercises those keys. Joseph Smith was and is a true prophet. As an Apostle and witness of the Lord Jesus Christ, I promise you that as you obey the commandments you will know the truth and be strengthened and warmed by light and love, which will come from God. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Henry B.

<h1> in the Light of Truth - Merril J. Bateman - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is common at graduation time to receive a few student letters expressing thanks for the opportunity to study at Brigham Young University. Almost all students feel a sense of gratitude for the BYU experience. They appreciate faculty and staff members who have been a special influence in their lives--both in terms of the learning associated with a particular discipline and the wise counsel received concerning life. Sometimes students share a special experience associated with a classroom lecture or some other event. Recently, an August graduate sent such a letter describing an experience that provided gospel insights for her. A portion of the letter reads:<br><br><i>Recently I sat in a physics class and had the Holy Ghost teach me. We were discussing fiber optics and how light travels perfectly through strands of plastic without losing energy. I realized as the lecture proceeded that all things point to Christ. Christ has all power and never "loses energy" as He influences our lives. I sat in awe at the understanding that came to me; not a physical understanding but a spiritual enlightenment filled my soul. I came out of that lecture on a spiritual high.</i>[Letter from Patricia Farr, 7 August 2000]<br><br>The young woman's insight is profound. As an infinite source of all power (Matt. 28:18), the Savior of the world does not lose energy as He assists us in the learning process and in our quest for eternal life (Alma 34:14), even though in mortality "virtue" left His soul (Luke 8:46). Like the woman who touched the hem of His garment, the student's connection to the Spirit and her insight illustrate not only the power of healing but the power of learning when temporal understanding combines with faith to produce a spiritual confirmation. The student's insight relates directly to the theme of this conference, which is:<br><br><i>And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:67]<br><br>Today my remarks will be directed to learning in "the light of truth" (D&amp;amp;C 88:6; 124:9), which is the subject of the first two institutional objectives introduced last year--i.e., first, to "educate the minds and spirits of students in a learning environment that increases faith in God and the restored gospel'; and, second, to "advance truth and knowledge." The first objective refers to all that is done by faculty and staff to share light and truth with students. The second relates to the research and creative efforts that build and replenish light within us so that our flame grows "brighter and brighter until the perfect day" (D&amp;amp;C 50:24). The day will come when President John Taylor's words will be fulfilled in that we "will be as far ahead of the outside world in everything pertaining to learning of every kind as we are today in regard to religious matters" (<i>JD</i>21:100). We will possess and share with the world temporal as well as spiritual truths of consequence.<br><br>In preparing material for today, I became fascinated with the nature of light and its characteristics. Everyone on this planet is aware of the natural light that emanates from our solar star or sun, which provides the heat and light that sustains temporal life on earth. In contrast, relatively few are aware of the spiritual light that emanates from a different Son--our polar or "bright and morning star" (Rev. 22:16). And even fewer are aware that temporal and spiritual light are related, with the second light a more refined version of the first.<br><h2><b>The Dual Nature of Light</b></h2><br>Physicists have studied light for many years and have determined that photons of light behave like streams of particles in some circumstances and like waves in others. In a diffraction experiment, light appears to be a wave as it passes through a large number of very fine parallel grooves or slits cut in the surface of glass or polished metal. When light is used to bombard certain materials or pass through a tube, it appears to be composed of particles. The German physicist Max Planck developed a theory in the early 1900s that "helped explain how tiny particles, such as photons, behave like waves. His theory . . . helped scientists accept the idea that light behaves like both particles and waves" (<i>World Book Encyclopedia</i>, 1974 ed., "The Nature of Light," s.v. "Light').<br><br>One of the interesting characteristics of light is that it can pass through a fiber-optic cable at high rates of speed for thousands of miles without requiring regeneration. As the graduate noted in her letter, there is little loss or attenuation as the light particles pass through the glass core. In contrast, electrical impulses passing along a copper wire lose energy more rapidly and must be boosted every 20 to 40 miles. Also, the carrying capacity of light in a fiber-optic cable is sufficient to transmit millions of TV signals or upward of a billion telephone conversations almost instantaneously. A coaxial cable, on the other hand, can transmit only a few hundred electrical impulses per time unit.<br><br>There is another form of light not often studied by physicists--light in the spiritual dimension. At BYU we are privileged to know about, access, and benefit from a more refined light that emanates from Christ. It, too, is the source of life--eternal life. This light, the Light of Christ, is the source of truth. In speaking to Joseph Smith, the Savior said:<br><br><i>For the word of the Lord is truth, and whatsoever is truth is light, and whatsoever is light is Spirit, even the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</i><br><br><i>And the Spirit giveth light to every man that cometh into the world; and the Spirit enlighteneth every man through the world, that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:45–46]<br><br>There is also a kernel of light within each man and woman that "was not created or made, neither indeed can be" (D&amp;amp;C 93:29). This light or intelligence is called "the light of truth" as well and is coeternal with the Creator. Because "light cleaveth unto light," there is a natural link or affinity between our intelligence and the Light of Christ that equips all people with a basic discernment of good and evil--that part of us we call our conscience (D&amp;amp;C 88:40; see also Moroni 7:15–16).<br><br>As an aside and in contrast to the natural light of the sun and the spiritual luminescence of the gospel, I cannot help but think of the plight of the Russian sailors last week lying inside the damaged submarine at the bottom of the Barents Sea. A few days ago a Russian official described the terrible scene in these words: "The darkness must be blinding!" Others speculated that any sailors still alive would be lying quietly trying to conserve oxygen and energy in the blackness of the 40 degree temperature that gripped the ship. Without light and heat, these men could no longer see and would soon become semiconscious, comprehending little. The whole world suffered with them as rescuers were turned back again and again and the men became doomed by an absence of light, heat, and oxygen--if they had not already been drowned by the sea.<br><br>In the study of light, physicists have discovered that light has a spectrum. The visible portion of that spectrum displays many colors. The light spectrum has proven useful as physicists and engineers have designed equipment that allows each color to be used as a conduit, thereby multiplying the carrying capacity of light.<br><br>The visible spectrum of light has a spiritual counterpart. The spiritual spectrum relates to various levels of intelligence, beginning with animal instinct and moving to more refined forms of light and truth. These gradations include man's reasoning ability and conscience, the light that comes through the Holy Ghost prior to baptism, and the light one receives through the gift of the Holy Ghost after entering the Lord's kingdom. Finally, a fullness of light is received when one has proven worthy of the Second Comforter and receives the "more sure word of prophecy" (2 Pet. 1:19; D&amp;amp;C 131:5). (The spiritual spectrum of light is based on statements by Parley P. Pratt in<i>Key to the Science of Theology,</i>9th ed. [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1965], 46–47; and Charles W. Penrose,<i>JD</i>26:21–22.)<br><br>In 1884 President Charles W. Penrose, citing section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants, stated that the physical and spiritual spectrums of light are related and belong to one continuum. Speaking of the Light of Christ, the Spirit of God, he said:<br><br><i>It is the light and the life of all things. It is the light and the life of man. It is the life of the animal creation. It is the life of the vegetable creation. It is in the earth . . . ; it is in the stars . . . ; it is in the moon . . . : it is in the sun, and is the light of the sun, and the power by which it was made; and these grosser particles of light that illuminate the heavens and enable us to behold the works of nature, are from that same Spirit which enlightens our minds and unfolds the things of God. As that light comes forth from the sun, so the light of God comes to us.</i>[Charles W. Penrose,<i>JD</i>26:21]<br><br>The scriptures teach that Christ was the creator of the heavens and of "worlds without number" (Acts 14:15; Mosiah 4:2; D&amp;amp;C 14:9; Moses 1:33). Recently NASA focused the Hubble telescope on a remote piece of sky with relatively few stars. Once focused, a second remote piece of sky, a subset of the first, was identified, and the telescope zoomed in on it. Once again another subset area was identified and brought into focus, and then the experiment was repeated a fourth time. This tiny part of our sky that is invisible to the eye revealed stars, galaxies, and "worlds without end" (D&amp;amp;C 76:112). It was full of light. As I viewed the results of the experiment, I was reminded of Abraham's experience with the Lord:<br><br><i>Thus I, Abraham, talked with the Lord, face to face, as one man talketh with another; and he told me of the works which his hands had made;</i><br><br><i>And he said unto me: My son, my son (and his hand was stretched out), behold I will show you all these. And he put his hand upon mine eyes, and I saw those things which his hands had made, which were many; and they multiplied before mine eyes, and I could not see the end thereof.</i>[Abraham 3:11–12]<br><br>From 1820 to the present, one invention and discovery after another has come to pass. In 1879 the light bulb was patented. Thomas Alva Edison's invention extended the day as it brought light to the night and to the dark places of the earth. This followed the 1820 revelation that Joseph Smith received in the Sacred Grove and the subsequent revelations that brought spiritual light to the world. The Lord told Joseph that the restoration of the gospel would be but a beginning to the light that He would pour out upon the earth--not only spiritual light but also light that pertains to this temporal world (see D&amp;amp;C 121:26–32). The discoveries of the intervening years and the accelerating rate at which light and knowledge are being added today are testimonials to the prophecy.<br><br>Brigham Young University is part of the miracle of the Restoration. The goal of the university is to be filled with light and truth--both temporally and spiritually. For BYU to be filled with light, the faculty, staff, and administration must have the same goal. We must be diligent and obedient in pursuing truth if we are to become a light both spiritually and within our disciplines. In this way we can be conduits of the full spectrum to our students and to the world. Brigham Young University is unique in the fact that it is the only university that can develop curriculum in the context of the restored gospel. This, therefore, becomes our core competency. And we will succeed only if we are under the constant influence of His Holy Spirit. For Brigham Young there was no division between sacred and secular matters--only between those who live according to eternal principles and those who see only with "the natural eye" and consider holy things "foolishness" (<i>JD</i>1:2).<br><br>A recent article in the<i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i>reported on a study that determined the common attributes of successful organizations. Prior to the study, some speculated that the factors would include charismatic leadership, complex strategic planning, and elegant mission statements. The findings contradicted these earlier expectations. The key common element was that each organization had a "core ideology--[a set of] core values and sense of purpose." The second was that each organization had a set of goals that were bold and required the best of those within the organization. The third was that they were willing to take risks and experiment. They were not afraid to make mistakes. (Robert C. Allen, "Why Can't Universities Be More Like Businesses?"<i>Chronicle of Higher Education,</i>21 July 2000, B4–B5; quoting from James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras,<i>Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies</i>[New York: HarperBusiness, 1994], 8.)<br><br>Brigham Young University is unique in that we have a "core ideology" that ties into "the light of truth." If we are devoted to His principles, He will extend to us the power to change lives. If we are bold enough, this will occur not only on campus but around the world. It is important that we encourage "intellectual entrepreneurism" (Allen, "Why Can't," B-5). Some areas in which this is occurring include involving undergraduates in mentored research programs; using technology in the classroom; introducing semester online courses to address bottleneck problems and improve student engagement; allowing undergraduate students access to the new supercomputer; and creating new institutes and centers designed to push forward the frontiers of knowledge.<br><h2><b>Educate Minds and Spirits:<i>Bringing Light to the World Through Teaching</i></b></h2><br>One year ago, four institutional objectives were introduced. The first concerns the quality of teaching in the classroom, the second scholarship, the third extending the blessings of learning beyond the campus, and the fourth developing friends for the university and the Church. As noted last year, the first two objectives form the foundation upon which the university is built and are critical in our quest for excellence. Moreover, the third and fourth objectives will only be realized if we are successful in achieving the first two. I will comment on all four objectives in the time that remains, but the first and second are of greatest concern. I am particularly interested in the bold moves that must be taken to move ourselves forward intellectually and spiritually.<br><br>In an effort to assess the quality of undergraduate learning at this institution, BYU participated in a national survey during the past academic year. The survey is based on research conducted during the last decade that identifies those institutional practices that are the best predictors of student learning and personal development. The practices or principles include:<br><br><i>student-faculty contact, cooperation among students, active learning, prompt feedback, time on task, high expectations, and respect for diverse talents and ways of learning. Also important to student learning are institutional environments that are perceived by students as inclusive and affirming and where expectations for performance are clearly communicated and set at reasonably high levels.</i>[George D. Kuh, "The National Survey of Student Engagement: Conceptual Framework and Overview of Psychometric Properties," appendix in<i>National Survey of Student Engagement: The College Student Report</i>(Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Center for Post-Secondary Research and Planning, 2000), 1]<br><br>Those interviewed were freshmen and seniors--in order to measure the quality at both ends of the undergraduate experience.<br><br>Recently the results were forwarded to our university, and Addie Fuhriman's assessment group was able to compare our practices and outcomes with those at other universities. (I will discuss the general conclusions with you today. The specifics will be available for the colleges and departments within a few weeks.) Overall, we do well. Not surprisingly, there are some areas in which we do very well. But there are two areas in which we fall below the national norm. The successful practices at the university include: student collaboration with other students, prompt feedback, time on task, high expectations, respect for different talents and ways of learning, and a special environment that is inclusive and affirming. The last, of course, relates to the strength of our core values and ideology. We also have high scores with respect to providing a broad general education, in the writing skills demanded of students, and in teaching critical analysis.<br><br>The two key areas in which improvement is needed include student-faculty contact and active learning. We fall below national norms in terms of students asking questions in class, making class presentations, participating in cocurricular activities, discussing grades or assignments with instructors, having faculty-student discussions regarding career plans, and working with faculty on activities other than course work.<br><br>The data suggest that our students are significantly less active in the learning process in their classes than are students at other institutions, yet they spend more time preparing for class. I suspect that large class size, especially in the freshman year, is partly to blame for less faculty-student contact and for less class participation. Four years ago the board of trustees provided additional resources for the freshman year. Also, the Freshman Academy addresses some of these issues. Still, we can improve.<br><br>I believe there are a number of ways in which the weaknesses can be addressed. First, we must continue the effort to reduce class sizes--especially in the freshman year. This will require additional resources. Second, we can extend many of the principles learned in the Freshman Academy to the rest of the freshman class. Third, we are in the early stages of capturing lecture materials on disk so that time in class can be more interactive. Rather than coming to class to hear a lecture, students should have lectures and other materials available for study before class so that class time can be used for interactive learning. Fourth, we must expand the use of new communication technologies that increase student-faculty and student-student interaction.<br><br>A number of other universities have discovered that technology can increase student engagement in and out of the classroom. Historically, technology has been considered a tool for research. Today it is becoming an integral part of the teaching/learning process. For many years technology in a teaching environment was equated with distance education (specifically television courses) and, therefore, with reduced faculty-student interaction. Consequently, it was common to assume a negative correlation between "interactivity" and "online-ness." With the new communication technologies, a positive correlation is possible. In fact, Dr. Laurie Nelson of BYU's Instructional Technology and Psychology Department has developed a matrix illustrating 20 different instructional environments that highlight varying relationships between faculty-student interaction and the degree of online-ness. The matrix fills the full spectrum. (Dr. Laurie Nelson, "Classification of Interactivity and Amount of Instruction Delivered Online: All Variables," http://dle.byu.edu/research/matrix/.)<br><br>With respect to technology and connectedness, Arthur W. Chickering and Stephen C. Ehrmann recently noted:<br><br><i>Communication technologies that increase access to faculty members, help them share useful resources, and provide for joint problem solving and shared learning can usefully augment face-to-face contact in and outside of class meetings. By putting in place a more "distant" source of information and guidance for students, such technologies can strengthen faculty interactions with all students, but especially with shy students who are reluctant to ask questions or challenge the teacher directly. It is often easier to discuss values and personal concerns in writing than orally. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Electronic mail, computer conferencing, and the World Wide Web increase opportunities for students and faculty to converse and exchange work much more speedily than before.</i>[Arthur W. Chickering and Stephen C. Ehrmann, "Implementing the Seven Principles: Technology as Lever," http://www.tltgroup.org/programs/seven.html]<br><br>All students have access to Route Y either on or off campus. Significant investments have been made during the last six months to rebuild the network core and to expand the bandwidth. In addition, more than 70 classrooms have been outfitted with the latest technology during the last few months so that a faculty member can bring a laptop to class, plug in, and present materials using PowerPoint, Flash, or other software.<br><br>[A video illustrating efforts at BYU to introduce new technologies into the classroom was shown.]<br><br>As the video illustrates, it is possible for technology to enhance student-faculty interaction, increase student collaboration, and encourage active learning. These tools allow students to enter the learning process in different ways according to their particular talents.<br><br>Before leaving the first objective, may I express the admiration of the board of trustees and the administration for the incredible learning environment created by the faculty and staff. You go the extra mile in providing quality learning opportunities and in sharing light and knowledge with students. We appreciate the extraordinary effort on the part of the faculty and the Center for Instructional Design to create new courseware for the campus. The new materials are exceptional. Some faculty may be fearful that the new courses will be static and inflexible. That is not the intent. Course-development tools continue to improve, and the ease with which changes can be made will increase. We will make some mistakes, but we also will learn how to correct them.<br><br>Recently Scott Howell informed me that his Center for Instructional Design may not be needed in another five years because the tools will be so easy to use that each faculty member will create his or her own courseware. We will believe that when we see it. In the meantime, we intend to provide additional support to aid faculty members--individually and as teams--in their efforts to enhance learning materials.<br><h2><b>Advance Truth and Knowledge:<i>Bringing Light to the World Through Scholarly Works</i></b></h2><br>Brigham Young not only understood the importance of disseminating knowledge but also the necessity of being "scholars of the first class" in all areas of learning (<i>JD</i>10:266). On one occasion he said, "Put forth your ability to learn as fast as you can, and gather all the strength of mind and principle of faith you possibly can, and then distribute your knowledge to the people" (<i>JD</i>8:146). For him, science and art are part of our religion (see<i>JD</i>10:177).<br><br>Consistent with the statements of the founder of this institution and other prophets who have followed, it is incumbent upon us to "advance knowledge and truth" in a consequential manner. Our research should make a difference and improve life upon this planet. The quality of learning in and out of the classroom is a function of the research and learning effort that supports it. There must be an appropriate balance between teaching and research. No institution of higher education, however, can afford the cost of researching an almost infinite frontier. Universities are becoming more selective in applying research dollars as they identify areas of comparative advantage. This principle applies to us. It is important to have a set of criteria that guides the research effort at BYU. Two guidelines have been developed to date. The first is that those research areas relating directly to the "core values" and mission of the Church will be given preference. The second rule is that university research funds will be directed to areas where the promise of world-class scholarship exists. In some cases the faculty are already on site. In others, one or more scholars on the outside may need to be attracted to complete an inside set of faculty in order to push the knowledge frontier forward. It is important that each college and department determine their areas of comparative advantage and allocate resources in a strategic manner.<br><br>Last year I highlighted a few areas of scholarship on campus. During the last few months an attempt has been made to identify additional areas of excellence. It is my desire to illustrate consequential scholarship from various colleges and departments. Most of the scholarship examples are just now coming in and are still being formatted for presentation. The items selected for this year were developed a few months ago by Dean Douglas Chabries. He has graciously allowed me to use them. They are illustrative of the extraordinary scholarship that is ongoing.<br><br>The first example concerns the new supercomputer and the breadth of its use across campus. The computer is the result of a major gift to the university. My first impression was that this expensive and powerful piece of equipment would be used almost exclusively by faculty in engineering and the physical and mathematical sciences. To my surprise, faculty and students in the humanities, Religious Education, biology and agriculture, and the College of Family, Home, and Social Sciences, as well as those in engineering and physical sciences and math, are users. Currently there are more than 28 different projects served by the supercomputer, ranging from interactive visualization to language modeling. As one might expect, some faculty and students are actually using the computer, whereas others are using students from the industrial design major to create visualizations for them. Machine usage is near full capacity and is carefully monitored. As Professor Brent Adams noted in the earlier video, we may be the only university in the nation where undergraduate students are allowed on a supercomputer.<br><br>BYU's industrial design program covers three areas: computer animation, product design, and transportation design. Last winter semester Professor Adams and his students worked on a design project with General Motors. Since GM had just acquired the Hummer brand name, they needed a portfolio of Hummer products. BYU students created 19 different designs that could be sold as Hummer trucks. This first animation represents four of those designs. The supercomputer was essential to completing the work within a semester. The jungle snake animation shown today was created by an industrial design student for her senior portfolio. Her work on the computer created a wonderful employment opportunity.<br><br>Dr. David Long, a faculty member in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, has helped develop an imaging capability using scatterometry radar from NASA's satellites. Using a computer model, he is able to convert radar images to optical images. He can develop optical images from radar pictures taken in the dark, through storms and heavy cloud cover, or 30 to 60 feet below the earth's surface. This can be done because radar is capable of penetrating through otherwise opaque obstructions. The significance of his work with radar imaging is best illustrated by a recent event. Dr. Long and his students were studying images of Antarctica and discovered a large iceberg the size of the state of Rhode Island floating in the shipping lane between the tip of South America and Antarctica. After some investigation they notified the National Ice Center and discovered that the iceberg in question had been lost due to darkness and storms. Would Dr. Long provide the location? Dr. Long and his students continue to provide data using the radar and optical imaging technology. Several newscasts have featured the story and continue to track the developments as the iceberg is now breaking up.<br><br>Using this same technology, Dr. Long and associates have been able to study wind dynamics by tracking wave height and direction. The scatterometry radar images allow the detection of waves, including their height and speed--which enables the tracking of wind direction and strength. The wind model shown is of Hurricane Dennis, which hit the eastern seaboard in 1999. The model was built by a student using the scatterometry technology and a computer model. Before the supercomputer became available, it took more than a year to solve the model and obtain the data necessary to track the storm. The supercomputer generates a solution in less than one day. The algorithms are proving to be quite accurate in forecasting storm movements and are being adopted by the National Weather Service.<br><br>Using a different imaging technology, that of infrared, BYU researchers have been able to recreate ancient writings and art. The infrared imaging technology allows researchers to focus on the spectral reflections of the inks and paint in ancient artifacts. Computer models are then produced that recreate the original documents. This work has solicited invitations from the National Gallery of Art and most recently from the Christian Syriac Church to image documents that are stored in the Vatican Library. BYU researchers are currently working in the Vatican and in Lebanese monasteries in the Middle East digitizing ancient rare Christian documents before they are destroyed or lost.<br><br>The above are a few examples that illustrate the quality of research conducted by BYU faculty and the involvement of students in that research. Again, I am interested in identifying and recording examples of scholarship from every college and department.<br><h2><b>Extend the Blessings of Learning:<i>Bringing Light to the World Through Distance Education</i></b></h2><br>The third institutional objective is to extend the blessings of learning that transpire on this campus to students across the world who would like to be with us but do not have the opportunity. There are four approaches being pursued. Last year we highlighted "interactive extended learning," where BYU professors and students in mechanical engineering worked in synchronous mode with professors and students in Tokyo; in Monterrey, Mexico; and at Ricks College.<br><br>A second approach is distributed learning, in which courseware and materials are available on the Internet. At present BYU has more than 150 courses on the World Wide Web--100 university courses and more than 50 high school courses. The off-campus online program was initiated three years ago and is administered by the Division of Continuing Education along with their paper and pencil courses. In early August the 10,000th student enrolled on the Internet. The rate of new enrollments is 1,100 per month and increasing. If the pattern continues, online/off-campus enrollments will exceed 15,000 by the end of the year. At last count, students from 22 countries have participated. In addition, the Division of Continuing Education still has more than 40,000 off-campus students taking paper and pencil courses. Unfortunately, the quality of the paper and pencil program is less than that of the online courses because of the delivery mechanism.<br><br>A third approach to extending the blessings of learning is the creation of a digital library that will serve faculty and students on and off campus. A discussion of the digital library will be reserved for a later time.<br><br>The fourth approach is media streaming, which I will briefly highlight. KBYU-TV is a classic example of media streaming. During the past year BYU had the opportunity to create a second TV station that is named BYU-TV. DISH Network, a satellite company serving almost four million homes across the nation, approached us and offered a channel for a reasonable fee. BYU-TV is not a public service station and has more program freedom than KBYU-TV. It becomes an outlet for BYU programming in all its forms.<br><br>Shortly after the initiation of BYU-TV, my wife, Marilyn, received an early-morning phone call from a friend in Pennsylvania. More than 25 years ago we lived near Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and became friends with Robert and Kathy Brueninger during the time they were investigating the Church. They joined the Church soon after we met them, and one year later we accompanied them to the Washington D.C. Temple, where they were sealed as a family. They have been stalwarts of the Church for more than 25 years. Their children have grown, attended BYU, found their spouses here, and graduated. The Brueningers have been a model convert family. When Marilyn picked up the telephone, it was Kathy Brueninger on the other end.<br><br>She began by saying, "Guess what?"<br><br>Marilyn had no idea. "Tell me!"<br><br>Kathy then indicated that she and Bob had purchased a DISH Network satellite, which had been installed the night before. That morning Kathy had turned the TV on and was switching channels when suddenly she saw a familiar face. It was the January 2000 devotional in which Marilyn and I were speaking. She was unaware that BYU-TV was even on the DISH Network. As she told Marilyn about her experience, she started to cry. And then she said these words: "For the first time since we joined the Church, I feel fully connected! I can now participate in the BYU devotionals! I can watch general conference and Women's Conference in my own home! We can watch the CES firesides and relive Education Week."<br><br>As soon as their conversation ended, Marilyn called me at the university and relayed the story.<br><br>I have pondered the meaning of the event in Kathy Brueninger's life and have concluded that we do not fully appreciate or understand the importance of this university to the membership of the Church. Technology is enabling the university to reach the world. It is becoming an incredible asset in the Church's arsenal to build a worldwide community of Saints--to build Zion. It requires the very best of us! We must meet the challenge!<br><h2><b>Developing Friends:<i>Bringing Light to the World Through Friendships</i></b></h2><br>In today's globalized world, no one is an island. Our light must shine clear and bright and extend not only to the members of the Church but to people in nations where the gospel light is dim or nonexistent. Recently, as I prepared an address for the Women's Conference, the opportunity for BYU to make a profound and lasting difference in large, highly populate areas of the developing world became clear to me. Over a year ago we determined to build strategic educational partnerships with a few special, focus countries. As time has passed and contacts have been made, it has become clear that these partnerships may include technologically based, cost-efficient ones as well as the more traditional ones. For example, Web-based efforts to teach English as a second language or computer skills may offer tremendous economies of scale in helping third-world citizens improve their educational and employment skills.<br><br>As we move forward in the process of developing friends, it is important that university personnel conduct international outreach activities according to a set of commonly held institutional guidelines. These guidelines or principles will help integrate our international efforts within BYU's four institutional objectives. If the principles are adhered to, BYU's international efforts will serve the university as well as its friends.<br><br>Our current thinking has identified seven principles to guide international activities:<br><br>1. Academic strength<br><br>2. Wise resource use<br><br>3. Personal and institutional safety<br><br>4. Strategic value<br><br>5. Cultural and political sensitivity<br><br>6. Adherence to welfare principles<br><br>7. Close coordination with Church officials<br><br>I will comment briefly on each one:<br><br>1. The first question to be asked regarding any international program is, "How strong is the link to academic programs?" What legitimate academic goal or requirement for students does the activity meet? Is it part of department and college objectives, consistent with regular departmental curriculum? Does it build academic reputation and connections and enhance faculty expertise and scholarship?<br><br>2. Wise resource use considers human, financial, and other resources for BYU, the Church (including members), and students. Wise resource use weighs strategic importance with costs and benefits and leverages student and faculty expertise and abilities.<br><br>3. Personal and institutional safety requires that students, faculty, the Church, and the university not be put in compromising, illegal, or unsafe positions and that personal health not be jeopardized.<br><br>4. Strategic value asks that international activities address areas of priority for the university, Church, college, and department without interfering with time to graduation. At the same time such activities should be in harmony with the aims of a BYU education.<br><br>5. Cultural and political sensitivity prepares students for respectful and appreciative interactions with others and with an understanding of the social, economic, political, historical, religious, and cultural context of their experience. The sensitivity implied avoids creating expectations that cannot continue to be met; considers the "ripple effect" of activities and the effect of terminating the relationship or activity; and avoids the appearance of siding with or supporting one political side or faction versus another.<br><br>6. When service is provided, it follows general welfare principles. Such service responds to a locally defined and generated need or problem; is sustainable and scalable once initiated; supports personal and family responsibility and preparedness; promotes self-reliance and does not create expectations that cannot be met; avoids creating an added burden to local Church members; and is correlated through appropriate Church channels when service is given to members.<br><br>7. The last principle is that international activities must be coordinated within the university and with the Church. Sandra Rogers is responsible on campus for the university's international affairs. It is important that anyone desirous of developing an international program counsel with her and keep her informed. She, in turn, will coordinate our activities with Church officials.<br><br>When these principles are followed, great results accrue. Just last week a BYU faculty and student group returned from a successful exchange in the Ukraine, where students contributed to public health awareness and religious tolerance and taught standing-room only English lessons as a community service.<br><h2><b>Summary</b></h2><br>In closing, it is my hope that we appreciate our opportunity to be a light to the students on campus. It is my dream that we will appreciate and commit to the destiny of Brigham Young University in its mission to take the full spectrum of light across the world. It is my personal belief that this university is an integral part of Zion and will share in her final triumph. I believe Brigham Young University will be a crown jewel in the New Jerusalem. John the Revelator, on the isle of Patmos, was shown the transformed earth and the conditions that will prevail when that day comes. May I close with his words:<br><br><i>And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away. . . .</i><br><br><i>And I John saw the holy city,</i>[the]<i>new Jerusalem. . . .</i><br><br><i>And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God. . . .</i><br><br><i>And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . And the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass. . . .</i><br><br><i>And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.</i><br><br><i>And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.</i><br><br><i>And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.</i><br><br><i>And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.</i>[Rev. 21:1–2, 10, 14, 18, 22–25]<br><br>May all of us live so that we can be together in that great city and receive the reward of a work well done is my prayer in the name of Him who guides the Church and this university, even Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Merrill J. Bateman was the president of Brigham Young University when this address was given at the Monday morning session of the BYU Annual University Conference on 21 August 2000.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>Your Eye Be Single to My Glory” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Just a few months ago, Kent Crookston, our dean of the College of Biology and Agriculture, attended a conference with many officers of the Church and leaders of various businesses in which the Church has invested. President Hinckley was in attendance, and Kent happened to bump into him at a break. President Hinckley was very kind and jovial as they began to talk, but when he found out what Kent's current assignment is, he went on the offensive. Pointing his finger at Kent, he asked, almost accusingly, "Why do we have agriculture at BYU?"<br><br>Kent and his colleagues had been discussing just that question, and he began to say that they had concluded that we shouldn't have agriculture at BYU unless . . . , but President Hinckley completed his sentence, "Unless it is unique in a way that blesses the Church."<br><br>Interestingly, those are precisely the words Kent and his colleagues have been using to help them focus and choose where to put their emphasis as they consider curricular offerings, faculty hiring, and research focus for the future. They have added the idea that their changes must bless students, especially undergraduate students.<br><br>So what is President Hinckley worried about? Why would he be asking such a question and with so much energy? I don't pretend to know all of the reasons President Hinckley asked that question, but as I have reflected on our interactions with him and with other members of the board of trustees, I have a perspective to share. We live in an era of unprecedented growth of the Church--often in third-world areas whose tithing can't fully pay for the growth in chapels, temples, and other support needed. In this context, entities within the Church, including BYU, must ask: How can we ensure that our performance blesses the kingdom in proportion to the resources we receive? An additional question for BYU might be: How can we extend our gifts to as many people as possible, including members in the third world?<br><br>I think you can see from the institutional objectives we have been developing with you over the past two years an approach to addressing these questions. As President Bateman reiterated this morning, we must worry first about being a university that (1) educates the minds and spirits of our students and (2) advances truth and knowledge. If we perform those two tasks thoughtfully and well, we will find quite natural ways to bless Church members and to develop friends for the university and the Church. We will not be tempted to become a church welfare agency or a Mormon peace corps. We will learn how to bless others in ways that increase learning opportunities for our students and ourselves.<br><br>But we must be creative and prayerful, because the first two tasks are full-time efforts. It seems we have to learn how to do more than one thing at a time. I have heard that theme frequently from President Bateman. He has challenged us to consider how we can use new technologies to improve the learning of our students here and then use what we learn and produce in that effort to share these blessings more broadly.<br><br>Elder M. Russell Ballard, chairman of the executive committee of the board of trustees, recently asked leaders of the Church Educational System (which includes BYU and the other higher education institutions as well as seminaries and institutes) to reconsider everything that we are doing to see what still needs to be done. And if it still needs to be done, are there better ways to do it? We need to be as nimble and focused as we can be if we are to take advantage of expanding opportunities and fill the needs in the kingdom.<br><br>I think President Hinckley was just giving Kent a dose of what I regularly experience when I am with the Brethren. They are both loving and challenging. They are trying to help us lift our vision and get ourselves in shape to address the significant needs and opportunities they see.<br><br>This afternoon I want to focus your attention on two general ways we might continue to improve our individual and collective efforts to bless the kingdom: (1) align our efforts with the institutional objectives of BYU; and (2) experiment with new technologies to bless our current students and to share with others.<br><h2><b>Align with Institutional Objectives</b></h2><br>BYU's institutional objectives, which have been warmly endorsed by the board of trustees, give us a sense of priority and perspective about how to bless the kingdom as a university. They also provide a context for even more specific questions at the level of departments and disciplines. Let me return briefly to the applied biological or agricultural sciences to show you how some of our colleagues are trying to align their programs with these objectives.<br><br>They began by acknowledging that the Church has grown beyond the Wasatch Front to become a worldwide institution, particularly in the past two or three decades. They have concluded that it is no longer sufficient to address primarily the needs of Utah or Western agriculture. Utah State has that mission and significant state and federal resources to assist them. We don't have that mission nor those resources. So, what is our mission? What will bless our students, allow our faculty to make unique and important contributions, and address the needs of Church members and others?<br><br>Consider a few examples of the answers our colleagues are developing. The Food Science and Nutrition Department has decided to provide the best program possible to help with third-world nutrition and inform us about food storage. The Animal Science Department will focus significant attention on the family of Camelidae (llamas, alpacas, vicuñas, etc.), which are not well researched but are critical to the economic and domestic survival of many peoples in Latin America. Faculty in the Departments of Agronomy and Horticulture and Botany and Range Sciences have decided to focus more of their attention on quinoa and other indigenous plants in the Andes region of Latin America. These plants are staples in that area but have received relatively little research attention compared with crops like corn, potatoes, and wheat.<br><br>I have yet to see fully developed plans for the impact of these decisions on the curriculum. However, I see our colleagues becoming aware of wonderful new opportunities they had not been able to see or at least had not been able to take advantage of heretofore. For example, the Farm Management Corporation of the Church, with vast holdings and tremendous international farming needs, is enthusiastic about providing research and internship opportunities for these focusing faculty and their students. Both Humanitarian Services and Welfare Services of the Church have been enthusiastic about providing similar opportunities.<br><br>Kent Crookston assures me that the experience of students on projects that apply basic science in these areas will provide them with excellent knowledge about the science involved as well as excellent preparation for careers in research and in government or business. His sense is that they not only learn how to be rigorous scientists, but they also develop an ethic of service that impels them to give of their developing scientific gifts to bless others.<br><br>These faculty also know that we need them to make major contributions to the teaching of basic biological sciences to students in general education and in other departments throughout the university. Imagine the way that the faculty's new learning in their areas of focus will help general education students see the benefits of the biological sciences. Imagine the teaching assistants in their classes who have been involved in significant research and internship experiences being able to share with general education students their enthusiasm for their science and their service.<br><br>It is very hard work to achieve the kind of consensus our colleagues in applied biological sciences are developing. We have to overcome concerns about individual research initiatives and a tendency to cling to the familiar to develop the right focus for the unit. But I have spoken directly with several of these groups. There is a light in their eyes and a palpable excitement.<br><br>I am reminded of the Lord's words in Doctrine and Covenants 88:67: "And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you." I have always assumed that the body that would be filled with light would be that of an individual person. What I have been seeing in these efforts in the College of Biology and Agriculture and in other similar efforts on campus is that groups of individuals have become "a body" filled with light and with enthusiasm, operating more as one than as a collection of individuals and thus comprehending new things together.<br><br>Many departments will have more difficulty in making such specific connections to the needs of the Church than have our colleagues in the applied biological sciences. However, departments and other units who are helping their students develop the faith, intellect, character, and ethic of learning and service that are the aims of a BYU education are fulfilling their highest purpose. If in support of that purpose they can develop and pursue a few areas of focus for their research and creative pursuits, they will have more depth to offer their students and a greater ability to share this learning in their disciplines and with others through distance learning or other means. When it is appropriate, they will also find ways to help develop friends for the university and the Church.<br><br>The past two years have brought significant improvement in our ability to focus and to align ourselves with BYU's institutional objectives. We are trying to streamline our processes for department and accreditation reviews and link their results more clearly to our budgeting and planning. We hope all of these processes will help us become more aligned with our objectives. We have asked deans to work with chairs and, in turn, asked the chairs to work with departments to consider their purposes and align them with the objectives. We have asked to see how they are reallocating their current resources to address their priorities. When they have done all they can do within the department and college, we consider what additional needs they have and try to help where we can in areas of greatest harmony with institutional objectives. Last year we were just starting this process and found some good work was being done. This year we received uniformly thoughtful proposals that showed evidence of significant work at refocusing colleges and other units. We have much more to do. But the progress is heartening.<br><br>It has been a remarkable blessing to have some additional funding made available because of the generosity of donors. We have found ways to sacrifice and reallocate to meet many of the needs we see. The Brethren have been very impressed with our efforts to focus and reallocate and have encouraged us to continue with this good work.<br><br>Another way that we are trying to align our efforts with our objectives involves the development of a survey that will help us ascertain the degree to which we are accomplishing the aims of a BYU education. Addie Fuhriman organized an excellent committee that has been developing this survey instrument for two years. The committee included Richard Sudweeks from the Department of Instructional Psychology and Technology; Gary Burlingame from the Department of Psychology; Howard Christensen from the Statistics Department; David Smart from the Counseling Center; and Danny Olsen, along with several others, from the Office of Planning and Assessment.<br><br>I am pleased to announce that this fall, and every year thereafter, we will administer this survey to a sample of our graduates who have been away from the university for three years. The Office of Planning and Assessment will provide departments and other units with data about their students and comparisons with the responses of the graduates as a whole. Each of the departments has been invited to suggest some specific questions they want to ask graduates based on their unit objectives. The Office of Planning and Assessment has received responses from more than half of the departments. I hope that you will be active participants in clarifying your focus for student programs, in submitting your questions for inclusion in this landmark learning effort for the institution, and in using the information derived from it to guide your improvements over time.<br><h2><b>Experiment with New Technologies</b></h2><br>I now turn to some brief observations about the use of new technologies to improve student learning and to share the blessings of learning with other members of the Church. Our first hope is that our experiments will lead us to real improvements in the way we support student learning on campus. We believe that students need to know how to manage themselves in a world that is increasingly involved with the Internet and a variety of computer devices. We also hope that as we improve student learning here, we can develop materials and approaches that can be shared more broadly. These two hopes must be buttressed by enough time savings that we can free up faculty to share these learning opportunities more broadly as well as be able to continue to update and further develop the materials involved.<br><br>The president showed us this morning materials that our faculty in several areas have developed in conjunction with the Center for Instructional Design that can significantly improve the ability of our students to learn certain concepts. We have had a surge of creativity from the collaboration of faculty and CID. What I have learned from observing these collaborations is that the technologies and approaches are quite diverse and are becoming more so. Take a look at some examples of this diversity and creativity from a sample of four of our faculty: Steven L. Turley, Department of Physics and Astronomy; Shauna C. Anderson, Department of Microbiology; Gary L. Hatch, English Department; and Norm Nemrow, School of Accountancy and Information Systems.<br><br>Our assessment of the courses we have developed that rely heavily on such media objects and technology-assisted delivery suggests that learning outcomes for students are, on average, at least as good as their in-class counterparts. When we realize that in addition to good learning outcomes students and faculty are developing improved competence in these media, we are encouraged.<br><br>However, we have not been able to demonstrate that providing course work using a variety of approaches with new technologies results, on average, in significant efficiencies in faculty time or in the use of classroom space overall. In part this result seems to be related to the rather significant start-up costs associated with learning how to teach in a new way with new media. Several faculty who have been at this business for two years or more have found ways to achieve excellent learning results and become more efficient.<br><br>Another reason for differences in course efficiencies relates to the design of the course. When faculty use approaches like providing answers to frequently asked questions or using preprogrammed responses to pretest questions to give students immediate feedback, they are able to conserve time to engage students on more difficult or unique questions.<br><br>We still have more to learn before we can share the blessings of BYU's education as extensively as we would like. We believe that education of the whole person requires more than the conceptual knowledge we are trying to share in new ways. For example, we are experimenting with ways to bring young people together in distant settings while they are learning so that they can meet role-model adults and associate with and encourage one another in gospel living.<br><br>I am delighted at the number of faculty who have been involved in these efforts and the quality of their work. We are learning from each other and from our students about the limitations and the possibilities of using new technologies. I trust that we will all seek to improve our ability to help students learn, with or without technology. But I especially invite those of you who have the energy and interest to experiment with using the Internet and other technologies both to improve learning on campus and to engage more actively in distance learning.<br><br>Of course not every new technology or approach will prove helpful, and we will need to be rigorous in our learning. As the Apostle Paul said, "Prove all things; hold fast that which is good" (1 Thessalonians 5:21). In that vein, I especially like the comment of Steve Turley, new chair of the Department of Physics and Astronomy, about what he and his colleagues are learning from their efforts to develop Physical Sciences 100:<br><br><i>I don't think that online courses will ever totally replace the classroom experience. There are a lot of things that go on in the classroom that are very difficult to capture online. What we were delighted with though was to find that there were some advantages online that we couldn't capture in the classroom. So even though there were negatives--some things we had to give up--there were some positives we picked up that, for some students, made an ideal learning environment.</i><br><br>By the way, we are sharing our online courses with more than independent study students. During the past several months, CID professionals have modified 20 independent study and semester online courses that our faculty have developed for use at Ricks College during this academic year. Ricks College president Elder David Bednar has called for every student entering this year to have at least one online learning experience during their two years at Ricks College. In addition to these courses, CID has customized three courses for BYU--Hawaii and one for LDS Business College.<br><br>We are likely to have about 49,000 enrollments in our independent study program this year, of which around 6,000 will be online enrollments. The online enrollments are growing at about 1,000 per month over the past several months. We hope that the growth in demand for our online courses is providing enough additional revenue to help fund further development of online materials on campus and broader sharing. Proceeds from these online courses and the paper and pencil independent studies courses fund approximately half of the Center for Instructional Design and of buying out faculty time. The other half of the funding comes from earnings on our general endowment.<br><br>I am enthusiastic about the opportunity that is ours because of new technologies and this increase in funding. Heretofore Independent Study was only able to build a curriculum from faculty who needed a few extra dollars or who felt an obligation to share their learning more broadly. We need a more orderly process for deciding which courses will be developed and by whom.<br><br>The most important thing I want you to understand about these efforts to use new technologies is that department chairs and department committees need to assume greater responsibility in the oversight of this curriculum. We need your disciplinary expertise to prioritize the development of online courses for campus and distance uses. We need you to evaluate the rigor and currency of these courses and to recommend when and how they should be updated. We need department chairs to select faculty to do the work and to make these assignments part of their normal load. We can provide funding to buy out faculty time for appropriate periods.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>Permit me one final observation in closing. Some have suggested to me that getting closer to the Church would limit us, would hinder our development as a great university. Candidly, I have found that aligning our efforts with the needs and purposes of the Church requires significant coordination and real work. However, I have seen an increase in the light we are receiving and in the influence of the hand of heaven as we pursue this course. I see faculty, staff, and students being inspired, lifted, and magnified.<br><br>A recent example might give you an additional glimpse of what I am observing. Just a few months ago I had the opportunity of representing President Bateman in greeting Ambassador Fahmy, Egypt's ambassador to the United States, and his wife when they visited BYU. We were joined by Dil Parkinson, professor of Arabic and chair of the Department of Asian and Near Eastern Languages, and Erlend Peterson, dean of Admissions and Records and diplomat par excellence for the university and the one who had invited the ambassador to visit. We were pleasantly surprised by the ambassador and his wife's enthusiasm about the Church's Humanitarian Services and the similarities they saw between our religion and theirs. But we weren't prepared for Mr. Fahmy's statement midway through our visit. He said that he had just come from the dinner President Bateman and Elder Neal A. Maxwell had hosted in Washington, D.C., to show the Islamic community the most recent contributions to our Islamic translation series. He was deeply impressed with the work of Dan Peterson and others at BYU to translate classic Islamic texts into English, thus making them available to the Western world. Furthermore, he had discovered that the Church was seeking formal recognition in Egypt, and he offered his services to help accomplish that goal. He provided a candid assessment of the political and religious situation in Egypt and gave specific advice about the process we should follow.<br><br>Erlend Peterson was able to make last-minute arrangements that put our Jim Toronto in the car that took the ambassador to the airport at the conclusion of his visit. Jim is a professor of Arabic and comparative religion who has been working closely with Elder Jeffrey R. Holland on obtaining recognition of the Church in the Middle East. He and the ambassador made specific plans together, and the process for obtaining official recognition of the Church is underway.<br><br>We didn't find out until a few days later the rest of the story. Following the dinner for the Islamic translation series, Mr. Fahmy had called the Egypt desk in Washington to get additional information on the Church and BYU. The person who was on call was a BYU graduate and a member of the Church. He just happened to know a good deal about both institutions and was able to suggest that the Church would be very interested in obtaining formal recognition.<br><br>I know that the Lord is guiding Jim Toronto, Dan Peterson, and Erlend Peterson in their efforts to perform this service. I know that the Lord is inspiring President Bateman and Elder Maxwell and Elder Holland and others to pursue this work. I also know that the Lord is micromanaging. He is inspiring our students and putting them in places of influence and respect.<br><br>May the Lord fill us with light, for "that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things" (D&amp;amp;C 88:67). We do not yet comprehend all things. But I bear witness of Him who does. It is my conviction that the only way for us to fulfill our purpose as individuals or as institutions within His kingdom is to make our eye single to His glory. If we will do so, He will fill us with light and comprehension beyond our fondest dreams.<br><br><i>Alan L.

<h1>, Priority, and Blessings - Russell M. Nelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, President Robert L. Millet, for your introduction. We appreciate you and all who faithfully serve as leaders among the wonderful youth of Zion. We acknowledge the presence of Elder Henry B. Eyring of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Elder Merrill J. Bateman of the Seventy, and each of you wonderful young adults. Thousands are attending here tonight, and thousands more will participate via satellite broadcast or taped delay in North, South, and Central America; Europe; Africa; Asia; and the isles of the sea. I am told that about a quarter of a million youth will be participating with us on this occasion.<br><br>Sister Nelson and I express our admiration for each of you. We bring greetings from President Gordon B. Hinckley, President Thomas S. Monson, President James E. Faust, and our brethren of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. And we most sincerely thank Brother Stanley A. Peterson for his message and his ministry in the Church Educational System.<br><br>Sister Nelson and I appreciate your beautiful songs of faith and devotion. Although the world is experiencing a spiritual drift, you young people stand as living proof that Latter-day Saints can be different! Like a giant rock centered in a raging river, you are steadfast. We admire you! We wish we could meet each of you personally. Not knowing how to do that, we hope you can know of our love for you and of our prayers for your success and happiness.<br><br>My message tonight is about identity, priority, and blessings. An understanding of their interrelationship can help you deal better with life's challenges. It is important for you to know who you are and who you may become. It is more important than what you do, even as vital as your work is and will be. You pursue an education to prepare for life's work. But I want you also to prepare for life--eternal life. I emphasize this because some people on life's journey forget who they really are and what is really important. Without sure identity and priority, blessings that matter most are at the mercy of things that matter least.<br><br>May I illustrate by reading from a letter written by a young mother:<br><br><i>Dear Elder and Sister Nelson,</i><br><br><i>My husband . . . just started his internship. . . . We have four children, ages twenty months to seven years (and would like to have more). My problem is that I don't see how he can give time to our family as the prophets have directed us to do. . . . My seven-year-old and five-year-old have already asked me, "Why doesn't Daddy come home anymore?" They seem to be comfortable with my answer that Daddy is busy helping many sick people, but what should I tell them when they are old enough to understand that Daddy could have chosen a less time-consuming specialty? . . . Please help me understand. I have been praying for peace and understanding.</i><br><br><i>Signed,</i><br><br><i>With much respect and admiration.</i><br><br>Now, why do I trouble you with their problems? Simply because in a few years many of you will be where they are now--very busy and very frustrated. They should solve their own problems, and I'm confident they will. Perhaps we can use their quandary as a springboard for our discussion. It is best we prepare today for the challenges of tomorrow.<br><br>Such concerns are not limited to those in the medical profession. The wife of a doctor, like the wife of a truck driver, soldier, or airline pilot, must know that her husband's important work will take him away from home. That places the burden of fidelity, identity, and priority squarely on the shoulders of each individual and every married couple as they strive to merit the blessings of the Lord. It was never easy to be a committed Latter-day Saint, and it isn't now. But the rewards are well worth it.<br><h2><b>Identity</b></h2><br>If the Lord were speaking to you tonight, He would urge you to understand your identity--to know who you really are. He did so when He spoke to the people of ancient America. After identifying Himself, He informed His listeners of their identity:<br><br><i>And behold,</i>ye are<i>the children of the prophets; and</i>ye are<i>of the house of Israel; and</i>ye are<i>of the covenant which the Father made with your fathers, saying unto Abraham: And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.</i>[3 Nephi 20:25; emphasis added]<br><br>You young adults share that same identity, which means even more when you are sealed to your companion in the temple. Some of you are already married. Most of you are still searching for the right one. I wish you well! Keep searching! Don't forget: "Neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord" (1 Corinthians 11:11). Isn't that a nice scripture? I love it!<br><br>Whether married or single, you will all have work to do. I hope it will be enjoyable. It's nice to bounce out of bed each morning eager to enjoy a day's work, and it is especially gratifying when we can bless the lives of others. But please remember: You work to sustain life; you don't live to sustain work.<br><br>Your life will be a blessed and balanced experience if you first honor your identity and priority. Keep a good long-range view, knowing that the days of retirement from your work will come. There will also be an end to your mortal life. For hale and hearty young adults, those realities seem pretty remote--about the last things you worry about. But the day of your demise is coming, and eventually you will stand before the Lord in judgment.<br><br>Contemplation of life after retirement and life after death can help you deal with contemporary challenges. In our discussion, I hope you will pardon reference to my personal experience. Hopefully, lessons from my life may be relevant to you and to the busy intern husband and his wife who wrote the letter.<br><br>Retirement looks a long way off for this couple. Even a year of internship seems unbearable. And it will probably be followed by a residency that lasts even longer. Those terms<i>intern</i>and<i>resident</i>mean just what they say. An intern is "confined to" and a resident "resides in" a hospital. That portends double trouble for a family.<br><br>I remember when I was a resident in a large hospital in Boston. I was off duty every other night and every other weekend. On nights off, I arrived home to my wife and our four children after the babies' bedtime. I departed in the morning before they were all awake. In order for me to attend sacrament meeting, I had to trade hours of duty with some of my Jewish or Seventh-Day Adventist colleagues. They were willing to cover for me temporarily on my Sabbath as I covered for them on theirs. Incidentally, I enjoyed some of my very most successful home teaching experiences on those highly prized nights off.<br><br>My years of training were followed by a surgical career that was wonderful and filled with challenge and reward. But now it is behind me. Thankfully, my dear wife is still with me. Ten days ago we celebrated our fifty-fifth wedding anniversary. Our family is most precious to us. She has blessed us with ten children. The time that elapsed between my graduation from medical school and my entering private practice was about twelve years. Seven of those ten children arrived before we could really "afford" them. Now all ten have been married in the temple and have families of their own. They have brought us fifty-two grandchildren. We are so grateful for temple endowments and sealings that bind us together forever!<br><h2><b>Priority</b></h2><br>My background in medicine may be relevant, even though most of you will not become doctors of medicine. Eternal principles that govern happiness apply equally to all. I doubt that the Lord cares much which honorable vocation you choose. But He does care if you love one another and serve one another (see Mosiah 4:15). And He cares that you have the obedience and self-discipline needed to maintain your identity and honor your highest priorities.<br><br>When we were the age of most of you, Sister Nelson and I were married. Through thick and thin, we have merged our identity and fixed our focus on our highest priority, our eternal marriage. Through the prolonged period of education and later medical practice, she could have complained about my schedule, but she never did. Our children did<i>not</i>feel they were deprived of their father's time, simply because Sister Nelson never murmured. Their attitudes were shaped by her attitude. Every moment we were together she seized as an opportunity to provide a little bit of heaven on earth for me and our children.<br><br>Now our children are adults with little ones of their own. We enjoy extended family home evenings once a month with all available members of our family. At that time we also celebrate family birthdays. Many names are written on each birthday cake. After those gala gatherings are over--when peace and quiet have again been restored--Sister Nelson and I lovingly embrace each other, grateful that we never allowed anything to take higher priority than our love--husband for wife, and wife for husband.<br><br>I pay tribute to Sister Nelson, this magnificent wife and mother who has always been supportive. When people have asked her how she managed with ten children with so little time available from her husband, she has responded with a twinkle in her eye, saying, "When I married him, I didn't expect much, so I was never disappointed."<br><br>Through those years of internship, residency, and all that followed, she faithfully served in Primary, Young Women, and Relief Society. In addition, she sang with the Tabernacle Choir for twenty years.<br><br>You young women can learn much from Sister Nelson's example. Sustain your husbands in their important work, and don't be selfish in your expectations. Let your husband return to a home of affection, not contention. Meanwhile, learn the doctrines and teach them to your children. The days are gone when the husband was the theologian and the wife was the Christian.<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley gave counsel to you sisters. He said:<br><br><i>I urge each of you young women to get all of the schooling you can get. You will need it for the world into which you will move. . . . No other generation in all of history has offered women so many opportunities. Your first objective should be a happy marriage, sealed in the temple of the Lord, and followed by the rearing of a good family. Education can better equip you for the realization of those ideals.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>President Hinckley also said, "In the process of educating your minds, stir within yourselves a greater sensitivity to the beautiful, the artistic, and the cultivation of the talent you possess, be it large or small."<sup>2</sup><br><br>Thank you, sisters, for your faith and devotion. The Church is greatly strengthened by your service. Your responsibilities are of such import that, should you fail, the brethren would not succeed.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, be of good cheer. Take life one step at a time and do the best you can each day. Life passes so swiftly. We do not know how many years we may have together here in mortality. For Sister Nelson and me, that number is dwindling down to a precious few. We are profoundly grateful that our love endures, even in our empty nest. Real love is not measured in terms of moonlight and roses, but in terms of who will care for you when you are old.<br><br>When mortal life is over, each of us will return to God, who gave us life. In a Judgment interview, I doubt that He will ask a surgeon, "How many operations did you perform?" or "Do you wish you had spent more time at the hospital?" But I<i>know</i>He will ask if Sister Nelson and I remained faithful to our covenants to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ and always remember Him. No doubt He will carefully scrutinize my apostolic ministry, but that vital subject will probably be subordinated to His evaluation of my record as a husband and father.<br><br>I don't fear death. In fact, a scripture describes a Saint's death as "precious in the sight of the Lord" (Psalm 116:15). It will be precious to me, too, as I am reunited with our parents and our precious daughter, Emily, who died some five years ago. Her passing left her young and righteous husband with five children. I will eagerly meet my ancestors and preceding prophets and apostles. And one day Sister Nelson and I will dwell together in the presence of our family and the Lord forevermore. We will have been faithful to covenants made in the temple, and to the oath and covenant of the priesthood, which have assured us, in the words of the Lord, that "all that my Father hath shall be given unto [you]" (D&amp;amp;C 84:38).<br><br>Faithful sisters share the blessings of the priesthood. Think of those words "all that my Father hath." That concept is beyond our mortal comprehension. It means that no earthly reward--no other success--could compensate for the bounties the Lord will bestow upon those who love Him, keep His commandments (see Moroni 4:3), and endure to the end (see D&amp;amp;C 14:7).<br><h2><b>An Inward Commitment to Christ</b></h2><br>The Apostle Paul taught that divine doctrines, such as these of identity and priority, are to be written "not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart" (2 Corinthians 3:3).<sup>3</sup>The importance of an inward commitment to the Lord is symbolized as we partake of the sacrament. Contrast it to other promises made in life, usually symbolized by an outward sign, such as a raised hand or a written signature. The Lord has invited us to symbolize our covenant with Him by a sign that is inward as well as outward. When the sacred emblems of His flesh and blood are administered to us, we are invited to take them into our bodies. As we do, His atoning sacrifice literally becomes a part of our own identity.<br><br>One day you will be asked if you took upon yourself the name of Christ and if you were faithful to that covenant. The newest convert makes the same covenant that each of us has made, to take upon us the Lord's name. We are all allowed--even encouraged--to achieve the fulness of the stature of Christ (see Ephesians 4:13).<br><br>Tonight I come to you in my true identity as a husband, a father, and an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ. My priorities are my wife, my family, and my ministry. I am to teach plain and precious things that have been restored in these latter days. As special witnesses of His name in all the world, the Apostles "talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ" (2 Nephi 25:26).<br><br>In a very real way, you bear similar responsibility. As Jesus said to His faithful followers in ancient America, He would surely say to you, "Ye are my disciples; and ye are a light unto this people, who are a remnant of the house of Joseph" (3 Nephi 15:12). You and I are to bear witness; we are to minister; we are to enlighten; we are to be an example to all who come within our sphere of influence.<br><br>This privilege is ours, twenty-four hours a day, 365 days a year--even on vacation. The Savior stated simply: "What manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am" (3 Nephi 27:27). Your most sincere sign of adoration of Jesus is your emulation of Him. You know of Him. You know of His divine parentage. You know of His mission and ministry in mortality. You know of Him, not by direct visitation, but through the testimony of the Holy Ghost. "The testimony of the Holy Ghost is the strongest testimony that can be given. It is better than a personal visit."<sup>4</sup><br><h2><b>Connecting Identity, Priority, and Blessings</b></h2><br>The Lord has revealed our identity, inspired our proper priority, and will fulfill blessings as covenanted to the remnants of the house of Israel. The pages of scripture are replete with historical documentation of this interrelationship. In 1836, under the direction of the Lord, "Elias appeared, and committed the dispensation of the gospel of Abraham, saying that in us and our seed all generations after us should be blessed" (D&amp;amp;C 110:12). That scripture bears upon our identity.<br><br>Delve deeper into sacred history and you will find that approximately four thousand years ago the heavens were opened to Father Abraham. To him these words were spoken:<br><br><i>Abraham, behold, my name is Jehovah. . . .</i><br><br><i>Behold, I will lead thee by my hand, and I will take thee, to put upon thee my name, . . . and my power shall be over thee.</i><br><br><i>. . . Through thy ministry my name shall be known in the earth forever, for I am thy God.</i>[Abraham 1:16, 18–19]<br><br><i>And I will bless</i>[my people]<i>through thy name; for as many as receive this Gospel shall be called after thy name, and shall be accounted thy seed, and shall rise up and bless thee, as their father;</i><br><br><i>. . . I give unto thee a promise that this right shall continue in thee, and in thy seed after thee . . . shall all the families of the earth be blessed, even with the blessings of the Gospel, which are the blessings of salvation, even of life eternal.</i>[Abraham 2:10–11]<br><br>These passages confirm the connection between your identity, priority, and promised blessings. Your responsibility is to apply these lessons to your life.<br><br>How do you discover your<i>identity?</i>First, remember that you are children of God, created in His image, sent here "for a wise and glorious purpose."<sup>5</sup>Then you need to search the scriptures. You will find that you are<br><br><i>children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.</i><br><br><i>For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</i><br><br>[You are]<i>neither Jew nor Greek, . . . neither bond nor free, . . . neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.</i><br><br><i>And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.</i>[Galatians 3:26–29]<br><br>This identity entitles you to "all of the privileges and blessings which the gospel affords" (Official Declaration 2).<br><br><i>For ye are lawful heirs, according to the flesh, and have been hid from the world with Christ in God--</i><br><br><i>Therefore your life and the priesthood have remained, and must needs remain through you and your lineage until the restoration of all things spoken by the mouths of all the holy prophets since the world began.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, blessed are ye if ye continue in my goodness, a light unto the Gentiles, and through this priesthood, a savior unto my people Israel.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 86:9–11]<br><br>How do you determine your<i>priority?</i>Ask yourself: What do I really want, most of all? Compare your answer with the high standard revealed by your Creator. He said you are to "seek not the things of this world but seek ye first to build up the kingdom of God, and to establish his righteousness; and all . . . things shall be added unto you" (JST, Matthew 6:38; see also Matthew 6:33a). You build up the kingdom of God as you place your family first. A husband's highest priesthood duty is to love and care for his wife, to bless her and their children. A wife's highest calling is to love her husband and nurture their children. As you serve the Lord, know that your "duty is unto the church forever, and this because of [your] family" (D&amp;amp;C 23:3).<br><br>How do you obtain your<i>blessings?</i>How can you qualify for eternal blessings--even "all that [the] Father hath"? With your identity preserved and your priorities properly honored, our Father's blessings will flow to you by virtue of the holy priesthood, which is without beginning or end.<sup>6</sup><br><br>You can lay claim to all the blessings of the Abrahamic covenant, destined to be fulfilled in these latter days (see 1 Nephi 15:18). Blessings and responsibilities once extended to other nations (see Galatians 3:7–9, 14, 27, 29) have now been given to us (see D&amp;amp;C 110:12). Patriarchal blessings reveal our linkage to the great patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<sup>7</sup><i>We are</i>the seed of Abraham through whom all the nations of the earth will be blessed. That identity merits our precious priority, which in turn brings to us the blessings of heaven.<br><br>These blessings include access to the Book of Mormon, which stands as another testament of Jesus Christ. It also stands as a sign that God will keep His covenants with the remnants of the house of Israel (see 3 Nephi 16:11–12; 29:3; Mormon 5:20; 8:21; 9:37).<br><br>This Church has been restored to the earth to fulfill divine prophecies and purposes. Israel is to be gathered. Families are to be sealed in holy temples (see 1 Peter 3:18–20; 4:6; D&amp;amp;C 1:11; 138:10–37; Abraham 2:8–11).<sup>8</sup>And the world is to be prepared for the Second Coming of the Savior.<br><br>Members of the Church are among the "elect of God" (Colossians 3:12; see also Titus 1:1; D&amp;amp;C 84:34), to whom truths of the gospel and ordinances of the priesthood have been given. Enjoy these blessings and teach them to others by precept and example.<br><br>Now my beloved associates, I would like to invoke upon you an apostolic blessing that you may know your<i>identity,</i>who you are and who you can be; that you may establish your<i>priority,</i>held high and protected from erosion; that you may qualify for<i>blessings</i>of the Lord to be with you, to bring joy to you--His faithful sons and daughters--and to your posterity. I so bless you, leaving my love and testimony with you that God lives, Jesus is the Christ, and that this is His Church, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Russell M.

Paul even told us how we can achieve that condition: "That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; [by] being rooted and grounded in love" (Ephesians 3:17). Alma taught how "a mighty change was . . . wrought in [the] hearts [of his people], and they humbled themselves and put their trust in the true and living God" (Alma 5:13). This change produced a visible transformation of their faces (see Alma 5:14).<br><br>4. Joseph Fielding Smith,<i>Doctrines of Salvation,</i>comp. Bruce R. McConkie, 3 vols.

Melchizedek received it through the lineage of his fathers, and Abraham received it from Melchizedek (see D&amp;amp;C 84:14–17). To Abraham was specifically revealed the promise that through him and his seed--his biological and his spiritual heirs--"all the families of the earth [would] be blessed, even with the blessings of the Gospel, which are the blessings of salvation, even of life eternal" (Abraham 2:11; see also Abraham 2:8–10; Genesis 12:2–3).<br><br>7.

<h1>of Life - Marilyn S. Bateman - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
On a clear day we can see forever and ever. We know where we came from and why we are here on earth and where we ultimately are going. The threads woven into the fabric of our lives are beginning to create a beautiful tapestry. Golden threads of eternal truths are interwoven throughout the fabric. The gospel of Jesus Christ has given us a pattern to follow, a pattern that has been provided for the benefit and growth of all God's children. "Come, follow me" is the declaration of the Master Weaver--our Savior Jesus Christ (Luke 18:22). If we continue to follow the intricate design of His pattern, we will add depth, meaning, and splendor to the fabric of our lives. Each of us, though, must be the weavers of our own tapestry. We must pull the yarn, tie the knots, and cut the strands--row by row--until our life here on earth is finished.<br><br>In laying the foundation of earth life, a blueprint was used. God drew up the plans and wrote the specifications. Then our Father called us all together, and the plans were perfected for forming an earth. In His own words, He said:<br><br><i>And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said unto those who were with him: We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell;</i><br><br><i>And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.</i>[Abraham 3:24–25]<br><br>That large assembly included all of us. We agreed to come to the earth, each in our turn, to see if we would do all things that had been commanded.<br><br>"One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth forever" (Ecclesiastes 1:4). There is "a time to be born, and a time to die" (Ecclesiastes 3:2). Our birth and time on earth were foreordained in the eternities. We were all privileged to be born in this the last dispensation of the fulness of times. We must never forget that! There is a time and a season and a purpose for each of us and also for each phase of our lives. Each stage adds insight, depth, and color.<br><br><i>For behold, thus saith the Lord God: I will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little . . . ; for unto him that receiveth I will give more.</i>[2 Nephi 28:30]<br><br>This whole mortal life is a time for us to prepare to meet our God.<br><br>I would like to suggest a few of the major stages of life and what the purpose is for each period. The time line I am going to present is adapted from some suggestions of a wonderful and talented woman by the name of Dr. Virginia Cutler. In the late 1960s she was the dean of the College of Family Living at Brigham Young University. She was a legend in her day--and a very dear friend.<br><h2><b>The Green Years or Preparatory Years</b></h2><br>The green years are the first phase of life. They range from birth until about 20 to 25 years of age. These are the preparatory years. We all start out as "greenies." During these years tremendous growth takes place. It is during this time that children prepare to become adults. We learn to talk, we learn to walk, and we learn to trust and love. We learn to share and to care about others. We learn all the values that create our character and our way of life.<br><br>During the green years parents are the most powerful influence--for good or bad--on their children. In our church we feel so strongly about parental influence that we have a family proclamation that states what our standard is:<br><br><i>Husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other and for their children. . . . Parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness, to provide for their physical and spiritual needs, to teach them to love and serve one another, to observe the commandments of God and to be law-abiding citizens. . . . Husbands and wives--mothers and fathers--will be held accountable before God for the discharge of these obligations.</i>["The Family: A Proclamation to the World,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, 102]<br><br>Small children are mimickers of what they see and hear. I remember visiting with a daughter and her family who at the time lived in another state. Their youngest little girl did absolutely everything and said everything that her older sister did or said. This bothered the older sister, yet she herself was a carbon copy of her mother. It was wonderful because I could even see a little of myself as the drama played out, as I am the mother and role model that their mother had.<br><br>Often if a mother is a talented cook, her daughter will be also. If a mother is a wonderful violinist, it is pretty sure that her children will play a musical instrument. If a father is a sports fanatic, his children, particularly his sons, will likely be so as well. It cannot be overstated how important parents are in the lives of their children. President Brigham Young said, "It is the mother's influence that is most effective in moulding the mind of the child for good or for evil. If she treat[s] lightly the things of God; it is more than likely her children will be inclined to do the same" (<i>JD</i>18:263).<br><br>It is often from parents and other family members that seeds of gospel principles are planted in the fertile minds of young children. The Apostle Paul declared to Timothy: "The unfeigned faith that is in thee . . . dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice" (2 Timothy 1:5). With flowering testimonies we seek to prepare for missions and for temple marriages. It is in the green years that these desires are kindled. Most of you, my young friends, are still in the process of carrying out that aspect of your life.<br><br>It is in the early green years that children are exposed to school and begin their formal education. During this time they develop their attitudes about education. What happens during these years will have an impact on what they do for the rest of their lives regarding their education and eventual profession. My dear young friends, you are in the final stages of the green years. Your education here at BYU is preparing you for the rest of your life. Now is the time--the season of your life--to take advantage of every learning opportunity that you can. President Hinckley counseled:<br><br><i>Get all the education you can. . . . I do not care what you want to be as long as it is honorable. A car mechanic, a brick layer, a plumber, an electrician, a doctor, a lawyer. . . . But whatever you are, take the opportunity to train for it and make the best of that opportunity. . . . Now is the great day of preparation for each of you.</i>[<i>TGBH,</i>172]<br><br>Gaining a formal education is your main priority right now, and you are truly blessed to have the resources of this great university available to you. Use these resources wisely and partake of the feast of knowledge set before you. One advantage you have at BYU is the chance to study the gospel and develop your spirituality. What a remarkable gift it is to read the scriptures daily and to share your testimony of the gospel with others your age. This spiritual focus will be a blessing to you throughout your life.<br><br>During this time of preparation, I challenge you to start looking beyond yourself. Get out of the "me." Learn to give service to others, to share freely the talents and skills you are developing. Give service to your family, to the Church, and to the community. College years are a busy time. But you will always be busy. There will never be a convenient time to serve others. Make a commitment to give of yourselves in service now, and it will become a lifelong habit.<br><br>Prepare yourselves to create an orderly home environment. Many young men and women have not learned homemaking skills from their parents. Universities are dropping classes from homemaking areas. People today have an attitude that homemaking is not important. We must not buy that attitude. The home is the center of our physical and spiritual lives. Both young men and young women should recognize their role in maintaining a house of order and comfort. Don't cheat yourselves of the sweet pleasures that come from having a clean, well-ordered home. It is a gesture of love and respect to your spouse and children when you can budget your money wisely, prepare delicious and nourishing meals, and create an environment that is beautiful and serene. Make it a priority now to learn those domestic skills that will add to the peace and comfort of your family.<br><br>Incredible growth takes place during these preparatory years. The beautiful green background we weave into our tapestry at this time establishes a framework for the rest of our lives. You will add different hues and colors to your tapestry as you move through the later stages of your life, but your diligence, faithfulness, and deliberate action now will determine the level of joy and peace of mind you will experience as you take on a wider range of responsibilities.<br><h2><b>Multicolored Years or Accumulative Years</b></h2><br>Many of you are passing out of the green years and are moving into what have been called the multicolored years. These "accumulative years," between the ages of 25 and 40, are very busy years. You will be getting married and acquiring a spouse, entering your profession, having children, and buying a home. You will accumulate many things that will add to the fullness of your lives. These years are full of activity and growth, and your success during this time will depend on how well you have prepared yourselves during the green years.<br><h2><b>Red Years or Launching Years</b></h2><br>The Red Years, between the ages of 40 and 60, are the launching years. They are a time to exercise restraint and caution. Most likely you will have heavy financial and social demands but not the level of physical vitality you have been used to. Be careful not to overdo it; plan ahead for this time.<br><br>Children will be leaving home, going on missions, attending college, and getting married. We can experience some strain and loneliness in our marriages if we are not prepared for the time when our children leave home. It is important to make the relationship with your spouse your number-one priority.<br><br>Most of you have parents who are going through this time of life. Be sensitive to the sacrifices they are making. Show gratitude for the opportunities they have provided you and be of service when you can.<br><h2><b>Golden Years</b></h2><br>The golden years, between the ages of 60 and 80, are a winding-down time. Some will have more financial resources available and more time on their hands to do the things they have always wanted to do. The golden years provide time for playing with grandchildren, travel, missions, temple work, and genealogy.<br><h2><b>Metallic Years</b></h2><br>The metallic years, if we live this long, are the years when we have silver in our hair, gold in our teeth, and lead in our feet. Eventually we will all die. But even death will be welcome if we are prepared to meet our Savior, if we have fulfilled our life's work according to the Lord's will.<br><br>If we make Christ the center of our lives, our tapestries will be rich in color and beautiful in design. I hope that as you continue to work on your life's tapestry you will be able to see the big picture. I hope you will see that what you weave now will influence the texture and pattern of the rest of your life. It is a glorious life. Trials will come, but you will be prepared to deal with them if you take the time now to pattern your life's tapestry after Christ's. I pray you will, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Marilyn S. Bateman, wife of BYU president Merrill J. Bateman, gave this devotional address on 19 September 2000.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>isions, and Dreams - Merrill J. Bateman - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Before I begin the formal part of my talk, I wish to express appreciation to Sister Bateman for the wise counsel given today and for the extraordinary companion she has been to me through four decades. While I have tried to fulfill my dreams, many of which pertained to a temporal setting, she has focused solely on matters of eternal consequence. Her time and energy have been given to supporting a husband, raising children, befriending neighbors, visiting those with special needs, and creating a wonderful, peaceful home. She is a quiet, self-effacing woman--one who does not seek the limelight. Her life is one of devotion to the Master. It is one of unselfishness. I cannot thank her enough. Although my words are embarrassing to her, I pay tribute to a remarkable friend and companion and hope that many of you will come to know her personally.<br><br>The semester is more than three weeks old, and this is Sister Bateman's and my first opportunity to welcome you to campus. We are grateful for all of you assembled. You are an incredible student body gathered to learn from a world-class faculty and staff. This is a marvelous campus. We hope you appreciate living each day in one of America's most beautiful settings. The beauty of the flowers, the tree-lined walkways, and grass-covered quads create a peaceful atmosphere accented by the mountains, blue skies, and exceptional facilities. The setting created by the Lord and the board of trustees establishes a standard for our purpose and dreams. The purpose of Brigham Young University is to educate the minds and spirits of students in a learning environment that increases faith in God and the restored gospel. Our dream is the fulfillment of President John Taylor's prophecy, in which he stated:<br><br><i>You will see the day that Zion will be as far ahead of the outside world in everything pertaining to learning of every kind as we are to-day in regard to religious matters. You mark my words, and write them down, and see if they do not come to pass.</i>[<i>JD</i>21:100]<br><br>Today my thoughts are centered on the dreams and visions that inspire temporal and spiritual progress and the principles that produce growth and achievement. Scientific discoveries during the last 100 years exceed the cumulative findings of all the centuries that preceded it. I do not believe that the increase in knowledge is happenstance. It is part of the Lord's plan as He bestows additional light upon the earth's inhabitants. The Lord told Joseph Smith that the restoration of the gospel would be but a beginning to the light that He would pour out upon the earth--not only spiritual light but also light that pertains to this temporal world (see D&amp;amp;C 121:26–32).<br><br>During the preparation of a recent talk given to the faculty and staff, I became fascinated with the nature of light and its characteristics. All of us are aware of the natural light that emanates from the sun, which provides the heat and light that sustains temporal life on earth. In contrast, few of the earth's inhabitants are aware of the spiritual light that emanates from a different Son--our "bright and morning star" (Revelation 22:16). Even fewer people appreciate the close relationship between spiritual and natural light.<br><br>Physicists have studied light for many years, fascinated by its dual nature. Photons of light behave like streams of particles in some circumstances and like waves in others. In a diffraction experiment, light appears to be a wave. When light is used to bombard certain materials, it appears to be composed of particles. The German physicist Max Planck developed a theory in the early 1900s that "helped explain how tiny particles, such as photons, behave like waves. His theory . . . helped scientists accept the idea that light behaves like both particles and waves" (<i>World Book Encyclopedia,</i>1974 ed., "The Nature of Light," s.v. "Light").<br><br>Another form of light not studied by physicists is light in the spiritual dimension. At Brigham Young University we are privileged to know about, access, and benefit from a more refined light that emanates from Christ. It, too, is the source of life--eternal life. This light, the Light of Christ, is the source of truth. In speaking to Joseph Smith, the Savior said:<br><br><i>For the word of the Lord is truth, and whatsoever is truth is light, and whatsoever is light is Spirit, even the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</i><br><br><i>And the Spirit giveth light to every man that cometh into the world; and the Spirit enlighteneth every man through the world, that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:45–46]<br><br>In the study of light, physicists have discovered that light has a spectrum. The visible portion of that spectrum displays many colors. The light spectrum has proven useful as physicists and engineers have designed equipment that allows each color to be used as a conduit, thereby multiplying the carrying capacity of light.<br><br>The visible spectrum of light has a spiritual counterpart. The spiritual spectrum pertains to various levels of intelligence, beginning with animal instinct and moving to more refined forms of light and truth. The higher gradations include man's reasoning ability and conscience, the light that comes through the Holy Ghost prior to baptism, and the light one receives through the gift of the Holy Ghost after entering the Lord's kingdom. Finally, a fullness of light is received when one has proven worthy of the Second Comforter and receives the "more sure word of prophecy" (2 Peter 1:19; D&amp;amp;C 131:5). (The spiritual spectrum of light is based on statements by Parley P. Pratt in<i>Key to the Science of Theology,</i>9th ed. [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1965], 46–47; and Charles W. Penrose,<i>JD</i>26:21–22.)<br><br>More than 100 years ago, President Charles W. Penrose, citing section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants, stated that the physical and spiritual spectrums of light are related and belong to one continuum. Speaking of the Light of Christ, the Spirit of God, he said:<br><br><i>It is the light and the life of all things. It is the light and the life of man. It is the life of the animal creation. It is the life of the vegetable creation. It is in the earth . . . ; it is in the stars . . . ; it is in the moon . . . : it is in the sun, and is the light of the sun, and the power by which it was made; and these grosser particles of light that illuminate the heavens and enable us to behold the works of nature, are from that same Spirit which enlightens our minds and unfolds the things of God. As that light comes forth from the sun, so the light of God comes to us.</i>[Charles W. Penrose,<i>JD</i>26:21]<br><br>Brigham Young University is part of the miracle of the Restoration. The goal of the university is to be filled with light and truth--both temporally and spiritually. In order for this to occur, all of us assembled must be diligent and obedient in pursuing truth if we are to be conduits of the full spectrum. Brigham Young University is unique in that it is the only university that can develop curriculum in the context of the restored gospel. This is our core competency. We will fulfill John Taylor's prophecy if we are worthy to abide the influence of the Lord's Holy Spirit.<br><br>Centuries ago the Old Testament prophet Joel spoke of our day and of the events preceding the Lord's second coming in the following words:<br><br><i>And it shall come to pass . . . that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions. . . .</i><br><br><i>And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth.</i>[Joel 2:28, 30]<br><br>The Lord promised Joel that he would pour out His Spirit upon young people, that your generation would see visions that would light the way and provide insights to increase faith and improve life. Sometimes in thinking of visions, dreams, and revelation, we think of an epiphany--an extraordinary event like Joseph's vision in the Sacred Grove or the appearance of Moroni. Generally, however, that is not the way the Lord works with us. More often, revelation comes quietly in the form of thoughts and ideas that seem to be pure intelligence flowing into us and teaching us things we did not know. The Prophet Joseph Smith, in speaking of revelation, said:<br><br><i>A person may profit by noticing the first intimation of the spirit of revelation; for instance, when you feel pure intelligence flowing into you, it may give you sudden strokes of ideas, so that by noticing it, you may find it fulfilled the same day or soon.</i>[<i>TPJS,</i>151]<br><br>I received a letter from a young BYU student describing such an experience. A portion of the letter reads:<br><br><i>Recently I sat in a physics class and had the Holy Ghost teach me. We were discussing fiber optics and how light travels perfectly through strands of</i>[glass]<i>without losing energy. I realized as the lecture proceeded that all things point to Christ. Christ has all power and never "loses energy" as He influences our lives. I sat in awe at the understanding that came to me; not a physical understanding but a spiritual enlightenment filled my soul. I came out of that lecture on a spiritual high.</i>[Letter from Patricia Farr, 7 August 2000]<br><br>The young woman's insight is profound. As an infinite source of all power, the Savior does not lose energy as He assists us in the learning process and in our quest for eternal life. The student's connection to the Spirit and her insight illustrate the power of learning when temporal understanding combines with faith to produce a spiritual confirmation.<br><br>I ask, "What are your visions and dreams for the 21st century? What are your goals and aspirations?" You represent the doctors, lawyers, scientists, artists, writers, and business leaders of the future. Are you living worthy to experience the light that the Lord wishes to bestow upon you? You stand at a critical juncture in life. You have just crossed the threshold into adulthood. Your dreams and choices will determine not only your future but the destiny of untold generations to come!<br><br>The prophet Joel also indicated that old men would dream dreams. This statement caused me to reflect on the experiences that have changed my life. Such an experience occurred when I was about your age. In my late teens a bishop called me to be a Sunday School teacher of eight-year-olds. I will always remember the trepidation I felt prior to the first class and the wonderment that someone believed in me enough to trust young people to my stewardship. I put my heart and soul into preparing for the class. I studied the scriptures as well as the manual and enjoyed the beauty and cogency of the Lord's word. One day as I was preparing a lesson, a thought came to me regarding the importance of the Lord's teachings and the scriptures and their applicability in my life. A strong, warm sensation saturated my being as the thought passed through my consciousness. That day I felt the swellings of the Holy Spirit within me, and I sensed the power that comes when one searches the scriptures. It was the beginning of a personal testimony.<br><br>Years later, as the dean of the business school, I had another dream. It was more mundane. I remember leaving my office and entering the secretarial area. Four secretaries were at work on IBM Selectric typewriters. The noise was deafening as the keys struck the paper. If OSHA had been around, a citation would have been issued. In my mind's eye I saw the day when silent typewriters would replace the noisy ones. I dreamed of a typewriter that had a screen where the typist could see what was being typed, and the printer would be across the hall in a soundproof room driven by an electrical connection. Before I left the dean's office, an early form of the desktop computer was installed, and a wire was run from the typists' pool to a noisy printer on the other side of the building. Today the desktop computer is much faster, the screen is in color, and the laser printer is silent. I learned that one's dreams can be fulfilled by the genius of others. And the end is not in sight. Computer and other forms of technology will continue to improve.<br><br>Professors at BYU and at other institutions are working on a technology called configurable logic that has the potential of speeding up computers by orders of magnitude. Professor Brad Hutchings and his colleagues have developed new ways of designing computer chips that increase computer speeds by 10 to 100 times. Where did their ideas come from? I wonder what their dreams were when they were students! What an opportunity to learn from them.<br><br>About 20 years ago a new dream entered my consciousness. It is ongoing and is concerned with noninvasive medical treatments. At the time, my father in his seventies underwent open-heart surgery. I learned that the operation consisted of a large incision from his throat to his midsection followed by the cutting of his sternum with a saw that allowed doctors to open his chest, connect his blood supply to a machine, stop the heart, and perform bypass surgery. Following the operation I stood in the intensive care unit and touched my father's body as they wheeled him to a recovery room. The body was cool and, in some ways, reminded me of a corpse. I had a sense of the trauma that had taken place. From that day onward I have dreamed of less-invasive methods to solve medical problems.<br><br>In the intervening years I have watched with interest the progress made by the medical community. Angioplasty is a relatively new procedure for correcting diseased arteries--a method that did not exist 20 years ago. Small balloons attached to catheters can be advanced over a wire from a small incision in the groin and placed within the arterial and venous system to remove blockages. A small metal tube called a stent can also be placed within the arteries to keep them open. In many cases major surgery is prevented. Another development involves thrombolytic therapy or the ability to dissolve clots. New medicines placed in arteries and veins via catheters are able to dissolve clots, restore blood flow, and prevent amputation. This new therapy also aids stroke patients. Another procedure developed within the last few years is called embolization. A catheter is placed within an artery and chemicals are injected to stop blood flow to tumors or to vessels that are bleeding from trauma. Often tumors that are not surgically removable can be treated in this manner, prolonging the patient's life. (This information is based on a discussion with Dr. John Collins, an interventional radiologist at Utah Valley Regional Medical Center, 16 September 2000.)<br><br>My dream is for the day when doctors will be able to perform medical procedures inside the body using ultrasound or lasers that are relatively noninvasive. Have you ever been to a doctor and wished that she or he could wave a device over you, determine what was wrong, and administer the remedy without invading the skin? Noninvasive medicine is wonderful. Is this an area in which you will have a role? As a student at BYU, you might be involved in the work of Professor William Pitt, who is developing ways of releasing chemotherapy drugs to specific locations in the body through ultrasound. Chemotherapy can be a miserable experience because, at present, the drug must be administered to the entire body. In Dr. Pitt's work the drug is bound in inert packages that do not release the drug until ultrasound is administered, and then the drug is confined to a local area. The illness associated with the procedure is thereby reduced.<br><br>Another area of the university in which you might fulfill your dream includes the work in micro-electro-mechanical systems. This interdisciplinary field produces miniature mechanisms the size of a human hair that can travel inside the human body to clean plaque from veins, monitor one's health, or perform microsurgery through remote control. Small microswitches can also be designed for the field of optics, where they are used to drive the small mirrors in a projector to refine the picture and increase the number of pixels used for each color. Another product might be a microsensor used to measure movements of buildings during an earthquake.<br><br>Perhaps one's dream might be fulfilled in BYU's Earth Remote Sensing Center, where professors are developing technology and information systems to gather data regarding the earth. Using various forms of radar and other scanning techniques, professors and students are able to locate icebergs, determine wind speeds in storms, produce more accurate weather models, and penetrate the earth's crust to find ancient cities. You might become a part of this effort because at BYU we believe that scholarly activity is an integral part of the learning process, and a significant portion of undergraduates as well as all graduate students are involved in scholarly endeavors.<br><br>Every discipline at this university represents a possible vision or dream. What is yours? Please be aware that it is normal for people's hopes and dreams to shift over time. The choices and opportunities available today may change as time passes. How do you prepare for the opportunities ahead?<br><br>To acquire temporal truths, one must be diligent in pursuing an education. We encourage you to take seriously the opportunity afforded here. Do not waste time. Study daily--at least three hours for every hour in class. That still leaves more than 100 hours per week for other things. Recently I spoke to a small group of freshmen who indicated that they did not need to study in high school to obtain A's. One indicated that he was doing well here even though he had not studied thus far. There are two problems with his thinking. The first is his belief that he will do well at exam time. The second is that he could be learning so much more if he applied himself.<br><br>To receive spiritual truths, one must be obedient as well as diligent (see D&amp;amp;C 130:19). Spiritual light is received when one follows the doctrine of Christ--that is, the first principles and ordinances of the restored gospel. I challenge you to increase your faith by living gospel principles more precisely, by repenting when you fall short, by taking an active role in your ward, by rendering service to others, and by making prayer and scripture study a part of your everyday life. In this manner you will find true joy.<br><br>In closing I turn to the words of the Prophet Joseph Smith, who wrote about the connection between heaven and our intellect as follows:<br><br><i>We consider that God has created man with a mind capable of instruction, and a faculty which may be enlarged in proportion to the heed and diligence given to the light communicated from heaven to the intellect; and that the nearer man approaches perfection, the clearer are his views, and the greater his enjoyments.</i>[<i>TPJS,</i>51]<br><br>May each of us take advantage of the unique opportunity offered by this university to educate both our minds and our spirits I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Merrill J. Bateman was president of Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 19 September 2000.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1> Your Future - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is frightening to be asked to speak to you today. It is even more frightening when I hear those who have sacred callings in the Church--those much closer to the Spirit than I--acknowledge the great responsibility they feel when asked to speak at a BYU devotional. I don't know that I will say anything profound today, but I will tell you a few things I have learned from others and from my own experiences, especially experiences I have had at BYU.<br><br>Forty years ago last month I became a freshman at this university. I came from a simple background in a small community with a small high school. My life was not even close to being sophisticated by today's standards, but my home life was one where reading and hard work were taught and valued. As a boy I did not always appreciate the importance of hard work, but I later understood its value in my life. I believe that Nephi's opening phrase in the Book of Mormon applies to me. Indeed, I was "born of goodly parents" (1 Nephi 1:1)--parents who taught me some of life's most valuable lessons: to work, to respect those with more experience, to make the best of situations without complaining, to obey, to sacrifice, to wait for what I want most instead of compromising for what I want now, to respect agency, to face accountability, and to value humor.<br><br>As I have read and pondered the scriptures through the years, I have been increasingly impressed with their applicability to my life. I suppose this should not be surprising, since Nephi said, "For I did liken all scriptures unto us, that it might be for our profit and learning" (1 Nephi 19:23). I have become more aware each year that events and behavior in my life and in the lives of others are described remarkably well by the scriptures, especially by the Book of Mormon. This recognition has strengthened greatly my testimony of that book. So, if I were to do nothing else today, I would consider myself successful if someone who is listening began to read and ponder the scriptures more faithfully, even every day.<br><br>I have often wondered what my life would be like today if I had read from the Book of Mormon for just 20 minutes every day since I first came to BYU in 1960. Had I done that, I would have read the Book of Mormon more than 160 times in those 40 years! I wonder what my perspective of life would be now if I had done that. What would be my knowledge and testimony? What would be my influence on my family? What would be my standing with the Lord? Why didn't I do it? Was I really too busy? I urge each of you, especially you students, to take steps now so that you do not have to ask yourselves or answer these last two questions: "Why didn't I do it?" and "Was I really too busy?" Make those choices now to establish habits and patterns in your life that will bring satisfaction in five, 20, 40, or 100 years.<br><br>Let me share with you two scriptures, and I will attempt to "liken them" to your BYU and other experiences.<br><br>The Savior advised us about the importance of our behavior in the sixth chapter of Luke:<br><br><i>And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?</i><br><br><i>Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like:</i><br><br><i>He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.</i><br><br><i>But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.</i> [Luke 6:46–49]<br><br>Helaman advised his sons Nephi and Lehi using a similar analogy:<br><br><i>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.</i> [Helaman 5:12]<br><br>There is no doubt that we should fill our lives with actions based on principles of the gospel and on the chief cornerstone, Jesus Christ. But there is another application to the analogies in these two scriptures. We can apply the principle of building on a solid foundation in our academic pursuits and in everything else we do. That foundation is preparation. Most of us will recognize times in our past when we were more interested in just finishing something than in learning or gaining real understanding. Tasks like reading a book, writing an essay, fixing a car, mowing a lawn, preparing a meal, cleaning a room, preparing a lesson, finishing a homework assignment, or completing a class are in this category occasionally in our lives. How much better we would be to build on a foundation of real understanding than to "just finish" something.<br><br>Often in our hectic lives we forget the opportunity to grow as we complete tasks and face challenges. It is unfortunate that we do not always consider the perspective of the future when we make the "small" decisions or perform the "small" tasks. Let me assure you that I speak from experience. Several times in the past 30 years as a faculty member I have found myself returning to fundamental principles in mathematics and science as I was struggling to understand a current or modern or exciting or sophisticated idea or development. Had I simply given greater effort earlier in life to understand basic principles, I would have saved myself and others considerable time, and I could have provided more help to others later on.<br><br>Two examples from my own interest in chemistry problems illustrate some important principles. Please don't worry too much about the chemistry, although I must say that it is "good chemistry," at least from my perspective. I would be pleased to discuss "good chemistry" with any of you later if you are interested.<br><br>One measure of the interactions between molecules in a substance or a mixture is the heat capacity of that substance or mixture. Let me give a few basic definitions. Heat capacity is defined as the amount of energy, such as heat, in units of calories or joules, that a specified amount of substance, such as a gram or a molecule, absorbs to raise the temperature of that substance by one degree in Celsius, Kelvin, or Fahrenheit. Thus heat capacity of a substance is its "capacity for heat." A homogeneous mixture of molecules is called a solution, and the amount of a component in a solution is that component's concentration. For example, sugar dissolved in water makes a solution, and the amount of sugar in that solution defines its concentration.<br><br><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10432" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/gif/fig-1.gif" alt="fig 1" width="242" height="254" /><br><br>Until last year, very few heat capacity data had been measured for solutions made by dissolving small amounts of sodium nitrate in water. The best data were available only at room temperature, 25 degrees Celsius, but over a fairly wide range of concentration. In Figure 1, experimental heat capacity values at 25 degrees are indicated by the circles and squares, and the line represents a correlation equation. If we were to predict from these data the heat capacity of a solution made from a small amount of sodium nitrate dissolved in water at, for example, 120 degrees Celsius, we would simply have to assume it is the same as at 25 degrees.<br><br><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10433" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/gif/fig-2.gif" alt="fig 2" width="220" height="237" /><br><br>The three circles in Figure 2 are data of lesser quality, but obtained at three temperatures near 25 degrees (fig. 2). We could rely on these three values to extrapolate a long way to estimate the "unknown" heat capacity of the solution at 120 degrees Celsius. Although we might be confident about that extrapolation, it does not represent the truth unless it gives the correct value of heat capacity at 120 degrees. A cautious or experienced person would likely try to avoid making an important decision or recommendation based on that long extrapolation.<br><br><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10434" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/gif/fig-3.gif" alt="fig 3" width="264" height="270" /><br><br>Careful measurements of the heat capacity of solutions of sodium nitrate dissolved in water made this year by BYU undergraduates are shown in a three-dimensional projection in Figure 3. One can readily see from the additional information now available that extrapolation to conditions far removed from those where measurements were previously made would have been seriously in error. There is nothing really wrong with the old heat capacity data for aqueous sodium nitrate solutions, but they are not very useful to describe behavior at significantly higher or lower temperatures. There is an important lesson to learn from this example. Extrapolation beyond our own or others' experience can be risky. Furthermore, extrapolation from our own perspectives to judge another person's behavior is even more risky.<br><br><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10435" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/gif/fig-4.gif" alt="fig 4" width="284" height="277" /><br><br>A more striking example of the risks of extrapolation is shown in the next few graphs. The compound <i>n</i>-dodecylpyridinium chloride is a surfactant. Detergents are a class of compounds called surfactants, and it should be obvious that their behavior in water as functions of temperature and the concentration of surfactant are important factors to understand, or at least to know, in the detergent industry. In Figure 4 we see the results of measurements of heat capacity at various temperatures for a solution that contains only a very small amount of <i>n</i>-dodecylpyridinium chloride dissolved in water. One could easily make a fairly safe extrapolation from just a few measurements at a few temperatures to other temperatures that would give "the right answer," but only because we know "the right answer" at those other temperatures.<br><br><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10436" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/gif/fig-5.gif" alt="fig 5" width="291" height="277" /><br><br>In Figure 5 we see an extrapolation of results of a few measurements at lower concentrations to higher concentrations based on a straight line or linear model. We do not know the reliability of this extrapolation unless someone has measured the heat capacity at higher concentrations.<br><br><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10437" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/gif/fig-6.gif" alt="fig 6" width="284" height="269" /><br><br>Such measurements at higher concentrations were made at BYU recently, and the results are shown in Figure 6. We can see clearly from this graph that, had we made measurements only on solutions containing the four lowest amounts of surfactant, an extrapolation to larger amounts would have been in error. Similarly, had we made heat capacity measurements only on solutions containing a few or even all of the larger amounts of surfactant, an extrapolation to the smallest amounts would clearly have been in error.<br><br><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10438" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/gif/fig-7.gif" alt="fig 7" width="236" height="265" /><br><br>Figure 7 shows the results of four series of heat capacity measurements on solutions of this surfactant at low concentrations as a function of temperature. Note that the trend in heat capacity is toward decreasing values as temperature increases, and we might be persuaded to make an extrapolation or generalization for all concentrations. However, Figure 8 shows results of three series of heat capacity measurements on solutions with about 10 or 20 times as much dissolved surfactant as in Figure 7. Note that the trend in heat capacity here is toward increasing values as temperature increases, which is opposite to what we saw in Figure 7. Thus, if we looked only at the data on this graph we might be persuaded to extrapolate or generalize opposite to what we observed in the previous slide.<br><br><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10439" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/gif/fig-8.gif" alt="fig 8" width="256" height="279" /><br><br>All the heat capacity results for measurements on solutions of this surfactant in water are shown in Figure 9. Only when we have all relevant information can we make a correct judgment about what happens to the heat capacity of solutions of this compound when temperature or the amount of surfactant in solution is changed. It is only when we see all the data that we can rationalize and formulate with confidence a functional model of what is occurring in these solutions. Of course, it would still be risky for us to make extrapolations beyond the boundaries of these data to conditions where measurements have not yet been made.<br><br><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10440" src="https://speeches.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/gif/fig-9.gif" alt="fig 9" width="236" height="270" /><br><br>These examples from chemistry illustrate some principles that are applicable in many important aspects of life. As we gain more knowledge and experience, we broaden our perspectives. As we have experiences and gain knowledge in new dimensions, we are able to make connections that allow us to interpolate between related variables and also to make extrapolations beyond the edge of our knowledge and understanding. Generally, the deeper and broader our database of knowledge and experience is, the greater likelihood we have to know and understand truth. We can formulate improved models of the world only when we have sufficient knowledge and perspective. We gain that knowledge and perspective through broad, in-depth study and experience. Since we have limited time to accomplish what we will do in life, it is fortunate that we can gain knowledge and perspective not only through our own experiences and observations but also through the experiences and observations of others. Thus it is crucial for us to listen to and learn from others. Perhaps most important, we can have the influence of the Holy Ghost to teach and guide us even in our academic pursuits and careers as we humbly live the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>There are some fundamental steps we must all follow to gain an understanding of, appreciation for, and ability to effectively apply ourselves in both earthly and spiritual matters. First, we must learn the facts about a matter, and often this means learning the facts about many seemingly peripheral matters as well. It is important that we try to gain as much information as time and circumstances allow before we make a decision or claim an understanding.<br><br>It seems appropriate to follow the advice in the scriptures about the value of knowledge and understanding. "He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him" (Proverbs 18:13). "The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge" (Proverbs 18:15). "How much better is it to get wisdom than gold!" (Proverbs 16:16). "Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding" (Proverbs 4:7). "For he that diligently seeketh shall find; and the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto them, by the power of the Holy Ghost" (1 Nephi 10:19).<br><br>To understand something requires that we gain and retain facts and information. Of course those facts and information should be relevant, or we will waste valuable time analyzing that which is not important. Ultimately, we must judge what information is useful and what information is irrelevant, but that usually requires that we at least become exposed to a variety of information. It is also important that we assess the uncertainty in the information judged as relevant. Clearly we cannot hope to understand, rationalize, interpret, or apply lessons learned by others if we do not know the facts about their experiences. We cannot hope to understand and avoid past mistakes in history unless we know some events of history, any more than we can hope to understand and use chemistry unless we know some facts of chemistry. There will always be those in our society who could have the greatest influence for good but who seem to be interested only in the present and who ignore both the past and the future. Others, however, have "made history" by building on the wisdom of past civilizations--wisdom that was gained only by dedicated study and prayer. Of course this includes many modern and ancient prophets.<br><br>Consider the following statements made by modern-day prophets about the value of knowledge, learning, and education.<br><br><i>Every accomplishment, every polished grace, every useful attainment in mathematics, music, and in all science and art belong to the Saints, and they should avail themselves as expeditiously as possible of the wealth of knowledge the sciences offer to every diligent and persevering scholar.</i> [Brigham Young, <i>JD</i> 10:224]<br><br><i>We might ask, when shall we cease to learn? I will give you my opinion about it; never, never. . . .</i><br><br><i>We shall never cease to learn, unless we apostatize from the religion of Jesus Christ.</i> [Brigham Young, <i>JD</i> 3:203]<br><br><i>True education seeks to make men and women not only good mathematicians, proficient linguists, profound scientists, or brilliant literary lights, but also honest men with virtue, temperance, and brotherly love.</i> [David O. McKay, "Why Education?" <i>Improvement Era,</i> September 1967, 3]<br><br>It is my observation that those who make the most of the new discoveries in the sciences or who create new applications in technology do so from the basis of a sound understanding of the fundamental principles of those sciences or technology. I believe that this is also true in nearly any area that might be considered. Thus it seems wise for us to try to understand--not just to study, not just to get a grade in, not just to get a degree in, not just to have experience with--the important foundational principles in any field we either choose or are asked to pursue. I urge you as students to avoid those behaviors and shortcuts that yield only immediate short-term results and that would encourage you to merely "get through" your university experience. Do not compromise your future capability and productivity by losing sight of your goal that you are here to learn and to really understand both spiritual and academic matters. I urge you to build your future on the rock of the Savior and on the foundation of knowledge and understanding of truth.<br><br>Consider the words of Brigham Young on the matter of education in the following three statements. "A firm, unchangeable course of righteousness through life is what secures to a person true intelligence" (<i>JD</i> 8:32). "Our education should be such as to improve our minds and fit us for increased usefulness; to make us of greater service to the human family" (<i>JD</i> 14:83). "Education is a good thing, and blessed is the man who has it, and can use it for the dissemination of the Gospel without being puffed up with pride" (<i>JD</i> 11:214).<br><br>I have recently reread <i>The Aims of a BYU Education,</i> a document that was developed a few years ago. The Aims document outlines what the purpose of this university is from the perspectives of prophets. Have you students read this document? Have you considered what it says? I believe it will help to clarify your perspectives of why you are here. I believe it is worth the few minutes it takes to read or reread and to think carefully about. May I quote a few more selections from that document.<br><br>"Education is the power to think clearly, the power to act well in the world's work, and the power to appreciate life" (Brigham Young, quoted by George H. Brimhall in "The Brigham Young University," <i>Improvement Era,</i> July 1920, 831).<br><br><i>The mission of Brigham Young University . . . is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life. That assistance should provide a period of intensive learning in a stimulating setting where a commitment to excellence is expected and the full realization of human potential is pursued.</i> [<i>The Mission of Brigham Young University and The Aims of a BYU Education</i> (pamphlet), BYU, 1995, 1]<br><br><i>To this end, BYU seeks to develop students of faith, intellect, and character who have the skills and the desire to continue learning and to serve others throughout their lives. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . A BYU education should be (1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building, leading to (4) lifelong learning and service.</i> [<i>Mission and Aims,</i> 3]<br><br>Also, consider the words of two prophets about their vision of Brigham Young University.<br><br><i>Brother Maeser, I want you to remember that you ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God.</i> [Brigham Young, in Reinhard Maeser, <i>Karl G. Maeser: A Biography</i> (Provo: Brigham Young University, 1928), 79]<br><br>[BYU] <i>has no justification for its existence unless it builds character, creates and develops faith, and makes men and women of strength and courage, fortitude, and service--men and women who will become stalwarts in the Kingdom and bear witness of the . . . divinity of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is not justified on an academic basis only.</i> [Spencer W. Kimball, "On My Honor," in <i>Speeches of the Year, 1978</i> (Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1979), 137]<br><br>[BYU fulfills its promise when] <i>the morality of the graduates of this University provide</i>[s] <i>the music of hope for the inhabitants of this planet.</i> [Spencer W. Kimball, "Second Century Address and Dedication of Carillon Tower and Bells," Brigham Young University, 10 October 1975, 12]<br><br>Also, from the Aims document we read the following about the purpose of our being at BYU:<br><br><i>Every part of the BYU experience should therefore strengthen character--academic integrity in taking a test or writing a research paper; sportsmanship on the playing field; the honest reporting of research findings in a laboratory; careful use of university funds derived from the tithes of Church members; treating all other people with dignity and fairness; and wholehearted acceptance of commitments made to bishops and parents.</i> Character is constructed by small decisions. <i>At this personal level of detail, BYU will realize its hope of teaching "those moral virtues which characterize the life and teachings of the Son of God" (Mission Statement).</i> [<i>Mission and Aims,</i> 11; emphasis added]<br><br>Finally, from the Aims document we have this summary:<br><br><i>These are the aims of a BYU education. Taken together, they should lead students toward wholeness: "the balanced development of the total person" (Mission Statement). These aims aspire to promote an education that helps students integrate all parts of their university experience into a fundamentally sacred way of life--their faith and reasoning, their knowledge and conduct, their public lives and private convictions. . . .</i><br><br>[Prophets] <i>have also known that education plays a vital role in realizing the promises of the Restoration; that a broad vision of education for<br>self-reliance and personal growth is at the very heart of the gospel when the gospel is at the heart of education. To the degree that BYU achieves its aims, the lives of its students will confirm Brigham Young's confidence that education is indeed "a good thing," blessing all those who humbly and faithfully use it to bless others.</i> [<i>The Aims of a BYU Education,</i> 14; also see http://www.byu.edu/about/aims/]<br><br>Let me share a few brief quotes from the scriptures concerning the importance of humility as we seek knowledge, understanding, and wisdom. "But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God" (2 Nephi 9:29). "See that ye are not lifted up unto pride; yea, see that ye do not boast in your <i>own</i> wisdom" (Alma 38:11; emphasis added).<br><br><i>And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</i> [Ether 12:27]<br><br>To conclude, I encourage each of you to do the following:<br><br>1. Build your life on a foundation of strong spiritual and academic principles.<br><br>2. Have faith in the experience of others and learn from their experiences and from your own experiences.<br><br>3. Seek all the information you can and assess its quality before you make a decision. Be cautious as you extrapolate or judge.<br><br>4. Trust in the future value of learning, both learning in breadth and in depth.<br><br>5. Remember those character traits of lasting value, including humility, civility, integrity, industry, rigor, and accountability.<br><br>I thank my Heavenly Father for the blessings of learning afforded me and my family at Brigham Young University. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Earl M. Woolley was dean of the College of Physical and Mathematical Sciences at BYU when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 3 October 2000.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1> Thanksgiving Daily” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I love to be among the youth of the Church. I love your energy, your optimism, your faith. I have heard others say they always feel younger when they spend time with young people. This has always been my experience.<br><br>It is good to be here today. I felt a certain thrill as I watched you enter this great Marriott Center. I noticed the beautiful smiling faces, the well-kept hair, the appropriate dress. I thank you for being here today.<br><br>Think for a moment, if you will, of someone you know who is truly happy. We've all met those who seem to radiate happiness. They seem to smile more than others, they laugh more than others--just being around them makes us happier as well.<br><br>Now think of someone you know who isn't happy at all. Perhaps they seem 10 years older than they are, drained of energy--perhaps they are angry or bitter or depressed.<br><br>What is the difference between them? What are the characteristics that differentiate the happy from the miserable? Is there something that unhappy people can do to be happier? I believe there is.<br><br>Let me tell you a story to illustrate this observation.<br><br>A long time ago in a faraway village lived a man who everyone did their very best to avoid. He was the type of person who believed that there was only one competent person in the world, and that one person was himself. Consequently he was never satisfied with anything. His shoes never fit right. His shirt never felt comfortable. When his food wasn't too cold, it was too salty, and when it wasn't too hot, it was too bland.<br><br>If a field wasn't sowed by himself, it was not sowed well. If he didn't close the door, the door was not closed properly.<br><br>In short, he made a career of frowning, lecturing, criticizing, and mumbling about the incompetencies of every other person in the rest of the world.<br><br>Unfortunately, the man was married, which made matters all the worse. No matter what his wife did, in his eyes it was wrong. No matter what the unfortunate woman cooked, sewed, or cleaned, or even when she milked the cow, it was never satisfactory, and he let her know it.<br><br>She tried very hard to be a good wife, but it seemed the harder she tried the less she pleased him. Finally, one evening she could take no more.<br><br>"I'll tell you what we'll do," she told him. "Tomorrow I will do your chores and you will do mine."<br><br>"But you can't do my chores," the man replied. "You don't know the first thing about sowing, hoeing, and irrigating."<br><br>But the woman was adamant. And on top of that, she was filled with a righteous anger that frankly astonished and frightened the man to the point where he didn't dare disagree.<br><br>So the next morning the wife went off to the fields and the man began the domestic chores. After thinking about it, he had actually convinced himself he was looking forward to it. Once and for all, he would demonstrate to his wife how things should be done.<br><br>Unfortunately, not everything went according to plan. In fact, nearly everything the man touched turned into disaster. He spilled the milk, let the pig get into the house, lost the cow, burned the dinner, and ultimately set the house on fire, narrowly escaping with his own life.<br><br>When his wife returned, she discovered her husband sitting on a pile of ashes, smoke still rising from his clothes. But the woman wasn't the type to rub things in. She helped him up, wiped the soot from his beard, fixed him a little something to eat, and then prepared a bed of straw for them to sleep on.<br><br>From that day forward, the man never complained about anyone or anything else for as long as he lived.<br><br>What do you suppose this story teaches us?<br><br>For one thing, it teaches that those who complain make their own and others' lives miserable. The story also teaches humility. It reminds us that "pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall" (Proverbs 16:18). It teaches us not to judge others until we walk in their shoes for a while.<br><br>In addition, the story illustrates a quality that the Roman orator Cicero claimed was "not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others" (Marcus Tullius Cicero,<i>Pro Plancio,</i>54 B.C.). It is a quality I have found in every happy person I know. It is a quality that instantly makes a person more likable and more at peace. Where there is an abundance, there is happiness. Where there is an absence, there is often sadness, resentment, and futility.<br><br>The virtue I am speaking of is gratitude.<br><br>In our story, it was the absence of gratitude that made the man miserable. His inability to appreciate others caused him to be critical of their efforts. Not only did he not empathize with them, he could not allow himself to acknowledge their contributions.<br><br>The disasters that confronted him surely made him humble, but, more particularly, they made him appreciate and be grateful for his wife.<br><br>Gratitude is a mark of a noble soul and a refined character. We like to be around those who are grateful. They tend to brighten all around them. They make others feel better about themselves. They tend to be more humble, more joyful, more likable.<br><br>You might be surprised to know that gratitude is a commandment of the Father. "Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things" (D&amp;amp;C 59:7), the Lord has commanded in these latter days. Even further, He has admonished that "in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his commandments" (D&amp;amp;C 59:21).<br><br>In the Book of Mormon we learn that we should "live in thanksgiving daily" (Alma 34:38). Isn't that a wonderful thought? To live in thanksgiving daily? Can you imagine how your life would improve if you lived in thanksgiving daily? Can you imagine how your life would improve if others did the same? Do you think the world would be a happier place? Less stressful? Less angry? More spiritual?<br><br>President Joseph F. Smith proclaimed:<br><br><i>The grateful man sees so much in the world to be thankful for, and with him the good outweighs the evil. Love overpowers jealousy, and light drives darkness out of his life. Pride destroys our gratitude and sets up selfishness in its place. How much happier we are in the presence of a grateful and loving soul, and how careful we should be to cultivate, through the medium of a prayerful life, a thankful attitude toward God and man!</i>[<i>GD,</i>263]<br><br>A few minutes ago I asked you to think of someone you knew who was truly happy. Think of the person again, if you will, and grade on this principle: Does he or she live inthanksgiving daily?<br><br>Now think of someone you know who is unhappy or resentful. Does this person live in thanksgiving daily?<br><br>It is difficult to even imagine a resentful person who is grateful or a grateful person who is resentful. President Gordon B. Hinckley has said:<br><br><i>Absence of gratitude is the mark of the narrow, uneducated mind. It bespeaks a lack of knowledge and the ignorance of self-sufficiency. It expresses itself in ugly egotism and frequently in wanton mischief. . . .</i><i></i><br><br><i>Where there is appreciation, there is courtesy, there is concern for the rights and property of others. Without it, there is arrogance and evil.</i>[<i>CR,</i>October 1964, 117]<br><br>I believe that many people are unhappy because they have not learned to be grateful. Some carry the burden of bitterness and resentfulness for many years. Some pass their days as though suffering a deep sadness they cannot name. Others are unhappy because life didn't turn out the way they thought it would.<br><br>"If only I had money," some might say to themselves, "then I could be happy."<br><br>"If only I were better looking."<br><br>"If only I were smarter."<br><br>"If only I had a new car, a college degree, a job, a wife, hair that wasn't so frizzy." (Or, in my case, if only I had more hair or I was 12 inches taller.)<br><br>If we only look around us, there are a thousand reasons for us not to be happy, and it is simplicity itself to blame our unhappiness on the things we lack in life. It doesn't take any talent at all to find them. The problem is, the more we focus on the things we don't have, the unhappier and more resentful we become.<br><br>Over the course of my years, I have met thousands of people. I have dined with the prosperous as well as the poverty-stricken. I have conversed with the mighty and with the meek. I have walked with the famous and the feeble. I have run with outstanding athletes and those who are not athletically inclined.<br><br>One thing I can tell you with certainty is this: You cannot predict happiness by the amount of money, fame, or power a person has. External conditions do not necessarily make a person happy. The brethren who have had assignments in Africa report that despite the abject poverty, the people are very happy. The fact is that the external things so valued by the world are often the cause of a great deal of misery in the world.<br><br>Those who live in thanksgiving daily, however, are usually among the world's happiest people. And they make others happy as well.<br><br>Years ago Elder J. Golden Kimball was traveling with one of the presiding brethren in southern Utah. In those days meetings often didn't have a time limit; they went on as long as the speaker wanted to speak. For those of you looking for something to be grateful for, perhaps I've just given you one idea.<br><br>One fast Sunday they had been preaching nearly all day. Everyone was hungry, especially Elder Kimball, who felt that he "was pretty nearly dead."<br><br>Finally, at about four o'clock in the afternoon, the presiding apostle turned and said, "Now, Brother Kimball, get up and tell them about the<i>Era."</i><br><br>The<i>Era</i>magazine had just been launched, and the Brethren wanted to encourage subscriptions. Elder Kimball approached the pulpit and then, after a short pause, said, "All you men that will take the<i>Era</i>if we will let you go home, raise your right hand." There was not a single man who did not raise his hand that day and subscribe to the<i>Era.</i>(In J. Golden Kimball,<i>CR,</i>April 1932, 78.)<br><br>You see, the power of gratitude is immense.<br><br>Rulon Gardner grew up in the small town of Afton, Wyoming. He is one of nine children. His mother and father are faithful members of the Church and instilled proper values in their children.<br><br>But because Rulon was so large, his classmates teased him. The taunts and name-calling troubled young Rulon, but he never became angry or resentful. He could have withdrawn and become bitter. Like so many others, he could have counted all the things that were going wrong and simply given up.<br><br>Instead, he used the insults as motivation. He determined he would use his size to his advantage. He would make something of himself.<br><br>"I would go out, as a kid," Rulon said, "and I could barely pick up a bale of hay. By the time my senior year came around, I was grabbing four bales of hay at a time, each 100 pounds. Just grabbing them and walking with them and seeing how physically strong I could be" (in Alan Robinson, "Wrestler's Magic Moment," Associated Press, Sydney, Australia, 28 September 2000 [at www.abcnews.go.com/sections/sports/DailyNews/oly_gardner_000928.html]).<br><br>He milked cows twice a day, often in subzero temperatures. He lifted frozen bales of hay to feed the cows. At times he would carry a newborn calf into the safety of a warm barn. He got up early in the morning, did his chores, then went to school. After school he either went to wrestling or football practice, then back to the farm to do more chores.<br><br>Rulon found that his size wasn't a disadvantage for him as an athlete--in fact, it was an asset. Wrestling particularly came easy to him, and he became the Wyoming state champion. After graduating from high school he decided that perhaps he might be good enough to compete in the Olympic games.<br><br>In Atlanta in 1996, due to a miscommunication, he arrived at the weigh-in 22 seconds too late and missed his chance to compete. Again Rulon could have despaired. He could have cursed his luck. He could have become embittered and resentful.<br><br>But do you know what he did? He worked harder. Instead of burying himself in self-pity, he began speaking at youth firesides about his experience. "I missed the Olympic games by 22 seconds," he told his eager listeners. "Don't you let anything keep you from your goals."<br><br>After four years of hard work, Rulon Gardner wanted to compete in the 2000 Olympic games in Sydney, Australia. The only trouble was, he couldn't afford the trip. That's when the members of his hometown rallied to his side. They held bake sales and potluck dinners and raised enough money to allow Rulon and his family to make the trip to Sydney.<br><br>This time he did not miss the weigh-in. He advanced through the preliminary rounds until he reached the final obstacle to his gaining a gold medal.<br><br>That obstacle was a man the world called the Siberian Bear, Alexander Karelin. This Russian bear is considered by most as the greatest Greco-Roman wrestler in the history of the sport. Not only had he not lost a single match in 13 years, but no one had scored a point on him in more than a decade. Karelin had won the gold medal in three previous Olympic Games and was the heavy favorite towin an unprecedented fourth gold medal.<br><br>But at the end of the gold-medal match, it was the farm boy from Afton, Wyoming, who stood triumphant in what many consider the greatest upset of the summer Olympic games.<br><br>"The reason I think I won," Rulon said, "is because I work harder than anyone else, train harder. And every day I live my life, I do everything I need to do to put my life in order" (in Alan Robinson, Associated Press).<br><br>Waving an American flag, a grateful Rulon Gardner thanked his family, his God, and his hometown of Afton, Wyoming, for their helping to make the moment possible.<br><br>Winning the gold medal in such a stunning way made Rulon an instant celebrity. Sometimes this sort of attention changes people. Sometimes people become more calloused. Sometimes they forget those they owe the mostto. But not Rulon Gardner.<br><br>Recently, while a guest on an evening talk show, the host invited Rulon to watch some highlights from his Olympic victory. Without warning, the picture changed to a live shot from Afton, Wyoming. It seemed that the entire population of the town had assembled in the high school gymnasium. They cheered and shouted and held up signs that said, "Rulon's got milk!" and "My uncle rocks!"<br><br>As this man--one of the strongest men in the world--looked into the television monitor at the faces of the people he loved, tears ofgratitude came to his eyes.<br><br>In a letter written to his stake president, Rulon Gardner said:<br><br><i>The Lord has given me the chance to work for all my dreams. I feel the Church has helped me to focus and live my life in the ways that have helped me to train and become an Olympic champ. . . . I am blessed . . . to be a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</i>[Letter to President Val J. Call, Afton Wyoming Stake, 20 October 2000]<br><br>Rulon Gardner knows what it means to be grateful.<br><br>Gratitude turns a meal into a feast and drudgery into delight. It softens our grief and heightens our pleasure. It turns the simple and common into the memorable and transcendent. It forges bonds of love and fosters loyalty and admiration.<br><br>Living in thanksgiving daily is a habit that will enrich our lives and the lives of those we love. But how do we make this part of who we are? May I suggest three things that will help as we strive to live in thanksgiving daily?<br><br><b>First, we must open our eyes.</b><br><br>I agree with Robert Louis Stevenson, who wrote, "The man who forgets to be thankful has fallen asleep in life" (<i>Quotationary,</i>electronic quotation dictionary). Unfortunately, because the beauties of life are so abundant, sometimes we take them for granted.<br><br>Our minds have a marvelous capacity to notice the unusual. However, the opposite is true as well: The more often we see the things around us--even the beautiful and wonderful things--the more they become invisible to us.<br><br>That is why we often take for granted the beauty of this world: the flowers, the trees, the birds, the clouds--even those we love.<br><br>Because we see things so often, we see them less and less.<br><br>Those who live in thanksgiving daily, however, have a way of opening their eyes and seeing the wonders and beauties of this world as though seeing them for the first time.<br><br>I encourage you to look around you. Notice the people you care about. Notice the beauties of this campus. Notice the fragrance of the flowers and the song of the birds. Notice and give thanks for the blue of the sky, the red of the leaves, and the white of the clouds. Enjoy every sight, every smell, every taste, every sound.<br><br>When we open our eyes and give thanks for the bountiful beauty of this life, we live in thanksgiving daily.<br><br><b>The second thing we can do is open our hearts.</b><br><br>We must let go of the negative emotions that bind our hearts and instead fill our souls with love, faith, and thanksgiving.<br><br>Anger, resentment, and bitterness stunt our spiritual growth. Would you bathe in impure water? Then why do we bathe our spirits with negative and bitter thoughts and feelings?<br><br>You can cleanse your heart. You don't have to harbor thoughts and feelings that drag you down and destroy your spirit.<br><br>You can repent of uncleanliness. That is the miracle of Christ's atoning sacrifice. You can become clean. You can cleanse your heart of impurity.<br><br>Begin the process today. Repent of those things you should repent of. Drink deeply of the living waters of the gospel. These latter days are a time of great spiritual thirst. Many in the world are searching, often intensely, for a source of refreshment that will quench their yearning for meaning and direction in their lives. The Lord provides the living water that can quench the burning thirst of those whose lives are parched by a drought of truth.<br><br>Pray with all your heart. Consider the love your Heavenly Father has for all His children. Open your hearts to His cleansing word. Feast on the words of holy writ. Cherish the messages of modern-day prophets and apostles. Forgive others who have offended you. Don't waste another moment feeling self-pity. Every day drain from your heart the feelings of resentment, rage, and defeat that do nothing but discourage and destroy. Fill your heart with those things that ennoble, encourage, and inspire.<br><br>The great Book of Mormon prophet Nephi certainly had reason to be resentful. Hated by his brothers, bound and beaten and nearly murdered, he had plenty to be bitter about. After his father died, Nephi must have felt completely alone. He surely felt threatened. He surely felt discouraged. He surely felt troubled. But when it came time for him to communicate his feelings, what did he write?<br><br><i>Behold, my soul delighteth in the things of the Lord; and my heart pondereth continually upon the things which I have seen and heard.</i>[2 Nephi 4:16]<br><br>Yes, his path had been difficult. Yes, his heart groaned because of mistakes he had made, but he did not allow himself to linger innegativity. Instead, he told himself:<br><br><i>Rejoice, O my heart, and give place no more for the enemy of my soul.</i><br><br><i>Do not anger again because of mine enemies. Do not slacken my strength because of mine afflictions.</i><br><br><i>Rejoice, O my heart, and cry unto the Lord, and say: O Lord, I will praise thee forever; yea, my soul will rejoice in thee.</i>[2 Nephi 4:28–30]<br><br><b>The third thing we can do to live in thanksgiving daily is open our arms.</b><br><br>One of the best ways we show our gratitude is by blessing the lives of those around us. The great King Benjamin taught his people:<br><br><i>If you should render all the thanks and praise which your whole soul has power to possess, to that God who has created you, and has kept and preserved you, and has caused that ye should rejoice . . . --</i><br><br><i>. . . If ye should serve him with all your whole souls yet ye would be unprofitable servants.</i>[Mosiah 2:20–21]<br><br>And how do we render thanks unto God? King Benjamin told us that as well:<br><br><i>And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.</i>[Mosiah 2:17]<br><br>We can live in thanksgiving daily by opening our arms to those around us. When was the last time you told someone you love how much they mean to you? When was the last time you expressed your gratitude to someone who has always been there for you, someone who has sacrificed for you, someone whose heart has always been filled with hopes and dreams foryou?<br><br>When was the last time you unselfishly reached out to help another in need? Every time we cheer another's heart, every time we ease another's burden, every time we lift a weary hand, we show our gratitude to that God to whom we owe all that we have and allthat we are.<br><br>Not long ago a mother and father from the Republic of Georgia faced a terrifying reality. The doctors told them their baby had a heart condition, and unless he had surgery he would die. Because they did not have adequate facilities in Georgia, the mother and father walked across their country and all the way to Yerevan, Armenia, seeking medical help.<br><br>The Armenian doctors examined the child and agreed that the baby needed heart surgery. They knew how to perform the surgery and they had the necessary facilities, but they couldn't perform the operation because they didn't have the right tubing. As much as they wanted to help, there was nothing they could do. They told the couple to take their baby home to die.<br><br>As you know, the Church--through its Humanitarian Service arm--sends millions of pounds of food, clothing, and medical and educational materials throughout the world each year. As it so happened, Elder and Sister Sangster were serving a humanitarian mission in Armenia, and they had just received a container of medical supplies.<br><br>You may have already guessed that tucked away in this container of medical supplies was a box of precisely the kind of tubing needed for this child's operation.<br><br>When the doctors discovered the tubing, they rushed the baby into surgery and performed the operation.<br><br>That's a wonderful story and one that repeats itself daily as a result of the tremendous humanitarian help that is given to many nations in the world. The great welfare effort given by the Church benefits members and nonmembers during times of need. It reaches out to care for others. But what happened later makes it an even better story. One day, soon after the operation, Elder and Sister Sangster heard a knock at their door. When they opened it, this loving mother and father fell to their knees and wept as they thanked the Sangsters and their church for supplying the precious tubing that had saved the life of their child.<br><br>The blessings that come from opening our arms to others are among the choicest this earth has to offer.<br><br>As we strive to open our eyes, hearts, and arms, our step will become a little lighter, our smile will become a little brighter, and the darkness that sometimes broods over our lives will become a little whiter. Don't be discouraged if you haven't been an especially grateful person. Rejoice and think of what an impression you will make on those who thought they knew you. Think of how delightfully surprised they will be.<br><br>Be grateful. Every day is a new canvas--a new opportunity. Our beloved President Gordon B. Hinckley has said:<br><br><i>My plea is that we stop seeking out the storms and enjoy more fully the sunlight. I am suggesting that as we go through life, we "accentuate the positive." I am asking that we look a little deeper for the good, that we still our voices of insult and sarcasm, that we more generously compliment and endorse virtue and effort.</i>[<i>Standing for Something</i>(New York: Times Books, 2000), 101]<br><br>Choice blessings await those who live in thanksgiving daily. "He who receiveth all things with thankfulness," the Lord has promised, "shall be made glorious; and the things of this earth shall be added unto him, even an hundred fold, yea, more" (D&amp;amp;C 78:19).<br><br>Don't wait to start. Open your eyes, open your hearts, and open your arms. I promise that as you do so, you will feel greater joy and happiness. Your life will have a new level of meaning. You will forge relationships that will transcend this life and endure through the eternities.<br><br>My dear brothers and sisters, I am grateful to be here with you. I am grateful for this experience of mortality. I am grateful for the gospel and for the life and testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith. I am grateful for my wonderful wife, my dear children and grandchildren. I am grateful for the support and love shown to me by countless friends and members of the Church throughout the world. I am grateful for life and even more grateful for the glorious promise of eternal life to come.<br><br>Not everyone can be a star quarterback; not everyone can be the CEO of a Fortune 500 company; not everyone can win a gold medal at the Olympics; but everyone--<i>everyone--</i>can live in thanksgiving daily.<br><br>As a special witness, I bear solemn testimony that Jesus is the living Christ, our Savior and Redeemer. He asks that we believe in Him, that we learn of Him, that we strive to follow His teachings, and that we adhere to the teachings of our prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley. He inspires him in the direction needed for this life and life eternal.<br><br>May we follow Him in all we do is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Joseph B. Wirthlin was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given on 31 October 2000.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>urselves to Act in All Holiness” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I must admit to feeling a little out of place here this morning. This call to speak today reminds me of the Texan who went to an Oklahoma wedding. When the minister asked if anyone could think of any reasons why this couple should not be married, the Texan stood up and said, "Well, no, I can't think of any reason for these two kids not to get married, but while I am up I would like to say a few words about Texas."<br><br>I routinely meet with administration and foreign government officials and dignitaries and brief congressional delegations on various issues, but never have I felt the weight of responsibility more than I feel coming here today. I have earnestly sought interest in your faith and prayers that what I say will uplift you, that it will cause you to "bind yourselves to act in all holiness before [the Lord]" (D&amp;amp;C 43:9).<br><br>Despite the weight of responsibility associated with coming here today, I count it a great honor to share my testimony of this great work we are all a part of. I would like to talk about two basic gospel principles this morning.<br><br>First, I wish to proclaim with some degree of clarity and example our duty to be obedient, as Paul counseled the Romans: "Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are" (Romans 6:16).<br><br>Second, I want to follow with some thoughts on the crown jewel of our religion: selfless service or charity. Paul's counsel to the Saints in Corinth highlighted this principle: "Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal" (1 Corinthians 13:1). I believe these two principles are inseparably connected--the former as the first law of heaven and the foundation of all other laws, and the latter as the ultimate expression of the first.<br><br>But before I begin, this is an important day in our nation's history. It is the first national election of the new millennium. We have the right, the responsibility, and the obligation to vote today to change the direction of this nation. And I say "change" because regardless of which party wins this great contest, there will be a shift in the direction and climate of this nation. I urge you to be part of that process if you haven't already exercised your privilege to make your choice known.<br><br>General Omar N. Bradley once said:<br><br><i>Freedom--no word was ever spoken that has held out greater hope, demanded greater sacrifice, needed more to be nurtured, blessed more the giver, ... or come closer to being God's will on earth.</i><br><br>General Bradley made it very clear that this concept of freedom--if it is to continue a reality--demands constant attention. His thoughts weren't new. Woodrow Wilson said, "Freedom exists only where the people take care of the government" (speech in New York, 4 September 1912).<br><br>So, with this great gift of being free of restraint, slavery, detention, and oppression; with this great gift of political independence; with this great gift of civil rights and immunity from the arbitrary exercise of authority and the exemption from unpleasant conditions; with this great gift giving us the capacity to exercise choice and free will; and, finally, with this gift that allows us the right of enjoying all of the privileges of citizenship and the opportunity to worship the God of our fathers, in this, the greatest, richest, most blessed nation in the history of the world, comes responsibility--some very serious responsibility. I hope you have, or will before the day is over, exercised your responsibility and voted your conscience.<br><br>Now to this first law of heaven: obedience. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught us: "When we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated" (D&amp;amp;C 130:21). If you will permit me, I wish to weave in a couple of experiences to demonstrate these principles. The first of these is a personal one.<br><br>I have had the opportunity of flying a number of different high-performance jet fighters during my time in the air force, and flying each of them has been a unique experience. However, at one point in the past, I was flying a small two-engine turboprop airplane called the OV-10 Bronco. It was an observation aircraft, and in it I performed forward air controller duties. The OV-10 was fully acrobatic, cruised at speeds ranging from 200 to 400 mph, and looked a lot like a oversized dragonfly with a large, clear bubble canopy protruding out the front. This allowed the pilot to see nearly all the way around the aircraft with an unobstructed view, and it flew slow enough and was maneuverable enough that you could locate and mark the position of targets using 2.75-inch rockets that it carried in pods located under its fuselage.<br><br>I not only flew this aircraft into combat but also flew it for two years while I was assigned to Bergstrom Air Force Base in Austin, Texas. Although I was assigned to Bergstrom, I was away from home about half of the time, as we supported all of the army and air force units west of the Mississippi.<br><br>Shortly after our arrival in Austin, Vicki and I were asked to visit with our stake president early one Saturday morning. He talked with Vicki and me for some time, during which I laid out in pretty graphic detail my travel and temporary duty schedule. Despite that heavy travel schedule, the stake president extended the call for me to serve as the elders quorum president in our ward. As he concluded that interview, he must have sensed my concern over what I thought would be a very difficult assignment made even tougher by my being gone almost half of every month.<br><br>He looked me in the eye and promised me that if I would do my best--the absolute best I could when I was home--and attend my meetings, work hard, and pick good men to be my counselors, the Lord would bless me with success in this calling. And then he added that the Lord would protect and watch over me while I was away from my family.<br><br>I was buoyed up by his promise of success in this calling in a large and recently organized ward, but quite frankly didn't think much more about the promise that I would be protected and watched over. I was, after all, young, confident in my abilities, and a combat veteran. I felt I could handle the OV-10 very well.<br><br>Several months later I was returning one Saturday evening from a two-week flying training assignment at a western base and stopped, along with a second airplane, in El Paso, Texas, for gas. It was late, and the two other pilots--in the second OV-10 in the formation--argued that we should spend the night in El Paso, get a room, have a good meal, sleep late on Sunday morning, and get home mid-afternoon on Sunday. I was also tired and hungry and agreed it would sure be great to get a good night's sleep, but I recalled the guidance of my stake president and knew that he would expect me to be at the early Sunday morning priesthood executive committee meeting and the other meetings that would follow. So I convinced the others to gas up quickly and get on our way. I called Vicki. She and our two-year-old son would be at the base in just a little under three hours to pick me up.<br><br>Since I had led from California to El Paso, it was the other pilot's turn to lead our two-ship formation. It was probably about a two-and-a-half–hour flight from El Paso to Austin. About halfway it grew dark, and the weather started to turn foul. I flew in close formation on the leader for the last half of the flight. About 15 miles away from the air base, in darkness and in some rough weather, we let down to just below the clouds to begin our approach to the field. We lined up on initial, which meant we would fly down the runway at about 1,000 feet above the ground. Then, over the approach end of the runway, the leader would execute a 180-degree turn, and I would take five seconds spacing and do the same 180-degree turn, slow down, extend our gear and flaps, and turn to final approach, with us landing one behind the other. We were flying just beneath the ragged edge of some very bumpy cumulus clouds, in and out of rain showers.<br><br>The leader approached the runway and gave the signal for me to take five seconds spacing and then do my turn or pitchout to downwind. About the time we were approaching the field to land, a concerned wife and mother looked outside at the impending stormy weather and felt prompted to kneel with her two-year-old son and ask a loving Heavenly Father to protect and bring home a dad who had been gone for two long weeks.<br><br>I counted to five and pulled the throttles back on the engines powering the two three-bladed, eight-and-a-half–foot propellers to slow the aircraft down and snapped the airplane into a 60-degree banked turn. I pulled back on the stick to increase the G forces, which are needed to complete a level 180-degree turn to a downwind position parallel to the runway. The G forces also help to slow the airplane down from 300 mph to less than 150 mph in a matter of a few seconds.<br><br>Just as I pulled on the stick to tighten up the turn, the main oil line failed on the right engine. Oil pressure is needed to hold the propeller at the precise pitch, based on the throttle position. When the oil line failed, the propeller instantly feathered, causing the three propeller blades to rotate 90 degrees within the propeller hub and streamline into the relative wind. As they rotated, they created extremely high drag loads on the engine, similar to someone trying to pull three large oars through thick molasses. This excessive load caused the engine to fail, followed by an engine fire. This catastrophic loss of thrust on the right engine while I was in a steep left turn caused my airplane to yaw upward into the nighttime storm clouds. A relatively simple overhead pattern and landing to complete the mission had turned into a serious malfunction compounded by the inclement weather.<br><br>A key part of our training as we learn to fly is how to handle various emergencies that can occur in flight. With the illumination of the fire warning light, I instinctively followed the emergency procedures--first shutting down the engine and then discharging the fire extinguisher, taking care of the engine problem. However, during the time I was concentrating on accomplishing the emergency procedure, I experienced a severe case of spatial disorientation--meaning I was no longer sure which way was up or down.<br><br>During those few seconds in the darkness of the clouds, a few hundred feet above my awaiting family, my brain fought to make sense out of what I saw on the instrument panel. As I struggled to overcome the compelling instinct to follow other sensory perceptions, I recalled the final part of the promise my stake president pronounced as he called me to be an elders quorum president several months earlier. He promised that the Lord would watch over me if I did my duty. In those brief seconds of fear and confusion, I prayed that Heavenly Father would make good on that promise.<br><br>Now, brothers and sisters, with a clarity that I cannot explain but with a power I could never deny, I knew with a confidence that defied the situation that I must simply turn left. Despite being in the weather and lacking the visual cues essential to land from a overhead pattern, I followed the promptings and quite easily and quickly maneuvered out of the weather without further reference to the instruments, completing a descending turn to final approach and landing without further incident. The first hint the control tower had that there was a problem came as I radioed them on landing rollout--after saying another short prayer of thanks--telling them that they needed to get the fire trucks and a tow truck out to the end of the runway.<br><br>I have thought about that experience many times and marveled at the peace I felt as the situation deteriorated in those brief seconds of frantic action and confusion. I have a better idea of what Helaman was talking about when he related the experiences of his stripling warriors to his commander.<br><br>Mormon quoted from Helaman's field report to Moroni from a time when they were surrounded by their enemy, outnumbered, and nearly starving for want of food:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that the Lord our God did visit us with assurances that he would deliver us; yea, insomuch that he did speak peace to our souls, and did grant unto us great faith, and did cause us that we should hope for our deliverance in him.</i>[Alma 58:11]<br><br>There is power in obedience. There is power in following the counsel of those who have authority over us. There is peace and assurance in doing our duty and performing with exactness all that the Lord requires of us. We have His word that He will bless us. He will lighten our load when it seems too heavy to bear. He will bring order to situations that seem hopeless and beyond our control. There will be pain. It will be difficult at times. And there will be some turbulent and cloudy air to travel through. You may even become temporarily disoriented. But He will make it possible for us to succeed even when we cannot make out a clear path ahead.<br><br>President Ezra Taft Benson said:<br><br><i>Men and women who turn their lives over to God will discover that He can make a lot more out of their lives than they can. He will deepen their joys, expand their vision, quicken their minds, strengthen their muscles, lift their spirits, multiply their blessings, increase their opportunities, comfort their souls, raise up friends, and pour out peace.</i>[<i>TETB,</i>361]<br><br>When we are obedient, the Lord opens our hearts to the second principle I wish to briefly discuss today: charity and selfless service. Elder Dallin H. Oaks wrote:<br><br><i>Self-effacing service with all of our heart and mind is a high challenge for all of us. ... Those who forget themselves and give service in this manner can look up to God "with a pure heart and clean hands" (Alma 5:19).</i>[<i>Pure in Heart</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1988), 49]<br><br>Two events that I am very familiar with illustrate this principle of selfless service.<br><br>Although my combat experiences have been very limited--a point I am thankful for--these two events are close to my heart because of my selected profession. The first of the events involved a trip to France in the spring of 1994, not long before the 50th anniversary of Operation Overlord that began on June 6, 1944--a day commonly referred to as D-Day, a day in history that we should never forget. Approximately 150,000 men were landed in a single day on the beaches of Normandy using 5,000 ships of every size and nearly 12,000 aircraft. During the next three weeks a total of a million men would funnel across Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword Beaches.<br><br>The day I spent at Normandy was a cold and dreary day. The clouds hung low in the sky, and the wind caused the waves to crash against the shore--not unlike that day nearly 50 years before. During my short visit I climbed a 100-foot hill that overlooks Omaha Beach to the east and Utah Beach further to the west. From this vantage point, despite the distance of three to 10 miles, you can plainly see both beaches. It was on this point, according to Allied intelligence, that the Germans had placed six 155-mm howitzers. These guns had to be destroyed to prevent them from wreaking havoc on the Americans landing at Omaha Beach and the naval fleet offshore. The task was assigned to Americans of the 2nd Ranger Battalion, which landed below the cliff at what is known as Pointe du Hoc. As these men attempted to scale this cliff, German soldiers hurled grenades and opened fire from their positions of advantage in an effort to repel the attack. Only 90 of the 225 Rangers who began the ascent were able to still bear arms at the end of the climb, but when the fighting was over, Pointe du Hoc was in American hands.<br><br>You can get a good view of the geography from the vantage point of that high ground and can easily visualize the thousands of German firing positions that surrounded the area. Standing on that point looking out over those beaches, particularly Omaha Beach, with its wide, soft-sand shoreline, it was difficult to visualize anyone surviving the fields of enemy fire placed in the way. It was humbling to realize that within a few short hours on a single day, within a few hundred yards of where I was standing, more than 12,000 men gave up their lives so that others could live free--others in a future generation that they didn't even know and would never see. That experience had a deep impact on me. Most of these men were your age or younger. They would never marry, never attend college, never experience the joy of children or grandchildren on their laps, and never see their wives or sweethearts again in this life. They gave their lives in selfless service so that we--and the rest of the world--could have one more opportunity to get it right. As Brother Hugh Nibley has said:<br><br><i>For charity there is no bookkeeping, no</i>quid pro quo,<i>no deals, interests, bargaining, or ulterior motives; charity gives to those who do not deserve and expects nothing in return; it is the love God has for us.</i>[<i>Since Cumorah,</i>2d ed., ch. 12, "Good People and Bad People," The Law of the Judgment (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1988), 347]<br><br>By the way, if I have my facts right, I believe a 34-year-old army intelligence officer possessing a PhD in ancient history from the University of California at Berkeley named Hugh Nibley came ashore at Utah Beach at first light on June 6, 1944.<br><br>The second event was a trip to the Orient just a few years ago. I flew to Japan, Korea, and China as part of a group of new general officers. Because we were flying in a small airplane, we island-hopped our way to Japan, stopping at Johnson Atoll and Kwajalein. We then overflew, along with several others, the island of Iwo Jima. I was up in the cockpit on that leg and had a great view of Iwo Jima. It is known to the Japanese as Sulfur Island. Even from altitude, on that clear day you could see it was a black, hot, bubbling, volcanic island that still spewed sulfur gas. During February and March 1945 it was the scene of one of the most terrible battles of World War II. During the 36-day campaign to take that island, a Marine fell to Japanese fire every two minutes. Just think, for 36 days, every two minutes a Marine was killed or wounded. It was the only battle in the history of our corps where Marines suffered more casualties than the enemy.<br><br>Today the island still bears the scars of that incredible struggle. Those who have spent time on the island say that the winds that constantly blow across the black sands of the Iwo Jima beaches seem, at times, to carry the voices of the warriors that fought there a half-century ago. It is a mournful and reverent place, even when viewed from above.<br><br>Before I suffered a back injury and had to quit running regularly, I use to run one of two routes near the Pentagon. The long run took me across the Memorial Bridge past the Lincoln, Vietnam, and Washington Memorials, then across the 14th Street Bridge and back to the Pentagon. But on those days when my legs felt up to it, I would take a shorter but more difficult run up to the Iwo Jima Memorial, high atop a hill overlooking the Potomac and adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery. As I am sure all of you know, this large bronze and granite sculpture captures one of the most famous battle photographs ever taken, the raising of the American flag on Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima. Five Marines and one navy corpsman took part in that flag raising. Three of the six did not survive the battle, but the navy corpsman did. His name was Pharmacist Mate 2nd Class John Bradley.<br><br>I would like to tell you a little of his story. He rarely spoke to his family about his experiences on Iwo Jima. When pressed, he would gloss over and downplay how he had won the nation's second highest award for bravery--the Navy Cross.<br><br>He earned that decoration by rushing to the aid of two wounded Marines and then shielding them with his body from enemy fire while he tended to their wounds. When Bradley hurried to their aid, he didn't exactly rush, he crawled. He crawled because he had been shot through both legs just a few minutes before.<br><br>I encourage you to visit the Iwo Jima War Memorial one day. When you do, step back and read the engraved words: "Where Uncommon Valor Was a Common Virtue." Then study the faces of those men, all young men, captured with great detail in bronze. You will have to go around to the south side and look toward the Potomac River. There you will find John Bradley. You will recognize him. He's the one with the empty canteen pouch. You see, prior to climbing Mount Suribachi, he gave the last of his water to a dying Marine. And on that hot bubbling sulfur island, John Bradley would go the next 24 hours without water.<br><br>There is something in what Corpsman Bradley did that goes beyond bravery--it goes beyond sacrifice. I think it is selflessness. The scriptures call it charity. John Bradley was certainly brave, and his sacrifices have surely secured a great reward for him in the next life, but most of all he was selfless. His brave acts were not done for any reward, nor were they intended to be captured by CBS or the News at 10. There was no public glory in what he did. In fact, men under fire rarely speak of glory. Instead, they speak of those who can be counted on and those who cannot. Above all, they speak about and remember individual acts of selflessness.<br><br>When Felix de Weldon, the sculptor of the Marine Corps War Memorial, asked John Bradley what happened to his canteen, Corpsman Bradley couldn't even remember. In the heat of the battle he had forgotten. But the surviving Marines of Bradley's unit knew, and they remembered. They told de Weldon the story of his sharing his water. Selflessness, you see, is unforgettable--even small acts of selflessness are unforgettable.<br><br>In a few minutes we will all walk out of here and begin the rest of another day. Each of you will face responsibilities of one sort or another. You will face challenges, and most of those can normally be translated into a series of choices.<br><br>A choice to be of service or to step back and hope someone else will volunteer.<br><br>A choice to stand for something that is good and right or let the guy with the loudest voice rule.<br><br>A choice to accept a challenge or settle for second best.<br><br>But of all the choices you will face, there is none greater than the choice between self and selflessness.<br><br>Is the benefit for you? Is it for your team? How about your peer group or school or church?<br><br>Over the chapel doors at the United States Naval Academy is a simple Latin inscription: "Non sibi sed patriae." Translated, it reads: "Not for self but for country." Simple but powerful.<br><br>Selflessness takes time to develop. Rarely does a man or woman suddenly grow a brain and a spine in the middle of a crisis or on a battlefield. Likewise, rarely does a person develop a sense of selflessness in a single moment in time. Spontaneous selfless acts rarely just happen. Instead, they are built on a strong moral foundation and constant obedience to sound principles. They are perfected by doing the right thing--over and over again.<br><br>I am confident that most of you possess strong character and a sense of duty and are striving to be obedient. Before me I see some of the finest young men and women on the face of the earth, faithful members and friends of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Remember the mission of this great university, seen by all as you arrive on campus: "Enter to learn; go forth to serve." I encourage you to build on the spirit of selfless service that Christ exemplified throughout His life.<br><br>John Bradley gave the last of his water to a wounded Marine on February 23, 1945. That afternoon he was struggling to climb the fire-swept heights of Mount Suribachi. The next day he braved enemy fire to aid two wounded Marines. And just a few days later, though wounded himself, he again braved enemy fire to aid two more Marines and shielded them with his own body as he tended to their wounds. It was not for sense of self that he performed those brave acts of courage. It was for others, for those he knew and for those he had never even met. Deep within his soul, John Bradley instinctually understood that "non sibi sed patriae" (not for self but for country) is contagious.<br><br>You see, after aiding those final two wounded Marines, Corpsman John Bradley, badly wounded, lost consciousness. He awoke 36 hours later aboard a hospital ship. How he arrived there is unknown. The names of those Marines or sailors who carried him off the field of battle, who placed him on the small boat, who carried him to the ship, have been lost to history. But their selfless deeds remain unforgettable in the life of John Bradley.<br><br>King Benjamin taught that when we are in the service of others we are only in the service of our God (see Mosiah 2:17). I would suggest that when we provide charitable or selfless service to others, we are acting in obedience to our Father in Heaven. It is my prayer that we will practice obedience to the laws of a loving Heavenly Father who knows what we need to be doing to be His covenant people. It is my prayer that we will exercise the capacity within each of us to become more selfless in our service to each other, to our community, to our church, and to our nation. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Bruce Carlson was an air force lieutenant general serving on the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington, D.C., when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 7 November 2000.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>for Solutions - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters and friends, I am grateful for this opportunity to be here with you. When I visited this campus on another occasion, about 20 years ago, I could not find as good of a parking place as I was given today. I came for Women's Conference with a car full of friends. After a very inspiring and fulfilling day, I went for the car, thinking I would save the other women the long walk through the parking lot. Imagine how shocked I was when I found my car rendered immobile by a huge contraption on the front wheel. I later learned that the students affectionately called this contraption the "boot." Our son, a BYU student body officer at the time, had borrowed my car earlier in the semester while his car was being repaired. Unbeknownst to me, in the rush to meet his many obligations on campus, he had parked somewhere he should not have and received a ticket that he had forgotten to pay. I got the boot that day. So believe me, today as I speak with you about seeking solutions to problems, sometimes not even of our own making, I know something about which I speak.<br><br>And I know you do, too. We each have our burdens to bear. No matter who we are, what we do, or where we go, each one of us will have difficulties. Problems are part of mortality. But when solved with wisdom and in accordance with gospel principles, those very problems can be gateways to eternity. As we walk the path of righteousness and turn to the Lord, we come to know the power of God that is within each one of us.<br><br>I want to commend you for how well you are already doing. Your wise decisions and hard work have brought you to Brigham Young University.<br><br>You do so well with such full schedules and heavy loads. I know something of the sacrifices you make to acquire a first-rate education, and I marvel at your strength and abilities. I admire the faithfulness with which you serve in your Church callings. I cheer for you when you put first things first. I have no doubt that you are youth of a noble birthright and that you can live up to the challenges you meet.<br><br>My personal experience has taught me that as you study and prepare to "go forth to serve," the most important skill you need to acquire is the ability to solve problems. Individually and as a people, we will make greater progress and do so more joyfully if we focus on solutions rather than problems--whatever the problems may be.<br><br>Today I would like to share four gems of motherly advice regarding problem solving. If at first this counsel seems contrary to your way of thinking, I pray that you will keep an open mind, study it out, and put it to the test--always remembering that "there is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated" (D&amp;amp;C 130: 20).<br><br>My first bit of counsel is to stop and consider where you are headed. When faced with a problem, search your soul to see if your present thoughts and actions are leading to a solution, feeding the problem, or possibly even creating more problems for you. You have probably heard the old adage that when you see you are digging yourself into a hole--stop digging! Seek for perspective greater than your own and take an outsider's look at the situation. In Proverbs we are taught that only "fools despise wisdom and instruction" (Proverbs 1:7).<br><br>Let me illustrate. When I was about 12 years old, my girlfriend and I were in her barn saddling a horse for a joyride. Suddenly her family's goose and gander came through the barn door honking and flapping their wings. They were headed right for me, so I started backing away. The geese became even more excited and started pecking at me fiercely. The further I inched away, the madder they got. Mercifully, my friend yelled over the racket, "You are backing into their nest." If I had only known that a few moments sooner, I could have walked toward them--away from the problem--and my legs would not have been so black and blue.<br><br>I learned an important lesson that day about going in the right direction--and about valuing another's viewpoint. Sometimes we become convinced that our perceptions are correct, that we are doing all that we can do, or that if we simply run faster or longer our problems will be solved. But nothing will get better if we are going the wrong way. I have discovered a valuable exercise. Occasionally I take a good look at my life, my daily habits, my thoughts, and certainly my actions. Then I ask myself: "Am I headed in the right direction? Will my actions<i>today</i>lead to greater peace and happiness tomorrow?" I must be humble enough to realize that I may need to change direction.<br><br>Just a few weeks ago, at general conference, Elder Richard G. Scott taught that repentance is an essential element of the gospel--for all of us. "Repentance is not optional" (Richard G. Scott, "The Path to Peace and Joy,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2000, 25). It is part of walking the paths of righteousness. If ever our performance does not adhere to correct and eternal principles, if the path we are traveling is pulling us away from eternal goals, we must make a course correction.<br><br>So often we hear people complaining about what a wicked world we live in. They say it is simply too hard to be virtuous. "Everyone is doing it," they rationalize. I see all of the temptations you face. I agree, armies of filth do surround us. We do not need to be their victims. We can each decide for ourselves ways to safeguard our virtue--ways to keep us going in the right direction. There is no sin that is worth the price you have to pay for it. Determine right now to put on the whole armor of God and neither retreat into iniquity nor surrender to vice. In our world today, what are you and I going to do to stay clean?<br><br>You think about what you can do, and while you are thinking, I will offer a few suggestions. First, dress modestly and neatly. How we adorn ourselves has so much to do with how we think and feel, and how we make others think and feel in our presence. President Harold B. Lee taught:<br><br><i>Do not underestimate the important symbolic and actual effect of appearance. Persons who are well groomed and modestly dressed invite the companionship of the Spirit of our Father in Heaven and are able to exercise a wholesome influence upon those around them. Persons who are unkempt and careless about their appearance, or adopt the visual symbols of those who often oppose our ideals, expose themselves and persons around them to influences that are degrading and dissonant. Outward appearance is often a reflection of inward tendencies.</i>[<i>Teachings of Harold B. Lee</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1996), 220]<br><br>We can ask ourselves, "Does the way I dress encourage others to think good, righteous thoughts or base, ignoble thoughts?" Consider how we would feel if we were to meet the Savior today. Would He be pleased with how we have chosen to adorn our body? Let us be willing to take a righteous stand and look like it, too!<br><br>For women and men alike, modesty is a building block of virtue. Why? Because our bodies are sacred gifts from God that actually give us power over Satan. Satan never has had nor ever will have a body, and he would like nothing more than to have us underestimate this gift. When we wear clothing that is unseemly or too tight, that exposes or otherwise belittles the sacredness of our bodies, we play with fire. And sometimes the scars of even a small burn mar our souls for a long, long time. Back away from the fire and head in the right direction.<br><br>Can you imagine what could happen in this casual world if<i>all</i>our students made a determination to represent the Lord--and to look like it, too! I wonder if you realize how many world leaders visit this university and look to it as an example.<br><br>Let me suggest another safeguard of virtue that will help you to head in the right direction. Be reverent. Especially during sacrament meetings, remember the purpose for which you are there. Listen to the truths being taught. You will be blessed as you go seeking to find solutions to your problems. The sacrament is a time to examine our lives over the past week, ask for forgiveness, and recommit. It is not a time for back rubs, whisperings about last night's party, or speculations about next week's dance. During the sacrament and throughout the week, let reverence lead to repentance.<br><br>The Savior has made it possible for us to become clean from sin and return to our Father in Heaven. In his conference talk, Elder Scott reflected, "It must pain Him deeply to see the pointless agony both in this life and beyond the veil that accompany the unrepentant sinner after all He did so that we need not suffer" ("The Path," 26). My dear brothers and sisters, if you have not yet felt the cleansing power of the Atonement, do not delay. Do not let yourself get any more bumped or bruised. Yield a broken heart and a contrite spirit. Change directions, if need be. Face the problem and with sincere sorrow and true humility submit to the Lord. He is all-knowing and perfectly loving. He simply could not lead us astray. His promise is sure: "Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently and ye shall find me; ask, and ye shall receive" (D&amp;amp;C 88:63).<br><br>All of which leads to my second suggestion for solving problems. When faced with a problem, humbly ask the question "What am I going to do about it?"<br><br>From His prophets on down, the Lord has empowered His servants to come unto Him, to repent, and to seek for solutions. Not alone, but with God's inspiration and support, prophets have had to solve enormous problems. Think of Nephi with his broken bow. Think of the brother of Jared with his dark boats. Think of Moroni in the heat of battle. Any and every leader has had to "study it out" (D&amp;amp;C 9:8), humbly present a solution to the Lord, and then faithfully act upon it as guided by the Spirit. The Lord perfectly sustains, but He does not solve problems for us. Surely He could have given Nephi a new bow. He could have just commanded the brother of Jared to bring Him some rocks. He could have won all of Moroni's battles for him. But higher laws were at stake. Learning and growing had to take place.<br><br>This process is vital to our spiritual growth and cannot take place as long as we look to other people, circumstances, programs, or institutions to solve problems for us. President Brigham Young taught: "Instead of searching after what the Lord is going to do for us, let us inquire what we can do for ourselves" (<i>JD</i>9:172). Then we can take it to the Lord for confirmation.<br><br>Let me illustrate with a story that a friend and faculty member at this university shared with me. Several years ago a student came to his office. She was distraught. Tears ran down her face as she outlined her situation. She had not done as well as she thought she would in some of her classes, and if she did not get a high enough grade in his class, she would be deported to her country of origin. She felt as if her whole future rested upon his decision.<br><br>With that preface, she pleaded, "What are you going to give me?"<br><br>The professor was warm and compassionate, but forthright. "What have you earned?" he responded.<br><br>Together they went through the ledger. They tallied her points, even added in some extra credit she had not yet completed, and determined that her scores were far, far below the university's standard. The professor felt that it would not be fair to other students who had studied, sacrificed, and rightfully earned their grades to raise her mark as high as it would need to go. He counseled with her. They agonized over the situation together. In the end, the professor was sincere and kind, but fair. He could not give her what she had not earned but desperately wanted.<br><br>Needless to say, she was quite upset. She had to leave BYU. Upon returning home, she enrolled in a community college. She studied and worked hard. Over the course of time she became committed to academic achievement. She began to recognize the Lord's hand in her life. She served a mission. Two and a half years later, she returned to BYU a different person. Ready to shoulder the responsibility of her own actions, she had become a conscientious student and a better person. A little more humble and a lot more mature, she looked up her former professor and thanked him for being firm. With love and respect he had invited her to do some soul-searching, and maybe for the first time in her life when confronted with a problem, she had really asked herself the question "What am I going to do about this?" And that made all the difference.<br><br>My dear friends, I invite you to do the same about whatever may be troubling you at this time. Be prayerful. Be responsible when facing a dilemma. Ask yourself, "What am I going to do about this?" You could have the same kind of dialogue with the Lord that the student had with her teacher.<br><br>I realize that many of your challenges may not be of your own making. You may have inherent disadvantages; you may have been treated badly; you may have been wronged. You may have someone who caused you to get the "boot." But no matter what your problem, you can take charge of your life and go forward with faith. You may not be able to change other people--most likely you will not. You may not be able to change everything about your circumstances, but the power is in you to determine how you will respond and what kind of a person you will be.<br><br>Some young men in one of the dorms shared how they worked together to solve a problem. They had been having some friction in their group. Although no one had been blatantly unkind, a competitive feeling was pushing these friends apart and making them dwell on their inadequacies. So one night the young men decided to take some positive steps. They determined to have family prayer in their apartment each morning and read a few verses in the scriptures together. They set goals to sincerely encourage and support each other. Simple though this remedy may sound, it made all the difference. One kind word led to another. One thoughtful act invited another in return. It did not take long before the situation had turned around and their apartment became a warm and inviting place again. These young men were willing to ask, "What am I going to do about this?" And the Lord blessed them with a solution to their problem.<br><br>Even as I encourage such self-reliance, I want to make something clear. True self-reliance implies a humble dependence upon deity. In last month's general Relief Society meeting, President Gordon B. Hinckley reminded us:<br><br><i>None of us is wise enough to make it on our own. We need the help, the wisdom, the guidance of the Almighty in reaching those decisions that are so tremendously important in our lives. There is no substitute for prayer. There is no greater resource.</i>["Your Greatest Challenge, Mother,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2000, 99]<br><br>So be prayerful as you evaluate yourself and your circumstances. Humble and sincere consideration of the question "What am I going to do about it?" could be an incredible turning point for you. When we sincerely and submissively search our hearts, we come to know what the Lord would have us do about the challenges we face.<br><br>My third point is know that the organizations of the Church can help prepare and strengthen us in our problem solving. We have been told that the Church will never be larger than our ward boundaries. Each of us has an opportunity to be an instrument in the Lord's hands in making our ward strong and filled with so much love, devotion, and acceptance that everyone feels a part of our ward.<br><br>The organizations of the Church are set up to teach us how to come to Christ. The priesthood is given to all worthy men, and Relief Society is the Lord's organization for women. It does not matter what position we hold, we can emanate love and support for our leaders. We need the older sisters and their experience, we need the younger sisters with their zest for life, we need those who have suffered through divorce and health problems, and we need those who have not yet married but are very capable and willing to serve. We need each other. We need visiting teachers and home teachers who are sincerely interested in those they visit and realize the importance of their calling as they strive to reach the one.<br><br>When we attend our meetings for priesthood and Relief Society, we are there to assist the teacher or leader. We attend to find out who needs our help and what we can do to further the work of the Lord.<br><br>As you are looking for a lifelong companion, choose someone who will be willing to support you in your Church callings. It is through these callings that we become better people. Each of us should look forward to the blessings that come from Church assignments given to our spouse as well as to ourself. As couples work together, leadership skills are developed.<br><br>My fourth point is be an influence for good on others. At school, church, and with friends and family, extend a loving hand of service. It is not enough for us to simply attend our meetings and fulfill Church callings. It is not enough to just "get by." Of all people, we should approach this mortality as a great and grand adventure and fill it with all the wonder, love, and meaning that we anticipated before we came here.<br><br>Imagine a situation in which your great dream in life was to travel to a foreign country, but when you arrived, all you did was sit listlessly in your hotel room--filled with worry, fear, desperation, and sadness about the opportunities awaiting you. Similarly, we are all here in this most marvelous and wonderful of worlds, living this magnificent adventure called mortality. Can we afford to spend our lives brooding, being bored, or being bothered?<br><br>Blessed with the eternal perspective the gospel gives, we will rise to the full measure of our abilities to bless and serve those around us and thereby experience a full measure of joy. We are in this together. When we return to the loving arms of our Heavenly Father, how many of our brothers and sisters and loved ones will we bring with us?<br><br>The spirit of service of which I speak as a means of overcoming our own problems has been ignited in the Relief Society organization. Relief Societies all over the world have reached out to their communities and are serving in the name of the Relief Society organization of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Priesthood leaders have witnessed firsthand the joy and testimony that develop from service and have made service projects both family and ward activities. Less-active members have returned to full activity, and new members have been brought into the fold through service.<br><br>President Hinckley has urged us to help increase the number of converts. We now have more than 11 million members of the Church. What are we doing to retain and strengthen each member? What can we do to share the gospel with others? The Lord needs each of us to reach out and touch the hearts of those around us. No one is exempt. President Hinckley does it, and so can we!<br><br>Not long ago I started praying for a missionary experience. Along with everything I have to pray for, I have added that sentence to every prayer, and<i>I promise you</i>our Father in Heaven answers this prayer--sometimes so quickly you are in awe. Try it! It will strengthen you and help you to realize you are on His errand and angels are there to assist you. Missionary work is revitalizing and energizing. Involvement in it helps us overlook our own concerns.<br><br>Recently a devoted wife and mother of nine children had a faith-promoting experience. Now, if she has time to be a missionary, we all do! A few years ago, this sister and her family hosted three young boys with the Phoenix Boys Choir during their stay in Salt Lake City. She gave each of them a Book of Mormon with her testimony and her family picture. John, one of the choir boys, for whatever reason, left his copy of the Book of Mormon on the bus when he returned home.<br><br>A businessman who happened to be named John found the book. For quite some time the book shifted around to several locations in his office. One day John opened the book and noticed someone had written a note inside the front of it. The note began, "Dear John." Since his name is John, he read the note.<br><br>In the meantime, Laurie, a co-worker, and a less-active member of the Church, developed a strong friendship with John. They started dating.<br><br>Laurie and John had some very meaningful talks about religion. Faced with some heartfelt questions, John turned to that persistent copy of the Book of Mormon and read some passages. He started going to church with Laurie.<br><br>You know the rest of the story. After they had been married about nine months, the sister missionaries knocked on their door, and John started taking the discussions. John was baptized and confirmed a member of the Church. John looked up the family whose picture was in his Book of Mormon.<br><br>Just before Christmas John called and explained how instrumental this sister and her family had been in his conversion. Needless to say, this faithful family was so excited to hear from John. They invited him to their home and continued to love and fellowship him. Just last month they accompanied John and his wife, Laurie, as they were sealed in the Salt Lake Temple.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, we have the truth, and someday we will have many regrets if we do not share what we have. Let us reach inside ourselves and give our best away. Whenever we truly give of ourselves, we forget about our own problems and garner newfound strength.<br><br>Right now you may be facing a lot more than a parking "boot." You may be backed into a corner and feel there is no way out, but I promise you that if you will use these steps, you will find solutions to your challenges.<br><br>As you leave here today, would you think of the four bits of counsel I have given you regarding problem solving?<br><br>1. Stop and consider where you are headed.<br><br>2. Ask the question "What am I going to do about it?"<br><br>3. Know that the organizations of the Church can help prepare and strengthen us in our problem solving.<br><br>4. Be an influence for good on others.<br><br>Our Father in Heaven knows our potential, and if we will make Him a part of our daily lives, if we humbly and sincerely strive to do His will, we will be blessed with solutions. Nevertheless, even in all our efforts to solve problems correctly, even then we may have moments of wondering if God is mindful of us. In D&amp;amp;C 6:20 it says, "Therefore treasure up these words in thy heart. Be faithful and diligent in keeping the commandments of God, and I will encircle thee in the arms of my love."<br><br>Brothers and sisters, in the most personal way, let me assure you that He is mindful of you. He knows you. He loves you. He wants you to succeed. Our Savior made problem solving possible. No problem is so big or so small that He cannot or will not help us solve it. So to all who seek for solutions, I lovingly invite: Seek Him. Come unto Him.<br><br>He will be there for us. He will guide us in our search for solutions to the challenges we meet every day of our lives. This is my testimony to you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Mary Ellen Smoot was the general Relief Society president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 14 November 2000.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>of the Lord Is Your Strength - Truman G. Madsen - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, the chorale has given my message in music and President Bateman has given my message in prose. So let's go back to class.<br><br>Ann and I are grateful to be in your midst in the Thanksgiving season. I have a cheerful message, and smiles will be permitted and even encouraged.<br><br>"I'm writing a book on joy," said a rabbi to a colleague of mine in New York. That book found that one root of the word<i>joy</i>in the Old Testament is<i>chemdah.</i>When it is conjoined with the phrase "of the Lord," it means three things. It means gladness; it means togetherness or being joined one with another; and it means something about the temple. Nehemiah was the rebuilder of the temple. The phrase "joy of the Lord" attends his invitation to the newly rebuilt temple.<br><br>Now our sacred texts place joy in the same mode, and our history writes it in flesh and blood.<br><br>Brigham Young, whose institution this is, said about the terrible persecutions and drivings of our people:<br><br><i>You that have not passed through the trials, and persecutions . . . , but have only read of them . . . may think how awful they were to endure, and wonder that the Saints survived them at all. The thought of it makes your hearts sink within you . . . , and you are ready to exclaim, "I could not have endured it." I have been in the heat of it, and I never felt better in all my life; I never felt the peace and power of the Almighty more copiously poured upon me than in the keenest part of our trials. They appeared nothing to me.</i>[<i>JD</i>1:313]<br><br>Brigham Young has a witness, Heber C. Kimball, who said:<br><br><i>Often when I have been in the presence of brother Brigham, we would feel such a buoyant spirit that when we began to talk we could not express our feelings, and so, "Hallelujah," says Brigham, "Glory to God," says I. I feel it and say it.</i>[<i>JD</i>4:222]<br><br>A second witness is Eliza R. Snow, who said, "None but saints can be happy under every circumstance" (in Edward W. Tullidge,<i>The Women of Mormondom</i>[Salt Lake City: s.n., 1975], 146).<br><br>My great-grandfather Jedediah M. Grant once said that even when he was at the grave site of his baby girl buried on the plains, he felt near unto heaven. He said:<br><br><i>It has given me much of trouble, and a great amount of perseverance, to be happy under all circumstances. I have learned not to fret myself. It has taken me a great while to arrive at this point. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . I thank the Lord for the bitter as well as for the sweet. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . I want the Saints to live in a way that they can feel happy all the time, and then we shall enjoy the Holy Spirit.</i>[<i>JD</i>3:11–12]<br><br>We all know that the Spirit brings joy. The revelation to me is that joy brings the Spirit. When we are happy, the Spirit flows more freely--otherwise, it does not.<br><br>Looking back, our Church presidents and also their wives have said together in different ways that because of the gospel and the joy of the Lord, the sufferings of the wicked are far more than the sufferings of the righteous. And the Plains epic is their metaphor for our lives.<br><br>Remember, adventurers and fortune seekers left civilization, and left acting civilized, to race west to the mines--every man for himself. The Saints became a community on wheels. They were linked by a common cause. They went in the name of the Lord. The desperadoes and the explorers went with the obsession to be first and to strike it rich and to jump claims--even to gun down their opponents. The Mormon Battalion left the goldfields without gold to return to their wives and families and to create a new culture and a new civilization in the vision of Zion. The Saints sometimes died in each other's arms with a prayer. That cannot be said of some of those in the Donner party. The Saints had covenanted to pool their resources so that every person--able-bodied or not--could make this rite of passage. Their temple was burned behind them; their anticipated temple was 1,000 miles and 40 years away. But the beginning and end of their journey was Christ.<br><br>Now, what of today? Perhaps we can credit the computer for our increasing impatience. This generation is intent on what they want and how they want it and when. Don't wait for next week. Forget others. Forget nonsense about rules. Play the game your way. Cut corners. Make your own rules. We may be in the midst of the most impatient generation in history. But the truth is that all supernal joys take time and discipline and discipleship.<br><br>We are taught that the opposite of humility is arrogance, and our prophet has recently alerted us against that. I suggest that the opposite of meekness is demandingness. "I demand mine." Some of us are apparently willing to do anything wrong in order to get our rights. But the teaching of Jesus turns that upside down. The meek will inherit the earth precisely because they understand the kind of caring that leads to sharing. And they demand, like the Christ, nothing. They pray as He prayed for deliverance and relief. But their blessings flow unto them without compulsory means because they submit to a higher and wiser will.<br><br>In the academy just now, one of the purr words is<i>postmodernism.</i>The superficialized thesis is that anything goes, that no one can say what is true or false or what is good or bad. But this stance is not really post- and it is not modern. It was old when Socrates was young. I submit that it is sometimes willful ignorance of human history--that a self-centered life is just as good as any other life. That is the attitude, I suggest, of sick souls. When it enters our presence, it becomes the 14th article of faith, which negates the other 13: "We believe in narcissism." Modern scripture has a definition of this. It is called "seeking to be a law unto yourself." For such there is a guaranteed result.<br><br>It was Dostoyevsky's character Ivan Karamazov who believed that if God is dead, then everything is allowed. Well, both the premise and the conclusion are misleading. Neither God nor law tell you what you must do. That is a fiction. They tell you what the inevitable consequences will be of what you do do. So here is an absolute that is not obsolete. It is more reliable than the second law of thermodynamics. Put negatively, if you seek your own immediate gratification and ignore, neglect, or, worse, exploit others, you will not find joy. You will find a chimera. And if you persist, you will find misery. You cannot find joy that way any more than you can jump off your own shadow.<br><br>As a little boy I used to try to see the refrigerator door turn the light off. Did you ever try that? I hurt my nose badly. You can't see the light turn off because the door is closed before the light goes off. Let us put it positively, as Jesus did: "If you lose yourself for my sake and the gospel's, you will rejoice and be exceeding glad. You will experience the joy of the Lord."<br><br>For it is not chance but choice that is involved here. Each of us has some control over finding joy. To paraphrase Elder Marion D. Hanks: "No matter how we live, there will be pain in this world. But misery is optional." Think about it. Christ is against selfishness and sin--not because He is the giant spoilsport, but the other way around. He is against sin and selfishness because He is against despondency and melancholy and morbidity. He is against the shrinking of our capacity for fulfillment. On this He is the world's leading expert. He knows. As the book of Hebrews has it, "For the joy that was set before him [He] endured the cross" (Hebrews 12:2). Whose joy did He envision? Ours. He saw beyond our sins and stupidities and our clumsy mistakes. He knows what we have within us to become. And having paid the awful price in blood, He is entitled to alert us to reality.<br><br>This changes the kinds of questions we ask of life. Instead of "What's in it for me?" we ask, "What's in it for those I love or should love?" Instead of "Why am I having such a hard time?" we ask, "Am I growing through my hard times? Can I see any meaning or purpose for the good of the kingdom in my struggle?" Instead of "How soon can I get what I want?" we ask, "Can I train my desires to be a better friend of Christ?" All these questions become prayers: "And however long it takes, dear Lord, stay with me."<br><br>For the Latter-day Saints the plight is better--or worse. We were not only born with the Light of Christ, but we have also been exposed to an environment of light. We have been exposed to the roots and the fruits of the tree of life. In our hearts we all know the difference between His way and all other ways. One result is expressed in Heber C. Kimball's ungrammatical sentence after the Saints had made covenants in the Nauvoo Temple. He said, "You can't sin so cheap no more" (1844 journal, LDS Church Historical Library, Salt Lake City).<br><br>Whatever diminishes our relish for spiritual things, whatever we cannot consistently invite the Spirit to attend, is not for us. Sin and selfishness are furtive, they are half-hearted, and they are self-dividing. But Christ's way is whole-hearted, and the wholeness becomes holiness. Sin cannot sing. The music of sin is a dirge. It is a wilderness crying in a voice. But Christ's way is song--a new song, a lifting song. Sin loves darkness and covers up. It is darkening. But Christ's way is light. And light cleaves to light. Sin and the defiant defense of sin is ugly. Christ's way is beautiful. And everlastingly so. There is no joy in iniquity and, contrary to the world, there is no joy in inequity. We are promised that one day, should we be faithful, we will be equal in heavenly things and even ultimately in earthly things.<br><br>Now let me name three dimensions of joy--all of which, I think, require the Spirit and revelatory awareness.<br><h2><b>1. The Joys of Mission</b></h2><br>These are what I call right-track feelings: the sense that no matter where we are or what we are doing, we are on the Lord's errand--that we are serving Him even in trifles. The conviction is that where you are is the best place for you to be as long as you need to be there. This applies even to sickbeds and dentists' chairs. It even applies to prisons. Such a sermon was delivered in the state penitentiary. Afterward, a young man forgot himself and prayed, "Bless all those who aren't here this time that they may be here next time." That is going a little too far.<br><br>In the Church, our purr word is<i>active,</i>and it is of course crucial. But even if we are partially disabled--and we are, most of us, in various ways--even then, if the heart is continually filled with righteous desires, they themselves are transforming. The activity Christ most cares about is within us amidst the bustle. In short, wherever we are can be a pleasant place if Christ approves us there and attends us there.<br><br>It is said that a man in Jerusalem was given a job of going daily to a flat roof and looking toward the east to anticipate the Messiah. Asked about it, he said, "Well, the pay isn't much, but the work is steady." We all have that steady job. It was assigned us by the Master--assigned the Saints when they were driven out in midwinter in Missouri. The counsel was, "Seek the face of the Lord always, that in patience ye may possess your souls" (D&amp;amp;C 101:38). Again, at Winter Quarters, history repeated itself. The Lord said, "If thou art sorrowful, call on the Lord thy God with supplication, that your souls may be joyful" (D&amp;amp;C 136:29). When He said, "In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world" (John 16:33), His disciples had almost nothing to cheer about except their relationship with Him and the transcending anticipation of His return.<br><h2><b>2. The Joys of the Senses</b></h2><br>H. L. Mencken scored religious people as those who live in mortal dread "that someone, somewhere, may be happy" (in "Sententiae,"<i>A Mencken Chrestomathy</i>[New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1949], 624). It is a sharp indictment. It is also one of the superstitions of the irreligious, I suggest, that religious people cannot have fun. We work at it in this church. Well, our religion is not Mencken's religion. It is the religion of the glad tidings of the Master. Notice His promised rewards for keeping the Sabbath. He only imposed one condition. He said we should keep the Sabbath "with a glad heart and a cheerful countenance" (D&amp;amp;C 59:15). And then He promised<br><br><i>the good things of the earth, and it shall bring forth in its strength. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . To please the eye and to gladden the heart;</i><br><br><i>. . . For food and for raiment, for taste and for smell, to strengthen the body and to enliven the soul.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 59:3, 18–19]<br><br>He calls this "the fulness of the earth" (D&amp;amp;C 59:16). He even defines fasting and prayer--fasting ordinarily conjoined with mourning--with rejoicing and prayer (vs. 14).<br><br>Further, the Master did not say we would only be happy when we transcend the earth. He said, instead, that this very earth transformed will become heaven. He said that even here we may begin to enjoy that which shall be in full hereafter. At this level, joy and pleasure are not opposed--they are combined.<br><br>When Jesus said through John in his epistle, "Love not the world," He meant, "Love not the wickedness of the world" (JST 1 John 2:15).<br><br>And when He said to keep "unspotted from the world" (D&amp;amp;C 59:9), it was actually to keep "unspotted from the vices of the world" (JST James 1:27).<br><br>He did not say the body is intrinsically evil. Yes, this body can be easily perverted and abused, but He taught that this body is a temple that is a house of light and glory. It can be a Stradivarius violin on which, if we permit Him, He can, as Master Musician, play. I was struck this morning again by a line reflecting Joseph Smith: "Man of himself is an instrument of music" (Joseph Young, "Vocal Music,"<i>History of the Organization of the Seventies</i>[Salt Lake City: Joseph E. Massey Restoration Publisher, 1970], 14). Through his modern prophet the Lord has promised that the Spirit will not only illumine our minds but heighten all our senses--sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch. What else is a glorious resurrection?<br><br>Now the devil's game is to convince you that he is the king of enjoyment. He advertises shortcuts to ecstasy. "Buy into my game," he says, "and the rewards are all here in glittering neon." But, as usual, he lies. He lies big time. In wrath over his own permanent unembodiment, he either taunts us that the body is nothing--and we seek then a kind of negative spirituality--or he tells us the opposite. The body is everything. And you know where that leads. In abject misery of his own making, he seeks to make all men miserable like himself. He is a double-crosser. He keeps no promises. He not only doesn't deliver, he enslaves. He is the saddest of sadists in the universe.<br><br>The Savior, in contrast, will never, ever tamper with your freedom, except if you cooperate with Him to increase it. I count 75 times in the Doctrine and Covenants where He pleads with us to "ask, seek." But He will not force. He has everything to give that the devil claims to have, and He has never broken a promise yet.<br><h2><b>3. The Joys of Contemplation and Anticipation</b></h2><br>Jesus said in modern revelation, "If thou shalt ask, thou shalt receive revelation upon revelation, knowledge upon knowledge" (D&amp;amp;C 42:61). Is there joy in learning, however difficult? Yes. All learning can be fulfilling and helpful: skills, talents, problem solving, earning a living. But below that is an undergirding quest. Listen to what He most wants us to learn. The Lord finished His sentence with "that thou mayest know the mysteries and peaceable things--that which bringeth joy, that which bringeth life eternal" (D&amp;amp;C 42:61). Peaceable things? That which bringeth joy? The context of this is the temple. Temples are where all levels of joy combine, where togetherness with Him and with others is hallowed and sealed into families. The temple is a magnifying glass of such learning and of such lasting love. There you see your mission in life in the framework of eternity. There mind and spirit and senses are reawakened to the grandeur of the earth and of its joys. The temple is our most direct access to His mighty intelligence. And I trust the line that He is "more intelligent than they all" (Abraham 3:19). This is the glory of God. This is light and truth.<br><br>In the house of the Lord, it is as if we are in the Panama Canal. The Spirit comes up, as it were, under us and lifts us, and when we leave, we leave on a different ocean. But at the same time we are there, the vessel itself is healed and repaired and recommissioned and floats away prepared for the batterings and the confusions of daily life. The Prophet said, speaking of these heavenly, peace-giving truths:<br><br><i>I can taste the principles of eternal life, and so can you. . . . You say honey is sweet, and so do I. I can also taste the spirit of eternal life. I know that it is good; and when I tell you of these things which were given me by inspiration of the Holy Spirit, you are bound to receive them as sweet, and rejoice more and more.</i>[<i>HC</i>6:312]<br><br>In the original Joseph Smith said, "<i>I</i>rejoice more and more." Which did he mean? I, or you? He meant both, because in that process, we have been told, "both are edified and rejoice together" (D&amp;amp;C 50:22). The temple and those within it are a perpetual prayer for the fulness of the Holy Ghost. And that means ultimately the fulness of joy (see D&amp;amp;C 109:15, 79–80).<br><br>But is there such a thing as the fulness of joy? Well, there is a portrait of how these dimensions came together once in this world. Near a temple in a land called Bountiful, Jesus, who had been rejected and crucified and abandoned, now found Himself in the midst of a multitude of men, women, and children who had survived a three-hour earthquake. (By the way, this is one of the most authentic notes in the Book of Mormon. It says "three hours." But then there is another phrase: "and it was said by some that the time was greater" [3 Nephi 8:19]. I've been in a 20-second earthquake, and I was already in serious trouble.)<br><br>As we are told in 3 Nephi 17, the people of Bountiful not only listened but received Him for whom He is. He could not do many mighty works at home, but in His new home He healed the crippled and the wounded and perhaps those who had other kinds of afflictions. All of them fell to their knees and in prayer poured out gratitude. The Book of Mormon says the Spirit taught them what they should pray. They had been commanded, as we have, to pray to the Father in the name of Christ. But now they prayed to Him, calling Him their Lord and their God.<br><br>And the Lord said, almost apologetically, in His prayer, "Father, . . . they pray unto me because I am with them" (3 Nephi 19:22). In how many ways with them! He prayed that they would be one with Him, as He is with the Father. And now they were.<br><br>Does the story end there? Not yet. He had called for their little children. Textbooks say that children have some innate fears, among them the fear of falling, the fear of loud noises, the identification with the terror and screams of others. Don't you think little children after a three-hour earthquake would be clinging to their parents, bewildered, and shyly recoiling from strangers?<br><br>But He was no stranger. All of the children were brought forward and were completely comfortable in His presence. He then said, "Blessed are ye because of your faith. And now behold, my joy is full" (3 Nephi 17:20). This is the only place in scripture that I know of where He spoke of His own fulness of joy. When He had said these words, He wept. And with exquisite tenderness He scooped the little children up one by one and blessed them as the parents and grown-up children beheld.<br><br>Shortly after a sacramental feast, Christ turned from His own prayers to see them all--men, women, and children--kneeling, whitened and lightened and transformed. In the record we are told that what they saw and felt defied words. But they tried. They said, "No one can conceive of the joy which filled our souls at the time we heard him pray for us unto the Father" (3 Nephi 17:17). He bade them arise, but they did not because they were overcome. The power of that experience lasted in the memories of their children and their children's children for 200 years.<br><br>The resurrected Jesus Christ was the fulfillment in their presence of His own prophecy to us. "Spirit and element, inseparably connected, receive a fulness of joy" (D&amp;amp;C 93:33). The joy of the Lord became their strength, as it can become ours.<br><br>My Quaker great-grandmother was named Rachel. Joseph Smith taught her. She had to reverse her notions from the past that there was little or no room for singing or dancing or playfulness or humor or for turning fasting into feasting. But on the theme of cultivating the inner light, she found in the fulness of the gospel confirmation of her earlier faith. Widowed nine days after the birth of her only son, she toiled her way through nagging poverty. She forced the bishop to take her tithing when there were six pans on the floor catching the leaks from the roof. And, brothers and sisters, in this day of growth in the Church, just count Chile and the Philippines only and you have a million Latter-day Saints who are living pretty much with a tin roof and a dirt floor and the 23rd Psalm on the wall.<br><br>Rachel served for 35 years as a Relief Society president. Even while hurting, she helped those who hurt more. During those years she was completely deaf and therefore more sensitive to the Light or its absence in those around her. She could not believe the promise made her by a patriarch that as Rachel of old she would have a worthy posterity. She had only one son. Her own portraits and the fading photographs are a study of clear eyes and serenity--she had the face of a saint. Last night we attended the 100th family reunion of her posterity. There are 700, and they are all of them in the world and of the world of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, this Light of the Spirit cannot be faked. All of the theater lights and stages and camera trickery and Photoshop manipulation may convince the unaware that artificial light has the same effect. It does not. Artificial light ends with the flipping of a switch. It is merely a backhanded tribute to Light. Christ is the Life and the Light--the Light that lightens hearts through thick and thin.<br><br>So I sum this up with two quotations again from Brother Brigham:<br><br><i>There is not a man or woman on this earth, whose peace is made with God, and who are associated with holy beings, and seeking after holy principles, but their countenances are lit up with a lamp of divine cheerfulness.</i>[Sermon by Brigham Young, 1 October 1854, Historians Office Report of Speeches, LDS Church Archives, Salt Lake City]<br><br>And again, elsewhere:<br><br><i>I say, if you want to enjoy exquisitely, become a Latter-day Saint, and then live the doctrine of Jesus Christ. The man or woman who will do this will enjoy and endure most; and if they will be humble and faithful they will enjoy the glory and the excellency of the power of God, and be prepared to live with Gods and with angels.</i>[<i>JD</i>18:247]<br><br>We are approaching the season to be jolly. But it can be more--it can be the season to be joyful. Let us come and adore Him. Let us sing the "songs of everlasting joy" (D&amp;amp;C 109:39, 133:33).<br><br>My testimony is this: I have been around a while, and I have read and spent at least half of my life looking at alternative religions and outlooks. And I suppose also I am a bit of an expert on the alternative death styles that are out there. One of the strongest arguments ever imposed upon me against this religion is that it is too good to be true. My testimony to you is, it is good and true and beautiful. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Truman G.
