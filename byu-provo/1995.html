<h1>More Excellent Hope&quot; - Russell M. Nelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Sister Nelson and I extend greetings for a happy New Year to all of you. At this fireside for college-age youth, thousands are with us on the campus of Brigham Young University. Elsewhere, many are participating via satellite transmission, including congregations assembled in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and other locations in the Caribbean area. Having recently visited Saints in those islands, we are grateful to greet you once again. In Santo Domingo, we stood on the site where a new temple will be built. There we envisioned the day when you may enter that holy house and receive all the blessings that are not as accessible at the present time.<br><br>This morning became historic when President Howard W. Hunter, President Gordon B. Hinckley, and President Thomas S. Monson officially dedicated the new Bountiful Temple. They also convey their greetings to you. The Brethren love and honor the youth of the Church and thank you for your devotion to the Lord Jesus Christ. This is his church, and he welcomes each of us with open arms.<br><br>We thank members of the institute choir from Ephraim, Utah, for their music. The words to their hymn seem particularly appropriate for our first fireside of 1995.<br><br><i>Come, let us anew our journey pursue,</i><br><i>Roll round with the year,</i><br><i>And never stand still till the Master appear.</i><br><i>His adorable will let us gladly fulfill,</i><br><i>And our talents improve</i><br><i>By the patience of hope and the labor of love.</i><br>[Charles Wesley,<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 217]<br><br>As we begin a new year, we desire to improve our talents--by the patience of hope and the labor of love. We all have hope. We hope for academic attainment. Some hope to find an eternal companion, perhaps even this year. And some just plain hope to survive. Speaking of companions, I like the counsel given by President David O. McKay. He said that "during courtship we should keep our eyes wide open, but after marriage keep them half shut" ("Five Ideals Contributive to a Happy, Enduring Marriage," devotional address given at Brigham Young University, 11 October 1955, p. 8; see also<i>CR,</i>April 1956, p. 9). Sister Nelson has been kind to follow that advice as she has overlooked my imperfections.<br><br>Some hopes are more important than others. A few are major enough to have merited New Year's resolutions. As the title of my message tonight, I have borrowed a phrase from the Book of Mormon: "A More Excellent Hope." That expression is attributed to Ether, who further declared that "man must<i>hope,</i>or he cannot receive an inheritance in the place which [God] hast prepared" (Ether 12:32; emphasis added).<br><br>That verse of scripture came to mind the other day as I read a letter from a troubled friend who is wrestling with a profound personal problem. I would like to quote excerpts from that letter.<br><br><i>The guilt and failure I feel make it almost impossible for me to repent. I am losing my faith. The sins were first; the doubts followed. The order is important because sin needed doubt. When I doubted my faith, sins lost their meaning and guilt its bite. Doubting began, then, as a means of anesthesia. It served to diminish the guilt that was literally tearing me apart. Before long, however, the doubts thrived independent of the needs that conceived them.</i><br><br><i>My painful indecisiveness, my tentativeness, my lack of direction, my paralysis of volition, my poverty of confidence, have caused suffering and depression. My family, my future, and my faith are at stake. I am losing hope.</i><br><br>Could the author of that letter, as well as others with such inner turmoil, have forgotten a promise of the Lord? He said, "Let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God" (D&amp;amp;C 121:45). Unrighteous thoughts are the termites of character--and of confidence.<br><br>To the author and to each person listening, I bring a message of hope. Regardless of how desperate things may seem, remember, we can always have hope. Always! The Lord's promise to us is certain: "He that endureth in faith and doeth my will, the same shall overcome" (D&amp;amp;C 63:20). I repeat, there is always hope!<br><br>We came to the earth to receive our bodies and to be tested. Do you remember the scripture that states, "We will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them" (Abraham 3:25). Passing tests of obedience requires faith and hope--constantly.<br><br>Hope is part of our religion--mentioned in one of the Articles of Faith. "We follow the admonition of Paul--We believe all things, we<i>hope</i>all things, we have endured many things, and<i>hope</i>to be able to endure all things" (Articles of Faith 1:13; emphasis added).<br><br>A correlation exists between hope and gratitude. To illustrate, let me share a personal experience. Last Thanksgiving, Sister Nelson and I hosted a memorable gathering. All of our locally available daughters, sons, and grandchildren were there, among others. We counted sixty-three people at the feast. As part of our after-dinner program, Sister Nelson distributed a sheet of paper to each individual, headed, "This year, I am thankful for. . ." The remainder of the page was blank. She asked each to complete the thought, either in writing or by drawing a picture. The papers were then collected, redistributed, and read aloud. We were asked to guess who composed each reply, which, incidentally, was not very difficult.<br><br>Meanwhile, I observed a pattern. Generally, the children were thankful for food, clothing, shelter, family (and, occasionally, pets). Their pictures were precious, though not likely to be shown in an art gallery. Our youth broadened their expressions to include gratitude for their country, freedom, and church. The adults noted most of those items, but in addition mentioned the temple, their love of the Lord, and appreciation for his atonement. Their hopes were combined with gratitude. Counting blessings is better than recounting problems.<br><br>Hope emanates from the Lord, and it transcends the bounds of this mortal sphere. Paul noted that "if in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable" (1 Corinthians 15:19). Only with an eternal perspective of God's great plan of happiness can we ever find a more excellent hope. "What is it that ye shall hope for?" asked Moroni. He then answered his own question: "Behold I say unto you that ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ" (Moroni 7:41; see also Alma 27:28). Paul expressed the same thought. He succinctly called the Lord Jesus Christ "our hope" (1 Timothy 1:1). Have you heard the old statement that "hope springs eternal?" It can only be true if that hope springs from him who is eternal.<br><h2><b>Faith, Hope, and Charity</b></h2><br>Have you noticed in the scriptures that hope seldom stands alone? Hope is often linked with faith. Hope and faith are commonly connected to charity. Why? Because hope is essential to faith; faith is essential to hope; faith and hope are essential to charity (see 1 Corinthians 13:13, Alma 7:24, Ether 12:28, D&amp;amp;C 4:5). They support one another like legs on a three-legged stool. All three relate to our Redeemer.<br><br><i>Faith</i>stems from the Lord Jesus Christ.<i>Hope</i>centers in his atonement.<i>Charity</i>is manifest in the "pure love of Christ" (see Moroni 7:47). These three attributes are intertwined like strands in a cable and may not always be precisely distinguished. Together, they become our tether to the celestial kingdom. We read in the Book of Mormon:<br><br><i>There must be faith; and if there must be faith there must also be hope; and if there must be hope there must also be charity.</i><br><br><i>And except ye have charity ye can in nowise be saved in the kingdom of God; neither can ye be saved in the kingdom of God if ye have not faith; neither can ye if ye have no hope.</i>[Moroni 10:20–21; see also Ether 12:9, 34]<br><br>We know that there is an opposition in all things (see 2 Nephi 2:10–11, 15). Not surprisingly, therefore, faith, hope, and charity have their opposing forces. As illustrated in the letter from which I read, the antithesis of faith is doubt (for descriptions, see Hebrews 11:1, Alma 32:21); the opposite of hope is despair. And the counterpart of charity--the pure love of Christ--is disregard or even disdain for him and his commandments.<br><br>Therefore, in our quest for faith, hope, and charity, we must beware of the dangers of doubt, despair, or disdain for the divine. Moroni so taught: "If ye have no hope ye must needs be in despair; and despair cometh because of iniquity" (Moroni 10:22).<br><br>Each of you is special, valued, and needed in building the kingdom of God. The adversary is also aware of your worth and will surely taunt you. When Satan's temptations come your way, please remember this counsel from Alma:<br><br><i>Humble yourselves before the Lord, and call on his holy name, and watch and pray continually, that ye may not be tempted above that which ye can bear. . . .</i><br><br><i>Having faith on the Lord; having a hope that ye shall receive eternal life; having the love of God always in your hearts.</i>[Alma 13:28–29]<br><h2><b>Anchor of Faith and Hope</b></h2><br>A more excellent hope is mightier than a wistful wish. Hope, fortified by faith and charity, forges a force as strong as steel. Hope becomes an anchor to the soul. To this anchor, the faithful can cling, securely tethered to the Lord. Satan, on the other hand, would have us cast away that anchor and drift with the ebb tide of despair. If we will cling to the anchor of hope, it will be our safeguard<i>forever.</i><br><br>A scripture declares:<br><br><i>Wherefore, whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a better world, yea, even a place at the right hand of God, which hope cometh of faith, maketh an anchor to the souls of men, which would make them sure and steadfast.</i>[Ether 12:4; see also v. 9 and Hebrews 6:19]<br><br>The Lord of hope invites all people to come unto him. Steps toward him begin with faith, repentance, and baptism. Moroni explained that<br><br><i>the remission of sins bringeth meekness, and lowliness of heart; and . . . the visitation of the Holy Ghost, which Comforter filleth with hope and perfect love, . . . until the end shall come, when all the saints shall dwell with God.</i>[Moroni 8:26; emphasis added]<br><br>That destiny can only be realized when we "have faith unto repentance" (Alma 34:15).<br><br>Insufficient hope often means insufficient repentance. John pleaded that "every man that hath this hope in [God] purifieth himself, even as he is pure" (1 John 3:3).<br><h2><b>The Fruits of Faith and Hope</b></h2><br>The fruits of faith and hope are beautiful to behold. While in Hawaii recently, I met with a vice premier of the People's Republic of China who had requested a visit to the Polynesian Cultural Center. The vice premier was accompanied by his wife and by the Chinese ambassador to the USA. More than twenty other dignitaries were also in their party. Because Elder Loren C. Dunn and I were already in Hawaii for meetings with Church leaders, we were asked to go to the Center and extend an official welcome to the Chinese delegation on behalf of the First Presidency and General Authorities. As these influential visitors toured the center and the adjoining BYU--Hawaii collegiate campus, they were impressed. The vice premier noted the sisterly and brotherly blending of some sixty different nationalities and thirty different languages. He even noticed that Samoans sang with Fijians, that Tongans danced with Tahitians, and so on. The spirit of unity among the Latter-day Saint youth was easily evident to all of us.<br><br>Finally he asked the question "How do you promote such unity among your young people?" I answered his question later, when I presented a copy of the Book of Mormon to him, describing it as the precious document promoting that unity--and joy.<br><br>Tonight I thought of that unity as we sang words to the opening hymn, "Now Let Us Rejoice." Written by W. W. Phelps in the 1830s, it was sung by early converts to the Church from many nations. Their difficulties adjusting to new neighbors, languages, and cultures must have been great. Yet they found hope in their new life together as brothers and sisters in the Church. Can you picture in your mind those early struggling Saints singing these words, just as we did tonight?<br><br><i>In faith we'll rely on the arm of Jehovah</i><br><i>To guide thru these last days of trouble and gloom,</i><br><i>And after the scourges and harvest are over,</i><br><i>We'll rise with the just when the Savior doth come.</i><br><br><i>Then all that was promised the Saints will be given,</i><br><i>And they will be crown'd with the angels of heav'n,</i><br><i>And earth will appear as the Garden of Eden,</i><br><i>And Christ and his people will ever be one.</i><br>["Now Let Us Rejoice,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 3]<br><br>This text is a remarkable statement of unity in the Lord's work. Regardless of nationality, the Saints have always understood the word of the Lord, who declared: "I say unto you, be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine" (D&amp;amp;C 38:27).<br><br>When stake number two thousand was created in Mexico last month, President Howard W. Hunter said that the "great purposes of the Lord could not have been achieved with dissension or jealousy or selfishness. [The Lord] will bless each of us as we cast off pride, pray for strength, and contribute to the good of the whole" (address delivered at the creation of the Mexico Mexico City Contreras Stake, 11 December 1994).<br><br>In stark contrast to that divine objective, the real world in which we live is divided by diverse languages, culture, and politics. Even the privileges of a democracy carry the burden of bickering in election campaigns. Contention is all about us. Ours is a pessimistic and cynical world--one that, to a great extent, has no hope in Christ nor in God's plan for human happiness. Why such global contention and gloom? The reason is plain. If there is no hope in Christ, there is no recognition of a divine plan for the redemption of mankind. Without that knowledge, people mistakenly believe that existence today is followed by extinction tomorrow--that happiness and family associations are only ephemeral.<br><br>Such fallacies feed contention. The Book of Mormon bears record of these words from the first sermon of the Lord to the people of ancient America. Jesus said:<br><br><i>I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another.</i><br><br><i>Behold, this is not my doctrine, to stir up the hearts of men with anger, one against another; but this is my doctrine, that such things should be done away.</i>[3 Nephi 11:29–30]<br><h2><b>The Importance of Names</b></h2><br>Unfortunately, our modern society is caught up in divisive disputation. Often unkind nicknames are added to--or even substituted for--given names. Labels are invented to foster feelings of segregation and competition. For example, athletic teams acquire names to intimidate others, such as<i>Giants, Tigers, Warriors,</i>and so on. Harmless you say? Well, perhaps not overly important. But that is only the beginning. More serious separation results when labels are utilized with the intent to demean, such as<i>Jew, Gentile, black, Hispanic,</i>or<i>Mormon.</i><br><br>Even worse, such terms camouflage our true identity as sons and daughters of God. The desire of my heart is that we might rise above such worldly trends. God wants us to ascend to the highest level of our potential. He employs names that unify and sanctify.<br><br>He gave a new name to Abraham's grandson, Jacob, saying, "Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men" (Genesis 32:28). In Hebrew, the term<i>Yisra'el</i>means "God prevails." Jacob was given a name to match his divine destiny.<br><br>When we embrace the gospel and are baptized, we are born again. We take upon ourselves the sacred name of Jesus Christ (see D&amp;amp;C 20:37). We are adopted as his sons and daughters and are known as brothers and sisters. We become members of his family; he is the father of our new life.<br><br>When we receive patriarchal blessings, we each receive a declaration of lineage--a name that links us to our heritage. We understand how we become joint heirs to promises once given by the Lord directly to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (see Galatians 3:29, D&amp;amp;C 86:8–11).<br><br>In a prophecy regarding us, Peter utilized uplifting terms. He declared that we "are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a<i>peculiar</i>people" (l Peter 2:9; emphasis added). We recognize the adjectives<i>chosen, royal,</i>and<i>holy</i>as complimentary. But what about the term<i>peculiar?</i>Moses also employed the term when he said,<br><br><i>Thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God, and the Lord hath chosen thee to be a</i>peculiar<i>people unto himself, above all the nations that are upon the earth.</i>[Deuteronomy 14:2; emphasis added]<br><br>I looked up the term<i>peculiar</i>in a modern dictionary. It is currently defined as "unusual" or "eccentric," "strange," "odd ," "standing<br><br>apart from others," "exclusive," or "unique" (<i>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language</i>[New York: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1980]). But the term<i>peculiar</i>as used in the scriptures means something quite different. In the Old Testament, the Hebrew term from which<i>peculiar</i>was translated is<i>cgullah,</i>which means "valued property," or "treasure."<br><br>In the New Testament, the Greek term from which<i>peculiar</i>was translated is<i>peripoiesis,</i>which means "possession," or "an obtaining." (Forms of the Greek suffix<i>poiesis</i>are seen in words currently in use in the English language. For example, doctors and druggists use a book known as a "<em>pharmacopoeia</em>," which refers to possession or obtaining of pharmaceutical agents. The term used for the making of blood in the body is known as <em>hemato</em><i>poiesis.</i>Students of the English language refer to <em>onomatopoeia</em><i>,</i>a word made to sound like its referent, such as<i>buzz, crack,</i>or<i>twang.</i>)<br><br>With that understanding from the Greek, we can see that the scriptural term<i>peculiar</i>does not mean "strange" or "odd" at all. It signifies "valued treasure," "made," or "selected by God."<i>Peculiar</i>is used in only seven verses of the Bible. In the Old Testament it is used five times (Exodus 19:5; Deuteronomy 14:2, 26:18; Psalms 135:4; Ecclesiastes 2:8). In each instance, it has been translated from the Hebrew term that means "valued treasure."<br><br>In the New Testament,<i>peculiar</i>is used two times (Titus 2:14, 1 Peter 2:9). In each instance it has been translated from a Greek term that signifies "possession" or "those selected by God as his own people." Thus, for us to be identified by servants of the Lord as his<i>peculiar</i>people is a compliment of the highest order.<br><br>When we know who we are and what God expects of us, we are filled with hope and made aware of our significant role in his great plan of happiness. The day in which we now live was foreseen even<i>before</i>Christ was born, when a prophet said:<br><br><i>Our father hath not spoken of our seed alone, but also of all the house of Israel, pointing to the covenant which should be fulfilled</i>in the latter days;<i>which covenant the Lord made to our father Abraham, saying: In thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.</i>[1 Nephi 15:18; emphasis added]<br><br>These are those latter days. We are the ones foredetermined and foreordained to fulfill that promise (see Alma 13:3). We are the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. We are, in fact, the hope of Israel. We are God's treasure, reserved for our particular place and time.<br><br>No wonder China's vice premier noted what he did. Our faithful Latter-day Saints are filled with hope and motivated by love of the Lord Jesus Christ. With that hope, we assiduously avoid labels that could be interpreted as derogatory. When the Nephites were truly righteous, their previous patterns of polarization vanished.<br><br><i>There was no contention in the land, because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people. . . .</i><br><br><i>There were no robbers, nor murderers, neither were there Lamanites, nor any manner of -ites; but they were in one, the children of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom of God.</i><br><br><i>And how blessed were they!</i>[4 Nephi 1:15, 17–18]<br><br>Unfortunately, the sequel to that story is not a happy one. This pleasant circumstance persisted until "a small part of the people . . . had revolted. . . and taken upon them the name of Lamanites" (4 Nephi 1:20), reviving old prejudices and teaching their children again to hate, "even as the Lamanites were taught to hate the children of Nephi from the beginning" (4 Nephi 1:39). And so the polarizing process began all over again.<br><br>I hope that we may learn this important lesson and delete such segregating names from our personal vocabularies. Paul taught that "there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus" (Galatians 3:28; see also Colossians 3:11).<br><br>Our Savior invites us "to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; . . . all are alike unto God" (2 Nephi 26:33). Scripture declares that God "made the world and all things therein," "And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth" (Acts 17:24, 26).<br><h2><b>Greek Terms for Love</b></h2><br>The New Testament contains many references to the Lord's commandments that human beings love one another. Those verses become even more meaningful if considered in the New Testament's original Greek language. It is a very rich language, having three different words for<i>love,</i>in contrast to the one available to us in the English language. The three Greek words for love apply at different levels of emotion. The term employed for the highest level of love is<i>agape,</i>to describe the kind of love we feel for the Lord or for other highly esteemed individuals. It is a term of great respect and adoration.<br><br>The second level of love is expressed by the term<i>phileo,</i>to describe affection felt for a beloved associate or friend. It, too, is a term of great respect, but perhaps less formal.<br><br>The third level of love is depicted by the term<i>eros,</i>to describe physical desire and intimacy.<br><br>As I quote a couple of scriptures, see if you can identify the appropriate Greek term. Quoting the Lord: "A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another" (John 13:34). Right! The level of love cited in this verse is that of<i>agape:</i>with highest respect.<br><br>Quoting Paul: "Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love" (Romans 12:10). If you said<i>phileo,</i>the second level, you were correct. The Greek term from which this was translated is<i>philadelphia.</i><br><br>I looked up all references to<i>love</i>in the New Testament, both in English and in Greek. I found that every reference that adjures us to love one another employs only the higher<i>agape</i>or<i>phileo</i>forms. Not a single reference utilized the third level,<i>eros.</i>One exception should be noted: "Beware of the scribes, which<i>love</i>to go in long clothing, and<i>love</i>salutations in the marketplaces" (Mark 12:38; emphasis added). In this instance, the word<i>love</i>was translated from the Greek term<i>thelo,</i>meaning "desire" or "delight."<br><br>This little exercise confirms what we already know, that the Lord wants our love for each other to be most noble, reserving the intimate expression of physical love exclusively for husband and wife (for examples, see Genesis 2:24, Matthew 19:5, Mark 10:7, D&amp;amp;C 42:22, Moses 3:24, Abraham 5:18). I'll translate that conclusion into simple terms. If you are tempted toward sexual behavior that is either errant or aberrant, hang an imaginary sign on the subject that says, "Please do not touch!" And, since deeds are preceded by thoughts, think<i>not</i>of now; think of<i>eternal life!</i><br><h2><b>Selection of a Marriage Partner</b></h2><br>At the beginning of my message, I suggested (with a smile) that some of you might be hoping to find a prospect for marriage, perhaps in the not-too-distant future. May I offer a word of counsel, in addition to the quotation from President McKay about keeping your eyes wide open. The commandment to love our neighbors without discrimination is certain (see Leviticus 19:18; Matthew 19:19, 22:39; Mark 12:31; Luke 10:27; Romans 13:9; Galatians 5:14; James 2:8; D&amp;amp;C 59:6). But it must not be misunderstood. It applies generally. Selection of a marriage partner, on the other hand, involves<i>specific</i>and not<i>general</i>criteria. After all, you can only be married to<i>one</i>individual.<br><br>The probabilities of a successful marriage are known to be much greater if both the husband and wife are united in their religion, language, culture, and ethnic background. Thus, in choosing your eternal companion, please be wise. It's better not to fly in the face of constant head winds. Occasional squalls provide challenge enough.<br><br>Once those marriage vows are taken, you will want to be absolutely faithful to the Lord and to your companion, to whom you have promised complete fidelity. This year, Sister Nelson and I will celebrate our fiftieth wedding anniversary. We realize that the number of additional years together in mortality is steadily diminishing. How grateful we are that we have been faithful to each other in spite of numerous periods of separation imposed by wartime and professional duties. Someone once asked my sweetheart how she managed with ten children as well as a husband with a demanding surgical practice, major responsibilities in the Church, and little time to help. Her reply was unforgettable. "When I married him ," she said, "I didn't expect much, so I was rarely disappointed." I pay tribute to her. All that I hold dear in life has come to me because of my love for her and for the Lord.<br><h2><b>Hope of Eternal Life</b></h2><br>Happiness comes when scriptures are used in shaping our lives. They speak of the "brightness of hope" (2 Nephi 31:20) for which we yearn. But if our hopes were narrowly confined only to moments in mortality, we should surely be disappointed. Our ultimate hope must be anchored to the atonement of the Lord. He said, "If you keep my commandments and endure to the end you shall have eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God" (D&amp;amp;C 14:7). In addition, President Joseph F. Smith said:<br><br><i>The great truth enunciated by the Savior seems very generally to be lost sight of in this generation, that it will profit a man nothing tho' he should gain the whole world if he lose his own soul.</i><br><br><i>The standard of success as declared by the word of God, is the salvation of the soul. The greatest gift of God is eternal life.</i>[<i>Juvenile Instructor</i>39, 15 September 1904, pp. 561–62]<br><br>An understanding of that objective should help us approach the future with faith instead of fear (see D&amp;amp;C 6:36), with a more excellent hope in place of despair. With education, your niche in life will be assured. Interests in your family, the Church, and your vocation can be properly balanced. God sent each of us here to be happy and successful (see 2 Nephi 2:25, Jacob 2:18–19).<br><br>Meanwhile, he also needs us. We are to "seek not the things of this world but seek . . . first to build up the kingdom of God, and to establish his righteousness" (JST Matthew 6:38). He decreed that "no one can assist in this work except he shall be humble and full of love, having faith, hope, and charity, being temperate in all things" (D&amp;amp;C 12:8).<br><br>Such an individual is President Howard W. Hunter. About two years ago he stood at this pulpit where I now stand. Suddenly he was accosted by an assailant brandishing a briefcase said to contain a bomb. President Hunter exhibited great courage. He didn't give an inch. After the threat was over and peace was restored to the scene, President Hunter delivered his message. It was entitled "An Anchor to the Souls of Men"--a theme similar to mine tonight. I would like to quote from his message because it is especially relevant. President Hunter said:<br><br><i>It is incumbent upon us to rejoice a little more and despair a little less, to give thanks for what we have and for the magnitude of God's blessings to us. . . .</i><br><br><i>For Latter-day Saints this is a time of great hope and excitement--one of the greatest eras . . . of all dispensations. We need to have faith and hope, two of the greatest fundamental virtues of any discipleship of Christ</i>.<i>We must continue to exercise confidence in God. . . . He will bless us as a people. . . . He will bless us as individuals. . . .</i><br><br><i>I promise you tonight in the name of the Lord whose servant I am that God will always protect and care for his people. . . . With the gospel of Jesus Christ you have every hope and promise and reassurance. The Lord has power over his Saints and will always prepare places of peace, defense, and safety for his people. When we have faith in God we can hope for a better world--for us personally and for all mankind. . . .</i><br><br><i>Disciples of Christ in every generation are invited, indeed commanded, to be filled with a perfect brightness of hope.</i>[<i>BYU</i>1992–93<i>Devotional and Fireside Speeches</i>(Provo: Brigham Young University, 1993), pp. 70–71]<br><br>President Hunter's counsel is timeless.<br><br>Tonight, to the youth of the Church, I would like to quote a scripture by way of summary and promise:<br><br><i>Ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.</i>[2 Nephi 31:20; see also 2 Nephi 32:3]<br><br>Your hope is your "Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel--the God of the whole earth" (3 Nephi 22:5). His hope is in you. You are literally the "Hope of Israel, Zion's army, Children of the promised day" (<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 259).<br><br>If the apostle Paul were with us tonight, he might choose to bless you as once he did the Romans: "Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost" (Romans 15:13).<br><br>As it is my privilege to bear that same apostolic authority, I invoke a blessing upon you, that you may feast upon the words of Christ and apply his teachings in your lives; that success may attend your righteous endeavors; that health, happiness, and a more excellent hope may be yours; that you may endure to the end and enjoy eternal life. I so bless you, consistent with the will of the Lord for each of you. I testify that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that his church has been restored in these latter days, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Russell M.

My dear brothers and sisters, I am grateful for your presence here today, especially in view of the fact that you anticipated hearing from President Howard W. Hunter today, and any replacement for him is clearly inadequate. Thank you for accepting a substitute with such graciousness. I bring you his love. He hopes to speak to you on another occasion.<br><br>On an earlier occasion when I spoke to a large audience here at BYU, I spoke on the subject "Our Strengths Can Become Our Downfall" (7 June 1992 fireside; see<i>Ensign,</i>October 1994, pp. 11–19, or<i>BYU 1991–92 Devotional and Fireside Speeches</i>[Provo: Brigham Young University, 1992], pp. 107–15). My subject today is a variation on that theme, which I might call "Our seeming downfalls can be the means of developing our strengths." I will speak on the significance and uses of adversity.<br><br>Adversity will be a constant or occasional companion for each of us throughout our lives. We cannot avoid it. The only question is how we will react to it. Will our adversities be stumbling blocks or stepping stones?<br><br>Father Lehi taught his son Jacob that in order to bring to pass righteousness, the Lord's plan allowed for wickedness. In order for God's children to appreciate joy, they must also be subject to misery (see 2 Nephi 2:23). To accomplish the purposes of God, there must needs be "an opposition in all things" (2 Nephi 2:11). Our adversities are part of that opposition. Elder Howard W. Hunter explained the principle in a general conference address many years ago:<br><br><i>We came to mortal life to encounter resistance. It was part of the plan for our eternal progress. Without temptation, sickness, pain, and sorrow, there could be no goodness, virtue, appreciation for well-being, or joy.</i>[<i>CR,</i>April 1980, p. 34]<br><br>Some adversities are individual. Others are common to large numbers of our Heavenly Father's children. During the last decade there have been many examples of large-scale adversities affecting tens or hundreds of thousands or millions. Only a few can be mentioned. In addition to wars in many nations, we have had earthquakes in Japan, California, China, Armenia, and Mexico; hurricanes or tornadoes in Florida and the central United States; volcanic eruptions in the Philippines; tidal waves in Nicaragua; forest fires in various western states; flooding in India and in the Mississippi valley; and famine and pestilence in Africa and elsewhere.<br><br>These huge catastrophes are tragedies, but they may have another significance. The Lord uses adversities to send messages to his children. Isaiah prophesied that in the last days the Lord would visit all nations with great natural disasters (see Isaiah 29:6; 2 Nephi 27:1–2). In modern revelation, the Lord speaks of calling upon the nations of the earth by the mouth of his servants and also "by the voice of thunderings, and by the voice of lightnings, and by the voice of tempests, and by the voice of earthquakes, and great hailstorms, and by the voice of famines and pestilences of every kind" (D&amp;amp;C 43:25). In another revelation, the Lord tells those he has called to teach the gospel:<br><br><i>After your testimony cometh the testimony of earthquakes. . . .</i><br><br><i>And also cometh the testimony of the voice of thunderings, and the voice of lightnings, and the voice of tempests, and the voice of the waves of the sea heaving themselves beyond their bounds.</i><br><br><i>And all things shall be in commotion; and surely, men's hearts shall fail them; for fear shall come upon all people.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:89–91]<br><br>Surely these great adversities are not random or without some eternal purpose or effect. They can turn men's hearts to God. Nephi was told that the natural enemies of his descendants would be "a scourge unto thy seed, to stir them up in remembrance of me" (2 Nephi 5:25). The idea of a scourge to cause people to remember God reaffirms a familiar teaching in the twelfth chapter of Hebrews: "Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth" (Hebrews 12:6). Even as adversities inflict mortal hardships, they can also be the means of leading men and women to eternal blessings.<br><br>Such large-scale adversities as natural disasters and wars seem to be inherent in the mortal experience. We cannot entirely prevent them, but we can determine how we will react to them. For example, the adversities of war and military service, which have been the spiritual destruction of some, have been the spiritual awakening of others. The Book of Mormon describes the contrast:<br><br><i>But behold, because of the exceedingly great length of the war between the Nephites and the Lamanites many had become hardened, because of the exceedingly great length of the war; and many were softened because of their afflictions, insomuch that they did humble themselves before God, even in the depth of humility.</i>[Alma 62:41]<br><br>I read of a similar contrast after the devastating hurricane that destroyed thousands of homes in Florida a few years ago. A news account quoted two different persons who had suffered the same tragedy and received the same blessing: each of their homes had been totally destroyed, but each of their family members had been spared death or injury. One said that this tragedy had destroyed his faith: "How could God allow this to happen?" The other said that the experience had strengthened his faith: "God has been good to me. Though my home and possessions were lost, our lives were spared, and we can rebuild our home." For one, the glass was half empty. For the other, the glass was half full. The gift of moral agency empowers each of us to choose how we will act when we suffer adversity.<br><br>I recall a memorable lesson I learned from<i>Chicago Daily News</i>columnist Sydney J. Harris. He wrote:<br><br><i>I walked with my friend, a Quaker, to the newsstand the other night, and he bought a paper, thanking the newsie politely. The newsie didn't even acknowledge it.</i><br><br><i>"A sullen fellow, isn't he?" I commented.</i><br><br><i>"Oh, he's that way every night," shrugged my friend.</i><br><br><i>"Then why do you continue to be so polite to him?" I asked.</i><br><br><i>"Why not?" inquired my friend. "Why should I let</i>him<i>decide how I'm going to act?"</i><br><br><i>As I thought about this incident later, it occurred to me that the important word was</i>act.<i>My friend</i>acts<i>toward people; most of us</i>react<i>toward them. He has a sense of inner balance that is lacking in most of us; he knows who he is, what he stands for, how he should behave. He refuses to return incivility for incivility, because then he would no longer be in command of his conduct.</i>["Do You Act--Or React?" condensed from the<i>Chicago Daily News</i>]<br><br>I like that example because it challenges each of us to focus our attention on the individual responses each of us must make to the individual personal adversities that are sure to hound us throughout our lives. Our responses will inevitably shape our souls and ultimately determine our status in eternity.<br><br>We can take comfort in the fact that because opposition is divinely decreed for the purpose of helping man to grow, we have the assurance of God that in the long view of eternity, opposition will not be allowed to overcome us. We will prevail. Like the mortal life of which they are a part, adversities are temporary. What is permanent is what we become by the way we react to them.<br><br>Our adversities can be the means of obtaining blessings unobtainable without them. Young Jacob had "suffered afflictions and much sorrow" in his childhood, but Lehi assured his son that God "shall consecrate thine afflictions for thy gain" (2 Nephi 2:1–2). After the Saints suffered severe persecutions in Missouri, the Lord gave this beautiful promise:<br><br><i>Fear not, let your hearts be comforted; yea, rejoice evermore, and in everything give thanks. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . All things wherewith you have been afflicted shall work together for your good.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 98: 1, 3]<br><br>A few years later, the Lord spoke similar words to the anguished Prophet Joseph Smith in Liberty Jail.<br><br><i>My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;</i><br><br><i>And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:7–8]<br><br>"All these things shall give thee experience," the Lord explained, "and shall be for thy good" (D&amp;amp;C 122:7).<br><br>How can adversities be for our good? Speaking in area conferences about twenty years ago, President Ezra Taft Benson explained:<br><br><i>It is not on the pinnacle of success and ease where men and women grow most. It is often down in the valley of heartache and disappointment and reverses where men and women grow into strong characters.</i>[Stockholm Area Conference, 1974, p. 70]<br><br><i>Every reversal can be turned to our benefit and blessing and can make us stronger, more courageous, more godlike.</i>[Philippines Area Conference, 1975, p. 11]<br><br>A few years ago I listened as a widow spoke in fast and testimony meeting. She told how she had lost her husband a year earlier. "He was a good man," she said, adding, "I lived in his shadow." Now that he was gone, she said she had to develop qualities in herself that were dormant during her husband's lifetime. She expressed appreciation for that opportunity. Some might not understand that expression, but I do. I heard my own mother express a similar thought about the effect on her of losing her husband--my father--after only eleven years of marriage. To carry this point to an even more personal level, I know it was a blessing to be raised by a widowed mother whose children had to learn how to work, early and hard. As promised in the scriptures, the Lord consecrated her affliction for her gain and for the blessing of her children.<br><br>In general conference ten years ago, Elder James E. Faust shared an experience President David O. McKay had related about the effect of hardships suffered in the Martin Handcart Company. Many years after this tragic event in which so many Mormon pioneers died, a teacher and some members in a Church class criticized the leadership of the Church for permitting that tragedy to occur. A man who had crossed the plains in the Martin Handcart Company was present in the class. Face white with emotion, he told the class they should not criticize something they knew nothing about.<br><br>"We suffered beyond anything you can imagine and many died of exposure and starvation," he admitted, but he reminded them that the survivors of that company had not been critical. "Not one of that company ever apostatized or left the Church," the old man said, "because everyone of us came through with the absolute knowledge that God lives for we became acquainted with him in our extremities." He told how he had pulled his handcart "when I was so weak and weary from illness and lack of food that I could hardly put one foot ahead of the other." Then, he said, "the cart began pushing me. I have looked back many times to see who was pushing my cart, but my eyes saw no one. I knew then that the angels of God were there." "Was I sorry that I chose to come by handcart?" he continued. "No. . . . The price we paid to become acquainted with God was a privilege to pay, and I am thankful that I was privileged to come in the Martin Handcart Company" (James E. Faust, "The Refiner's Fire,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1979, p. 53, quoting David O. McKay, "Pioneer Women,"<i>Relief Society Magazine,</i>January 1948, p. 8).<br><br>Brother Faust concluded:<br><br><i>Here then is a great truth. In the pain, the agony, and the heroic endeavors of life, we pass through a refiner's fire, and the insignificant and the unimportant in our lives can melt away like dross and make our faith bright, intact, and strong.</i>[<i>CR,</i>April 1979, p. 77]<br><br>Thousands of years ago, the Egyptian taskmasters afflicted the Israelites with heavy burdens. However, the Bible records, "the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew" (Exodus 1:12).<br><br>The Book of Mormon contains many similar examples of how whole groups of people can be blessed through common adversities.<br><br>When the wicked Nephite priests enslaved the faithful people who followed Alma, the Lord blessed them with extra strength as a witness of how he did "visit my people in their afflictions" (Mosiah 24:14).<br><br><i>And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were made light; yea, the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord.</i>[Mosiah 24:15]<br><br>When Alma the Younger preached to the Zoramites, the rich and the proud would not listen, but many who were poor heard his message. Alma saw and made record "that their afflictions had truly humbled them, and that they were in a preparation to hear the word" (Alma 32:6).<br><br>Later, during the long wars reported in the last chapters of the book of Alma, many of the Nephites and the Lamanites "were softened because of their afflictions, insomuch that they did humble themselves before God, even in the depth of humility" (Alma 62:41). As a result, Helaman and his brethren were able to preach to them, baptize them, and reestablish the Church in their land (see verses 45–46).<br><br>With the blessings of God, what seem to be adversities can be turned to the benefit of his faithful children.<br><br>For example, on a large scale, we can look on television as an adversity because it brings ugly programming into our homes and undercuts our standards of behavior by making wickedness seem accepted and popular. But television is also a medium we are using to spread the glorious message of the gospel to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. Many other such examples could be given.<br><br>On a personal level, being separated from home during your student years is an adversity, but it is also an occasion for significant growth as you make individual choices and obtain independent experiences you could never have obtained by remaining in the home of your loving parents. This whole process of learning and maturing is a type of the experience of mortality away from our heavenly home.<br><br>Some students look on a shortage of money and the need to be employed as a serious adversity. Along with many of your parents and teachers, I remember such experiences and feelings, and I am unpersuaded that relative poverty and hard work are greater adversities than relative affluence and free time. You are all familiar with the cycles reported in the Book of Mormon, in which prosperity led to complacency and pride and spiritual downfall, and in which deprivations led to humility and spiritual growth. I believe that the easy way materially usually is not the best way spiritually. For many, though not all, material wealth and abundant free time are spiritual impediments.<br><br>I am sure that the skills and discipline and soul-power that result from overcoming the challenge of material shortages open the door for extraordinary blessings. I offer one small personal example. As poor graduate students in Chicago, my wife and I did not have the resources to telephone home, except for very short calls on special holidays. We had to keep in touch by long, weekly letters, which each of us typed to both sets of parents each week. The composition of those letters developed writing skills that have blessed each of our lives for the ensuing forty-some years. We would have been deprived of a blessing of significant growth if we could have simply picked up the telephone and communicated in the almost effortless and sometimes almost thoughtless way that would have been available if we had had more money. I am an advocate of letters among loved ones, and my preference has been reinforced as I have written family histories and rejoiced in the details of loved one's lives that have been preserved in writing rather than lost on some electronic highway.<br><br>To cite other examples of how what seem to be downfalls can become the means of developing great strengths, consider Japan and West Germany. These nations survived and built upon the terrible adversities of defeat in World War II to become two of the world's mightiest nations. South Korea has done the same. At this time many great people in China and other nations, including members of our Church, face significant adversities in trying to meet together and practice their religion. But I believe that through faith even these adversities will be turned to blessings in the lives of these brothers and sisters. As we sing in that great hymn, "God Moves in a Mysterious Way,"<br><br><i>Ye fearful Saints, fresh courage take;</i><br><i>The clouds ye so much dread</i><br><i>Are big with mercy and shall break</i><br><i>In blessings on your head.</i><br>[<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 285, verse 2]<br><br>In her fine book called<i>Adversity,</i>Elaine Cannon shares this valuable example:<br><br><i>An old cowboy said he had learned life's most important lessons from Hereford cows. All his life he had worked cattle ranches where winter storms took a heavy toll among the herds. Freezing rains whipped across the prairies. Howling, bitter winds piled snow into enormous drifts. Temperatures might drop quickly to below zero degrees. Flying ice cut into the flesh. In this maelstrom of nature's violence most cattle would turn their backs to the ice blasts and slowly drift downwind, mile upon mile. Finally, intercepted by a boundary fence, they would pile up against the barrier and die by the scores.</i><br><br><i>But the Herefords acted differently. Cattle of this breed would instinctively head into the windward end of the range. There they would stand shoulder-to-shoulder facing the storm's blast, heads down against its onslaught.</i><br><br><i>"You always found the Herefords alive and well," said the cowboy. "I guess it's the greatest lesson I ever learned on the prairies--just face life's storms."</i>[Elaine Cannon,<i>Adversity</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1987), pp. 133–34]<br><br>Similarly, if we face up to our individual adversities or hardships, they can become sources of blessings to their apparent victims. God will not give us adversities we cannot handle, and he will bless us richly for patiently doing the best we can in the circumstances.<br><br>Elaine Cannon reminds us of an important way these blessings come and how we can make the most of them.<br><br><i>When we are pushed, stung, defeated, embarrassed, hurt, rejected, tormented, forgotten--when we are in agony of spirit crying out "why me?" we are in a position to learn something.</i>[Cannon,<i>Adversity,</i>p. 47]<br><br><i>A person who understands that life is schooling is more likely to benefit from adversity than one who expects only happiness in life.</i>[Cannon,<i>Adversity,</i>p. 46]<br><br>The apostle Paul demonstrated his understanding of that principle and provided a wonderful example of how to act upon it. Paul had what he called "a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me" (2 Corinthians 12:7). He prayed for the Lord to take that thorn from him, but the Lord replied: "My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness" (2 Corinthians 12:9). Having received that answer, faithful Paul then said he would "glory in [his] infirmities" (verse 9). "Therefore ," he said, "I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong" (2 Corinthians 12:10).<br><br>Elder Marvin J. Ashton gave a modern example of this in a conference address about fifteen years ago. He quoted a young friend who lost his hand when it was crushed in a hydraulic press.<br><br><i>During the first night there were thoughts of "Why me? Was it something in my past? What have I done to deserve this?" Then I thought, "No more rodeo, football, or skiing," and I wondered what type of a woman would want a one-handed husband.</i><br><br>Then came a fast Sunday when this young man gathered the courage to thank everyone for their prayers in his behalf. He later recalled:<br><br><i>After the testimony meeting, an admired friend gave me a special blessing. So many questions were answered during his blessing. He told me this accident was not punishment for anything I had done but, rather, an opportunity to help me become a better person and to amplify those particular traits which needed to be developed. He shared the thought that this challenge could make me more understanding of people, problems, and life. As I look back now, each point of his blessing and encouragement has helped in a very fulfilling way.</i><br><br>The young man concluded:<br><br><i>Today as I look back, I see the challenge of adversity as something upon which to build.</i>[<i>CR,</i>October 1980, pp. 82–83]<br><br>Elder Bruce R. McConkie declared: "In the wisdom of Him who knows all things . . . , all of us are given the particular and specific tests that we need in our personal situations" (<i>CR,</i>October 1976, p. 158; "The Dead Who Die in the Lord,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1976, p. 106). As the Lord explained to the prophet Moroni,<br><br><i>I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</i>[Ether 12:27]<br><br>The courageous faith and action of one person who excels in coping with adversity can be a great blessing to others who are strengthened by the example.<br><br>Many thousands of us were strengthened by observing President Spencer W. Kimball. During his long lifetime he was tortured by the most severe physical afflictions, including invisible boils, life-threatening heart ailments, and the devastating throat cancer that crippled his voice. His noble response to those adversities inspired all of us and helped us respond to our own adversities.<br><br>President Kimball gave us these inspired thoughts on the blessings of adversity:<br><br><i>I'm grateful that my priesthood power is limited and used as the Lord sees fit to use it. I don't want to heal all the sick--for sickness sometimes is a great blessing. People become angels through sickness.</i><br><br><i>Have you ever seen someone who has been helpless for so long that he has divested himself of every envy and jealousy and ugliness in his whole life, and who has perfected his life? I have. Have you seen mothers who have struggled with, perhaps, unfortunate children for years and years, and have become saints through it? Have you seen people who have calamity like the woman in my childhood who came home after a party and found seven children in ashes, her children, whom she had locked in her home. I am glad that we don't have to make those decisions. No pain suffered by man or woman upon the earth will be without its compensating effects if it be suffered in resignation and if it be met with patience.</i>[<i>TSWK,</i>p. 167–68]<br><br>Our president, Howard W. Hunter, has had many adversities, and his stalwart determination to overcome and grow through them is an inspiring example for all of us. After his wife, Clare, had a devastating stroke, Elder Hunter took care of her for many years before her death. Despite the heavy demands of his calling, his personal, loving care for his disabled wife was an inspiring model for all of us. In the years that followed he has surmounted about a dozen life-threatening illnesses and physical impairments. From each new challenge he has emerged with added power and patience and sweetness. In addressing the Church last October he acknowledged God's miraculous hand in his life:<br><br><i>He has repeatedly spared my life and restored my strength, has repeatedly brought me back from the edge of eternity, and has allowed me to continue in my mortal ministry for another season. I have wondered on occasion why my life has been spared.</i>["Exceeding Great and Precious Promises,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1994, p. 7]<br><br>The Lord's purposes have been served by the adversities given to Howard W. Hunter, and I believe that one of those purposes has been to give each of us a highly visible example of what the surmounting of mortal adversities can do for the refinement of an eternal soul.<br><br>I had an earlier experience of learning from someone else's adversity. Many years ago a tragic accident impaired a boy in our ward. As a freshman in a faraway college, this mischievous boy made a bomb in a chemistry lab, and it exploded and blew off his hand. As I sought to compose a letter of comfort to him, the words of a hymn came into my mind. I remember clearly how I was overcome with emotion and stained the letter with tears as I wrote the words:<br><br><i>In the furnace God may prove thee,</i><br><i>Thence to bring thee forth more bright,</i><br><i>But can never cease to love thee;</i><br><i>Thou art precious in his sight.</i><br><br><i>God is with thee, God is with thee;</i><br><i>Thou shalt triumph in his might.</i><br>["Zion Stands with Hills Surrounded,"<i>Hymns,</i>no. 43, verse 3]<br><br>The young man was blessed in his adversity, and so was I. The words of that hymn have been among my comforting companions for almost thirty years. Since that time I have discovered the source of that vivid metaphor. It is the words the Lord spoke to the children of Israel through the prophet Isaiah: "Behold, I have refined thee . . . ; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction" (Isaiah 48:10; 1 Nephi 20:10).<br><br>I know that the "furnace of affliction" is an eternal reality and that its consequences are an eternal blessing. I know and testify to the truth of Alma's teaching "that whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be supported in their trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions, and shall be lifted up at the last day" (Alma 36:3).<br><br>I pray that we will place trust in that comforting assurance and act so as to be worthy of our Heavenly Father's choicest blessings for his children. Those blessings are made possible because of the Resurrection and Atonement of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, whose witness I am, and in whose name I testify, even the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Dallin H.

<h1> Doesn&#039;t Grade on a Curve: Comparing Ourselves - Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Eighteen days ago our daughter-in-law Sharon gave birth to twin boys, James and John. As you can imagine, there was much rejoicing the morning they were born. Excited and loving grandparents, aunts, uncles, and friends all lined up in front of the hospital nursery window, marveling at the beautiful little faces and perfect little bodies.<br><br>"Are they identical?" we all asked. The preliminary tests were inconclusive, which of course only made us more curious. We stared at them, placed side by side, and compared them from their ears down to their toes. Was one lighter, darker, fatter, thinner, smaller, or bigger than his brother? This led to other questions in our minds: Would one be more athletically or musically inclined? Would one have an easier time in school? Would one have more friends?<br><br>Watching from outside the nursery window, we could see the new father, our son Michael, busily going from one baby to the other, speaking softly and gently touching them. When we were finally able to talk with him in the hallway, he was full of excitement and pride about how each one was doing, noting their individual characteristics. In our curiosity we had been drawing comparisons, but Michael, as the loving father, had focused on each boy separately.<br><br>As I left the hospital, I continued to think about these new little members of our family and whether it would be hard to be compared constantly with someone else. I hoped that our family would be able to value each child individually.<br><br>Then I began to think about life and how we often tend to compare ourselves to others. We compete with brothers, sisters, roommates, friends, or people with whom we work and go to school. Sometimes we even seem to be in competition with our husbands or wives. A few days later, still reflecting on this thought, I remarked to a friend, "Life is like being in school. We are continually grading ourselves on some imagined scorecard, trying to see who gets the A.<br><br>"You must remember," my wise friend answered, "the Lord does not grade on a curve."<br><br>This remarkable phrase caught my attention. Whatever we are doing, wherever we see ourselves on the scale of life, we need to put aside the world's preconceived notions of what we should be and remember, "The Lord doesn't grade on a curve."<br><br>We all want to do our best as we go through life. Sometimes, however, the most visible measuring stick we use to examine how we are doing is the one devised by the world. We naturally recognize people who are "at the top." We applaud them, we see their names on honor rolls, we read about them in newspapers and magazines, and we try to emulate them. There is nothing wrong with that except when we try to determine our intrinsic worth or the value of those around us by our comparative grades, social status, acclaim, appearance, salaries, degrees, or possessions.<br><br>It is an inevitable fact of life that we compare ourselves to others. Yet it can be a very dangerous practice. If we give ourselves a superior rating, we fall into the trap of pride. President Ezra Taft Benson has warned us that "the proud depend upon the world to tell them whether they have value or not. Their self-esteem is determined by where they are judged to be on the ladders of worldly success" ("Beware of Pride,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1989, p. 6).<br><br>If we see ourselves at the top of the ladder, we diminish the significance of others, sometimes overlooking important qualities that our grading scale ignores. We may not even be aware that we are doing this.<br><br>Not long ago, Rex and I visited a small ward in another part of the world. There was no organ or piano present. The bishop didn't own a suit jacket or even a tie. The Relief Society president didn't use a day planner. But the spirit in those meetings filled our hearts with love for our Savior and for our fellow beings. We went there thinking that because of our vast Church experience here on the Wasatch Front, there might be some way we could help lift or teach this little ward. Instead, they taught and lifted us with their pure testimonies of Christ.<br><br>An equally dangerous practice is giving ourselves an inferior rating. In this instance we often compare our weakest points with everybody else's strongest ones. If we believe we are at the bottom of the ladder of success, we feel defeated. I remember one afternoon sitting as a family in a sacrament meeting where a talented family performed a beautiful musical number. Each instrument was perfectly tuned and exquisitely played, creating an atmosphere of truly celestial music. At first I listened attentively, but soon a part of me became distracted as my thoughts broke through the Spirit. What kind of mother am I? I should have made our children practice more. Then, glancing at my row of children, I thought: Don't kid yourself--our gene pool just didn't produce great musicians. I supposed we could polish the piano keys, carry the instrument cases, or even wheel in the harp. But at that moment, in my very narrow perception, I felt we were among the lowly, and this musical family was surely several rungs up the celestial staircase.<br><br>Why do we do that to ourselves? When someone else does something well or owns something we do not have, why do we immediately knock ourselves down a rung or two? Appreciating the abilities and resources of others should lift us, not diminish us in any way. Every time we see or hear something of merit, we should be better because of it. The Lord must have intended it to be that way, because each of us has been given different gifts, unique abilities, and varying insights.<br><br>We cannot have every talent and every virtue. The only way we can experience all that is virtuous, lovely, or of good report, or praiseworthy is to enjoy at least some of it vicariously. We may never play tennis like Chris Evert, sing like Ariel Bybee, or throw a football like Steve Young, but we can come closer to appreciating those talents if we spend our time in joyful observation rather than in degrading envy. If we are troubled by the inadequacies of our home when we visit our neighbor, then we have rejected their gift of hospitality. If we belittle ourselves when we study with a brilliant friend, we close our minds to at least part of what we could be taught. If we berate ourselves as we observe the gentle nature of President Hunter, we miss the magic of his example. Being able to appreciate and encourage the gifts of others may well be the greatest gift of all.<br><br>The third danger is viewing ourselves in a dead heat with those around us. We need to be reminded that life is not a horse race. This past semester a student returned from the testing center with a lower grade than expected. She was discouraged, knowing she could have studied harder. Then one of her roommates suggested that she should wait to be depressed until she found out how everyone else in the class had done. Maybe the curve would be in her favor after all.<br><br>Sometimes this is how we view life. We justify our actions, feeling that those around us are doing no better than we are. In this situation we choose to make comparisons only with those who make us feel good about ourselves when we are not doing our best. When we do that, we are forgetting once again that the Lord does not grade on a curve.<br><br>The story of Enoch helps us to realize the Lord's ability to measure our individual potential and worth. At the time the Lord called Enoch to prophesy to the people, Enoch basically responded, "Why have you chosen me?" He explained all the reasons he feels incapable: "I . . . am but a lad, and all the people hate me; for I am slow of speech" (Moses 6:31). But the Lord knew Enoch's heart and blessed him to become a mighty prophet who was respected and loved by the people.<br><br>As Elder Marvin J. Ashton explained:<br><br><i>When the Lord measures an individual, He does not take a tape measure around the person's head to determine his mental capacity, nor his chest to determine his manliness, but He measures the heart as an indicator of the person's capacity and potential to bless others.</i>["The Measure of Our Hearts,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1988, p. 15]<br><br>Never will our eternal value be measured in comparison with another's performance. The Lord doesn't think in terms of quotas--only qualities. He does not accept just the top ten percent. He wants all of us. He sees our worth from where we are today and what we can become tomorrow. Each of us stands on equal footing as we work to develop Christlike qualities such as love, humility, patience, and charity. He will attend to our individual needs and assess our progress because it is "his work and his glory" to help us succeed.<br><br>When our measuring stick is Christ's life and teachings, we need no other comparison. As President Hunter says, the Savior<br><br><i>set a perfect example of right living, of kindness and mercy and compassion, in order that all of the rest of mankind might know how to live, know how to improve, and know how to become more godlike. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . We should try to be like him, even as the Primary children sing, "Try, try, try." (Children's Songbook,</i>p. 55). ["What Manner of Men Ought Ye to Be?"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1994, p. 64]<br><br>I testify to you that each of us is loved and valued beyond any earthly means of measuring. Because the Lord knows our hearts and sees our individual worth, he does not grade us on a curve. That we may see ourselves and others in this light as we strive to emulate the teachings of our Savior is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Janet G. Lee, wife of Rex E.

<h1>e on Earth: When Would You Have Chosen to Come? - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As a basis for my remarks this morning, I want you to assume--contrary to what we know--that in your premortal life you were permitted to see the end from the beginning. Assume also that you were told you would be privileged to come to the earth as a member of the restored Church and that you could choose one particular period of Church history in which you would lead your active adult life. Given that opportunity, what choice do you suppose you would have made?<br><br>Surely the temptation would have been great to pick the very early years, what we might call the New York/Pennsylvania period, when the Book of Mormon was being translated and published, the Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthoods were being restored, and the Church officially organized. Just think how exciting it would have been to be there when men such as Oliver Cowdery, Martin Harris, the Whitmer family, and Parley and Orson Pratt first came to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet and the Book of Mormon was modern-day scripture, even the companion volume to the Bible, the stick of Joseph foreseen by the prophet Ezekiel.<br><br>What a thrill it would have been to hear the Prophet Joseph or Oliver Cowdery recount their personal impressions as John the Baptist returned to earth and on the banks of the Susquehanna River laid his hands upon their heads and said, "Upon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah I confer the Priesthood of Aaron" (D&amp;amp;C 13:1).<br><br>Based on our present-day impressions, it is not likely that many of us would have picked what we might refer to as the Ohio period, from about 1831 through 1838, but if we look more carefully, some very exciting and important events occurred during that time. It was, for example, a period in which no fewer than seventy-seven sections--60 percent of the total pages--of the Doctrine and Covenants were revealed.<br><br>The Ohio years also constituted the single period that probably would have presented the greatest opportunities in all Church history to demonstrate your loyalty to the Prophet and to sustain him in times that he was in great need of sustenance. For this was a period of great rebellion from within the Church, including such Church leaders as Martin Harris, Frederick Williams, John Boynton, and William McLellin. It was also the time when faithful leaders were called upon to participate in Zion's Camp, a venture that, from all outward indications, was a failure, but, when viewed through the long lens of history, proved to be the laboratory that would identify and develop the Church's top leadership for decades to come.<br><br>Surely it would have taken great courage, knowing in advance the events that were to occur there, to have selected the comparatively brief but brutal and even tragic Missouri period, highlighted by the tarring and feathering of Bishop Edward Partridge, the driving of the Saints from Jackson County in the cold of November, and the subsequent battles of DeWitt and Crooked River. These events ultimately culminated in Governor Boggs' extermination order--and within a matter of days the tragedy of Haun's Mill, the capture of Far West, and the incarceration of the Prophet and his companions in Liberty Jail. To those of us whose understanding of civil rights and common decency is rooted in the soil of the last half of the twentieth century, it is literally unthinkable that the governor of any of the United States of America would issue an official order that an entire group of people be either expelled from the state or actually exterminated.<br><br>The extermination order carries an irony that accompanies its offensive outrage: though the threat of its actual use existed for only a brief period, it was not formally revoked until 1976. Little did I know when I traveled to St. Louis or Kansas City prior to 1976 that I was under official order of the state of Missouri to be dealt with in the same manner that the Orkin Company deals with termites.<br><br>How great the temptation would have been to have picked the Nauvoo period. Nauvoo the Beautiful--it was beautiful in many ways. Certainly beauty abounded in its physical surroundings, as anyone can attest who has visited it in its restored condition. Even more beautiful were some of the events that occurred there. It was in Nauvoo that the Prophet introduced for the first time baptism for the dead, the endowment in the form we know today, and the sealing of husbands and wives in the new and everlasting covenant of marriage.<br><br>Nauvoo was also beautiful because of the faithful Saints and the lessons they taught us. They knew, for example, that their remaining days in Nauvoo were limited; indeed, they had publicly committed to that effect. Yet they worked feverishly, literally around the clock, twenty-four hours a day, pouring enormous portions of their resources and their energy into the completion of a temple that they knew they would have to abandon. They toiled and they built and they spent their scarce funds because that was the place where their endowments could be performed--and nearly 6,000 were in fact performed before they began the long trek westward.<br><br>And what about that long trek westward? Is that the period you would have chosen? The years from 1846 through 1869--and particularly through the end of the 1850s--were a time when it was not easy to be a believing and practicing adherent of the restored gospel. You would have suffered deprivation of a quality and duration known by few other people in the history of the world. Almost inevitably some of your loved ones, and perhaps even you, would have been buried along the trail in shallow, unmarked graves, and one might conclude that even greater suffering was endured by some of those who did not die. The experiences of the Willie and Martin Handcart Companies, for example, must never be erased from our memory but must always remain a proud part of our tradition, however painful it may be to reflect back on their tragic experiences.<br><br>Because of a series of unfortunate delays, those companies found themselves buried by the deep snows of a disastrous Wyoming winter. Their food stores ran out, and they did not have sufficient bedding to withstand the freezing temperatures. An estimated 217 of them perished in the cold. Samuel and Margaret Pusell and their little family from Preston, England, were with the Martin Company. Samuel grew so weary from lack of food and the constant pulling of the cart that he became ill and died. His wife followed five days later. Ten-year-old Nellie's feet were frozen so badly that they had to be amputated with a butcher knife and a carpenter's saw, without anesthetic. A biographer records that "in pain she waddled through the rest of her life on her knees." Nevertheless, in "poverty and pain she reared a family of six children but never asked for favors of pity or charity because of her tragic handicap" (William R. Palmer, "She Stood Tall on Her Knees," <i>Instructor </i>91 [July 1956]: 196–97).<br><br>Those days, my brothers and sisters, are gone forever. Never again will faithful Saints be required to endure that exact set of circumstances. What we must never forget is that the members of those companies were willing to suffer as they did because of their unshakable belief that no sacrifice--whether starvation, loss of frozen limbs, or death itself--was too great a price to pay for their convictions.<br><br>Once Zion's center point was established, there followed periods of significant colonization not only in Utah but also in the surrounding states and Canada and Mexico. In the Brigham Young era alone, there were from 350 to 400 colonizing settlements. This period would have also presented important opportunities to contribute to the building of the restored kingdom. My own ancestors were called to settle on the Little Colorado River in northeastern Arizona. It was a bleak existence, but, once again, they went in response to a prophet's request. The Little Colorado, at least the part of it that flows by my little town, hardly deserves its label as a river. It was described by my grandfather as "Too thin to plow and too thick to drink."<br><br>My grandfather was also the source of several stories about living conditions and other circumstances that existed during that late nineteenth-century colonization period. Let me share one of them with you.<br><br>In the 1890s, as the Salt Lake Temple was nearing completion, a request went out from the First Presidency under Wilford Woodruff that members of the Church contribute whatever money they could toward the completion of the temple. My great grandfather called a family council, and all agreed that they should donate their entire savings, consisting of about $5, which they kept in a jar on the top shelf in the kitchen. It was the family's mite--everything they had--and they gave it for a cause in which they believed and in response to a prophet's request. It was the same spirit, undergirded by the same conviction, that had sustained their own forebears in Missouri, in Illinois, and on the trek across the plains--a conviction that Joseph Smith really saw the Father and the Son, that once again there are prophets on the earth. The account of this $5 contribution has come down from generation to generation as a valuable part of our family heritage.<br><br>I am now prepared to give you my own answer to the hypothetical question I posed at the outset. Had I been privileged to know the beginning from the end, and had I been given the choice, I would have elected to come during the time that you and I share in common, the close of the twentieth century and the opening of the twenty-first.<br><br>My conclusion is based on my conviction, grounded on several years of contemplation of this very issue, that a well-educated and totally devoted Latter-day Saint whose education prepared him or her to deal with the world on its own terms and who is also anchored on foundation stones of great faith can make as great or perhaps even greater contribution to building and strengthening the restored kingdom today than at any other time in our history. Daniel saw our day. He spoke of the little stone cut out of the mountain without hands that would roll forth and consume all other kingdoms (Daniel 2:45). Peter also saw our time when, in the third chapter of Acts, he prophesied concerning the "restitution of all things" (Acts 3:20–21). I bear testimony that this restitution of all things has come to pass, and you and I are participants. That rock cut from the mountain without hands has greater momentum today than at any time in our history (see D&amp;amp;C 65:2), and there are very concrete things that you and I can do that will add to that momentum.<br><br>For me there is a particularly delicious and nostalgic significance in the fact that stake number 2,000 was organized last month in Mexico. I served as a missionary in Mexico from the mid- to late 1950s. When I left the mission in 1958 there were in the entire Mexican Republic fewer than a dozen branches that either were functioning or could have functioned under local leadership independent of the missionaries. The membership of the Church in Mexico at that time totaled less than 13,000. Today, just thirty-six years later, it totals more than 700,000 members organized into 129 stakes, 1,366 wards and branches, and eighteen missions.<br><br>Well, you may ask, what's the point of all this? And the answer is, it illustrates my central thesis about the importance, and the attraction, of being a believing, practicing, dedicated member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints at this particular time in history. While the Mexican experience is hardly typical of what has happened in the whole world, the Church is growing like never before. We now have wards and branches organized in twenty-six countries where just four years ago we had no wards or branches at all. In 1982 we had twenty temples. Today there are forty-seven, with commitments already made for ten more. And the wonderful thing, from our standpoint, is that it is happening right now in our day, with our participation.<br><br>We were not there to march in Zion's Camp, to build the temple in Nauvoo, or to pull a handcart along the north bank of the Platte River. Carthage Jail, Haun's Mill, Johnston's Army, Winter Quarters--those are experiences that we will never have. It is, however, our good fortune to be participants in events that are equally historic and equally significant.<br><br>But once again you question me: How can I possibly say that we are participants in today's events just as our ancestors were in Zion's Camp? None of us is now preaching the gospel in the Czech Republic or in Mongolia, or doing the masonry work on a temple in Hong Kong. However true those facts may be, they cannot and must not mask the central reality that by virtue of the very structure that the Lord has ordained for his Church, if we do our job right as ordinary, everyday, practicing members, we are necessarily and inevitably contributing directly to the magnitude and quality of today's kingdom-building just as effectively and importantly as if we had colonized on the Little Colorado or mixed mortar for the Nauvoo Temple. Let me explain why.<br><br>I think that if any objective observer were to analyze the LDS Church, completely ignoring any considerations of divine origin or continuing divine involvement, two factors undergird our success. The first is volunteer, uncompensated service, including not only our missionaries, but also the vast corps of leaders ranging from Mia Maid advisors to bishop's counselors to Primary teachers who run our wards and stakes and other local units. And the second is our observance of the ancient law of tithing, as well as other voluntary financial contributions. Those of us who are believing, practicing members would add to that objective analysis that those who are faithful enough to pay their tithing and fulfill to the best of their ability whatever callings come to them in the Church will necessarily follow other commandments and counsel.<br><br>Does it sound too simple? Can that really be all there is to it? Just pay our tithing, serve willingly in the callings we have received, and keep the commandments? How, you ask, can it be said that doing these things makes our generation the most exciting and the most productive time in history to be a participant in the Restoration, given the fact that activities and service of that kind are no different today from what they were 150 years ago or at any time in between then and now?<br><br>The answer is, we are in a position to make more effective contributions of both our time and our money toward strengthening and enlarging the Restoration because of advantages uniquely available to us--advantages largely attributable to superior education such as you are receiving here. There has never been a time when the investment of those time and money resources can yield such immense returns.<br><br>And that's our job. That's our counterpart to pulling a handcart or giving as did my grandfather's family their entire family savings to finish the Salt Lake Temple. We prepare ourselves to serve, and then we serve willingly and faithfully. We live the gospel: school ourselves and our families in the importance of prayer, missionary, and other Church service; pay our tithing; and offer complete loyalty to the Lord's chosen leaders.<br><br>I testify to you that this work of which I have spoken today is not just another church, another religious organization, another way of life, but the literal kingdom of God, restored to the earth in these last days through a prophet and still directed today by prophets under the inspiration of our Heavenly Father. That's what drove our ancestors through the Missouri period, the Illinois period, across the plains, and out to the surrounding states and Canada and Mexico, enduring conditions far more adverse than any that you and I will be called upon to endure. I further testify that faithful adherence to the commandments of our Heavenly Father received by us through those ancient and modern prophets will bring us the greatest joys that this life has to offer. The best time of all is ours. Right now. Our time. Our generation. May we take full advantage of it, building further on what earlier generations have begun, is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Rex E. Lee was president of Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 24 January 1995.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>
<h1>His Law in Their Hearts: The Development of Religious Faith in Children - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In chapter 31 of Jeremiah the Lord says, "I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people" (Jeremiah 31:33).<br><br>My question for this morning is, "What can, or must, parents do to assist the Lord so that his law becomes internalized in the hearts of their children?" As some parents here can attest, it's not that easy.<br><br>I love the beautiful story in the Book of Mormon of the prophet and king Benjamin, a great example to all parents. After a lifetime of loving, teaching, and working alongside his people, Benjamin delivered such a profound sermon to them as he approached the time of his death that the entire community was converted to Jesus Christ. The Spirit had touched their hearts so completely that they knew of the truth of his words and had no more disposition to do evil but had a desire to do good continually (see Mosiah 5:2). They had become the children of Christ, his sons and his daughters. What a wonderful thing to have happen to these people, these grown-ups. In Mosiah we read that all<i>except the little children</i>had been taught the commandments, and that every one of the community<i>except the little children</i>took upon themselves the name of Christ (see Mosiah 6:2).<br><br>The verses noting that the little children weren't old enough to partake of the sermon are foreshadowings because the scriptures return to these youngsters later on as adults:<br><br><i>Now it came to pass that there were many of the rising generation that could not understand the words of king Benjamin, being little children at the time he spake unto his people; and they did not believe the tradition of their fathers.</i><br><br><i>They did not believe what had been said concerning the resurrection of the dead, neither did they believe concerning the coming of Christ.</i>[Mosiah 26:1–2]<br><br>What went wrong? How was it that these deeply committed Christian parents, spiritually diligent people, likely to be furiously active in church, missed raising their children in such a way that these children also possessed a strong religious faith? As you know, four of the unbelievers were grandsons of the prophet king Benjamin. Ammon, Aaron, Omner, and Himni didn't believe Grandpa's words about Christ.<br><br>Using this scriptural example as a metaphor, again, my question is<i>What can parents do to help their children internalize the religious faith of their fathers and mothers?</i>How can they assist the Lord in putting his "law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts" (Jeremiah 3l:33)?<br><br>Now I hasten to add that I am not suggesting that these ancient parents necessarily did anything wrong. There is a tendency both in the Church and in my profession to blame parents for the errors of their children. We are too prone to forget agency, sometimes biological factors, and the concept of bidirectional influence; in other words, children influence their parents and parents influence their children. President Howard W. Hunter has commented on the critical importance of remembering agency--that parents can only do what they can do. They cannot do what their children must do for themselves.<br><br><i>A successful parent is one who has loved, one who has sacrificed, and one who has cared for, taught, and ministered to the needs of a child.</i>["Parents' Concern for Children,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1983, p. 65]<br><br>In other words, the parent who does what she or he can do is a successful parent, even though the child may choose to disregard the offering. The inculcation of values, particularly religious commitment, is an affective or emotional as well as cognitive process that, at its center, includes loving, sacrificing, caring for, and ministering to, as well as teaching. The parenting relationship to children represents an invitation to link spiritually across generations in sharing traditions, a culture, a lifeway in bonds of love beyond biology. Still, our parenting invitation, after all we can do, is ultimately left to the child to embrace or reject. I am, however, going to talk about influences. We can, as parents or individuals, make it more likely or more difficult for children to develop religious faith.<br><br>The scriptures tell parents to raise up their children in light and truth and to teach them to believe and follow the commandments of God. To be teachers though, we must first have been and<i>continue to be</i>students ourselves. Some of you recently returned missionaries may know the unsettling speed with which the joys of the scriptures depart from your hearts when Math 111 or American Heritage exams displace daily scripture study. But remember,<i>You can't teach what you don't believe or feel committed to yourself.</i>Parents are tradition bearers, and one's faith must be kept alive and growing in order for it to be felt as true to children who listen to them and watch them. As Paul says, "Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God" (Romans l0:17)--for ourselves as well as our little ones, and for some of us parents our little ones are now big ones like you.<br><br>There is strong evidence that narratives, the stories we tell or hear, may be our most natural register for learning about human behavior. Some of the work of David Dollahite of BYU in family stories and the research of Richard Bounforte, also of BYU, suggest people can teach their fundamental beliefs most deeply in personal stories, stories in which listeners and the storyteller participate together in the recognizable, "Oh-I-know-what-you-mean" elements of the story. Bounforte is finding that people really do "share" their religious testimonies.<br><br>One of my favorite essayists, Wendell Berry, has written,<br><br><i>When a community loses its memory, its members no longer know one another. How can they know one another if they have forgotten or have never learned one another's stories? If they do not know one another's stories, how can they know whether or not to trust one another? People who do not trust one another do not help one another, and moreover they fear one another.</i>["The Work of Local Culture," in<i>What Are People For?</i>(San Francisco: North Point Press, 1990), p. 157]<br><br>This morning I invite you to share with me some of my stories, that we may strengthen each other in our community.<br><br>Children are uncomfortably adept at seeing through insincerity, and sometimes startlingly open about stating it. I remember taking my son with me to the grocery store once when he was about four years old. At the checkout counter when he wanted a candy bar, I responded, "I'm sorry, Matt, I don't have enough money for a candy bar." I thought it was a clever response--I was telling him I didn't want to while hiding behind words that suggested I didn't have enough money. That night, when I told him it was time to go to bed, he responded, "Sorry, Daddy, I don't have enough money to go to bed." He was not fooled by my words in the grocery store. He knew I was saying that I didn't want to buy the candy bar, and so he used my manipulative tool, words, to say that he didn't want to go to bed.<br><br>In communicating our religious tradition, let us not underestimate the perceptiveness of children, thinking to hide anything behind words. Children must sense our commitment and honest striving for consistency even while recognizing that we, too, are human, not without struggles. The psychologist William Damon, writing about the development of morality in children, has warned that moral ends cannot be achieved by immoral means because children, especially adolescents, are so quick to detect hypocrisy. He suggests that when we make moral mistakes, it may be quite helpful for us to discuss our mistakes with our children and allow them to watch us make amends (see<i>The Moral Child: Nurturing Children's Natural Growth</i>[New York: The Free Press, 1988]).<br><br>A Swedish psychologist distinguished between three categories of religious tradition bearers.<i>Unconfident transmitters</i>of tradition are parents who have problems with their own feelings about religion. When their children ask questions about God, these parents are unable to teach faith wholeheartedly because their hearts are still unsettled. They necessarily also communicate their doubts as well because, as I have suggested, children are sensitive to more than just words.<i>Confident transmitters,</i>on the other hand, can teach in an emotionally harmonious way because they are teaching what they love. Moreover, their confidence is more apt to allow the children to grow in the tradition at their own pace because the parents are also teaching who they love. I suggest the whisperings of the Spirit have a "tenderizing" effect, teaching us more clearly how to discern the spirits of our children.<br><br>There are others described as<i>overconfident transmitters</i>of religious tradition. These people try to influence others with great intensity, as though they were going to press the beliefs into the children almost physically. They are likely to be intolerant of any doubt or hesitation on the part of their children, as though it were an affront to their dignity that a son or daughter of theirs would doubt. Research shows that many of the children of the overconfident transmitters reject faith, not because they had considered it carefully, but because they were, in essence, saying, "Dad or Mom, if your faith makes you so harsh and demanding, I want nothing to do with it."<br><br>Back to a Book of Mormon story. Listen for the difference in a faithful and<i>confident transmitter's</i>viewpoint and that of his brothers, who were definitely<i>unconfident transmitters.</i>And notice, then, how your faith as a parent would affect the way you would teach your children. Here's Nephi's account:<br><br><i>We did travel and wade through much affliction in the wilderness; and our women did bear children in the wilderness.</i><br><br><i>And so great were the blessings of the Lord upon us, . . . our women did give plenty of suck for their children, and were strong.</i>[1 Nephi 17:1–2]<br><br>And now listen to Laman and Lemuel's account of the journey:<br><br><i>We have wandered in the wilderness for these many years; and our women have toiled, being big with child; and they have borne children in the wilderness and suffered all things, save it were death; and it would have been better that they had died before they came out of Jerusalem than to have suffered these afflictions.</i>[1 Nephi 17:20]<br><br>I think you can see how differently these three brothers undoubtedly transmitted their religious tradition to their children. They were talking about the same experience, which, because of their faith, was not the same experience at all.<br><br>As faith is a gift from God and grows by righteous living, the security<i>and joy</i>supporting a confident transmitter depends upon our diligence as parents. The development of religious faith in our children must be a central and fundamental goal for us as parents.<br><br><i>And thou shalt teach</i>[the commandments]<i>diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.</i>[Deuteronomy 6:7]<br><br>In other words, Moses would have our awareness of the blessings of God be so present that it would be a part of all we do. Spiritual nutrition requires daily servings of the bread of life, not just for Sunday dinner.<br><br>Now let me illustrate, and let's apply the Martian Observer Test. In other words, if you were a alien observer of my behavior, what would you decide was the true purpose of my actions, in spite of what I may think I mean? I am a campus bishop, and each year in the LDS Church we have a tradition called tithing settlement. Bishops review with each member his or her contributions, and these include both tithing funds that go to the building up of the Church and fast offerings--donations for those who need help. The first time I interviewed a couple who had paid a complete tithing but who had made no fast offerings, I was embarrassed for them. How could they forget that tradition, I thought? Then I imagined what my own children might be learning from my teaching about the paying of fast offerings (the Martian observer): The doorbell rings, one of the children says, "Dad, the deacon is here with his blue envelope," and I go to the door with my checkbook. Period. Now I ask you, the Martian observer, What was my purpose? You may answer, "Well, I think you were paying a bill. The deacon looked just like the paperboy collecting for the paper. In fact, wasn't that the paperboy? But wearing a tie?"<br><br>My children know more about fasting than that, but perhaps not much more about making a fast offering. I had let the sacred tradition of making an offering of my fast appear to be a habit about which I neither thought very much or felt the importance to teach. The living story was missing for them in which they themselves participated. They had not heard me say that when I do<i>think about what I am doing,</i>I love to make a fast offering because I know how I am blessed by God. They probably have not heard that there have been specific times when I have felt particularly guided because of my participation in fast offerings. As Moses suggests, we must be living, talking stories of faith, aware of its sacred importance in other's lives and in our own.<br><br>Consider once more how important it is that our sacred traditions be sacred, not just tradition or habit. If, for instance, I were a Martian observer, what would I conclude was the purpose of how we celebrate, for instance, Memorial Day? Would I conclude that the purpose of Memorial Day is to shop until you drop because the mall is offering a fantastic one-day-only sale? Or is the purpose of Memorial Day to take flowers to the cemetery and then go on a picnic? Yes. But what is its historical purpose? Why is it important enough to declare a holiday? Do we ourselves honor the servicemen who gave that last, full measure of devotion that we might live? Do we teach that? Wendell Berry laments that it seems<br><br><i>we have become a nation of fantasists. We believe, apparently, . . . that democratic freedom can be preserved by people ignorant of the history of democracy and indifferent to the responsibilities of freedom.</i>["Word and Flesh," in<i>What Are People For?</i>(San Francisco: North Point Press, 1990), p. 202]<br><br>Parents are the culture bearers. What are we parents transmitting about the culture--the stories of our country, our ancestors, our<i>spiritual forefathers?</i>Notice how often, for instance, Nephi tried to bring his brothers back to faith by pleading with them to remember the faithful stories of the prophets' experiences with God. We can't ask our children to remember if they've never heard the stories.<br><br>Remembering my son with not enough money to go to bed, I suggest that children are Martian observers--watching, sensing, trying to understand, and frequently detecting more about what people are saying than what their words suggest.<br><br>If you were an observer in my home, would you assume by listening to my family prayers that I was much more concerned that my children be safe and well and get good grades than I was that they remember Jesus Christ? That I am more concerned that they get home safely than that they get Home safely?<br><br>Back to the scriptures. In Proverbs we find the well-known admonition "Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it" (Proverbs 22:6).<br><br>That seems self-explanatory, but part of the embedded message there, I think, is that training up a child is a long process that requires patience and "the long view" of development with all its unevenness of growth's ups and downs, both for us as well as for them. Internalization of faith does not simply occur at age four or age seven or sixteen. Parenting takes place in a million small moments of interaction, and children and adolescents adopt or repudiate their parents' values in part because of the nature of their relationship.<br><br>I suggest to you that King Benjamin in a sense "parented" his people; his love, sacrifice, and ministering for many years prepared them for the wonderful conversion experience we read of.<br><br>Next, from the Book of Mormon: "Pray in your families unto the Father, always in my name, that your wives and your children may be blessed" (3 Nephi 18:21). Now you may ask, Are they blessed because you pray that they may be blessed? Or blessed because you have modeled a devotional pattern for them to follow? Or blessed because they have joined you in your story and can also be partakers of the whisperings of the Spirit? I suggest "all of the above." But it is particularly important that we act our faith--not just train in the habits of belief, but create the sacred invitation for God to confirm in the hearts of the children that these acts are real, that he is there, listening and answering our prayers.<br><br>Thus we hear in the scriptures that we should<i>teach the children, share with them worship experiences.</i>Then there are corollary, more affective, perhaps psychological themes that speak to parenting: "Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord" (Ephesians 6:4). And, "Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged" (Colossians 3:21). These verses speak to the bond between parents and children so important in the psychological literature on attachment and internalization. These particular verses warn of the dangers of parents' behaving in ways that provoke rebellion or shame in the children toward the parents, which so frequently has to do with humiliating them.<br><br>Now you may ask, Why is the parent-child relationship so important to the development of faith? First, the process of internalization is one in which children incorporate external messages from their parents into themselves--that is, things said to me as a child, especially about me, gradually become internal, become things I say to myself, in an interpreted form. Thus I metaphorically see myself in my mother's eyes and in her actions toward me, and I am likely to gradually learn to believe about myself what I see. If I experience Mom as soothing and caring, I will be more likely to be able to soothe and care for myself in times when Mom is not around. These messages become how I see the world, as though I am learning about life through my parents' eyes. And what, then, will I see in my parents' eyes when they look at God?<br><br>A second example from developmental psychology also applies. Have you ever knocked on someone's door and heard a dog within barking furiously? When the owner comes and is glad to see you, suddenly the dog is glad to see you, too? We call that<i>social referencing.</i>Similarly, babies who normally go through a period of being frightened of people they don't know, may warm up much faster to Grandma and Grandpa than to other strangers. They look in Mama's eyes, see her love of Grandma, and trust that Grandma must be wonderful. Again, what will our children see in our eyes when we look at God?<br><br>We should emphasize that attachment is a bidirectional influence; that is, parents attach to their children as well. Excessive attachment in the form of overprotection from the parent can be harmful. Secure attachment frees children to explore, to learn, and to develop their competencies. Overprotection, what we sometimes call "hover mothering," teaches children to see themselves as loved but either incompetent or fragile.<br><br>There are other scriptures that are equally illustrative, but we can assume that the scriptural counsel to teach also suggests that the atmosphere of teaching is, like our discussion of the attachment process, one of nurturing, loving, and consistency. Let me emphasize teaching for a moment. Telling does not equal teaching, and telling, or information dispensing, does not equal behavior change. William Damon's (1988) research in moral training of children suggests that the attempt to "indoctrinate" children as simply passive recipients of knowledge just doesn't work. Children need to be active in order to learn, and what they learn depends a great deal on the teacher's presentation. Probably all of us know adolescents who seem "unable" to learn or "unable" to complete the assignments for teachers they don't like. And, in my experience, the feelings they just can't seem to get past are the resentments toward teachers who provoke them by demeaning them in class.<br><br>Consider this example: I watched a father "teaching" his daughter to swim one day several years ago. She was quite frightened of the water, so, of course, since he knew that there is nothing to be afraid of and that he is quite capable of protecting her, he told her to relax, there is nothing to be afraid of. But being told to relax is often an insufficient modifier of a feeling as primitive as fear about water. When she continued to be afraid in spite of the father's telling-equals-teaching-equals-behavior-change effort, Dad became more and more irritated, increasing the volume and insistence of his so-called teaching, which by now was sounding more like demand and command. Soon his daughter was more afraid of her father than she was of the water, and she was now more afraid of the water than before being "taught" to not be afraid because anxiety is a total-body feeling. She was by now looking for any avenue of escape from the situation and did not learn to swim in this session. More important to her development, she had learned more about her father than about swimming. And, if these experiences continue in myriads of other small moments of so-called teaching, she will learn more about her feelings about herself being an incapable, fearful child than about the supposed objects of teaching, whatever they might be, because what she internalizes is what Dad is saying to her about her as a person.<br><br>Remember Ephesians 6:4: Bring up children in the "nurture and admonition of the Lord." The problem for teaching is the affective "packaging" of the knowledge that parents wish to impart. In this example, when Dad recognizes that relaxing is a feeling, he may begin to accomplish his goal when he creates a learning situation wherein relaxation and safety is more likely to occur, perhaps by play or letting her ride his back while he swims. Then he can include the information or cognitive component. When we let our children "ride our backs" in the waters of faith and worship, which are feelings as well, these feelings can be confirmed by God. We teach best when we are a "haven of safety" for our children.<br><br>Finally, in the scriptures as well as in the research on parenting, there is clearly a behavioral control, accountability element in the messages to parents. Perhaps the best example may be found in the same prophet-king Benjamin's address: "And ye will not suffer your children. . . that they transgress the laws of God, and fight and quarrel one with another, and serve the devil, who is the master of sin" (Mosiah 4:14). Religious faith is not just a "feel-good" experience. It is one that grows by faithful service and discipline. C. S. Lewis teases that sometimes we act as if<br><br><i>we want, in fact, not so much a Father in Heaven as a grandfather in heaven--a senile benevolence who, as they say, "liked to see young people enjoying themselves," and whose plan for the universe was simply that it might be truly said at the end of each day, "a good time was had by all."</i>[<i>The Problem of Pain</i>(New York: Macmillan, 1962), p. 40]<br><br>Heavenly Father has a great work for us to do. Remember the internalization process we spoke of earlier. Children who experience their parents' reasonable expectations for learning to work hard will come to expect themselves to work hard and know the inner confidence that comes with a job well done. Consider now the combination of love and firmness from psychological research as it relates to parenting moral children. The classic investigations in parenting of capable, competent children conducted by Diana Baumrind (1971, 1972, 1973, 1989) emphasize the combination of parents' clear love and commitment to their children, their equally clear expectations for behavioral control and discipline, and their respect for their children's individuality. I have sometimes typified those elements in a mnemonic:<i>Love, Limits, and Latitude.</i>In other words, parents of the most competent children are saying, in effect:<br><br><i>We love you and we want you to belong with us. We also accept the obligation to help you learn to grow into responsible maturity in our family and our community. But we know that you are an individual with feelings and tastes of your own. We will need to talk a lot to explain our reasons for our expectations, and we welcome your discussing with us your age-appropriate right to choose.</i><br><br>It is interesting to note that Baumrind initially found three styles of parenting--authoritarian, authoritative, and permissive parenting. I have been describing authoritative parents. Later analysis of the data, however, highlighted another effective parenting style--what she called harmonious parents.<br><br><i>Harmonious parents seemed to neither exercise control, nor to avoid the exercise of control. Instead, they focused upon achieving a quality of harmony in the home, and upon developing principles for resolving differences and for right living.</i>[Diana Baumrind, "Harmonious Parents and Their Preschool Children,"<i>Developmental Psychology</i>4 (1971): 99–102]<br><br>These harmonious principles appear to be particularly critical in adolescence when teenagers are suddenly intellectually capable of being critical of parental rules while at the same time perhaps not yet understanding other moderating circumstances. In that situation, research indicates that the least amount of parental control required to get them to comply with an unpleasant request is most likely to be later internalized as their own value. Let me say that again.<i>In adolescence, the least amount of parental control necessary to get obedience will be most likely to foster internalization of parental values.</i><br><br>Dr. William Damon (1988) expanded upon Baumrind's and others' research as he considered the particular requirements in fostering morality. He emphasized that it is the child's love for his parents that establishes an emotional foundation of respect for authority. Parents must be willing to confront inappropriate behavior, he suggested, with explanations for why it is wrong and how it can be made right. And children will learn moral values by active participation in relationships, not in lessons or lectures in which they are passive recipients. The quality of interactions, both with adults and with peers, will teach much more enduring lessons than any indoctrination or verbal directives.<br><br>Damon has some warnings for parents as well. First, parents ought not overintrude into their children's experiences. Children who are not permitted to thoughtfully make their own decisions do not develop trust in their own sensitivities, and they are being taught that their own feelings don't matter much. And children who are protected by parents' intrusion into possibly deserved unpleasant consequences do not learn self-control.<br><br>We have considered attachment as a general process. I would like to go back to that process now as we examine an extrapolation. Infants, in the first two or three months of life, and certainly throughout the first year, engage in an activity with people that is called<i>interactive synchrony</i>(Tronick and Cohn, 1989). The infant looks into her mother's eyes and smiles or makes a noise, to which the mother responds. Mom "talks back" with vocalizations or facial expressions, in turn, which then draws another response from the infant (Butkatko and Daehler, 1992). This trading back and forth between the adult and infant of eye contact, facial expressions, and vocalizations is like a duet or "dance" of emotional interaction. It is the source of what we sometimes call "motherese," that language of inflections that we all smile at when we hear it, but are equally likely to do in the same situation: "Oooh, you cute little sweetheart! What a wonderful smile you have!"<br><br>I saw little Caleb Karpowitz, at about six months of age, perched on a table during a church meeting recently, safely held by his mother, trying to engage his neighbor, the Sunday School president, as if he were saying, "Do you want to play with me? Do you want to talk back and forth with me in smiles and lifted eyebrows and noises?"<br><br>Now let's expand the concept. Perhaps the process of synchrony continues throughout life, as some researchers suggest, in conversation, sharing experiences, in whatever we mean when we speak of "connecting" with someone or "staying in touch." Perhaps in order to continue a certain depth of attachment, people have a need to continue to experience synchrony. One Sunday after my church meetings, I spread myself and the Sunday newspaper on the floor to read the comic strips. At the same time, my son, then about four, wanted my attention to show me something he could do. I barely looked up from the paper and continued to read. Being a smart boy with initiative, he walked over and laid down in the middle of my paper with a large grin on his face about two inches from mine, determined that he was going to get the attention he wanted. It was a simple act for a trusting young child, but it is not so simple for a teenager.<br><br>So what happens when we get "out of synch" with our adolescent, when we haven't "danced" with him long enough to know how he is really feeling? It is a natural age of some disengagement from parents on his part and, coincidentally, a time when parents are often in a very busy part of their own life cycle. So parents may "lose touch" with their teenagers. Moreover, it is a time that, research shows, is most sensitive for the disruption of religious faith. Indeed, research in the LDS Church shows that the time period in which we are most likely to lose young people from activity in church is around the ages of fourteen and fifteen. Now, what happens when busy parents and busy children, out of synch with one another, "collide" on the subject of religion? If parents are punishing and controlling at a time when their adolescent may be feeling hurt because of social failures, Mom and Dad's lack of understanding may emphasize a decision that "I can't talk to them. They don't care about me, they just care how it looks to others if I miss church." Well, you can see my point.<br><br>Psychologists have found that adolescents in so-called corporate families, in which their fathers were deeply absorbed in their careers in a corporation, often saw Dad as too physically exhausted or emotionally drained to play an active part in the family. They described him as "passive, uninvolved, disinterested, and remote." And the adolescents resented the corporation that had taken their father from them (see Thomas P. Gullotta, Scott J. Stevens, Kevin C. Donohue, and S. Victoria Clark, "Adolescents in Corporate Families,"<i>Adolescence</i>16 [1981]: 621–28).<br><br>It takes no imagination to substitute busy church leader for corporate executive. At the end of a long Sunday, "physically exhausted or emotionally drained" is an apt description. My own children, adolescent or not, could tell you of too many instances in which, to my own chagrin, I have simply not "paid my dues" to understand or be in synch with them. Sometimes I have said something in anger or in an ill-advised attempt to control them, and I almost immediately see my wife wincing as she says to herself, "You bull in a china shop, you're breaking a lot of dishes. You don't know what is going on here, and you don't know what we've already talked about." She moves into damage control mode to protect them and me from further harm.<br><br>What to do? Well, Nietzsche is supposed to have offered one of my favorite quotes: "Love is a long conversation." There is simply no substitute for nonconflict talk time spent together to re-create synchrony, to understand one another, and to learn one another's dance. If for no other reason, it should be one of our chief justifications for the importance of mothers, when they can, to be able to stay home, to be there when each family member comes in and out of the house, to be the constant emotional source of understanding, helping to pull it all together and maintaining synchrony. Research indicates it is so. Girls would rather talk to their mothers when they have a problem, and boys would rather talk to their mothers when they have a problem.<br><br>In a recent church meeting, a mother, after describing her sorrow at their oldest son's disaffection from the Church, explained her daily routine with the youngest child, who is still at home:<br><br><i>I always try to be home from 2:20 to 3 p.m., for that is when my seventeen-year-old son, who is six feet three inches tall, comes home from school. I fix him something to eat and we sit and talk. I don't do anything else--just sit and listen. He tells me about his day at school, his joys and sorrows and frustrations. I tell him how much I love and appreciate him. He then goes on with his schoolwork peaceful and contented.</i><br><br>If we ignore our children and do not give them the attention that they need to feel they are "in synch" with us, they may either increase their efforts in good ways to get attention or get attention by doing bad things or, worse still, "wall off," give up, and no longer seek our attention, feeling alienated from us. If a power conflict develops, each party to the conflict is gradually more and more likely to gravitate to using as a weapon the values that mean the most to the other. Parents ground the sixteen-year-old from the car and his friends. The sixteen-year-old? Yup, you guessed it. He boycotts church.<br><br>Some years ago following a talk I gave about the concept of faith, I was approached by an older gentleman. I'll try to paraphrase his observation:<br><br><i>You know, young man, I've lived a long time, and I've learned that there are only so many things that you can get done with the time that you have. You have to choose carefully where you are going to put your energies. You've said some nice things tonight about using faith to accomplish worthwhile goals, like learning to play the piano. But you didn't talk at all about faith in Christ.</i><br><br>I hope I never forget how stunned I felt. I think of the Pharisees' meticulous care in observing the law while all along failing to recognize the Christ. The whole aim of tradition, of religious culture, is to point our souls to Christ. In our parenting, if we teach only morals, or church activity, or cultural tradition, we will have fallen terribly short of what must be our goal--to teach our children faith in Christ, that they will turn to him for salvation. For it is he, after all, not us, that will write his law in their hearts. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>M.

<h1>Heeded Them Not” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, President Lee. I am a friend of BYU. I love BYU. Sister Porter and I were here more years ago than I would like to say, other than to tell you that we have grandchildren who are now seeking to enter BYU, so that will give you some impression of how much time has passed. Our love for this institution has never wavered.<br><br>One reason for that came to mind as I sat here watching you arrive today. There is a goodness about you that can be felt as one sits here and looks into your faces and listens to the marvelous music we've just heard. I like to return to this campus.<br><br>You can tell a great deal about a community, a nation, or a civilization by noting on whom they shower fame, wealth, and influence. Have you ever thought about that?<br><br>In a letter to John Adams on October 28, 1813, Thomas Jefferson said:<br><br><i>There is a natural aristocracy among men. The grounds of this are virtue and talents. . . . There is also an artificial aristocracy, founded on wealth and birth, without either virtue or talents.</i>[Adrienne Koch and William Peden, eds.,<i>The Life and Selected Writings of Thomas Jefferson</i>(New York: Random House, 1993), p. 579]<br><br>President David O. McKay, speaking in the October general conference of 1949, said there would come a time "when nobility of character [would] be recognized as being greater than intellect" ("The Sunday School Looks Forward,"<i>Improvement Era,</i>December 1949, p. 863). My hope is that even sooner, nobility of character will be recognized as being greater than outstanding athletic or musical or acting ability. Please do not misunderstand. It is to be devoutly wished that you leave here highly skilled in music, business, science, drama, the law, athletics, history, or in whatever your chosen field may be. But, I ask you, what of virtue? I use that term this morning in its broadest meaning, "a moral excellence in all aspects of one's life." Consider for a moment: Who is it in your heart of hearts that you honor? Who is permitted a place in that sacred sanctuary that is your personal hall of fame?<br><br>For many years I have engaged in a series of educational experiments. I have asked friends and associates, even casual seat partners on airplanes, "Who is the greatest person you have ever met?" Some have answered quickly, and others have pondered for a considerable time. When they have named someone, I have always followed with another question. "What is there about this person that has caused you to feel this way?"<br><br>As they begin to describe attributes, I have been able to learn much that is important about the person speaking. It has helped me to understand what characteristics the speaker feels deeply about. And, as you can appreciate, these conversations have often led to discussions about the Lord's plan of happiness.<br><br>It is my suggestion that you try it on yourself some Sunday afternoon when you have uninterrupted time to think and ponder. Just ask yourself what it is about the person you admire most that causes you to admire him or her. As you ponder these qualities, you will learn some things about yourself.<br><br>There is a companion question that should be asked: Who is it that has influenced you the most, but whom you have never met? That broadens the horizon considerably.<br><br>Samuel the Lamanite, in speaking to the Nephites, asked a question: "Yea, how long will ye suffer yourselves to be led by foolish and blind guides?" (Helaman 13:29). I wonder how many of us today permit ourselves to be led by foolish and blind guides?<br><br>Is there some way to test the guides in our lives? The answer is obviously yes. There is a test, and it has many names. In the scriptures it is called the plan of happiness, the plan of redemption, the plan of salvation, the great plan of the Eternal God. Each of these names has been taken from the scriptures, and there are at least that many more names in the scriptures, all referring to one plan that exists for the eternal happiness of men and women. Our lives need order, and order requires a plan. The Father of us all has given us one. The plan says, among other things, that there was a premortal existence,<i>and each if us was there.</i>Agency is part of that eternal plan, as is the fall of man and the atoning sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>The plan tells us that the individual survives the grave and there is a spirit world, a judgment, and a resurrection. There is a concept involving the plan that Alma teaches, which I sincerely wish Sister Porter and I had understood as we left this institution so many years ago. It would have been so much easier to raise our children.<br><br>Those of you who are parents, and all of you who are going to be parents, take note. I read from the words of Alma:<br><br><i>Therefore God gave unto them commandments, after having made known unto them the plan of redemption, that they should not do evil, the penalty thereof being a second death, which was an everlasting death as to things pertaining unto righteousness.</i>[Alma 12:32]<br><br>Why do I wish we had known it? I suppose in a sense we did, but it would have been helpful if we'd had a better concept. Let me suggest to you that when the day comes that you tell your teenagers they cannot stay out at night as late as they wish with whomsoever they wish, stop and explain the plan of happiness. Tell them that parents must do their duty, and give them commandments after explaining the plan. Teach them that a very important part of the plan is the law of chastity, the violation of which has eternal consequences, including "an everlasting death as to things pertaining unto righteousness." Of course, there is also a law of repentance that is part of the plan of happiness. Help your children understand that the cost of sin is enormous to the offender and to the Savior. Further, it is my deep conviction that there are few, if any, in this group today who totally understand the mortal and eternal consequences of the violation of God's commands in relation to the law of chastity. It is very difficult because Satan has largely convinced this world that its violation is of no serious consequence.<br><br>Brother Rodney Turner wrote with great insight about our times when he said:<br><br><i>Our moral environment is far more polluted than our physical environment. It seems as though good and evil are being homogenized out of existence by a generation largely led by "foolish and blind guides" (Hel. 13:29). What was once whispered in shame is now electronically shouted from the housetops as the famous and the foolish appear on television to parade their sins, like so many medals, before laughing, applauding audiences. Every aspect of modern communication seems to have been appropriated by Satan to legitimize the everlastingly illegitimate. It is imperative that Latter-day Saints view these times from a gospel perspective and follow the counsel of our prophet by taking warning from the teachings--and the fate--of an earlier generation of Americans, the Nephites.</i>[Rodney Turner, "Morality and Marriage in the Book of Mormon,"<i>The Book of Mormon: Jacob Through Words of Mormon, To Learn with Joy,</i>Papers from the Fourth Annual Book of Mormon Symposium (Provo: Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University, 1990), p. 272]<br><br>Should not a warning voice be raised about whom you permit to enter that sacred place in your personal hall of fame? If you desire to cultivate virtue in your life, should you not choose carefully whom you permit in that personal sanctuary? Should they be more than talented in the arts or in athletics or in the professions?<br><br>Tevye in<i>Fiddler on the Roof</i>taught a marvelous principle. You'll recall he sang a song entitled "If I Were a Rich Man." He expressed the thought that he would like to be rich so people would come to him for advice. Then Tevye says, "It won't make one bit of difference if I answer right or wrong. When you're rich, they think you really know." It is important to understand that everything said, written, sung, or insinuated by the wealthy or famous is not necessarily so. Surely all of us here are on a quest for virtue in our lives. I ask the question again: Should we not choose carefully whom we will open our hearts and minds to?<br><br>Brother Truman Madsen opened a door of enlightenment as he concluded his excellent work on the life of President B. H. Roberts. You'll recall the book is entitled<i>Defender of the Faith.</i>In that book, he quoted President Roberts as he described<br><br><i>the quality that linked him [Brigham Young] to God; that added in large measure the strength and wisdom of God to his own strength and wisdom. . . . The man</i>[or woman]<i>who so walks in the light and wisdom and power of God, will at the last, by the very force of association, make the light and wisdom and power of God his own--weaving those bright rays into a chain divine, linking himself forever to God and God to him. . . . Beyond this human greatness cannot achieve.</i>[Truman Madsen, ed.,<i>Defender of the Faith: The B. H. Roberts Story</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1980), p. 390]<br><br>Is it not clear that he who walks in the wickedness and depravity of Lucifer, even if only in the mind, also weaves those dark rays into a chain that will bind him? One whose mind is saturated, even intermittently, with wicked or pornographic thoughts will find when he seeks to escape that he has forged a formidable chain indeed.<br><br>We, here on this campus and as members of the Church, hear the prophets speak, and we come away determined to do what we already knew was right, the correctness of which has been brought to our attention one more time by the prophets. This is truly life's struggle. There are a few who will help us, but there seem to be many who will make light of our efforts and seek to shame us for simply trying to do the right thing.<br><br>There are ways to protect ourselves. Bruce Hafen asked the following question:<br><br><i>Have we really comprehended how the devil operates? Lehi's vision of the great and spacious building, for example, tells us graphically that the one main weapon used by the wicked is mocking and derision. . . . When you know your opponent's play book, it's a lot easier to plan your defense.</i>[Bruce Hafen, "J. Reuben Clark,"<i>BYU Today,</i>September 1988, p. 22]<br><br>President Ezra Taft Benson gave us great insight on Satan's playbook and on the Savior's playbook when he told us that "the Book of Mormon was written for us today" (<i>CR,</i>April 1975, p. 94). Referring to the Nephites, he said those people never had the book. "God, who knows the end from the beginning, told him [Mormon] what to [put in the book] that we would need for our day" (ibid .). Each time you read the Book of Mormon, why don't you say to yourself, "Why did the Lord have Mormon put that particular information in the book?"<br><br>For instance, let's review part of Lehi's dream and see if we cannot find where the Lord has given us an answer to one of life's severe challenges.<br><br><i>And I beheld a rod of iron, and it extended along the bank of the river, and led to the tree by which I stood.</i><br><br><i>And I also beheld a strait and narrow path, which came along by the rod of iron, even to the tree by which I stood; and it also led by the head of the fountain, unto a large and spacious field, as if it had been a world. . . .</i><br><br><i>And I also cast my eyes round about, and beheld, on the other side of the river of water, a great and spacious building; and it stood as it were in the air, high above the earth.</i><br><br><i>And it was filled with people, both old and young, both male and female; and their manner of dress was exceedingly fine; and they were in the attitude of mocking and pointing their fingers towards those who had come at and were partaking of the fruit. . . .</i><br><br><i>And great was the multitude that did enter into that strange building. And after they did enter into that building they did point the finger of scorn at me and those that were partaking of the fruit also; but we heeded them not.</i>[1 Nephi 8:19–20, 26–27, 33]<br><br>There, tucked away as a tiny comment, was the answer--simple, clear, and enormously effective: "but we heeded them not." Difficult to do? Yes. Clear to understand? Yes!<br><br>Elder James E. Faust, who spoke at this podium a few months ago, said, in referring to Lucifer: "He is really a coward, and if we stand firm, he will retreat" ("Trying to Serve the Lord Without Offending the Devil,"<i>BYU 1994–95 Devotional and Fireside Speeches</i>[Provo: Brigham Young University, 1995], p. 64).<br><br>Let us continue with another portion of Lehi's dream.<br><br><i>And it came to pass that I saw and bear record, that the great and spacious building was the pride of the world; and it fell, and the fall thereof was exceedingly great. And the angel of the Lord spake unto me again, saying: Thus shall be the destruction of all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, that shall fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</i>[1 Nephi 11:36]<br><br>Brother Hafen was right--when we know our enemy's playbook, we really can plan our defense.<br><br>I ask you to consider with me the response when Lucifer used this very weapon against the boy prophet, who received so much scorn when he simply told the truth about his experience in the Sacred Grove. I quote from the Prophet Joseph:<br><br><i>However, it was nevertheless a fact that I had beheld a vision. I have thought since, that I felt much like Paul, when he made his defense before King Agrippa, and related the account of the vision he had when he saw a light, and heard a voice; but still there were but few who believed him; some said he was dishonest, others said he was mad; and he was ridiculed and reviled. But all this did not destroy the reality of his vision. He had seen a vision, he knew he had, and all the persecution under heaven could not make it otherwise. . . .</i><br><br><i>So it was with me. I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light I saw two Personages, and they did in reality speak to me; and though I was hated and persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision, yet it was true; and while they were persecuting me, reviling me, and speaking all manner of evil against me falsely for so saying, I was led to say in my heart: Why persecute me for telling the truth? I have actually seen a vision; and who am I that I can withstand God, or why does the world think to make me deny what I have actually seen? For I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it; at least I knew that by so doing I would offend God, and come under condemnation.</i>[JS--H 1:24–25]<br><br>Did it bring the Prophet pain? Of course it did. What did he do? He continued with the work of the Restoration. Though the scorn was very painful, he "heeded them not" (1 Nephi 8:33).<br><br>Now, I have to point out to you something you know very well. There is fear in each human heart. Satan plays upon our feelings of inadequacy. We are all vulnerable, and when scorn comes, we feel it deeply. Even Moroni shares his concern over this very human malady when he says:<br><br><i>Thou hast also made our words powerful and great, even that we cannot write them; wherefore, when we write we behold our weakness, and stumble because of the placing of our words; and</i>I fear<i>lest the Gentiles shall mock at our words.</i><br><br><i>And when I had said this, the Lord spake unto me, saying: Fools mock, but they shall mourn; and my grace is sufficient for the meek.</i>[Ether 12:25–27; emphasis added]<br><br>Do the Gentiles--and do some of us who consider ourselves other than Gentiles--mock the words of Moroni? I fear we do, on occasion. I'd ask those faithful missionaries who have stood as witnesses across the earth about the reaction of the world, generally, to the words of Moroni.<br><br>The wicked heap scorn when they have no other weapons to use--and too often the righteous run for cover--especially if the mocker can run fast or jump high or sing well or has high-profile degrees or a great deal of money, even if each or all have nothing to do with the subject at hand.<br><br>For instance, we voted here in Utah some months ago on whether we wanted to permit gambling at our horse-racing events. During that time a well-known actor, and one for whom I have deep respect as an actor, came on the TV screen deriding those of us who were going to let some "church" tell us what to do. He suggested that those who voted against permitting the gambling were simply following Church leaders without thinking. It was not mature of us to let prophets suggest how we should vote, but if we were convinced by the actor's viewpoint, we were obviously thinking for ourselves.<br><br>I ask you, what are the rewards of standing fast in our own virtue--even against the scorn of the world? They are far more monumental than one might think. Let us share together the experience of Nephi, the son of Helaman and the brother of Lehi. Nephi was suffering depression and discouragement in the building of the kingdom. The Lord spoke to him and said:<br><br><i>Blessed art thou, Nephi, for those things which thou hast done; for I have beheld how thou hast with unwearyingness declared the word, which I have given unto thee, unto this people.</i>And thou hast not feared them,<i>and hast not sought thine own life, but hast sought my will, and to keep my commandments.</i><br><br><i>And now, because thou hast done this with such unwearyingness, behold, I will bless thee forever; and I will make thee mighty in word and in deed, in faith and in works; yea, even that all things shall be done unto thee according to thy word, for thou shalt not ask that which is contrary to my will.</i><br><br><i>Behold, thou art Nephi, and I am God.</i>[Helaman 10:4–6; emphasis added]<br><br>Because Nephi had stood for truth and virtue, without fear of the world, the Lord told him that he would bless him forever, that he would make him mighty in word, deeds, faith, and works. No blessing that came to Nephi will be denied anyone in this dispensation who will give the same devotion, the same commitment, to the Lord and to his work.<br><br>Now what I guess I'm leading up to is this: Among those honorable enough to be in your private hall of fame, let there be the prophets of God, particularly the living prophets of God.<br><br>The Lord has placed prophets in the land. They speak the truth. On whatever subject the prophets choose to speak, LISTEN. Listen with your ears, with your minds, and with your hearts. Do not analyze their mortal preparation to speak upon the subject. That's not where their strength comes from. It is the power of God coupled with his call to them that qualifies them to speak--on any subject. The united voice of the First Presidency and the Twelve will never, never, never lead us astray.<br><br>What is it that hinders us from absorbing into our very beings the words of the prophets? Could it be that we do not believe them? I think that for most of us here today that is not the problem. Is it that we think they are talking to someone else? Possibly.<br><br>Might it be "I wonder what others will think of me if I follow them?" After all, the prophets are not always politically correct.<br><br>Let us be honest. Is this not often the real problem?<br><br>I was fighting a personal battle one day some years ago trying to be popular with everybody. Did you know that's dangerous-- trying to be popular with everybody? Well, I was doing that. In the midst of my pain, a thought came to me. Its impact really was substantial. The thought was this: "Most people in this world do not care what you think." Speaking to myself: "They do not care what happens to you. Only YOU will remember this unhappy experience a few months or weeks or days or even hours from now. Furthermore, the people who are respected by you are, by the very nature of things, unpopular with the people who raise the finger of scorn at you." That was a big day in my life. You might want to ponder that experience. We simply must not be afraid to stand, even if it is quietly, in defense of virtue. We must understand that there really are two forces warring for mankind and that we cannot be in both camps. You cannot be popular with everybody. You can't have one foot in each camp.<br><br>Follow the prophets as they lead us in God's plan of happiness! In the process expect the scorn of the world. Decide in advance how you are going to handle it, for it most surely will come. Now, beware of those whom the world loves and showers with fame and fortune. They are often unreliable guides in your quest for virtue.<br><br>It is necessary that each of us individually obtain a witness that God the Father is real and that there is a living Savior. If it takes a little while, be patient--continue to study the scriptures, pray over your desires to know, and be obedient to the commands of God. It will come in the Lord's time by the power of the Spirit to your spirit; and when it comes, it will come with certainty, sureness, confidence, and peace.<br><br>Now we have to recognize this, that when it does come, with the receipt of that testimony comes the obligation to bear witness to the world of the Lord and his work. Part of the covenant we made in the waters of baptism is that we would "stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that [we] may be in, even until death" (Mosiah 18:9). From what may be a passive peace in our knowledge of these things, there must eventually come an active witness if we are to be happy.<br><br>Alma spoke those marvelous words that we sing and hear often, and love: "Oh, That I Were An Angel." Listen carefully to why Alma wanted to be an angel.<br><br><i>O that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart, that I might go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake the earth, and cry repentance unto every people!</i><br><br><i>Yea, I would declare unto every soul, as with the voice of thunder, repentance and the plan of redemption, that they should repent and come unto our God, that there might not be more sorrow upon all the face of the earth.</i>[Alma 29:1–2]<br><br>You see, we don't proselyte in this Church just to make the Church larger. We proselyte to make the person larger--more whole, more complete, more certain in the knowledge that there are eternal things. We bring the power of the atoning blood of Jesus Christ through the ordinances so that eternal blessings can come and also that "there might not be more sorrow upon all the face of the earth." We err when we count this Church's progress through numbers only.<br><br>Earlier I referred to the outstanding address given here last November by Elder James E. Faust at this pulpit. I'd like to quote another paragraph. He said:<br><br><i>I wonder how much we offend Satan if the proclamation of our faith is limited only to the great humanitarian work this Church does throughout the world, or to our beautiful buildings, or to this great university, marvelous as these activities are. When we preach the gospel of social justice, no doubt the devil is not troubled. But I believe the devil is terribly offended when we boldly declare by personal testimony that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God and that he saw the Father and the Son; when we preach that the Book of Mormon is another witness for Christ; when we declare that there has been a restoration of the fullness of the gospel in its simplicity and power in order to fulfill the great plan of happiness.</i><br><br><i>We challenge the powers of darkness when we speak of the perfect life of the Savior and of his sublime work for all mankind through the Atonement.</i>[Faust, "Trying to Serve," p. 63]<br><br>Are we fence straddlers? I suppose it is one's right to be a fence straddler, but I'd suggest that he then should not assume that he knows very much of the important nature of this work. He or she may have been born in the Church, have attended Primary and seminary and all of the other activities made available to us, yet have remained a fence straddler into adulthood. If one has chosen that course, he at least should have the courage to admit that he's never joined the fray, has never battled as a witness that there is a God and that his Son is our Savior and the Redeemer of the world. Let him, then, not assume that he can speak with any certainty on the subject of the Sacred Grove and Moroni and the plates of Nephi. Knowledge by itself has never been conviction.<br><br>Now, we are not without support when we throw ourselves into the battle to establish the great plan of the Eternal God in our personal lives. Let me share an example of what I mean. I quote from Brigham Young:<br><br><i>You that have not passed through the trials, and persecutions, and drivings, with this people, from the beginning, but have only read of them, or heard some of them related, may think how awful they were to endure, and wonder that the Saints survived them at all. The thought of it makes your hearts sink within you, your brains reel, and your bodies tremble, and you are ready to exclaim, "I could not have endured it." I have been in the heat of it, and I never felt better in all my life; I never felt the peace and power of the Almighty more copiously poured upon me than in the keenest part of our trials. They appeared</i>[as]<i>nothing to me.</i>[<i>JD</i>1:313]<br><br>Well, are the days of sacrifice over? Certainly not. The missionaries who scatter across the earth have left behind school, family, occupations, friends, fiancées and fiancés, scholarships, and more. Are the blessings attached to personal sacrifice over? Most certainly not! Any devoted mother who nurtures her little ones knows something of sacrifice. Any father who struggles to support and to teach his children knows something of sacrifice. Everyone who gives diligent effort in Church service or service to his fellowman experiences the blessings that come from sacrifice. But we must recognize that there is a price, and so often the price is opposition from the world.<br><br>Fourteen days after the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, Willard Richards and John Taylor, who were with them in the jail at Carthage at the time of the attack, wrote a letter to the president of the British Mission. It is very applicable to us.<br><br>It is in this period<i>of time that we are permitted</i>to live.<i>It is at the dawning of that day of days in which our heavenly Father is about to usher in that glorious period when times and seasons shall be changed and earth renewed, when after rumors and commotions, turmoils, strife, confusion, blood and slaughter, the sword shall be beaten into ploughshares, and peace and truth triumphantly prevail o'er all the footstool of Jehovah. The day of these events has dawned, although to human view a cloud has o'erspread the horizon.</i>[<i>HC</i>7:172; emphasis added]<br><br>That day is here. That day is now. My beloved young people, place sentinels by the entrance to your personal hall of fame. Let no one be honored there who is not worthy of your highest respect and emulation. I might suggest to you that the highest positions of honor might be given to our Father in Heaven; to his Son, our Savior and Redeemer; then to the prophets, particularly the Prophet Joseph and the living prophets--because they have given and sustained, through worthy lives, the great plan of happiness devised by our Eternal Father. Learn the plan. Live it. Testify of it, and expect the scorn of the world. When you do, you will find the "peace and power of the Almighty more copiously poured" out upon you.<br><br>I bear my personal witness to you that there is a God in Heaven. He is real. He exists. I bear witness that his Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, was born in the flesh, that he literally walked forth from the tomb, inhabiting that body which hung upon the cross. I bear testimony to you that they love us and desire for us only happiness, and the process of happiness has been given to us by them in a plan. When we find ourselves in opposition to the plan, we can expect for certainty the tragedy and the sorrow to follow. I bear witness to you that the Lord Jesus Christ lives this very instant and directs his living prophets on the earth today, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>L.

<h1> Learn—Go Forth to Serve - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As you enter the BYU campus, prominently displayed is the challenge "Enter to Learn--Go Forth to Serve." This challenge not only applies to BYU students but could apply to others as well. It would also be appropriate and correct to say this challenge represents the purpose of our mortal experience.<br><br>I would imagine all of us have moments when we sit, ponder, and meditate on who we are and how we are spending the time the Lord has allocated to us. Tonight I want each of you to think about where you are in the grand design that is unfolding before you. The desired objective of our evening of reasoning together is that we may all commit to spending time each day, each week, each year to check the course we have charted for ourselves.<br><br>You have arrived at that exciting time in life when so many major decisions must be made. For some, there is the preparation for a full-time mission; for others, the selection of educational pursuits, the contemplation of marriage, and the charting of a career path. All of these are challenging decisions. We must be certain that each decision we make will lead us to that ultimate goal--the one and only destination that will give us lasting peace and joy--that of life eternal.<br><br>A recent<i>Church News</i>"Viewpoint" makes this statement:<br><br><i>We have many goals, but the most important is to gain eternal life. The teachings if the Savior and His prophets and apostles bear this solemn message: There is no royal road to exaltation.</i><br><br><i>Through the Savior's atoning sacrifice and resurrection, we already have the gift if immortality; all of us will be resurrected from the grave. The journey from that point onward, however, depends on what we do in this life.</i>["No Royal Road,"<i>Church News,</i>28 January 1995, p. 16]<br><br>I guess it is no surprise to the membership of the Church that the General Authorities spend a great deal of time on airplanes. The Church is now worldwide. Stake centers dot the landscape of many nations. I have had the opportunity of visiting with many airline pilots, and I am always amazed as I look into the cockpit how many switches, lights, displays, and controls are necessary to fly the plane. I entered into a discussion with a pilot regarding what could happen if he deviated from the flight plan. I proposed deviating just one degree from the charted course. His reply astonished me. He said for every one-degree variance from the plan, you would miss your charted destination by one mile for every sixty miles you were flying. This would mean that in a flight from Salt Lake to Denver, you would land in downtown Denver rather than at the airport. On a flight from Salt Lake to Chicago, you would miss the airport and land in Lake Michigan. Going from Salt Lake to New York, you would miss Kennedy Airport and land in the Hudson River. Going to London, you wouldn't even make England--you would land somewhere in France.<br><br>You can see that a deviation from a flight plan of several degrees would take you totally off course. The pilot explained to me that, obviously, the faster the error is discovered, the easier it is to return to the filed flight plan. If the correction is delayed for a long time, it is very difficult to find the way back because of flight traffic, weather, visibility, and so on. The charted course would be so far away that it would be almost impossible to reach the intended destination. My visit with the pilot gave me no comfort, but it did cause me to think of how the flight plan parallels the direction we chart for our life's experience.<br><br>We are here in mortality experiencing a great adventure. Each of us must chart our own course and follow the plan to determine our final destination. With our understanding of the gospel, it should be easy to determine, for the way has been marked for us by the Savior. In the Sermon on the Mount, the Savior said:<br><br><i>Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:</i><br><br><i>Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.</i>[Matthew 7:13–14]<br><br>Repeatedly the scriptures tell us there is only one course to eternal life. The Savior, in the Upper Room on the evening of the Last Supper, was bidding a tender farewell to his apostles when he told them:<br><br><i>In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.</i><br><br><i>And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.</i>[John 14:2–3]<br><br>The apostle Thomas said, "Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?"<br><br>The Savior's answer was simple and clear: "I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me" (John 14:5–6).<br><br>How fortunate we are to know the Lord's plan for us. He has marked the path that will bring us back to his presence.<br><br>If the path is so clearly marked, why is it that so many deviate from it, thus making it impossible to reach their hoped-for destination?<br><br>The road to exaltation and life with our Heavenly Father is strewn with hazards of various kinds. There are tribulations--some brief, and others prolonged. Temptations lie in wait at curves, forks, and intersections. Whether or not we succumb to temptation and stray from our course is determined by how firmly we are committed to reaching our goal.<br><br>The Book of Mormon tells us about Lehi and the vision of life he saw. By holding to a rod of iron, people were able to reach the tree and taste the fruit, which was sweet and most desirable above all other fruit. Lehi then reported:<br><br><i>And I also cast my eyes round about, and beheld, on the other side of the river of water, a great and spacious building; and it stood as it were in the air, high above the earth.</i><br><br><i>And it was filled with people, both old and young, both male and female; and their manner of dress was exceedingly fine; and they were in the attitude of mocking and pointing their fingers towards those who had come at and were partaking of the fruit.</i><br><br><i>And after they had tasted of the fruit they were ashamed, because of those that were scoffing at them; and they fell away into forbidden paths and were lost.</i>[1 Nephi 8:26–28]<br><br>If we hope to arrive at the destination we seek on our journey through life, we must learn to ignore the gibes and ridicule of so-called friends. We need to turn a deaf ear to suggestions to follow the "easier and more pleasant route" pointed out by those who profess to know more than the Lord's apostles and prophets.<br><br>As Nephi counseled:<br><br><i>Wherefore, I, Nephi, did exhort them to give heed unto the word of the Lord; yea, I did exhort them with all the energies of my soul, and with all the faculty which I possessed, that they would give heed to the word of God and remember to keep his commandments always in all things.</i>[1 Nephi 15:25]<br><br>One marker on the course to eternal life is the challenge "Enter to Learn--Go Forth to Serve."<br><br>To remain on the course, we must first learn all we can about the "strait and narrow way" we must follow. The Lord has revealed the plan of life for his children to his prophets throughout the ages. President Kimball counseled us:<br><br><i>I am grateful that you and all of us have the gospel of Jesus Christ as a guide, so that we have a framework of understanding into which we can fit the events and circumstances that we will live to see. It is clear from the scriptures that we in this part of our dispensation cannot be promised by our political leaders that there will be "peace in our time," but we, as church members, are given the means of having a personal peace, of coming to know serenity in our souls--even when there is no peace without!</i><br><br><i>By now you are perhaps accustomed to having those of us who are further along the pathway of life describe to you the importance of staying on the "strait and narrow" path. So often we say many of the same things to you again and again, but if you reflect upon why that is so, you will soon discover that the precipices that lie on each side of that narrow path don't change or become less dangerous; the steepness of that path does not change.</i>[<i>President Kimball Speaks Out</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1981), p. 89]<br><br>Without waiting to find out the true meaning of life, many young people jump to conclusions and embark on their life journey unprepared. They follow the traffic without a road map, and, not surprisingly, all they find along the way is disappointment. What do you need to learn before you go forth to serve?<br><br>The scriptures tell us that "it is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance" (D&amp;amp;C 131:6). This principle is greatly misunderstood. Elder John A. Widtsoe wrote:<br><br><i>There are of course many kinds of knowledge; some of lesser, some of higher value. When Joseph Smith said that a man cannot be saved in ignorance, he meant naturally ignorance of the laws which all together lead to salvation. Such knowledge is of the highest value. It should be sought after first. Then other kinds of knowledge may be added to support and amplify the more direct knowledge of spiritual law. For example, it is a duty of the Church to preach the gospel to all the world. This however requires the aid of railroads, steamships, printing presses, and a multitude of other things that make up our civilization. A knowledge of the gospel is the missionary's first need, but the other needs, though lesser, help him perform better the divine injunction to teach the gospel to all people.</i>[<i>Evidences and Reconciliations,</i>arr. G. Homer Durham (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1987), p. 224]<br><br>Of course, today we require knowledge about passenger jets, computers, satellite communications, and so on, but Elder Widtsoe's point still holds. What he inferred is there must needs be an order to our learning, the same order indicated by the Savior's teaching: "But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you" (Matthew 6:33). Learning about sacred things should come first, providing a context and a need for secular learning. If we want to return to our Heavenly Father's presence, our first priority should be to learn about his ways and his plan.<br><br>The world might fool you into believing there is insufficient time to engage in both spiritual and secular learning. I warn you not to be deceived by these philosophies of men. Your learning about sacred things will facilitate, even accelerate your secular learning. President John Taylor said:<br><br><i>Man, by philosophy and the exercise of his natural intelligence, may gain an understanding, to some extent, of the laws of Nature; but to comprehend God, heavenly wisdom and intelligence are necessary. Earthly and heavenly philosophy are two different things, and it is folly for men to base their arguments upon earthly philosophy in trying to unravel the mysteries of the kingdom of God.</i>[<i>JD</i>14:191]<br><br>If we provide a spiritual foundation for our secular learning, not only will we better understand the laws of nature, we can gain a deeper understanding about art, languages, technology, medicine, law, and human behavior never before imagined possible. We can see the world around us and understand it through God's eyes.<br><br>The story of King Solomon tells us that we can ask the Lord for understanding. When Solomon was in Gibeon, the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said: "Ask what I shall give thee" (l Kings 3:5). Solomon, feeling overwhelmed and under-prepared for his new responsibilities as king, told the Lord: "I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in" (verse 7). Therefore, he asked the Lord for "an understanding heart to judge" the people (verse 9). We read in 1 Kings 3:10 that the Lord was pleased with Solomon's request. He answered Solomon:<br><br><i>Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;</i><br><br><i>Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.</i>[verses 11–12]<br><br>Talk about accelerated learning programs. Do not underestimate the Lord's power and his willingness to bless your lives if you ask with a sincere heart and real intent. He has instructional designs and learning theories that the world's educational psychologists haven't even imagined yet.<br><br>Although the gift of mortal life offers a relatively brief period of time to learn of God and his ways, we have the eternities to learn of the universe and all the things therein and to accumulate secular knowledge. President Spencer W. Kimball taught us that one of the several blessings of exaltation is an infinite amount of time to learn about secular things--so be patient, my young friends. President Kimball said:<br><br><i>After death we continue to learn. Exaltation means godhood, creatorship. "As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may be." (Eliza R. Snow Smith,</i>Biography of Lorenzo Snow<i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret News Co., 1884], p. 46.) This is in the future. It is obvious that before one can take of the materials in existence and develop them into a world like our own, he must be master of geology, zoology, physiology, psychology, and all the others. It is obvious, also, that no soul can in his short mortal life acquire all this knowledge and master all these sciences, but he can make a beginning and with the foundation of spiritual life and controls and mastery, and with the authorities and powers received through the gospel of Christ, he is in a position to begin this almost limitless study of the secular.</i>[<i>TSWK,</i>p. 53]<br><br>So never worry about the time it takes to learn of spiritual things. It is time well spent. It provides a foundation for secular learning. Indeed, the Lord will bless you if you trust in him and learn about his eternal plan, first. And the eternities offer an infinite amount of time to acquire secular knowledge. We are talking about a widening, not a narrowing window of opportunity to learn if we attend to first things first.<br><br>President Kimball further states:<br><br><i>Now this mortal life is the time to prepare to meet God, which is our first responsibility. Having already obtained our bodies, which become the permanent tabernacles for our spirits through the eternities, now we are to train our bodies, our minds, and our spirits. Preeminent, then, is our using this life to perfect ourselves, to subjugate the flesh, to subject the body to the spirit, to overcome all weaknesses, to govern self so that one may give leadership to others, and to perform all necessary ordinances. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . After our feet are set firmly on the path to eternal life we can amass more knowledge of the secular things.</i><br><br><i>. . . A highly trained scientist who is also a perfected man may create a world and people it, but a dissolute, unrepentant, unbelieving one will never be such a creator even in the eternities.</i><br><br><i>Secular knowledge, important as it may be, can never save a soul nor open the celestial kingdom nor create a world nor make a man a god, but it can be most helpful to that man who, placing first things first, has found the way to eternal life and who can now bring into play all knowledge to be his tool and servant.</i>[<i>President Kimball Speaks Out,</i>pp. 90–92]<br><br>After we learn all we can about the course we must follow and have proceeded on the path to gain eternal life, we have an obligation to others of our Father in Heaven's children who need help. Gaining a knowledge of God's plan leads to many consequences, one of the more profound being an incredible sense of incurred debt to the God of this world, Jesus Christ. The plan of salvation balances on the need for a redeemer. Jesus Christ performed this role. He atoned for our sins, and, in the words of Isaiah and Peter, "with his stripes we are healed" (Isaiah 53:5; see also 1 Peter 2:24).<br><br>The apostle Paul felt deeply this sense of incurred debt when he wrote his letter to the Romans: "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service" (Romans 12:1).<br><br>Paul identified here a fundamental aspect of service. We serve from a sense of gratitude to the Lord for the blessings he has provided us. Moreover, we must remember that the greatest blessing of all is that he suffered, bled, and died to fulfill the great plan of happiness--a plan designed and executed for us, that we might return with him into the presence of the Father. It was an understanding of this pivotal idea that led King Benjamin to say, "I say, if ye should serve him with all your whole souls yet ye would be unprofitable servants" (Mosiah 2:21).<br><br>How do we serve him who made it possible for us to gain eternal life? Again, King Benjamin provided the answer when he counseled the people, "When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God" (Mosiah 2:17).<br><br>The Book of Mormon provides several examples of men who understood the fundamental equality that explains so much of our purpose in life, namely, service to fellowmen equals service to God. King Benjamin, of course, was one of the more profound examples of service to God and man. As he told his people, "And even I, myself, have labored with mine own hands that I might serve you" (Mosiah 2:14). King Benjamin chose to be taught the plan of salvation. Then he went forth and served.<br><br>Perhaps an even more dramatic example of how the spirit of service consumes those who learn and understand God's plan is the story of Alma, the son of Alma. We know that during Alma's youth, he and the sons of King Mosiah sought to destroy the Church of God. His actions were a full 180 degrees off from the course he should have been following. Then a remarkable event occurred. An angel appeared to Alma and set him and his brethren straight.<br><br>Can you imagine Alma's astonishment? Here he had devoted his life to destroying the Lord's Church and the faith of the people, and then an angel appeared to tell him, "For the Lord hath said: This is my church, and I will establish it; and nothing shall overthrow it, save it is the transgression of my people" (Mosiah 27:13).<br><br>Alma's shock was so great that he was left speechless, literally, and he could not move his hands.<br><br>Alma was taken by those who were with him and laid before his father, Alma, the chief high priest. The priests assembled themselves and fasted and prayed for Alma for two days and nights that his mouth might be opened and he might regain his strength. Their supplication to the Lord was finally answered when Alma the Younger stood before them a changed man and spoke to them. He said:<br><br><i>My soul hath been redeemed from the gall of bitterness and bonds of iniquity. I was in the darkest abyss; but now I behold the marvelous light of God. My soul was racked with eternal torment; but I am snatched, and my soul is pained no more.</i><br><br><i>I rejected my Redeemer, and denied that which had been spoken of by our fathers; but now that they may foresee that he will come, and that he remembereth every creature of his creating, he will make himself manifest unto all.</i>[Mosiah 27:29–30]<br><br>It had been a painful course correction for Alma. He had suffered untold pain and soul-racking torment, but he was back on track. Now it is most interesting what the scriptures record next.<br><br><i>And now it came to pass that Alma began from this time forward to teach the people, and those who were with Alma at the time the angel appeared unto them, traveling round about through all the land, publishing to all the people the things which they had heard and seen, and preaching the word of God in much tribulation, being greatly persecuted by those who were unbelievers, being smitten by many of them. . . .</i><br><br><i>And they traveled throughout all the land of Zarahemla, and among all the people who were under the reign of king Mosiah, zealously striving to repair all the injuries which they had done to the church, confessing all their sins, and publishing all the things which they had seen, and explaining the prophecies and the scriptures to all who desired to hear them.</i><br><br><i>And thus they were instruments in the hands of God in bringing many to the knowledge of the truth, yea, to the knowledge of their Redeemer.</i>[Mosiah 27:32, 35–36]<br><br>After conversion comes the responsibility and obligation to share the knowledge received with others of our Father in Heaven's children. Alma's life was changed, and he became one of the greatest missionaries who ever lived. He taught with power and firsthand knowledge about the plan of redemption. He had learned--at the feet of an angel--then he went forth and served.<br><br>We realize the extent of Alma's conversion to the truth and his resulting desire to serve all God's children when he wrote near the end of his ministry:<br><br><i>O that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart, that I might go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake the earth, and cry repentance unto every people!</i><br><br><i>Yea, I would declare unto every soul, as with the voice of thunder, repentance and the plan of redemption, that they should repent and come unto our God, that there might not be more sorrow upon all the face of the earth.</i>[Alma 29:1–2]<br><br>Alma had come to the point in his understanding of the plan of salvation and service to the Lord where he felt constrained by the reasonable limits of his human body. While he realized it was an unreasonable request, he wanted to do more--he wanted to proclaim the gospel with the voice of the angel who had proclaimed it to him. Feeling in a profound way his debt to the Lord, he wanted to sacrifice much more than all he had to his service.<br><br>There are those among us today that preach the doctrine of "me-ism." They declare that we should think of ourselves first and foremost and above all else. History, however, has taught that selfishness has never brought happiness. An important part of life is serving and sharing. Certainly the soul-satisfying joy of life is leaving a legacy of love and service for others to emulate and enjoy. Bryant S. Hinckley said this about service:<br><br><i>Service is the virtue that distinguished the great of all times and which they will be remembered by. It places a mark if nobility upon its disciples. It is the dividing line which separates the two great groups of the world--those who help and those who hinder, those who lift and those who lean, those who contribute and those who only consume. How much better it is to give than to receive. Service in any form is comely and beautiful. To give encouragement, to impart sympathy, to show interest, to banish fear, to build self confidence and awaken hope in the hearts if others, in short--to love them and to show it--is to render the most precious service.</i>[Quoted by Steven R. Covey,<i>First Things First</i>(New York: Simon and Schuster, 1994), p. 306]<br><br>Friday was a day of deep sorrow for me personally, with the passing of President Howard W. Hunter. We are now separated for a time from a great friend, a great leader, and a great prophet of God. President Hunter was a man of unequaled wisdom. He had an unusual ability to make you feel warm and comfortable in his presence. His courage in facing difficulties has rarely been equaled by any of our Church leaders.<br><br>I remember so clearly the Sunday meeting of the Quorum of the Twelve in the temple on the day following President Benson's funeral. As we arrived, it was clear that this was a different meeting. There was no First Presidency. The three chairs in the front of the room had no occupants. The seating of the Twelve was according to seniority--President Hunter in the first chair, followed by President Hinckley, President Monson, and President Packer, in order, down to the last-called member. President Hunter presided and conducted the meeting. After a song and prayer, President Hunter recited the history of the organization of the First Presidency from the time of Brigham Young to President Benson. During the early changes in the presidency, two or three years elapsed before a new First Presidency was called, and the Church was then under the direction of the Quorum of the Twelve. President Woodruff had instructed President Snow that if he should be called home before President Snow, he should immediately organize the First Presidency. It has followed that pattern since that time.<br><br>President Hunter then asked us what would be our desire. Starting with President Hinckley, we had the opportunity of expressing ourselves. It was unanimous that we should immediately proceed to organize the First Presidency. Then President Hunter asked us what would be our wish. President Hinckley stood and said about these words: "This is the Lord's Church. He is at the head. He selects his prophets by having the person he has designated to lead the Church in position of being the next senior apostle at the passing of the president of the Church." He then said, "The Lord has selected Howard W. Hunter to be the next president." President Hunter then requested that each of us respond.<br><br>It was a very spiritual and moving experience to have each member of the Twelve express agreement with the Lord's system and also express their love and appreciation for President Hunter. As I awaited my turn to respond, I thought of what a marvelous system this is. It would not be possible for the Lord to select his prophet in any other way. It is not left to man. It is left to the Lord. He names the man who will lead his Church. It eliminates all balloting, politicking, or lobbying for the position. It is done in a complete system of order.<br><br>A chair was then brought to the center of the room, and President Hunter was seated in the chair. Then, in order, each of us put our hands on his head, and the next senior apostle, President Hinckley, ordained and set apart Howard W. Hunter as prophet, seer, revelator, and president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. President Hunter then nominated his two counselors, President Hinckley and President Monson. We were then asked to sustain his nomination. Of course, the sustaining was unanimous. Because of President Hunter's inability to stand without supporting himself, he remained seated on the chair in the center of the room, and a short stool was placed at his feet. President Hinckley was then seated on the stool where President Hunter could reach him and set him apart as first counselor and president of the Quorum of the Twelve. Then it was President Monson's turn to be set apart as second counselor, and then President Packer's turn to be set apart as acting president of the Quorum of the Twelve. The whole process took maybe forty-five minutes to an hour, and the Church was ready to move forward under the direction of the Lord's chosen prophet.<br><br>We then had a sacrament song and the sacrament together before leaving the temple to return to our homes. Monday morning the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve gathered at the Church Administration Building for a press conference to announce to the world our prophet. His statement to the press on that day so catches the wisdom, inspiration, and spirit of President Hunter. Among other things, he said:<br><br><i>I have shed many tears and have sought my Father in Heaven in earnest prayer with a desire to be equal to the high and holy calling which is now mine.</i><br><br><i>My greatest strength through these past hours and recent days has been my abiding testimony that this is the work of God and not men, that Jesus Christ is the authorized and living head of this church and he leads it in word and deed. I pledge my life, my strength, and the full measure of my soul to serving Him fully. . . .</i><br><br><i>To the membership of the Church in every country of the world and to people everywhere I extend my love.</i>. . .<i>I pray that we might treat each other with more kindness, more courtesy, more humility and patience and forgiveness.</i>[Quoted by James E. Faust, "The Way of an Eagle,"<i>Ensign,</i>August 1994, p. 2]<br><br>He was such a kind and accommodating man. His hand was extended to all he could possibly reach. I think he knew that he would not preside long, for with all of the strength and power that his frail body could stand, he took assignments and did everything he could to be among the people and serve. It was only when his body completely gave out that he had to stop, and that was only after he could no longer get out of bed.<br><br>Quoting again from his press conference, he issued this great challenge to the Church:<br><br><i>I . . . invite the members of the Church to establish the temple of the Lord as the great symbol of their membership and the supernal setting for their most sacred covenants. It would be the deepest desire of my heart to have every member of the Church be temple worthy. I would hope that every adult member would be worthy of--and carry--a current temple recommend, even if proximity to a temple does not allow immediate or frequent use if it.</i>[Ibid.]<br><br>His call had a dramatic effect on the Church. Temple work greatly increased during the short period of his presiding over the Church.<br><br>I want to leave my witness with you that Howard W. Hunter was indeed a prophet called and selected to serve under the direction of the Lord, our Savior. How I loved him as my friend and my leader. At these moments in history, may it be a time of checking the course we are following. Are we heeding the voice of the prophet? If we find any deviations in our actions, let us make a quick course correction and get back to the path that will lead us to life eternal. Let us<i>Enter to Learn</i>of his great plan that he has for us for the eternities, and then let us<i>Go Forth to Serve,</i>following the great leadership, courage, and enthusiasm of our prophet leaders.<br><br>I bear witness that this is the Lord's Church. He is the head, and we are engaged in his work. This is my witness to you, in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>L. Tom Perry was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 5 March 1995.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>from the Potter and the Clay - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Let me tell you about some people I know. One is a woman who served a full-time mission when it was not fashionable to be a sister missionary. She received no financial support nor spiritual encouragement from her family. Upon returning, she worked her way through college and graduate school, marrying when most considered her rather old. After her children were born, her husband lost his job; he has yet to find permanent employment. However, by taking temporary jobs here and there, including those the family could do together, this woman and her husband have survived financially for several years. The couple serves faithfully in Church callings, finding numerous opportunities to encourage and assist those who are in need. Whenever I visit their relatively small and humble home, I am struck by their simultaneous expressions of gratitude, peace, and joy and their enthusiastic pursuit of knowledge.<br><br>I know another woman who was widowed at age twenty-four, after only three years of marriage. She worked hard to support her young family and eventually became a very successful businesswoman. At the height of her career, as a result of a client's dishonest dealings, she lost her business and any capital to begin again. Today she struggles financially and is learning to live a much simpler lifestyle. However, she considers herself wealthy because she has grandchildren and opportunities to expand her understanding and appreciation of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>What do these two friends of mine have in common? Life has rarely, if ever, been easy for them. It has not been at all what they had expected, nor does it appear that it will become easier in the future. Yet they continue to trust in the Lord.<br><br>Many of you may be feeling great concern as you look to the future. You are often reminded that the most critical decisions in life are made during these, your college years. You hear frantic reports of a diminishing job market, a shrinking marriage market, and expanding competition to get what little there is of each. Fears of losing a scholarship, running out of tuition money, never having a date, and lacking the intellect to complete graduation requirements can keep you perpetually burdened with doubt and worry. When the Savior proclaims, "Be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you" (D&amp;amp;C 68:6), we sometimes conclude he couldn't<i>possibly</i>be talking to students. We think that not until after we graduate, marry, and settle into a career can we experience a life that is rejoicing, relaxing, and reassuring. That is, until you talk to those who have graduated, married, and are settled in a career and find that many of them worry, too.<br><br>My remarks today are an attempt to dispel some of our worries and concerns. When the Lord invites us to "cast [our] burden" upon him (Psalms 55:22), I believe he is talking to us now, regardless of our current lot in life. When he said, "I am come that [ye] might have life, and that [ye] might have it more abundantly" (John 10:10), I don't believe he meant only after retirement but that we can enjoy peace and happiness now.<br><br>President Ezra Taft Benson said:<br><br><i>I hope that we will keep ever burning in our hearts the spirit of this great work which we represent.</i><br><br><i>If we do so, we'll have no anxiety. We'll have no fear. We'll not worry about the future because the Lord has given us the assurance that if we live righteously, if we keep his commandments, if we humble ourselves before him, all will be well.</i>[<i>So Shall Ye Reap,</i>comp. Reed A. Benson (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1960), pp. 58–59]<br><br>Actually, if directed properly, our worries and fears may be the very emotions that lead us to where we need to be. Sister Virginia Pearce said,<br><br><i>The uncertainties of earth life can help to remind each of us that we are dependent on</i>[our Heavenly Father].<i>But that reminder is not automatic. It involves our agency. We must</i>choose<i>to take our fears to him,</i>choose<i>to trust him, and</i>choose<i>to allow him to direct us. We must make these choices when what we feel most inclined to do is to rely more and more on our own frantic and often distorted thinking.</i>["Fear,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1992, p. 90; emphasis in original]<br><br>How do we direct our fears and worries to the Lord so that we can focus our energies on the things that really matter?<br><br>The scriptures are filled with glorious imagery that leads to deeper appreciation of the Lord's counsel to us. Today I would like to use the symbolism of how a potter transforms clay into a valuable and useful vessel to show the Lord's guiding hand in our lives. I am indebted to Brian Christensen, assistant professor of ceramics here at BYU. He generously gave of his time to both demonstrate and explain the process of forming clay pots. The slides you will see show one of his current students engaged in the ceramic process and some of Professor Christensen's completed pieces.<br><br>Old Testament prophets used the metaphor of the potter and the clay to teach a particular dimension of our relationship to the Lord and remind us of our dependence on him. In Isaiah we read: "But now, O Lord, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand" (Isaiah 64:8).<br><br>Elder Bruce R. McConkie identified the potter in the metaphor as Christ, "meaning that he governs in the affairs of men so as to mould and shape earthen human vessels into vessels of honor and service to him" (<i>MD,</i>p. 580). By understanding the process required to form a clay vessel, we are able to more fully appreciate the role the Savior, or the Master Potter, performs in our own lives.<br><br>First, let's look at the qualities in the clay itself. This readily available raw material is part of the earth. It is in itself one of God's creations. We are struck from the very beginning by the humility and unpretentiousness manifest in unworked clay. How appropriate to compare our mortal bodies to tabernacles of clay (see Mosiah 3:5), a lowly substance capable of being formed into vessels of glory. It reminds us of our own nothingness without the skills, the vision, and the sacrifice of the Master Potter.<br><br>Of all sculpting materials, clay responds the easiest to touch and retains the most minute detail, even a thumbprint. Each detail can be changed innumerable times until the potter is satisfied and declares the vessel complete. As sons and daughters of God, each of us bears his imprint. Jesus alluded to our bearing the imprint of God when he taught in Jerusalem. A group of Pharisees and Herodians, attempting to trap Jesus with their cunning questions, asked, "What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?" Jesus drew their attention to Tiberius' image engraved on a Roman coin and responded, "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's" (see Matthew 22:15–22). If the coin belongs to Caesar, what then belongs to God? Elder James E. Talmage suggested the following:<br><br><i>Every human soul is stamped with the image and superscription of God, however blurred and indistinct the line may have become through the corrosion or attrition of sin; and as unto Caesar should be rendered the coins upon which his effigy appeared, so unto God should be given the souls that bear His image. Render unto the world the stamped pieces that are made legally current by the insignia of worldly powers, and give unto God and His service, yourselves--the divine mintage of His eternal realm.</i>[<i>Jesus the Christ</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1956), pp. 546–47]<br><br>In the metaphor of the potter, the Lord's handiwork and detail in the clay is an enduring reminder that he has formed us and that we will "not be forgotten of [him]" (Isaiah 44:21).<br><br>However, the clay is not without its weaknesses. Initially it is unresponsive and requires at least three preparatory treatments before it can be shaped. First, the potter must add water--another seemingly simple element, but one that has vital properties. Water brings the clay to life. The symbolic water we receive from the Savior is as critical to our existence as physical water is to the clay. To the Samaritan woman drawing water from a well, Jesus taught:<br><br><i>Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</i>[John 4:14]<br><br>Elder Bruce R. McConkie described this "everlasting water" as the "words of eternal life, the message of salvation, the truths about God and his kingdom; it is the doctrines of the gospel" (see<i>Doctrinal New Testament Commentary</i>1 [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1965], pp. 151–52). These everlasting truths keep our hopes and faith in Christ alive. They are essential to our ability to endure.<br><br>Another form of preparation occurs when the potter dries out the clay while kneading it and eliminating air pockets. In ancient times the clay was even trodden underfoot to form the paste (see Isaiah 41:25). These "kneadings" of the potter can be paralleled to disappointments and at times severe challenges we experience individually or as a people. They are not intended to destroy but have a refining capacity to bring increased perspective and wisdom. In 1855 Elder Wilford Woodruff told the Saints to trust the hands of the potter, particularly during their current hardships. He said:<br><br><i>The chastisements we have had from time to time have been for our good, and are essential to learn wisdom, and carry us through a school of experience we never could have passed through without. I hope, then, that we may learn from the experience we have had to be faithful, and humble, and be passive in the hands of God, and do His commandments.</i>[<i>JD</i>2:198]<br><br>Joseph Smith recognized the growth and progress that came from his life of adversity. Likening himself to a rough stone, he said:<br><br><i>The only polishing I get is when some corner gets rubbed off by coming in contact with something else, striking with accelerated force against religious bigotry, priestcraft, lawyer-craft, doctor-craft, lying editors,</i>...<i>backed by mobs, blasphemers, licentious and corrupt men and women--all hell knocking off a corner here and a corner there. Thus I will become a smooth and polished shaft in the quiver of the Almighty.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 304]<br><br>Sometimes I think we expect that our lives will be free from hardship, suffering, and pain if we just continue to pay our tithing, read our scriptures, and do our home and visiting teaching most of the time. We like to focus on scripture passages that proclaim God's love and concern for us, concluding that he will therefore protect us from any discomfort and distress if we are at least trying to keep his commandments. We are then surprised when we get sick right before finals, or we lose our job while trying to save money for a mission, or what looks like a tragedy hits a strong family in the ward. We may be wiser to also notice scriptures where the Lord says:<br><br><i>Whom I love I also chasten.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 95:1]<br><br><i>My people must be tried in all things, that they may be prepared to receive the glory that I have for them, even the glory of Zion; and he that will not bear chastisement is not worthy of my kingdom.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 136:31]<br><br>Remember that the Savior came to "heal" broken hearts, not to prevent them. It is also helpful to note that one meaning of the word<i>chaste</i>is "pure," and, therefore, to "chasten" also means to "purify" (<i>Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary,</i>1981).<br><br>During the kneading process, the potter will become aware of stones and other foreign objects mixed in with the clay. They will need to be identified and removed by running a wire through the clay as the final preparation to shaping. In reference to the potter and clay metaphor, Brigham Young identified a part that we must assume in this cleansing. He said, "It is my business to ... use the wire to draw from the lump any material that would obstruct the potter from preparing a vessel unto honor" (<i>JD</i>4:23). In the analogy, it is important to recognize that our responsibility is not a passive one. It is through the process of repentance, confessing and forsaking our sins, that we do our part to become pure and receptive in the hands of the Potter.<br><br>Now that the clay is pliable and free from debris, the potter is ready to anchor the clay wedge on a wheel. In a sure and confident manner, the potter presses the clay down and brings it up until it is not only centered on the outside but eventually centered at its very core. It is critical that the clay be totally centered or it can never respond to the directives of the potter and therefore never be formed into a vessel of honor. When the clay does not deviate to the left nor to the right, the potter knows it is centered. Elder Heber C. Kimball, a potter himself by trade, taught, "What makes the clay snap? Because it wants its own way; and you cannot be happy unless you submit to the law of God, and to the principles of His government" (<i>JD</i>2:154).<br><br>Our focused faith in Christ even enables us to perform beyond our natural abilities. Recall Peter when he walked on water. I am disappointed when I hear those who claim the incident shows that Peter was lacking in faith. If we accuse Peter of not having faith, what must we conclude about the eleven who remained in the boat? President Howard W. Hunter explained the source of Peter's success in walking on the water and why that success subsided. He said:<br><br><i>While</i>[Peter's]<i>eyes were fixed upon the Lord, the wind might toss his hair and the spray might drench his robes, but all was well. Only when with wavering faith he removed his glance from the Master to look at the furious waves and the black gulf beneath him, only then did he begin to sink.</i>["The Beacon in the Harbor of Peace,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1992, p. 19]<br><br>As we become "centered" on the wheel of the Potter or "fix our eyes on Jesus," as President Hunter said it, we too can walk successfully over "the swelling waves of disbelief' and remain "unterrified amid the rising winds of doubt" (ibid.). Like Peter, we will believe the Savior when he says, "Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid" (Matthew 14:27). Once we are centered in him, right to our very core, we have no need to fear.<br><br>The clay is now cleansed, pliable, and centered, allowing the potter to form and shape it into the vessel he has envisioned. I found it fascinating to learn where a potter focuses his attention during this stage of creation. He does not concentrate on the outward appearance of the vessel. He knows that the outside will take care of itself when the inner space is formed. In other words, the form of the inner chamber determines the appearance of the exterior. President Benson spoke to us as a church of the importance of focusing on the inner vessel (see Alma 60:23), beginning first with ourselves, then with our families, and finally with the Church (see "Cleansing the Inner Vessel,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1986, pp. 4–7).<br><br>Society and the world hold the magnifying glass to our outward appearance: the style of our clothing, the strength of our GPA, the size of our home, the price of our car. In contrast, the Lord "seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart" (1 Samuel 16:7). It is much easier to repair a bad-hair day than to repent of an offense. What a fallacy to think that just because we get a new haircut, or a grade changed, or a new piece of furniture that we are better people. It is equally untrue to conclude that we can change people's spiritual desires and hopes by simply changing their physical appearance. It is what comes from the inside, from the heart, that reveals our true level of goodness and is consequently reflected in our outward appearance (see Mark 7:15–23). Likewise, Paul taught that we can be epistles of Christ, not written "with ink" or "in tables of stone" (there is the outward surface only), but with "the Spirit" when we have internalized Christ in the "fleshy tables of the heart" (see 2 Corinthians 3:3).<br><br>Not all clay vessels go into their desired shape the first time. Some become marred while they are on the potter's wheel. The experienced potter Heber C. Kimball explained that it happens when "they are not [content] with the shape the potter has given them, but straightaway put themselves into a shape to please themselves; therefore they are beyond understanding what God designs, and they destroy themselves" (Stanley B. Kimball,<i>Heber</i>C.<i>Kimball: Mormon Patriarch and Pioneer</i>[Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1981], p. 270). The Lord described such individuals as those who<br><br><i>seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god, whose image is in the likeness of the world, and whose substance is that of an idol.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 1:16]<br><br>While there are no guarantees that once on the wheel you will never go wrong, all is not lost for those who contend against the Potter. The clay is "cut off the wheel and then thrown back again into the mill, to go into the next batch"<i>(HC</i>4:478). It is given another chance to be obedient and pliable in the hands of the potter. Even so, through sincere repentance, individuals may start again and be found humble before the Lord, willing to hear his word and follow his direction.<br><br>That is what Jeremiah meant when he said:<br><br><i>Arise, and go down to the potter's house....</i><br><br><i>... And, behold, he wrought a work on the wheels.</i><br><br><i>And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it.</i><br><br><i>Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying,</i><br><br><i>O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the Lord. Behold, as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are ye in mine hand,</i>O<i>house of Israel.</i>[Jeremiah 18:2–6]<br><br>It is also what Paul was referring to when he said, "Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?" (Romans 9:21).<br><br>In all this imagery of being submissive in the hands of the Lord, some of you may be uncomfortable with the apparent absence of agency. In reality, agency is constantly present, but it is not the so-called agency the world has designed. A good potter always gives the clay respect by not moving it faster than it is capable of enduring and will never force it into a shape. With a combination of pinching and pulling movements, adding the living water constantly to keep it flexible and alive, the potter leads the vessel to its proper form. He can feel unique tendencies within the clay that, when followed, lead him to create a different vessel every time. Notice the variety in these completed vessels. Some are more simple, others more complex. Some are rough and cracked, others are very smooth. The true beauty and glory of each individual vessel is produced as a result of the cleansing, kneading, centering, and internal shaping the clay has endured.<br><br>We may balk at the thought of trusting our all to the Potter for other reasons. I will mention three.<br><br>First, it may be a problem we have with pride: We think we can do things better on our own. In Jeremiah's time, the kingdom of Judah was chastised for not only forsaking the Lord as the "fountain of living waters," but for insisting that they design their<i>own</i>water vessels. Their vessels turned out to be totally dysfunctional, described as "broken cisterns, that can hold no water" (Jeremiah 2:13).<br><br>In reality, being puffed up with our own sense of greatness and ability has no foundation. Stop and think of where you are in your life. How did you get to your current status? How many others have made sacrifices for you, given you guidance, advice, moral and financial support--even just giving you an opportunity to prove yourself? Since my arrival at BYU one and a half years ago, I have been impressed with the older buildings on campus. They were obviously constructed when there were fewer students, a smaller faculty, and a simpler system for administration. Technology, as we know it today, would have been unfathomable to students of that earlier era. Yet those students came to college then as eager to learn and hopeful of the contributions they would give to the world as you are now. Those older buildings remind me that we are the recipients of the inventions, inspiration, and courageous endeavors of those previous graduates. We have the opportunities available to us today because of their sacrifices and contributions.<br><br>Perhaps one reason the Savior admonishes us to "become as little children" (Matthew 18:3) is that children are so pliable, free from pride, and receptive to direction from others. A friend of mine recently reported to a Church leader that she overwhelmingly prefers her calling in the Primary to her previous assignment of teaching adults in Sunday School. "I can understand that," the Church leader responded, "in Primary you still get to work in wet cement."<br><br>We have heard prophets call us a "chosen generation" reserved to come to earth at this important time. I have wondered what that means. What should we be doing to fulfill our important purpose? Is it to become the best composer? the greatest engineer? or the most renowned financial planner? I don't think so. That seems to be secondary--the exterior. I am intrigued by the absence of pride expressed in a thought by President Joseph F. Smith:<br><br><i>To do well those things which God ordained to be the common lot of all man-kind, is the truest greatness. To be a successful father or a successful mother is greater than to be a successful general or a successful statesman. One is universal and eternal greatness, the other is ephemeral....</i><br><br><i>... Many are unhappy because they imagine that they should be doing something unusual or something phenomenal. Some people would rather be the blossom of a tree and be admiringly seen than be an enduring part of the tree and live the commonplace life of the tree's existence.</i>[<i>GD,</i>pp. 285–86]<br><br>Perhaps our greatest mission is to show by the way we approach each day, each assignment--even in the most challenging times--that we will remain valiant, that we will be great covenant-honoring Saints.<br><br>A second reason we may resist submitting to the Lord is because we have been abused and mistreated or our agency has been denied by one whom we loved and trusted in the past. Fears of possible consequences of being vulnerable cause us to put up barriers and defenses. We can become convinced that someone else who appears to love us today may only be scheming ways to take advantage of our trust tomorrow. The difference here is that the Master Potter is a perfect being. In the LDS Bible dictionary, under<i>Faith,</i>we read:<br><br><i>The Lord has revealed himself and his perfect character, possessing in their fulness all the attributes of love, knowledge, justice, mercy, unchangeableness, power, and every other needful thing, so as to enable the mind of man to place confidence in him without reservation.</i>[p. 669]<br><br>We must remember that Jesus Christ came to earth to<i>"heal</i>the broken-hearted, to preach<i>deliverance</i>to the captives, and<i>recovering</i>of sight to the blind, to<i>set at liberty</i>them that are bruised" (Luke 4:18; emphasis added). There is absolutely no need to fear that he will harm or ever disappoint us!<br><br>Finally, we may hesitate to trust the Potter because we have a fear of taking responsibility. We would rather trust other mortals to make our decisions, knowing that if things don't work out as expected, we have someone to blame besides ourselves. Some of us don't know how to be alone with ourselves and our thoughts and therefore miss the direction of the Spirit. Our lives are so filled with schedules and deadlines, social events and noise that silence and stillness have become extremely uncomfortable to us. Elder Henry D. Moyle said:<br><br><i>Without</i>[the]<i>power of the Holy Ghost you and I would not be able to become submissive to the will of our Heavenly Father. We would not know what his will is. ... We must be as clay in the hands of the potter to permit our lives to be molded in the pattern that the Savior of mankind set for us.</i>[<i>CR,</i>April 1950, p. 148]<br><br>No one can tell you just how your life will evolve, nor how to avoid misfortune. You can design your most hoped-for life and painstakingly work to achieve it. But I would dare say that fortunately for you and me, it may not unwind as we have planned. There will be surprising turns that we never could have anticipated. The Lord is in control. He is the Potter. And as a result, we have richer, more meaningful lives. As you look at your own past, you can recognize the obvious guidance of the Lord. He has told us:<br><br><i>As often as thou hast inquired thou hast received instruction of my Spirit. If it had not been so, thou wouldst not have come to the place where thou art at this time.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 6:14]<br><br>Why should we question that he will continue to direct us in the future?<br><br>In conclusion, remember what our two most recent prophets have promised us concerning putting our trust in the Lord. President Benson identified ten aspects of our lives that are improved when we submit to him:<br><br><i>Men and women who turn their lives over to God will discover that He can make a lot more out of their lives than they can. He will deepen their joys, expand their vision, quicken their minds, strengthen their muscles, lift their spirits, multiply their blessings, increase their opportunities, comfort their souls, raise up friends and pour out peace.</i>["Jesus Christ--Gifts and Expectations," Christmas Devotional, Salt Lake City, 7 December 1986; quoted in<i>TETB,</i>p. 361]<br><br>President Howard W. Hunter observed the consequences if we choose<i>not</i>to submit to the Lord:<br><br><i>Indifference to the Savior or failure to keep the commandments of God brings about insecurity, inner turmoil, and contention. These are the opposites of peace. Peace can come to an individual only by an unconditional surrender to him who is the Prince of peace and who has the power to confer peace.</i>[<i>That We Might Have Joy</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1994), p. 30]<br><br>You are the clay--and as such you are of utmost importance to the Lord. He loves you and desires to shape you into a magnificent vessel of honor--designed and glazed for all eternity. May we therefore set aside our fears and concerns for the future and "trust in the Lord with all [our] heart[s]; and lean not unto [our] own understanding. In all [our] ways" let us "acknowledge him," and I bear witness "he will direct [our] paths" (Proverbs 3:5–6). He loves us and will continue to support us. I bear witness of that love and that we are not forgotten of him. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Camille Fronk was an instructor in the Department of Ancient Scripture when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 7 March 1995.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>Steady Course - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It hardly seems possible, but this June it will be forty-five years since I walked across the podium at Utah State--then the Agricultural College, now a university--and took my place beside approximately two thousand others. It was the largest graduating class in our history as many of those who had served their country during the Great War were also finishing their degrees.<br><br>Many of the graduates were concerned about being able to find jobs, with such large numbers flooding the market. But then as now, things work out if approached with preparation, faith, and a will to work.<br><br>I trust you are genuinely enjoying your experience here. Since I realize what it takes to meet the admission requirements, I know I'm with a group with impressive credentials. I commend you for your preparation and for your accomplishments to this point. You notice I say<i>to this point,</i>and I do so advisedly because, as we know, life is a continual growing experience.<br><br>We read in Ecclesiastes, "The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong" (Ecclesiastes 9:11); and in Matthew, "But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved" (Matthew 24:13).<br><br>Well, I don't think any of us feel we "have it made," so to speak. If you are like most, you will have many happy and wonderful times. But you will also have temptations, discouragements, and disappointments. You will have challenges, sometimes to a degree you may not feel you're quite up to. But you will find that you are--unless, of course, you are trying to do something that is not right or that just isn't feasible for you to do.<br><br>So my counsel to you is to steer a steady course, as many a brave sea captain has prescribed when storms and rough seas are encountered and the fainthearted become anxious to turn back. By adopting this resolve you will not be distracted when the winds of temptation or adversity come upon you and threaten to blow you off course or tempt you to turn back.<br><br>We read in Proverbs:<br><br><i>Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</i><br><br><i>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</i>[Proverbs 3:5–6]<br><br>This, I would say, has been the key to the success and happiness I have had in my life. I feel I was blessed early on with a deep and abiding faith in the Lord. As far back as I can remember, I have known that he was there and that he loves his children. He stands ready to help us.<br><br>As a young married couple, my wife and I felt that trust and direction as we pled for the life of our firstborn, who lay in a coma with serious head injuries following an automobile-bicycle accident. Physicians later shook their heads when that young boy indeed recovered after having been diagnosed as having fatal injuries. We knew we had witnessed a miracle. You can imagine the joy that Sister Hansen and I felt earlier this year when I was able to ordain that boy--now a man--as a bishop.<br><br>That trust and promise again stood the test when two of our five sons were called home to live with Heavenly Father--one as the result of a mid afternoon automobile accident while on his way to a state debate meet, the other some twelve years after he contracted multiple sclerosis during the eighteenth month of his mission in Sweden. Throughout those difficult times, we unquestionably received the strength and direction to see us through.<br><br>I love my Heavenly Father. I love my Savior, Jesus Christ. I love his gospel, and I will be ever grateful for the guidance and inspiration of the Holy Ghost.<br><br><i>Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</i><br><br><i>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</i>[Proverbs 3:5–6]<br><br>As I think back on my college experience, I remember an inscription above the main library desk at Utah State. Each time I stood there my attention would focus on some other words taken from Proverbs.<br><br>Here I must confess that even though I stood there quite often, it wasn't always to check out a book. But I did have valid business there. You see, a certain striking coed from Idaho spent several hours a day on the other side of the desk working her way through college.<br><br>I felt a responsibility to look after her since she was a freshman and I was an upperclassman. She, of course, needed the attention, guidance, and tutoring that only an upperclassman could provide.<br><br>Often as I waited nonchalantly for Jeanine to appear, I pondered the statement "And with all thy getting get understanding" (Proverbs 4:7). I believe it was Elder Sterling W. Sill who later modified that somewhat to read, "And with all thy getting, get going." I tried to follow both admonitions, and I commend them to you.<br><br>Over the years we have had a great relationship with BYU. In fact, while here I need to check on some property that we assumed--back in October 1948--was merely going to be here occasionally. However, it has been in Logan for only three of the last twenty years. I am referring to the old wagon wheel that we jointly selected back in 1948 as the symbol of football supremacy between the two schools. It has been here so long that we haven't been able to inspect it. (It must be that training we gave LaVell up in Logan before he signed on down here.)<br><br>Well, since the three wheels that match it are on the Hansen family farm in East Garland, up in northern Utah, and since we may need to borrow the wheel long enough to move the old wagon that it came from in out of the weather, I received instructions from my ninety-year-old father to check it out while I'm here. We just want to make sure you have been taking good care of it and that it's still sound.<br><br>It was while I was a junior at Utah State that the two chapters of Blue Key inaugurated the traditional exchange of the old wagon wheel. So now the next time you see it you'll know where it came from.<br><br>We are living in a wonderful era of time. We may not always realize it since there are so many challenges and problems in the world today, but as Latter-day Saints we know what a great blessing it is to have the restored gospel of Jesus Christ on the earth. This is the period the Lord has designated as the last dispensation of the fullness of times.<br><br>The apostle Paul, in an epistle to the Ephesians, foretold this era. He wrote:<br><br><i>That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him.</i>[Ephesians 1:10]<br><br>The Prophet Joseph indicated that in this dispensation there would be marvelous things revealed, and indeed there have been.<br><br>The message of a beloved latter-day prophet, President Howard W. Hunter, reminds us of a very important blessing of this dispensation: the blessing of temples and the sealing power. This makes possible the opportunity to partake of the greatest of all the gifts of God, the gift of eternal life and exaltation. With this blessing comes eternal marriage and the opportunity to be together as families for the eternities.<br><br>As we speak of temples, let us not take lightly President Hunter's charge to make the holy temples the supernal setting of our most sacred covenants, to become worthy or maintain our worthiness to hold a temple recommend, and to attend the temple as often as time and circumstances permit.<br><br>The significance of this charge becomes more meaningful when we realize that as of 1982 there were twenty operating temples in the Church. Now, a little more than a decade later, we have forty-seven operating temples. Thirteen more have been announced by the First Presidency.<br><br>Incidentally, you might be interested to know that our new prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley, has been very involved with temples over the years. In fact, he has dedicated twenty-two of our forty-seven operating temples. He has attended and been involved in the dedications or rededications of all but five of the forty-seven temples. I know President Hinckley believes deeply in the importance of temples.<br><br>I hope during your experience here you will gain much. I also hope it will be a time when you will achieve not only in academic pursuits but spiritually as well.<br><br>If you find yourself in a spiritual slump, I encourage you to take counsel from President Spencer W. Kimball, who said, while speaking on this campus in 1966:<br><br><i>I find that when I get casual in my relationships with divinity and when it seems that no divine ear is listening and no divine voice is speaking, that I am far, far away. If I immerse myself in the scriptures the distance narrows and the spirituality returns.</i>[Quoted by Ezra Taft Benson, "Seek the Spirit of the Lord,"<i>Ensign,</i>April 1988, p. 4]<br><br>I trust you will be constantly striving to be a better, less selfish person, one who has genuine concern for others.<br><br>While we're on the subject of being better persons, let me read the words of Solomon Bennett Freehof:<br><br><i>Years ago I preferred clever people. There was a joy in beholding ... a mind ... bearing thoughts quickly translated into words, or ideas expressed in a new way. I find now that my taste has changed. Verbal fireworks often bore me. They seem motivated by self-assertion and self-display. I now prefer another type of person; one who is considerate, understanding of others, careful not to break down another person's self-respect. ... My preferred person today is one who is always aware of the needs of others, or their pain and fear and unhappiness, and their search for self-respect. ... I once liked clever people. Now I like good people.</i>[<i>Richard Evans' Quote Book</i>(Salt Lake City: Publishers Press, 1971), p. 166]<br><br>An important part of your training here will be to develop mental and physical discipline. As you improve your ability to master yourself, you will experience the thrill and exhilaration of accomplishment, of getting more done in a day than you thought was possible, of feeling the satisfaction of the realization of your daily goals, of feeling the pure joy that comes from understanding a concept or developing a skill.<br><br>You will need to be alert and sensitive to the facilities and resources that are available at this fine institution to assist you in what you are trying to accomplish.<br><br>A word of caution. Sometimes we make things harder than they need to be. We fail to see opportunities or helps that are right there for us. We fail to recognize them.<br><br>Sister Hansen and I had an experience some years ago that illustrates the point I want to make. We were serving as chaperons to a young adult group from our stake on an overnight retreat to a cabin in Huntsville located in the mountains east of Ogden.<br><br>This retreat we were chaperoning was in January, and it was a particularly cold January. When we were given the details, no one mentioned that the large log cabin we would be staying in was heated by a single fireplace in the living room.<br><br>Well, as the time came for retiring--the young women upstairs, the young men downstairs with their sleeping bags laid out on the plank floors--Jeanine and I were given the privacy of the bedroom and the luxury of a bed. There were no blinds on the windows, so with the lights out we removed our street clothes and quickly jumped into bed.<br><br>We were surprised to feel such a light set of covers, but we thought with the help of the bedspread we might make it through. We quickly dropped off to sleep, but as we did, the temperature dropped, too.<br><br>As we awakened shivering, we could tell that the young man assigned to keep the fire going had dropped off to sleep also and not one Btu could be felt radiating under the door into our room. What to do? We hurriedly got up and put on our clothing--but even with all our clothes, including the light jackets we had worn in the car, we spent the next four hours literally in a slow freeze. I am sure the temperature went down to twenty or twenty-five below zero outside, and it wasn't much warmer inside. We were reluctant to turn on the lights and try and get a fire going and wake everyone up, so we just toughed it out.<br><br>Without a doubt that was as uncomfortable as any night we have ever spent. As daylight broke, we couldn't wait to get out of bed and start moving. Then, as we removed the pillows to make the bed, to our great surprise there were the controls for the electric blanket we had unknowingly slept under during that miserable night.<br><br>Unfortunately, we ofttimes have similar experiences, though not necessarily involving an electric blanket. But we make things harder than they need to be as we fail to recognize or take advantage of facilities or resources that would make our lives or our work more enjoyable and more effective or even more bearable in some cases.<br><br>Too often I sense we fail to draw on spiritual strengths and resources that are available for the asking--provided, of course, we are doing our part and that we are living in such a way as to be worthy of the blessings that are available to us.<br><br>I have always considered that the spiritual strength and help I receive from living the gospel to the best of my ability and from rendering Christian service is one of my greatest assets. For as long as I can remember, I have had a calling in the Church. This was so even during the years of greatest academic demands while I was in law school.<br><br>I felt the Lord knew what was best for me and what I could handle. And so as the calls came, I accepted them, and I can truthfully say that I can't think of a class that suffered because of accepting a call. To the contrary, I seemed to do better in my courses.<br><br>We may consider it an honor and a privilege to accept a call and to serve the Lord, but I realize there are some who cannot understand why we in the Church are so willing to accept calls.<br><br>I am reminded of an actual case involving a young executive who received a call from President Kimball to serve as a mission president. As he went in to break the news to his two senior nonmember partners, they were totally flabbergasted. They immediately began to ask such questions as "Aren't you satisfied with your work here? Aren't we paying you enough? Would you leave a six-figure job to go and live in some third-world country for three years?"<br><br>The young executive tried desperately to explain that the income he was making or the position he held had nothing to do with his accepting a call from a prophet.<br><br>The eldest of the partners asked who the call had come from. The young man explained that it had come from a prophet in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints named Spencer W. Kimball. Immediately the older of the two partners turned to the other and said, "Get this man Kimball on the phone and find out what it will take to have him withdraw the call. You are authorized to go as much as a hundred thousand dollars, if necessary. But tell him to keep his hands off our man."<br><br>Of course, the young executive refused to allow that, and as his partners realized he was serious in his resolve to accept the call, he was informed that he would be terminated and would have no further opportunity with the company upon his return. He was disappointed in the way the partners had taken his call, but he left and served honorably.<br><br>When the three years were up and he returned, it took some time for him to find employment, but this in no way dampened his spirit or interfered with the joy that he felt after he accepted the call and finished his course with a "Well done, thou good and faithful servant" result.<br><br>The Lord tells us in section 52 of the Doctrine and Covenants that he will provide a pattern for us.<br><br><i>And again, I will give unto you a pattern in all things, that ye may not be deceived; for Satan is abroad in the land, and he goeth forth deceiving the nations.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 52:14]<br><br>That pattern is the gospel of Jesus Christ in its fullness. By keeping the commandments, studying the scriptures, and listening to the prophets, we have the benefit of these great resources.<br><br>Another word of caution, if I may. Let me emphasize "listening to the prophets." I believe it was President Romney who once said words to this effect: "Many people want to serve the Lord, but only in an advisory capacity." Be careful that you don't ever slip into that category. Yes, we believe in the blessing of personal inspiration for ourselves and our families and with respect to specific callings and assignments. But when it comes to receiving revelation for the Church, that should be left to those who have been duly called and sustained as prophets, seers, and revelators.<br><br>A quote from a former member of the Twelve is instructive here.<br><br><i>It is not important that a prophet should say those things with which you and I are in full accord. But it is important that you and I should bring ourselves into full accord with those things which a prophet speaks by virtue of his office and calling.</i>[Richard L. Evans, "On Being A Prophet,"<i>Improvement Era,</i>November 1939, p. 672]<br><br>Now a word about our responsibility to be an example.<br><br>William George Jordan, in his book<i>The Majesty of Calmness,</i>succinctly reminds us of the importance of our example:<br><br><i>The only responsibility that a man cannot evade in this life is the one he thinks of least, his personal influence. Man's conscious influence, when he is on dress parade, when he is posing to impress those around him, is woefully small. But his unconscious influence, the silent, subtle radiation of his personality, the effect of his words and acts, the trifles he never considers, is tremendous. Every moment of life he is changing to a degree the life of the whole world. Every</i>[person]<i>has an atmosphere which is affecting every other. So silent and unconsciously is this influence working, that</i>[one]<i>may forget that it exists....</i><br><br><i>Into the hands of every individual is given a marvelous power for good or for evil, the silent, unconscious, unseen influence of his life. This is simply the constant radiation of what a</i>[person]<i>really</i>is,<i>not what he pretends to be. Every</i>person,<i>by his</i>[or her]<i>mere living, is radiating sympathy, or sorrow, or morbidness, or cynicism, or happiness, or hope, or any of a hundred other qualities. Life is a state of constant radiation and absorption; to exist is to radiate; to exist is to be the recipient of radiations.</i>[William George Jordan,<i>The Majesty of Calmness</i>(New York: Fleming H. Revell Company, 1900), pp. 18–19; emphasis in original]<br><br>One of the great blessings of life is the opportunity to make choices. A respected philosopher once said, "Choose well; your choice is brief, and yet endless" (Goethe).<br><br>President Kimball effectively capsulized the thought that I feel is instructive here. I quote from his writings:<br><br><i>Life gives to all the choice. You can satisfy yourself with mediocrity if you wish. You can be common, ordinary, dull, colorless; or you can channel your life so that it will be clean, vibrant, progressive, useful, colorful, rich. You can soil your record, defile your soul, trample underfoot virtue, honor, and goodness, and thus forfeit an exaltation in the kingdom of God. Or you can be righteous, commanding the respect and admiration of your associates in all walks of life, and enjoying the love of the Lord. Your destiny is in your hands and your all-important decisions are your own to make.</i>[Spencer W. Kimball,<i>The Miracle of Forgiveness</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1969), p. 235]<br><br>Making good choices is nothing new to us. In fact, as we go to the scriptures we realize that we were making choices even before we were born. We were part of the Council in Heaven. We heard opposing views. Fortunately we had the good judgment to make the right decision--the result of which is that we are here today in mortality, blessed with bodies. We have the opportunity to gain experience and to continue making choices that are of no small consequence with respect to our future peace of mind and happiness.<br><br>Every day of our lives we all make scores of decisions. Some, of course, are merely minor or routine that have little or no lasting effect. However, others are of much more serious consequence. Some--in fact, many--even have eternal consequences.<br><br>It was Carlyle who said, "The greatest of faults ... is to be conscious of none" (<i>Heroes and Hero Worship</i>[1841],<i>The Hero as Prophet</i>). We should be constantly analyzing ourselves and taking notice of the consequences of our bad choices. We can also learn much as we observe others. I'm reminded of a sign I saw on an office wall. It read, "Learn from the mistakes of others. You'll never live long enough to make them all yourself."<br><br>Strive constantly to keep your thoughts in check. Remember thoughts have a way of developing into action. Keep yourself morally clean. The scriptures warn us, "To be carnally minded is death" (Romans 8:6) and "wickedness never was happiness" (Alma 41:10). Some years ago President Harold B. Lee, then Elder Lee, counseled a group of LDS servicemen in Korea, of whom I was one. Said President Lee, "He who seeks the rapture of the moment will lose the peace of years."<br><br>One of the most important decisions you will ever make on this earth will be choosing an eternal companion. It will be helpful to have thoughtfully considered and to have in mind what is most important to you as you are making that decision. I was pleased as I asked one of my sons about the girl he was becoming quite serious with. After some rather general responses, I was impressed when he said, "Dad, she's the kind that would make a good mom."<br><br>The longer I live, the more grateful I am for a patient and loving wife who is a wonderful mom. I am thankful for the blessings of the temple with the glorious promise of eternal life. And I am grateful for the direction and focus that we receive as we attend the Lord's house.<br><br>It naturally follows that with agency and choice must come accountability. There are various forms and types of accountability.<br><br>The community holds its members accountable to obey the laws in effect. A violation may result in fines, forfeitures, or even in being removed from living in society.<br><br>Schools and universities hold their students accountable to learn the subjects that are taught. If the student fails, he or she is held back or is denied credentials.<br><br>Most employees must account for their time and efforts, and if they do poorly or fail, they are terminated or denied advancement.<br><br>We believe that we are also accountable to the Lord for our actions and that one day the book of life will be opened and what we have done with our agency will determine what we do and where we will be for a long time.<br><br>In the examples I have given you, I have indicated situations where someone else initiates the accountability process. But what I would like to refer to this morning is the situation where we individually commence and operate the accountability process.<br><br>In discussing personal accountability, I specifically direct your attention to those situations where probably no one--save yourself and perhaps one other, but a mighty important other--would even be aware of what you were doing or thinking.<br><br>Perhaps it is (1) staying in bed longer than is needful; or (2) consciously leaving work for someone else to do that you should have done yourself; (3) preparing poorly for a given responsibility; (4) thinking thoughts that are unwholesome or improper; (5) taking longer to do a project than is really necessary; (6) bearing false witness against someone; (7) consciously failing to give help and assistance in an appropriate situation--in other words, failing to be charitable; (8) being insensitive to the thoughts and feelings of others; (9) failing to set personal goals for achievement; (10) failing to put forth the effort to overcome bad habits or practices; (11) wasting time (I was taught at home that there is nothing so boring as loafing because you can't stop and rest); (12) failing to accept responsibility for our mistakes or failures; (13) bending or breaking applicable rules; (14) enjoying it when misfortunes come to a rival; (15) failing to make prayer a regular part of your daily life. I could go on indefinitely with a list that is virtually inexhaustible.<br><br>These are the types of things that can slow or stall our progress and cause us to constantly rely on excuses.<br><br>Admittedly, these may all sound like little things, but I'm reminded of President McKay's observation on one occasion in the Tabernacle. He counseled that huge trees in the forest often withstand strong winds and harsh elements only to succumb to insects so small that it takes a microscope to see them.<br><br>In closing let me share an experience that I had while still quite young. To the best of my recollection, it was while I was a student in the sixth grade at the Garland Elementary School. I had not quite turned twelve. It was spring, and I was anxious to join the scores of other boys who had signed up to compete in the<i>Deseret News</i>Pentathlon.<br><br>As you may know,<i>penta</i>comes from the Greek word meaning "five." Thus, the pentathlon consisted of five track and field events that all of the boys in the state could compete in. The pentathlon, as I indicated, was sponsored by the<i>Deseret News</i>and was conducted throughout the grade schools across the state. The scores that you attained in the various events were computed by applying a factor for age and height and weight. They were then added together and sent to Salt Lake City, where winners in various categories were selected. Winners received recognition and, among other things, an expense-paid trip to Salt Lake City, where they spent a day as special guests of the newspaper.<br><br>The five events consisted of the high jump, broad jump, shot put, basketball free throw, and fifty-yard dash.<br><br>The pentathlon was the talk of the school. Most all of the boys who were old enough were suited up for the event. At age eleven I was a ninety-eight-pound weakling; but more troublesome than that, I had marginal coordination. But how I wanted to do well in that athletic event. I suppose in that respect I was not much different than anyone else as I imagined the thrill that would accompany one to the winner's circle. I knew that I wasn't what you would call a coach's dream. But I had studied the rules carefully. I was hopeful that the factors for height, weight, and age might give me a chance.<br><br>Well, I really got into it. I found a round rock that weighed within an ounce or two of the regulation five-pound shot put. I spent considerable time in the evenings when the chores were done throwing the shot put around the backyard.<br><br>I also dug a broad-jump pit that I used to practice my broad jump and high jump. I nailed some old flooring boards together for a backboard, installed a hoop, and secured it to the end of the barn. Though it was not fancy, it provided a facility with which to practice my foul shots.<br><br>The big day finally came. All who were participating were excused from school for the afternoon. We began with the shot put. I did exceptionally well for my size. This was understandable because of my experience with the round rock at home. My practice shooting foul shots paid off, and I scored well in that event. The high jump didn't go quite as well. Here again, my lack of coordination worked against me.<br><br>Then it was time for the fifty-yard dash. We lined up by the starter and were off. It almost instantly became obvious that I would view the race from the rear of the pack. But how I tried! I gave it all the effort I had. As I passed where the coach was standing, I noticed him turn and say something--then there was a burst of laughter from those who stood around him.<br><br>We crossed the finish line. I was fifth of five runners. I resigned myself to the fact that there would be no trip to Salt Lake for me that year. But the worst was yet to come. As I approached the place where the coach had been standing, one of the more arrogant boys couldn't wait to call out, "Hey, Hansen, the coach says you run like a duck." And there was more laughter. As you picture that characterization in your mind, you'll have to agree it was quite descriptive and probably an accurate evaluation of how I looked.<br><br>Well, of course, I laughed too, but many thoughts went through my mind. I was angry, I was hurt, and I was embarrassed. When I went to bed that night it was still on my mind. When I awakened the next morning, those pointed words came back, "Hey, Hansen, the coach says you run like a duck."<br><br>I struggled with that situation for quite some time. I admit I had thoughts of never getting on the athletic field again. But then some Danish determination must have come out in me. I resolved I would learn to run. And I was going to show the coach and my friends, but I suppose most of all myself, that I could do it.<br><br>From that moment forward, every time I had some distance to go, I ran. When coming in from the fields at noon, I ran. When the grain bin on the harvester was full and I had to get the truck to empty it, I ran. When I went to the pasture to get the horses, I ran. As I had spare time while on army duty in Korea, I practiced my running. And after returning home, I kept it up.<br><br>Though I realized I had made some substantial progress, it was not until a particular stake fathers and sons' outing that I had a chance to evaluate those twenty-plus years of determination.<br><br>It was shortly after we had moved into our current stake. We were at a campground in the Uintas for the Saturday morning games. All of the youth had run their races, and then the call came for "everyone over twenty-one." As I lined up with the dads and others, I noticed a young man in the group who had made a name for himself at East High School in the 440-yard run. I knew he would be the challenge.<br><br>Again the starting gun sounded, but this time, instead of bringing up the rear, I was in front. I remained there as we crossed the finish line. Of course, the coach wasn't there to see it, neither were my grade school friends, and particularly the arrogant little guy with the loud voice. But this I know, winning the pentathlon could not have resulted in the self-satisfaction I felt as I shared the first prize--a giant candy bar--with my two little sons that day.<br><br>What a lesson in life I gained from that experience. I learned humility, as I was humbled. I learned tolerance, as I successfully fought back the urge to slug the boy who shouted out the characterization the coach had used to describe my athletic prowess. I learned patience, as I found that some things take several years of determination to accomplish. And I experienced the sweet feeling that comes from successfully accomplishing a goal.<br><br>Someone once wrote, "Life is not having or getting. It's being or becoming."<br><br>Perhaps you have some particular challenge in your life at this time. Whether you run like a duck, have trouble concentrating or controlling your temper, or have the need to develop charity and compassion or whether you need to break a bad habit or raise your level of spirituality or whatever it is, there are very few things that you cannot master if you but set your mind to it and then pay the price with determination and hard work.<br><br>Remember also that the only place where success comes before work is in the dictionary. Remember too that many times we learn more from a defeat or a disappointment than we gain from a success or a win.<br><br>Now, in closing, could I leave a couple of my favorite scriptures with you. From 1 John:<br><br><i>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</i><br><br><i>For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.</i><br><br><i>And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.</i>[1 John 2:15–17]<br><br>And last of all, here is King Benjamin's instruction for becoming a saint, found in Mosiah:<br><br><i>For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.</i>[Mosiah 3:19]<br><br>May you put off the natural man and become a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord. May you "hold up your light that it may shine unto the world" (3 Nephi 18:24).<br><br>May you steer a steady course as you go through life, remembering the commitments and covenants you have made--striving to live a little better each day, keeping the commandments, loving the Lord and your neighbor.<br><br>As you do, you will not only store up treasure in heaven, but you will realize a special peace, now, in this life, a "peace of God, which passeth all understanding" (Philippians 4:7).<br><br>I leave you my witness that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, our Master and Redeemer. This is his Church. May the Lord bless and be with you, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>W.

<h1>ation of the Heart - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I love the words to the song our choir just performed:<br><br><i>Write</i>[thy]<i>blessed name, O Lord,</i><br><i>upon my heart</i><br><i>There to remain so indelibly engraved</i><br><i>that no prosperity or adversity</i><br><i>shall ever move me from thy love.</i><br>[D. Grotenhuis and Thomas à Kempis (Dayton, Ohio: The Sacred Music Press, 1991)]<br><br>When Thomas à Kempis penned those lines more than 500 years ago, he was in one sense talking about education--the kind of education that can occur at this university in a way that can occur at no other because we believe that all truth is tied together and that when we learn a new truth, whether in a course on religion, mathematics, or physical education, that truth will strengthen our testimony of the Creator (who said, "I am the truth" [see John 14:6]) and engrave his name ever more indelibly upon our heart.<br><br>When we understand truth in this way, we need not worry about separating secular learning from religious learning--we need only worry about separating truth from error. As Brigham Young said:<br><br><i>Take the whole truth wherever you find it. It is good; claim it, take it to yourself, and cleave to it, for it will do you good. Cease to separate truth from truth.</i>[<i>JD</i>8:260]<br><br>And, as Joseph Fielding Smith confirmed:<br><br><i>There never was and never will be any conflict between truth revealed by the Lord to his servants, the prophets, and truth revealed by him to the scientist, who makes his discoveries through his research and study.</i>[<i>GD,</i>p. 86]<br><br>Why, then, do we struggle at times with the blending of the sacred and the secular? If truth is truth, how can there be a conflict? And if "truth tastes so good," as the Prophet Joseph taught (see<i>Teachings,</i>p. 355), how could a student or a teacher ever lose interest in a course--if it's really truth that we are learning and teaching?<br><br>The longer I have considered the question of how teaching and learning should occur in my own classroom, the more I have come to believe that the question extends far beyond my own experience as a professor at BYU. I believe the question applies to all of us--students, staff, and administrators, as well as faculty. We might all ask ourselves: As one who knows that the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored in its fullness, how should I go about learning and how should I teach--not only here on this campus, but in the Church, in my home, and in my personal studies for as long as I live?<br><br>Before coming to BYU as students, you completed thirteen years of education--most commonly in public schools. You were among those who succeeded in these schools, but I'm sure you were acquainted with students who were not so successful. A high school principal told me recently:<br><br><i>I worry a lot about the students we have to suspend from our school for unacceptable behavior, but I worry even more about the students who feel left out, the ones who are on the margins; they don't feel like they fit in, like they have a real place in our school.</i>[Linda Sandstrom, personal communication, 20 January 1995]<br><br>Nearly all of us are acquainted with someone who is not succeeding as a student--school may be a place of boredom or a place of pain but not a place of learning. And in some cases neither is the student's home. For so many, education is something to get out of, rather than something to get into. Many have called it an educational crisis, but it is much more than a crisis of pedagogy or standardized test scores--or even of illiteracy. If Thomas à Kempis were alive today, I think that he might call it a crisis of the heart. We are reminded every day that knowledge alone will not suffice, that we can be "ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth" (2 Timothy 3:7).<br><br>So what is the answer? A crisis of the heart demands that we look at teaching and learning anew, that as students and teachers we not confine ourselves to the models we have experienced in our own education. If we want to rediscover what it means to learn and to teach, we need to bathe ourselves in the light of the Restoration.<br><br>The scriptures teach us that, like the soul, the heart encompasses both the body and the spirit (see Alma 32:28)--the heart is the very center of our being. We "rejoice" with our heart (D&amp;amp;C 97:21); we "ponder" with our heart (see Luke 2:19); we "understand" with our heart (John 12:40). It is our heart that is "humble" (see Alma 42:30); it is with our heart that we "discern" (l Kings 3:9) and are "edified" (see D&amp;amp;C 50:23); and it is with our heart that we experience "reverence" (see 1 Peter 3:15), "inspiration" (see Alma 43:48), and "joy" (2 Nephi 1:21). Yet these are not the terms we typically use to describe the ways most of us teach and learn. If anything, we reserve them for the learning that takes place within the walls of our churches and temples, but not within the walls of our classrooms and homes.<br><br>How would our present approaches to learning and teaching change if we considered what it means to educate the heart?<br><br>The Prophet Joseph's account of his own personal search for truth has much to teach us about education. Joseph spent little time in formal schooling, and yet he learned more in his short life than any of his contemporaries. The following excerpts from his personal history remind us that Joseph's learning began with a question, a question that arose out of confusion:<br><br><i>During this time of great excitement my mind was called up to serious reflection and great uneasiness; but though my feelings were deep and often poignant, still I kept myself aloof from all these parties, though I attended their several meetings as often as occasion would permit. ... But so great were the confusion and strife among the different denominations, that it was impossible for a person young as I was, and so unacquainted with men and things, to come to any certain conclusion who was right and who was wrong....</i><br><br><i>While I was laboring under the extreme difficulties caused by the contests of these parties of religionists, I was one day reading the Epistle of James, first chapter and fifth verse, which reads: "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him."</i><br><br><i>Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart. I reflected on it again and again, knowing that if any person needed wisdom from God, I did.</i>[JS--H 1:8, 11–12]<br><br>Joseph's "mind was called up to serious reflection," but the message of the scripture came with power to his heart. Like Joseph, when we yearn for answers and for wholeness, we ask questions that demand our personal response. And only when we ask such questions will our most important learning occur.<br><br>How do such questions arise? How do they develop? Joseph's experience suggests that they come from deep within us. They are not surface questions like so many of us ask as teachers or students.<br><br>Joseph's account teaches us that reaching inside the mind or inside a book will never fully satisfy a question of the heart; we must eventually reach outward to others and upward to God. Our family members and friends--those who know us best--are often most prepared to help us in our search, as Joseph's family helped him. The story of Lorenzo Odone, a six-year-old boy who developed adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), a rare fatal genetic disease, powerfully portrays the connection between family and questions of the heart.<br><br>The story opens when Lorenzo begins having trouble at school. Teachers meet with Lorenzo's parents, Michaela and Augusto, and explain that Lorenzo is often unresponsive in the classroom and should be placed in a special education program. Unconvinced that Lorenzo has a problem, the Odones argue that with the proper attention, Lorenzo will do fine in the regular classroom. But then Michaela notices some of the behavior problems at home. Lorenzo begins having accidents around the house, and when he plays outside with his friends, he seems to have difficulty at times controlling his arms and legs.<br><br>The Odones begin to worry that something is seriously wrong with their child, but when they take Lorenzo in for a medical examination, the physicians are unable to identify the problem. After a series of frustrating visits to the hospital, Michaela and Augusto finally find a physician who diagnoses Lorenzo's disease as ALD, a disease that strips away the myelin--the insulating tissue that surrounds the nerve endings. The doctor explains that there is no cure for the disease, that the medical profession is just beginning to understand what it is. The Odones plead with the doctor; they tell him that they will take Lorenzo anywhere for special treatment--anywhere they can find someone who is working on a cure. But the physician cannot help them. He looks over his desk at them and simply shakes his head, indicating that neither he nor anyone else can provide the help Lorenzo needs.<br><br>The next day Augusto goes to the local library and begins reading about ALD. He finds that the disease often leads to death within two years of diagnosis and that before the child dies, he gradually loses control of bodily functions, often experiencing blindness, deafness, and complete loss of speech and mobility. Augusto and Michaela cry out for help; they begin searching for answers to their son's problem. They seek help from God, as well as from the medical profession.<br><br>The Odones know that their time is short. They know that if they do not respond quickly, Lorenzo will die. As they continue to study the disease, they find that ALD makes it impossible for the body to digest fatty acids and that the rise in fatty-acid levels gradually destroys not only the body's myelin but all of the vital organs. The Odones' question becomes "How can we lower Lorenzo's levels of fatty acids?" After months of intensive study and personal prayer, they light upon the idea of using oleic acid, an extract from olive oil. When they administer the oleic acid to Lorenzo, they find that his fatty-acid levels indeed decrease, but the decrease plateaus at the halfway mark.<br><br>They watch in anguish as Lorenzo's condition deteriorates. Michaela, his mother, devotes herself so completely to his care that she begins to forget her own physical needs. At a point of deep discouragement, Augusto convinces Michaela that she must continue on and that they must extend their search for a cure to Lorenzo's illness.<br><br>Augusto returns to the library, studying all the scientific literature he can find on long-chain fatty acids. His search is intense; he thinks about Lorenzo's problem day and night. When his research fails to yield what he is looking for, he becomes frustrated and knows that he needs help from others who are seeking a cure for ALD. He and Michaela begin working with a medical researcher who is conducting studies on ALD; they appreciate his help but do not believe that he is bold enough to try new approaches. Augusto returns to the library again and again; the librarian becomes an important resource for Augusto, supplying him with scientific studies on long-chain fatty acids. Augusto begins building models of the fatty acids so that he can visualize what is happening inside Lorenzo's body.<br><br>After months of research, Augusto hypothesizes that an extract from rapeseed oil might be effective at reducing Lorenzo's fatty acids to normal levels. But then he finds that this oil is not approved for human consumption in the U.S., so he is unable to convince an American firm to produce the substance for him. Finally, he finds a chemist in England who agrees to help him. He is close to retirement but agrees to extract the substance from rapeseed oil so that Augusto can try it with Lorenzo. When the Odones receive the oil from the British chemist, Lorenzo's condition has already deteriorated significantly. They try the oil nonetheless and find that it indeed reduces Lorenzo's fatty acids to normal levels.<br><br>Although the Odones lived more than a century and a half after Joseph Smith, the two stories have some common threads. As was true for the Odones, Joseph's question sprang from the center of his being; in neither case was the question imposed from the outside. Neither teachers nor parents came to Joseph or to the Odones and<i>assigned</i>them to answer the question. In both cases the question arose out of love--in Joseph's case a love for God, and in the Odones' case a love for their son, Lorenzo. And both stories powerfully portray how the question laid claim on the person; neither Joseph nor the Odones could rest until they had found their answer.<br><br>Questions of the heart emerge on their own; we don't sit down one day and decide to create them. They come through the natural course of living the way God wants us to live. But once a question comes, it demands our full attention--we are compelled to action. We cannot rest, we cannot feel peace until we have found the answer or the answer has found us. We must lie in wait at times, wondering if the answer is obtainable. But then, without warning, it arrives--often in a form we did not expect, usually in a way that teaches us more than we set out to learn.<br><br>The search for truth demands that we have faith, that we ponder and pray, and that we open ourselves to guidance from others and from God. Such effort requires our utmost commitment, our maximum energy, our whole being. It is not a search in which we can enter and exit when a bell rings in a school building or when a class starts and stops or when a semester begins and ends. Once we have taken our first step on the path, we must follow it to its conclusion.<br><br>What I am suggesting is that teaching and learning seldom proceed in this way. Seldom do we follow our own questions, seldom do we exercise our faith as we should in the learning process, seldom do we ponder and pray over our learning as Christ asked the Nephites to do (3 Nephi 17:3), and seldom do we open ourselves to the kind of guidance we need as learners and teachers. I believe that only when we do these things will we experience the kind of education the Lord desires for us--only then will we receive an education that will fit us for eternity.<br><br>We often say that we came to BYU to "get" an education. But the education of the heart is not something we can "get." It comes to us indirectly as a free gift when we follow the Lord's will for us. As Arthur Henry King reminds us:<br><br><i>One of the mistakes we make over and over again in life is to go directly for the things we think are important. But if we aim at self-fulfillment, we shall never be fulfilled. If we aim at education, we shall never become educated. If we aim at salvation, we shall never be saved. These things are indirect, supreme results of doing something else; and the something else is service, it is righteousness, it is trying to do the right thing, the thing that needs to be done at each moment.</i>[<i>The Abundance of the Heart</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1986), p. 255]<br><br>For this very reason I've often wondered if the sign at the entrance to campus that says "Enter to learn, go forth to serve" should be reversed: "Enter to serve, go forth to learn." Too often formal learning, the way it is now carried out, points us inward and causes us to forget the needs of our neighbor. But the education of the heart is always connected in some way to service. Joseph was compelled to share what he had learned, first with his family and then with "every nation, kindred, tongue, and people" (Mosiah 3:20). The Odones likewise shared their discoveries first with their own son, later with other parents of ALD children, and finally with the entire medical community.<br><br>I do not pretend to know all of what it means to educate the heart, but I find it helpful to think of the process in three stages: the question, the search, and the fruits. Joseph's question led him into the grove, but his questioning did not end there. His entire life could be characterized as one of continual searching. Again and again he questioned, studied, exercised his faith, pondered, prayed, and sought guidance. The Odones continued their search as well until they found a cure for Lorenzo's disease. Their search was not an easy one. They wondered at times if they would ever succeed, if they were really capable of finding the cure they were looking for. But finally, with help from family and others who became their friends, their answer came.<br><br>The world often measures the quality of education by direct results--by the wealth, position, or fame that comes to someone. In formal education we often look for improved standardized test scores, higher self-esteem, critical thinking skills, or self-awareness. But the fruits of the heart's education are much greater than these worldly markers. As I have said, these fruits are indirect gifts that come from questioning and searching in the right way. There are many such fruits. I will mention six that I believe are the most central.<br><br>First,<i>sensibility.</i>When I was a young father, I remember rushing my five-year-old son to the emergency room, where a plastic surgeon was waiting to stitch a gash in my son's scalp that had resulted from a biking accident. The doctor allowed me to observe the entire treatment. What caught my attention were the doctor's hands as he cleaned the debris from under my son's scalp. He would move his thumb over the top of the scalp, feel a protrusion, lift up the skin and remove the particle of dirt or small pebble. He would then wash the wound and again use his thumb to feel for any remaining debris. I later decided that we had paid the doctor not so much for his ability to stitch up cuts, but for the sense of touch he had developed in his thumb. We were grateful for the doctor's<i>sensibility</i>(see 2 Nephi 2:11).<br><br>If I were to search through a stack of current books on education, I am confident I would not find the word<i>sensibility</i>in any of them. And yet it is one of the most important fruits of a good education. The term refers not only to one's ability to "perceive through the senses" (as the plastic surgeon used his sense of touch to clean my son's wound). It also includes one's ability to become aware of others' needs, to feel sympathy for another human being, and to perceive things clearly without confusion--to "make sense" of our world.<br><br>The education of the heart unifies our sensibilities so that we experience wholeness instead of fragmentation, clarity instead of confusion. Not only can we discern more readily between good and evil, we can see anew what we have seen before, hear anew what we have heard before, and know again what we have known before.<br><br>Second,<i>reverence.</i>As our power of discernment grows, our reverence for the Lord, his creations, and his children deepens.<i>Reverence</i>is another word I would have difficulty finding in books on teaching and learning. If anything, many educators often value<i>irreverence</i>because they believe that it shows one's ability to think critically. Just as the children of Israel gradually lost their sense of reverence for manna (see Numbers 11:1–15), so many today also have lost their sense of reverence for God's gifts to them.<br><br>This is one reason, I believe, President Kimball used to urge all the Saints to grow a garden. My father has always followed this prophetic counsel. In addition to growing vegetables, every summer my father grows a wide variety of strawflowers, harvests them, hangs them upside down to dry, and then spends the winter months preparing and arranging them. And his Parkinson's disease has not slowed my father's propensity to plant and to harvest. In fact, I have wondered if the flowers have actually slowed the progress of the disease. When I see his flower arrangements, I am reminded of the reverence my father has for life, and for beauty, and for the Giver of these precious gifts.<br><br>The education of the heart leads to a deeper reverence for all creation, for others, and for God as we form questions and search for answers. We are reminded that learning is a sacred act. As J. Reuben Clark said:<br><br><i>The gaining of knowledge is not to be like the commonplace work of earning a livelihood. He who invades the domain of knowledge must approach it as Moses came to the burning bush; he stands on holy ground; he would acquire things sacred; he seeks to make his own the attributes of Deity. ... We must come to this quest of truth--</i>in all regions of human knowledge whatsoever,<i>not only in</i>reverence,<i>but with a spirit of worship.</i>["Charge to President Howard S. McDonald at His Inauguration as President of the Brigham Young University,"<i>Improvement Era,</i>January 1946, p. 15; emphasis added]<br><br>Third,<i>humility.</i>Because learning is a form of repentance, we will always be humbled when we give up a false idea and embrace truth. As Alma taught Corianton, we must "let the justice of God, and his mercy, and his long-suffering have full sway in [our] heart; and let it bring [us] down to the dust in humility" (Alma 42:30).<br><br>Submission is an important part of humility. When we submit ourselves to truth, the unfamiliar takes on meaning and the uncomfortable begins to feel like home. At the beginning of their search for a cure to ALD, the Odones were intimidated by the scientific and medical worlds. The new scientific terms, the federal regulations, and the traditions of professional associations were foreign and frustrating. But as they searched for answers, the terms became<i>their</i>terms, the regulations and traditions became a natural part of the process. By the end of their search, the Odones had published scientific papers on ALD and had created their own professional associations.<br><br>The teachers and students who humble themselves will ponder and pray about what they are attempting to learn and to teach. They will seek guidance from others and from God. And as they seek such guidance, they will be humbled by the answers they receive. Seldom do we view the teacher as a seeker of truth along with students, as one who is willing to submit in truth and submit to truth. Such a view, I am convinced, would cause teachers to teach differently and students to learn differently.<br><br>Fourth,<i>edification.</i>My wife's mother is an expert in<i>edification.</i>When the children were young and visited their grandma, every visit required a thorough examination. She would say, "Open up your mouth so I can see if you've been good." She then proclaimed her diagnosis: "Oh, I can tell you've been good. I can always tell." No child ever questioned the need for grandma to look inside to see if they had been "good"; it seemed natural that their grandma would not be able to discern their goodness by examining their outward appearance. To see if they had been edified, she needed to look upon the heart.<br><br>We know we are experiencing edification when we are drawn closer to God, are more able to confront our challenges, are more at peace, and are less diverted by the tawdry and titillating things of the world. We recognize beauty and truth more readily and sense a greater need to serve those around us. As soon as Enos felt forgiveness, he desired to help his "brethren" (Enos 1:9). His heart was right, he was humble, he reverenced God, and he had the sensibility to know when God spoke peace to his heart. As healing came to his soul, he sensed the needs of those around him. And he wanted to help them. These are the results of edification.<br><br>Fifth,<i>inspiration.</i>When Adam was created, God "breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul" (Genesis 2:7). God's air was the breath of life--spiritual air that fused with Adam's body and made him a living soul. God literally<i>inspired</i>Adam, and at the very moment that God blew life into him, Adam inhaled so that he could receive God's<i>inspiration</i>(see<i>inspire</i>in<i>The Oxford English Dictionary).</i>Without both actions--God's breath and Adam's inhalation--Adam could not live.<br><br>Teaching and learning both require inspiration. When a teacher draws a student closer to truth, the teacher breathes life into the student. And when the student acts on the truth, the student breathes life into the teacher. Both inspire and are inspired as they engage in the education of the heart. They recognize that the inspiration they receive from each other comes from God and that the truth that comes to them is as necessary to the life of their soul as God's breath was to Adam's soul.<br><br>My own inspiration as a teacher often comes from students. And this inspiration doesn't just occur in the classroom. I've often said that my favorite assignment is to give away scholarships to deserving students. One such student was a single mother with four children who received a scholarship from a local business leader. At a luncheon honoring the donor, this single mother said:<br><br><i>Because of this scholarship, I will graduate next month. June will be one of the happiest months of my life because I will start paying income tax for the first time in several years. Yes, I'm excited to pay tax again instead of receiving it in welfare payments. People think I'm crazy, but it's true.</i><br><br>Students like this one inspire me. They breathe life into my soul.<br><br>Sixth,<i>joy.</i>If I were to ask students to tell me the first word that comes to their mind when I mention the word<i>learning,</i>few would say "joy." As students and teachers we often take the joy out of learning. The joy of finding truth that Joseph experienced and the joy of discovery that the Odones experienced occur too rarely in our lives as teachers and learners.<br><br>Joy can come only after we have tasted the other fruits of the education of the heart--when our sense of discernment has been quickened, when we have gained a reverence for truth and for beauty, when we have learned humility, and when we have been edified and inspired. Joy is the ultimate, all-encompassing fruit of the education of the heart.<br><br>The Odones experienced joy as they found a cure for their son's vicious disease. Joseph also experienced joy as the heavens opened and he received his answer. Through him, a fourteen-year-old boy prophet, came truths that had been hidden from view for centuries--truths that can liberate us all from our own pain and suffering if we will open ourselves to their healing power. I know that the Restoration was real, that Joseph's question was answered, and that as we allow the truths of the Restoration to find a place in us, we will change the ways we teach and the ways we learn--not only in our church assignments, or in BYU classrooms, but in our own homes.<br><br>I pray that as learners and teachers we will recognize our questions of the heart as they emerge, that we will earnestly search as Joseph did, and that we will receive the guidance we need from the Lord and from others who love us. It is my prayer that we will each taste the fruits of such a search, that our sensibilities will increase, that our reverence for the Lord and his creations will deepen, that as we humble ourselves, we will receive inspiration and be edified. Then we will understand the unity of all truth and be filled with a joy that "passeth all understanding" (Philippians 4:7). The Lord's name will be written on our heart, "indelibly engraved, [so that] no prosperity or adversity shall ever move us from [his] love." I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Russell T.

I am grateful the musical number could be delivered not only with talent, but with the Spirit. I appreciate Sister Glenna Woolf, the accompanist, and the duet by Gaye Beeson and her daughter Emily Galland. We hope, this morning, to be second and third and fourth witnesses of the testimonies borne at the just-concluded general conference. I thank Brother Williams for the spirit of his prayer.<br><br>We welcome those attending this morning who are a part of the Second Annual Family Expo Conference being sponsored by four BYU administrative units: the Division of Continuing Education, the Division of Religious Education, the BYU Alumni Association, and the College of Family, Home, and Social Sciences.<br><br>The theme of Family Expo is "Living After the Manner of Happiness," taken from a phrase used by Nephi to describe the condition of the Nephites about thirty years after their arrival from Jerusalem (see 2 Nephi 5:27). I wish to speak about how such happiness is possible and also about how, for many, the very idea of living happily is a problem. The title of my talk is actually "To Walk in the Light." I intend to show that happiness and walking in the light inescapably go together. I hope to portray the truth of Moroni 7, that the Spirit of Christ is given to each of us that we might know good from evil and that anything which invites and entices us to do good and to believe in Christ is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ (see verses 16–18).<br><br>Specifically, I hope to show that the gospel is a blessing. To do this I will speak of possibilities and problems. The prime possibility is, simply, that it is possible to live the gospel and to obey the commandments--and when we do, we experience happiness, which is the lot of those who live righteously. I have met not a few people who consider the idea that we can be happy if we are obedient a naive notion. Some people feel it is naive because we can't be obedient all the time, and others feel it unrealistic to expect to be happy at all. Therein is the problem I must address.<br><br>The major problem is that we have abundant evidence that we do not always live according to the possibility of obedience and, consequently, are not always happy. If you want a quick example of what I mean, imagine the counsel to "love thy neighbor as thyself" as you make your way home in rush-hour traffic. Some observers, seeing what they call a mismatch between belief and behavior, assume that our behavior is not completely changeable. Therefore, they examine beliefs, especially religious beliefs, as a great threat to our happiness. Once the problem is cast this way, it requires us to choose between our beliefs and what is realistic. What a dichotomy! If we choose beliefs, we are doomed to guilt and inescapable feelings of inadequacy. If we choose being realistic, we sabotage the power of our beliefs to be meaningful in the real world. This trap has helped give true religion a bad name by discounting its value in everyday life. A classic example of this approach to the problem is the sarcastic definition of Puritanism that many of you have heard. "Puritanism--The haunting fear that someone, somewhere, may be happy" (H. L. Mencken,<i>A Mencken Chrestomathy</i>[New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1949], p. 624).<br><br>How are we to handle ourselves when there is a difference between our beliefs and the way we live? Some think that because all of us have sinned and have "come short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23) that we must have an excuse. And some think that if we do not have that excuse, we cannot escape the gloomy feelings that come from never being able to measure up. We must then suffer these feelings, it seems, if not eternally, then at least daily, and especially whenever we get an inkling that we can relax or actually enjoy life. To escape such feelings, we often invoke explanations for our wrong behavior, such as "nobody's perfect." Rarely is that phrase spoken as a simple statement of fact. Often it is spoken as an excuse for wrongdoing, as when Jimmy is confronted in the morning by his failure to do the dishes and clean the kitchen as he had promised. A second ideal excuse is the phrase "Don't lay a guilt trip on me," which could be spoken by Jimmy as someone is about to talk to him about the dishes. The task here seems to be how to accept the Lord's word that we can be obedient and simultaneously deal with the evidence that we don't do what is claimed by the Lord to be possible for us to do. How can the gospel be a gospel of hope or happiness in this scenario? Our choices seem to be between not being too hard on ourselves or not taking our beliefs too seriously.<br><br>An example of what I am talking about could be your feelings about the message of the song we just heard. Some of you, "ere you left your room this morning,"<i>did</i>think to pray ("Did You Think to Pray?"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 140). Others, as you listened to the song, found yourselves wishing you had done so, and in meekness resolved that tomorrow morning will be different than this morning. Still, a few others of you might have decided not only to continue to pray each morning but also to pray with full purpose of heart, with a desire to do good, with an interest in not being a stumbling block to others. Your thoughts might have included the plea of "More Holiness Give Me" (<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 131) or the recognition that the intensity of your prayers is often related to the various demands facing you on any given day, be they academic, familial, or related to your physical health or your spiritual well-being. I claim that responses such as all of these are symptoms of being meek and lowly of heart and of being uplifted when spiritual truths are told to you. You accept the song as affirming where your heart ought to be at the beginning of the day. You simply determine either to continue the practice or to do better and say a prayer in your heart that both tonight and tomorrow you will retreat in silent, secret prayer. In other words, for those of you who did not pray this morning, but who are willing to live after the manner of happiness or to walk in the light, rather than being guilty, despairing, or resentful that the song reminds you that you do not measure up, you accept the light and truth it offers and seek to live better tomorrow than you did today. These types of feelings are usually signs of being willing to admit your shortcomings and to be heartened by a gospel that invites and entices you to do good. If there is guilt, it is guilt unto repentance and nothing more.<br><br>But it is possible the song meant something different to a group of you. Some might have found the message painful. The reaction could have been more like this: "No, I didn't pray this morning--are you trying to make me feel guilty about it? Besides, do you have any idea how impossible it is to get a moment's peace in the morning with roommates flying about everywhere in the rush to get to school? And if I really did pray every morning, I risk being translated. That's all I need--to leave school in the middle of the semester and have a bunch of UWs on my transcript."<br><br>If any of you really were troubled by a musical invitation to pray, in the way I am illustrating, the case might be made that you would have been better off not to have heard the invitation at all. That would be an example of not wanting our beliefs to be confronted by our behavior, lest we be made to feel bad.<br><br>A more extreme case of how the truth can seem troubling is that of the responses of Laman and Lemuel to Nephi's rehearsal of how the gospel would be restored to Lehi's seed by the Gentiles in the latter days. Laman and Lemuel had been in dispute concerning the meaning of Lehi's dream. In Nephi's words:<br><br><i>For he</i>[Lehi]<i>truly spake many great things unto them, which were hard to be understood, save a man should inquire of the Lord; and they being hard in their hearts, therefore they did not look unto the Lord as they ought.</i>[1 Nephi 15:3]<br><br>Nevertheless, after Nephi rehearsed many truths to them, including the restoration of the Jews in the latter days, Laman and Lemuel "were pacified and did humble themselves before the Lord" (l Nephi 15:19–20).<br><br>This is not a story with a happy ending, of course, in either the short or the long run, because as Nephi went on to answer their questions about the features of Lehi's dream--giving them the meaning of the tree of life, the rod of iron, and the river, including how, through justice, the wicked would be separated from the righteous--Laman and Lemuel changed their hearts again. Their response to Nephi now was, "Thou hast declared unto us hard things, more than we are able to bear" (1 Nephi 16:1). Nephi's response to them (I assume sorrowfully and not cheerfully) was:<br><br><i>I said . . . that I knew that I had spoken hard things against the wicked, according to the truth; and the righteous have I justified, and testified that they should be lifted up at the last day; wherefore, the guilty taketh the truth to be hard, for it cutteth them to the very center.</i><br><br><i>And now my brethren, if ye were righteous and were willing to hearken to the truth, and give heed unto it, that ye might walk uprightly before God, then ye would not murmur because of the truth.</i>[1 Nephi 16:2–3]<br><br>This looks like a classic example of the problem we are addressing: How can we hold to our beliefs and still be at peace in the world? From Laman and Lemuel's perspective, that probably is not possible. To them, Nephi is the source of their emotional misery. But if scriptural truths were taken seriously, another view is possible altogether. For example, from the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>And the Spirit giveth light to every man that cometh into the world; and the Spirit enlighteneth every man . . . that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit.</i><br><br><i>And everyone that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit cometh unto God, even the Father.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:46–47]<br><br>We have been given a light, and living by it will lead us to God. More specifically, we know about the author of that light, and the testimony of John is relevant:<br><br><i>In the beginning was the Word . . . and the Word was God. . . .</i><br><br><i>In him was life; and the life was the light of men.</i><br><br><i>And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.</i><br><br><i>There was a man sent from God, whose name was John</i>[this refers to John the Baptist].<br><br><i>The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.</i><br><br><i>He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.</i><br><br><i>That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</i>[John 1:1, 4–9]<br><br>The problem Laman and Lemuel face is not a burdensome gospel but a reflection of their own hard-heartedness--their refusal to come into or walk in the light.<br><br>The hope to be drawn from this situation is that it reveals our search for happiness as Latter-day Saints is not really a choice between having to excuse ourselves or discount the gospel. The solution is in repentance and obedience, which I claim is available to us in every moment. By repenting we take the gospel seriously. By obedience, we act as agents, capable of acting on the environment and not being acted upon. By choosing the right, we reveal we are not hard-hearted, so we don't have to excuse ourselves.<br><br>Now, we, as children of the Restoration, proclaim ourselves to be moral agents. But the meaning of being a moral agent is not so much a matter of free choice as it is a matter of free obedience. God will force no man or woman to heaven. Because of the Atonement of Christ, our future is in our hands, and that future is either liberty and eternal life or captivity and death (see 2 Nephi 2:27).<br><br>Laman and Lemuel were miserable and found the truth to be hard only when they were hard-hearted. In those moments when they humbled themselves, they began to seek meaning and understanding. When they walked uprightly before God, their murmuring against the truth ceased. But when they returned to living hard-heartedly, the truth was a hard thing. Laman and Lemuel found the gospel not to be what it is but what<i>they</i>were. Our own experience may teach us the same thing.<br><br>Here is an example from my own experience of how our attitudes change when we move from being hard-hearted (or walking in darkness) to being brokenhearted (or walking in the light). When we moved to Utah from New Mexico and bought a pine siding house, we didn't know that it would drink gallons of stain. Every year! I neglected it the first year. But by the second year the need for care was obvious, and I set out to complete the task in the month of July. I figured that if I began July first, scraping off the paint that was peeling, I could apply the rejuvenating, absorbent stain and be finished by July thirty-first. On August twenty-eighth I was finishing the last wall. It was a hot day--I was feeling martyred and had tripled my frustration level by occasionally getting the dark brown stain on the two yards of light buff brick at the bottom of the wood. I would break out the solvent-soaked rags from my rub-it-off-quick kit, wipe off the bricks, and then go back to rolling on the stain. Out of the corner of my eye I saw our station wagon come around the corner and remembered that my wife had taken our preschooler to the mall for a new outfit.<br><br>I knew two things about my daughter. First, she would come home wearing whatever they had purchased. Second, she would promptly show me. In that moment, I had a feeling consistent with living in the light. It was not necessarily a feeling born of rationality, although some of you would think that any rational person would have acted on this feeling. But the feeling and thought was a moral one and consisted of the idea that I ought to lean the roller against the wood and walk so that I would be standing between the five-gallon bucket of stain and my soon-to-be-coming-around-the-corner daughter. That is exactly what a person walking in the light would have done. But I did a very Lemuel-like thing. I resisted the light within me. Immediately, my thoughts and feelings changed. The first thought was one that would get me off the hook for any future doom that might occur. The thought was, "I sure hope Karen has the sense to keep Cammie from running over here." I also remember muttering to myself, "If I have one more interruption today . . ." Here comes Cammie around the corner. Now, remember, I am now living in darkness. The problem I am about to have is not a matter of IQ but of honesty--or should I say<i>dis</i>honesty. I am not being true to the light within me.<br><br>At this point I did what hard-hearted people often do instead of act. I talked. "Cammie, look out, stay back, don't . . . !" I quickly rushed over and, still holding the stain roller away from her, was able to deftly push her away from a collision course with the stain bucket. I pushed her down. Her knee hit the only sprinkler head within about twenty feet. I asked (feigning concern), "Are you all right?" Real compassionate. I sent her in the house after being semi-relieved that though she had gotten a grass stain on her new slacks, she had not torn them. I sighed to myself about how hard life can sometimes be. A few minutes later I came to my senses. That is, I returned to the light--which is to say, I softened my heart. I then saw my role in creating and maintaining a problem. In fact, as Terry Warner has pointed out, for the hard-hearted, the very way I saw the problem was the problem. The way I saw was an expression of the condition of my heart. What I saw and felt was what hard-hearted people see and feel. I was blind to the reminder from the Lord that<br><br><i>if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:67]<br><br>In my hard-hearted moment I didn't comprehend anything, not even the joy of a little girl wanting to share a joyful moment with her father.<br><br>So, to review briefly: To find invitations to truth either burdensome or beneficial may reveal more about us than about the quality of the message. The truths of the gospel are best understood when offered and received in love. To live after the manner of happiness is to seek the truth and to acknowledge what we could do if we only would. To find the truth burdensome may be the same as saying the gospel, in everyday life, is unrealistic. Alternatively, to find the truth comforting is a source of hope for our own improvement and future possibilities of peace and harmony. That is why my prayer is that we were all softhearted and willing to receive the light of today's hymn "Did You Think to Pray?" If we receive the little things, I am convinced we are more likely to receive the big things regarding gospel truths. After all, it is out of small things that comes that which is great.<br><br>So let's examine ourselves for a moment. Do we sometimes hold our beliefs in ways that discount their value to us in everyday life? Do we commit to faith or repentance or forgiveness or sacrifice in the abstract, but in the very situations that demand these activities of us do we find our beliefs unrealistic or too impractical or in some other way inadequate? Do we suspend our belief in them? Such an approach would be in contrast to what we do when attending a play that portrays a fantasy or when we go to a science fiction movie. We have heard that in order for us to enjoy such presentations that there must be a "willing suspension of disbelief." With respect to the gospel in everyday life, I am afraid we sometimes engage in a "willing suspension of belief" lest we actually have to live by what we espouse. In the very moment we need to live by our principles or beliefs we often abandon them.<br><br>For example, we may say we believe in forgiveness, but when confronted by injustice we refuse to seek the Lord's help to forgive. We proudly proclaim our belief in prophets until they require something like lengthening our stride or daily reading of the Book of Mormon or being more gentle. Perhaps we believe we ought to love our neighbor as ourselves, but then put ourselves down in ways we wouldn't think of doing to a neighbor. In hundreds of ways we excuse ourselves from living in the ways we affirm are the ways we believe we ought to, or we seem to find certain commandments as beneath us or as impossible. These excuses could extend to something as simple as morning prayer or giving your heart to a child or asking the Lord to help us understand the prayers of our fathers regarding a tree, a river, and a rod of iron.<br><br>And what are the consequences of excusing ourselves in these ways? Supposedly we are being realistic. We console ourselves that we are not rigid. We are pleased we seem not to be guilty of taking ourselves too seriously. Yet such rationalizations imply that it is the gospel we are not taking seriously; it is our beliefs we are reconsidering. Our realism comes at the cost of our commitments.<br><br>Counsel against such an approach comes from James, the brother of the Lord. His encouragement is particularly compelling since the evidence seems to be that none of Christ's brothers or sisters came to accept him until after his crucifixion. They were hearers for a time and not doers. But James did eventually come into the fold and knew what life was like both before and after the gospel of Christ was delivered. James, having been converted, exhorts:<br><br><i>But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</i><br><br><i>For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:</i><br><br><i>For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.</i>[James 1:22–24]<br><br>In the moment we cease being doers of the truths we know, we forget who we are. I forgot who I was when I resisted the prompting to put down the roller and go to my child.<br><br>Here is an example of the problem from a sixteen-year-old high school student in California who, not being a member of the Church, had only the Light of Christ to guide him. He reported a time when he was not a doer of the things he felt in his heart to do:<br><br><i>My mother sent me to the grocery store for avocados and lettuce with the counsel not to dillydally. As I was hurrying into the supermarket I encountered an older woman almost hobbling out of the store under the weight of two obviously heavy bags of groceries. I instantly felt I ought to help her with her burden, but in that same instant I stiffened and walked right by her. I made my way to the produce section and realized that my mind was not on avocados and lettuce but on the woman.</i><br><br><i>What I didn't like was what kind of thoughts I was having toward her. I was mulling over feelings like "Dumb lady, hasn't she ever heard of shopping carts?" or "Where are the boys who bag and carry out the groceries when you need them?" I realized at this point that I had intense feelings--negative feelings--about someone I didn't even know. How could I be so resentful?</i><br><br><i>Then I paid attention to my belief that I should have helped the woman. Immediately my resentment dissolved into remorse. I don't mean I wallowed around in guilt all afternoon or anything, but I saw clearly that not acting according to my conscience was what produced my feelings. Had I offered to help, I would have been the kind of person I believed in being. But as soon as I went against myself, I was troubled.</i><br><br>By the way, this student's analysis was in response to a question we often ask as part of a high school citizenship curriculum we have developed. We had asked the class to report on a time when they felt something was right to do. We did not ask them the question in James' language, of being "doers of the word," but it was the same question nonetheless. And this student's answer gave us an example of how we think or feel when we are hearers only, for he told us of a time when he felt something was right to do and he didn't do it.<br><br>In scriptural terms, James described this act more boldly when he said, "To him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin" (James 4:17). This student might not understand having his behavior toward the woman described as "sin," but his own understanding of what he was doing when he was refusing to help the woman is consistent with what the curriculum was about to unfold. This high school student's description of what happened to him when he violated his conscience echoes Terry Warner's description of what happens when we betray ourselves, when we go against what we believe to be right. When we sin in this way, or when we walk in darkness, we transform our understanding of the situation so that we appear to be victims rather than agents. We see others as the source of our troubles. We deceive ourselves about the meaning of the events we are experiencing. John the apostle described our condition in such moments as, "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us" (1 John 1:8).<br><br>In other words, when we are only hearers of the words we believe in we are troubled, but we are deceived about the meaning of our troubles. Dr. Warner has described the act that produces self-deception as self-betrayal; that is, simply, willfully doing that which we believe to be wrong. Or, as one of Dr. Warner's preschoolers once said, when asked to define self-betrayal, "It is when you know what is right but you don't do it, and you are fussed in your mind."<br><br>The California high school student who told us about the woman, the groceries, and his conscience didn't know our vocabulary; he didn't know the scriptures. But he described his experience in simple, honest, direct terms. He understood something about the way he was changed when he didn't honor his conscience. In the language we are using today we could say that, for a brief period, he went from living after the manner of happiness to living some other way. He went from walking in the light to walking in darkness. But then he gave up his deceived view of the situation (meaning he returned to the light), and, while explaining himself to us, honestly saw his role in creating his own resentments.<br><br>Here is another example from my own experience. More than a decade ago I was watching an NCAA basketball tournament game. The house was quiet because the young children were asleep and the older children were waxing responsible and attacking their homework. I thought, This is great! A free night! No interruptions! Such are the feelings of one whose heart gets too easily set on the things of the world. The game was going magnificently. With 2:08 minutes left in the first half, one of my high school daughters came downstairs and made a request: "Dad, I'm stuck on this math problem. Could you help me?"<br><br>At that moment I was struck by a very human feeling. The feeling was inescapable. If put into words it would be something like "I believe helping her is the right, fatherly, responsible, loving, committed thing to do." I simultaneously betrayed that feeling. The next few moments were predictable. I looked pained. I whined some question to my daughter like "Do you have any idea how often I get to watch a playoff game?"<br><br>She was unmoved: "Well, it shouldn't take too long, if you would just . . ."<br><br>I interrupted her.<br><br>Terry: "Have you worked out the sample problem they give you at the beginning of the chapter?"<br><br>Daughter: "Well, no, but . . ."<br><br>Terry: "Well, how do you expect me to help if you haven't even tried? Do you want me to do your work for you?"<br><br>Daughter: "Not exactly, I just . . ."<br><br>Terry: "When is this assignment due, Kathie?"<br><br>Daughter: "It's due tomorrow, and . . ."<br><br>Terry: "How many times have I told you not to leave things until the last minute?!"<br><br>By this time her lower lip was starting to curl out in a sort of defensive martyrdom. She withdrew, haughtily enough that I could comfort myself by saying that if she really were responsible she would have tried harder before asking me.<br><br>Such are the feelings of the self-deceived. Like the high school student who couldn't concentrate on lettuce and avocados anymore because of his violation of conscience, so I didn't concentrate on the game much. My eyes were on the screen but I wasn't seeing anything. I was muttering in my mind, something I've come to see is typical when we are hard-hearted or when we knoweth to do good and doeth it not. I was rehearsing thoughts about why I was right and why my daughter was wrong.<br><br>The apostle John had me pegged:<br><br><i>He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.</i><br><br><i>He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.</i><br><br><i>But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.</i>[1 John 2:9–11]<br><br>I was as blind in that moment as I had been with my other daughter and the stain. Now, lest you think I walk in darkness all the time, and thereby give you an excuse to use my behavior as an excuse for when you do as I have done, I must say I also have seen, honored, and walked in the light--and did in both of these situations. I sought out my preschooler and asked her forgiveness. I went upstairs after my math daughter retreated and offered help and an apology. I have been informed in heart and mind, again by John:<br><br><i>This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.</i><br><br><i>If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:</i><br><br><i>But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.</i>[1 John 1:5–7]<br><br>Also: "Whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him" (1 John 2:5).<br><br>Here are four implications of what I hope I have illustrated:<br><br>1. It is possible to walk in the light. Taking the Savior's mission, atonement, and testimony seriously is always the beginning point.<br><br>2. The blessing of moral agency is not that it is a matter of free choice but of free obedience.<br><br>3. When we do walk in the light, we experience life differently than when we walk in darkness. The gospel of the Restoration is not a gospel of guilt and despair but of light and love and hope.<br><br>4. When we go against the light we are blind to the truth. It is a self-inflicted blindness that departs when we give up our hardheartedness. It is always possible to come out of the dark.<br><br>We began by addressing how we can take the gospel seriously and accept the idea that it is realistic to walk in the light. We have seen that when people abandon the light, life gets harder. We learned, perhaps, what Peter learned after the Savior's bread-of-life sermon at Capernaum. The Savior had testified that he was the Messiah, that he would be killed and be resurrected, that all who would come to the Father must accept him.<br><br><i>Many . . . of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it? . . .</i><br><br><i>From that time many of his disciples . . . walked no more with him.</i><br><br><i>Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?</i><br><br>[Peter's answer is the answer anyone walking in the light would give:]<i>Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.</i><br><br><i>And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.</i>[John 6:60, 66–69]<br><br>Truly, when we turn our backs on the light we find the sweet truths of the gospel to be bitter, for there is no place else to go. The sobering truth of the gospel is that there is no other way, and the comfort and hope of the gospel is that it is the way to happiness.<br><br>I pray that you will measure what has been spoken today by comparing it to the scriptures, to the living prophets, including what was delivered to us this past weekend, and to your own experience when walking in the light, sifting the wheat from the chaff. I pray we will turn our hearts to the Savior in everyday life, in the little things, and be willing to see how out of small things comes that which is great. I testify that Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph Smith is the prophet of the foretold Restoration, and that when we live by the light and truth we have, we find life a blessing and our yokes easy and our burdens light. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Terrance D.

<h1>me to “Get Real” - Marie K. Hafen - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I recently heard a sentence that caught my attention: It is better to<i>be</i>than to<i>seem.</i>I've been thinking about this idea--about what it means and how it applies.<br><br>Hamlet's mother asked him why he was so concerned about the death of his father, "Why seems it so particular with thee?"<br><br>Hamlet answered, "Seems, madam! Nay, it is; I know not<i>seems"</i>(William Shakespeare,<i>Hamlet,</i>act 1, scene 2, lines 75–76). I have come to feel with Hamlet that it<i>is</i>better to be than to seem. Merely<i>seeming</i>thwarts our development. We cannot truly grow if we remain inside an illusion. But<i>being</i>or<i>being real,</i>as taught by the gospel, encourages rather than stifles our relationship with God and encourages rather than stifles our relationships with others, including dating relationships. In fact, there are many good reasons for saying it is better to be than to seem.<br><br>Here's an example: A grandfather had just finished telling his grandson a story when the little boy asked, "Grandpa, was that a true story or were you just preaching?" The little boy was innocent in asking the question, but the underlying assumption in the<i>way</i>he asked it is that preaching, or religion, is not something to be taken seriously. A true story, on the other hand, is<i>real.</i>The idea that preaching is not real, that it doesn't apply to real life, can lead to superficial thinking about religion in general and about vital religious concepts--such as repentance, specifically.<br><br>An example of this kind of superficial thinking about repentance is when a person sins while planning to repent. As stated in the Church booklet "<a href="https://www.lds.org/youth/for-the-strength-of-youth?cid=YS-M-youthstrength&amp;amp;lang=eng"><span style="color: #33cccc;">For the Strength of Youth</span></a>," "Some people knowingly break God's commandments [even while] they plan to repent before they go on a mission or receive the sacred covenants and ordinances of the temple" (p. 17). There is something especially perverse about "planning to repent" in the very act of transgression. This attitude twists the sublime source of our healing until it actually inflicts<i>more</i>sickness, like poisoning the water in a hospital for wounded soldiers. That is wounding the soldiers twice.<br><br>This kind of shallow thinking can begin early. I know well two brothers I'll call Steve and Scott, ages nine and seven. Steve had been baptized; Scott would be baptized soon. One day their father caught Scott heading for the candy counter at the neighborhood grocery store with a quarter that did not belong to him. As Scott and his dad sat down to talk about the seriousness of stealing, Scott was at first very penitent. But then he looked up brightly and said, "But Dad, Steve said it's okay to steal things until you're eight!"<br><br>Startled, the father went to find Steve, his young theologian, to ask him why he would say such a thing. Steve replied confidently with a shrug, "Yeah, that's what I told him. When he's eight, he'll be baptized and all his sins will be washed away. So I say, Live it up!"<br><br>Sometimes, while preparing to attend BYU or to go on a mission or to be married in the temple, a young person can be tempted to "live it up," so long as he or she "just repents" before the deadline. Paul describes these foolish ones as wanting "to enjoy the pleasures of sin<i>for a season"</i>(Hebrews 11:25; emphasis added). But when the season ends, as seasons inevitably do, the stain of sin is still there when the pleasures have turned to ashes. Some even feel it is their "right" to romp in the mud of transgression right up to the moment they take their spiritual shower of repentance.<br><br>This kind of thinking is like acting in a dress rehearsal, unrealistically relaxing in the knowledge that the real performance is not now but in the future.<br><br>Prince Hal, a character in Shakespeare's<i>King Henry the Fourth, Part</i>1, is just such a dress rehearsal actor. His father, King Henry IV, desperately wants Hal to prepare to become king (like many fathers want their sons to prepare for missions); however, Hal is off in Eastcheap at the Boar's Head Tavern "living it up" with Falstaff and his other low-life friends--wine, women, and jokes. Hal is deliberately planning to play for a while. But then, dramatically, he will "imitate the sun," and when he (and listen to this language) "please[s] again to<i>be</i>himself," he will break "through the foul and ugly mists of vapors that did<i>seem</i>to strangle him." Hal somehow thinks that his repentance will then make him look downright heroic. He will be "like bright metal on a sullen ground," the "reformation glitt'ring o'er my fault, Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes" than if he had not lived it up at all (see act 1, scene 2; emphasis added). Hal is far more interested in his future<i>looking</i>good than he is in his present<i>being</i>good.<br><br>Planning to sin now in the rehearsal and repent later in real life is like walking across the stage of your life with the trapdoor double size and wide open.<br><br>How important is reality? Jacob, that sensitive, poetic prophet, tells us:<br><br><i>For the Spirit speaketh the truth and lieth not. Wherefore, it speaketh of things as they really are, and of things as they really will be; wherefore, these things are manifested unto us plainly, for the salvation of our souls.</i>[Jacob 4:13]<br><br>What is the risk of<i>not</i>seeing things "as they really are"? Just the salvation of our souls. We may indeed be strangled by those "foul and ugly mists of vapors." Conversely, what is the<i>benefit</i>of seeing things as they really are? Just the salvation of our souls. We know deep down, as Prince Hal did, who we really are and what we really ought to be doing. It is time to get real.<br><br>Lowell L. Bennion, a great teacher, was once asked, "Is a person better off if he rebels and then repents or if he never rebels at all?" Brother Bennion replied, "It is better to strive to live righteously than to give way to weakness and have to fight to come back." He continued, "I have never known a truly penitent person who was glad for his sins. They are never a pleasant memory, and memory is part of the stuff of which life is made."<br><br>Another reason, as Brother Bennion put it, is:<br><br><i>The repentant life appears to be so beautiful, one is tempted to rationalize his weakness or desire in order to be a penitent hero. The danger here is that one never knows his strength or how he might feel in a different style of life. He may lose his will to repent once involved in the passing pleasures of unwholesome living.</i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/new-era/1972/04/qa-questions-and-answers?lang=eng"><span style="color: #33cccc;">Q &amp;amp; A</span></a>,"<i>New Era,</i>April 1972, p. 9]<br><br>Sadly, those like Prince Hal, who frivolously engage in what they think is a penalty-free romping time, may discover too late that they cannot wash every stain from their clothes and hands. Of course, repentance, when it is genuine and complete, can restore our spiritual standing before God. But even then, the entanglements of sin--the bent fenders and the broken hearts, the addictions and the lost opportunities, the unwanted children and the unfortunate marriages, the bills to pay and the fences to mend--these may never wash away.<br><br>Moreover, once sin's swift current carries us downstream, we can't always just turn around at will and swim back, against the current, to our point of beginning. We don't have that much control over our lives. For example, one of the most exciting football games in BYU history was the so-called Miracle Bowl in 1980 against SMU. The Cougars were behind four touchdowns with only minutes to play. Then, amazingly, they came roaring back to win the game with an onside kick and a Hail Mary pass in the final seconds.<br><br>The next year, in an early game, BYU fell far behind against a very strong team. Our ten-year old daughter said, "You know, this is a lot more fun for everybody--let the other team get way ahead and then just pass them up like we did last year!" But it wasn't to be--the Cougars were soundly defeated, and our daughter had to rethink her philosophy about the thrill of coming from behind. She found she had to get real about playing against tough competition. And Satan is a tough competitor.<br><br>The deadly AIDS epidemic illustrates graphically the tragedy of ignoring the consequences of sin. For example, some well-traveled athletes and entertainers have been stunned to find that, because of their sexual promiscuity, they are now infected with the AIDS virus. Some of them recently discovered that their carefree lifestyles could cost them their lives. And beyond that, they may have unknowingly infected their spouses and children, those who mean the most to them. Last year, in a<i>Sports Illustrated</i>interview, Magic Johnson said his greatest fear in having AIDS is that he might have unwittingly infected his new wife, Cookie, and the baby she was expecting. But upon such a realization, even if one were to repent, there is no way to call back the seeds of destruction scattered in the past.<br><br>We cannot live a high-risk life as if it were just an illusion--or a rehearsal. As the apostle James said of people jet-setting carelessly through life:<br><br><i>We will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:</i><br><br><i>Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour</i>[that word again],<i>that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.</i>[James 4:13–14]<br><br>It<i>is</i>time to get real.<br><br>Some may rationalize their sinning or wanting to sin by saying, "If I have sinned, then I will be better able to understand and help others who are repenting to overcome their sins." Lowell Bennion refuted this false reasoning when he said:<br><br><i>The only life free of sin known among men was that of the Savior. Did his life suffer from its strength and purity?</i><br><br><i>The rest of us will know weakness and sin without seeking them out. In fact, despite our best efforts, there will be failures and sinful acts of omission and commission.</i>[Bennion, "Q &amp;amp; A," pp. 9–10]<br><br>One of my students underscored Brother Bennion's point when he wrote in a personal essay:<br><br><i>No sin will</i>[in and of itself]<i>make one wiser. Earlier in this semester a roommate came home drunk, telling me that he could relate to kids in drug rehab because he used to be a drug addict. If that were true, then Christ would have been a better Savior if he had been a sinner. We know that this is not true.</i><br><br>And, finally, planning to sin and then repent is an affront to the Savior because it assumes that we control our own forgiveness. While we must do all we can do to be worthy of Christ's grace, we cannot turn that miraculous power on and off like a water faucet. He loves us no matter what we do, but he forgives only the honest in heart--and on his terms, not on ours. Because we lack the power to compensate fully for the effects of our sins, we are utterly dependent on Jesus Christ. Without his holy atonement, no amount of agonizing repentance could return us to God's presence. We dare not trifle with so sacred a reality. But the Good News is, when we do fully repent in the honesty of a broken heart and contrite spirit--no seeming, no pretending--he will do all the rest. Thank God, literally, that is under<i>his</i>control, not ours; for only he has enough power to make our scarlet sins be white as snow.<br><br>To be is also better than to seem in dating relationships. You want to appear to be the most beautiful, or the most handsome, the smartest (or at least to be able to speak a coherent sentence), the funniest, or the most sincere--in other words, to put on your best face. As someone said, "Be sincere, whether you mean it or not." At times the face we put on for other people can become a facade, another way of seeming, a mask to hide behind. How can you avoid the seeming and encourage the real being in dating so that things as they really are can be the basis for your relationships with friends of the opposite sex?<br><br>When Moses came down from Mount Sinai, he did not bring the Ten Suggestions, he brought the Ten Commandments. I'm not bringing ten commandments but nine practical suggestions about how you might find fulfilled, romantic reality.<br><br><b>First, be your own best self.</b>An eighteen-year-old young woman I know recently got up her courage to ask a mighty senior, a guy she'd had a crush on for weeks, to a big preference dance. The day before the dance she came to her mother in obvious frustration.<br><br>"Mom, what am I going to do?" she asked, her brow furrowed. "My face looks terrible. Look at these zits! You could do a dot-to-dot. Besides that, what am I going to talk about? I don't know what to say. He'll think I'm stupid."<br><br>Her mother tried not just to comfort her but to teach her: "Just be yourself. Maybe it would help to look at the conversation from his point of view. Talk about things in which you both have some interest. That way you can be yourself and still be interested in him. Don't worry so much about him being a 'date.' Think of him first as a friend."<br><br><b>Second, during your dating, please be emotionally honest in expressing affection, because those expressions must also involve being, not just seeming.</b>Imagine that same little boy I quoted earlier seeing his grandparents exchange a kiss, then later asking, "Was that real love, Grandpa, or were you just kissing?"<br><br>Sometimes you are not as careful as you might be about when, how, and to whom you show affection. The desire for that expression can be motivated by forces and needs other than true love. In addition, even when--or especially when--true love may be present, that is only more reason to nourish love's integrity as you look toward the genuine, lasting fulfillment of your longing for real love. Erich Fromm put it this way:<br><br><i>Desire can be stimulated by the anxiety of aloneness, by the wish to conquer or be conquered, by vanity, by the wish to hurt and even to destroy, as much as it can be stimulated by love. It seems that sexual desire can easily blend with and be stimulated by any strong emotion, of which love is only one. Because sexual desire is in the minds of most people coupled with the idea of love, they are easily misled to conclude that they love each other when they want each other physically. ...</i>[But]<i>if</i>[this]<i>desire ... is not stimulated by</i>[real]<i>love, ... it ... leaves strangers as far apart as they were before--sometimes it makes them ashamed of each other, or even makes them hate each other, because when the</i>illusion<i>has gone they feel their estrangement even more markedly than before.</i>[<i>The Art of Loving</i>(New York: Harper and Row, 1956), pp. 45–46]<br><br>In short, save your kisses--you might need them some day. Remember also that a kiss symbolizing love and respect is different from a kiss of self-centered passion. When you are given entrance to the heart of a trusting young friend, know that you stand on holy ground. In such a place you must be honest--real--with yourself and with your friend about love and the expression of its symbols.<br><br><b>Third, be friends first.</b>Lowell Bennion once said that relationships between young men and women should be built like a pyramid. The base of the pyramid is friendship. The ascending layers are built of such dimensions as time, understanding, respect, and restraint. At the top of the pyramid is a glittering little mystery called romance. When weary travelers in the desert see from afar that glitter on top of the pyramid, they may not realize all that must lie beneath the jewel to give it such prominence and hold it so high. A pyramid won't stand up if you stand it on its point instead of on its base. So, be friends first and sweethearts later, not the other way around. That way, when you do become sweethearts, it will<i>be</i>love and not just seem like love.<br><br><b>Fourth, develop the power of self-restraint.</b>Be like Joseph, not like David. When Potiphar's wife tried to seduce Joseph, he "fled, and got him out" (Genesis 39:12). He knew that it was wiser to avoid temptation than to resist it. King David, by contrast, somehow developed too much confidence in his own ability to handle temptation. He was tragically willing to flirt with evil, and it destroyed him. Even when you feel there is a growing foundation of love in your courtship, show your<i>real</i>respect for that love and the possibilities of your life together. Exercise self-restraint as Alma advised Shiblon in this paradox: "Bridle ... your passions [so] that ye may be filled with love" (Alma 38:12). It is not that cheap thrills are too satisfying but that they are not satisfying enough. Temptation is an illusion--a trick to make you give up the blessing of real love in exchange for fake love.<br><br><b>Fifth, as you search to fulfill your God-given romantic longings, live for the presence of the Holy Spirit as your constant guide.</b>He will help you not only to separate the real from the counterfeit but also to have the strength to live reality in complete worthiness. Don't date someone you already know you would not, or should not, ever want to marry. If you should fall in love with someone you shouldn't marry, you can't expect the Lord to guide you away from that person after you are already emotionally committed. It is difficult enough to tune your spiritual receiver to the whisperings of heaven without jamming up the channel with the loud thunder of romantic emotion.<br><br>The key to spiritual guidance is found in two words:<i>genuine worthiness.</i>A comparison of two scriptures makes this point vividly: Those who look upon others with lustful hearts will (1) not have the Spirit, (2) shall deny the faith, and (3) shall experience fear (see D&amp;amp;C 63:16). In direct contrast, point-by-point, those who garnish their thoughts with virtue will (1) have the Holy Ghost as a constant companion, will (2) feel confident in the Lord's presence, and will (3) have the doctrine of the priesthood distilled upon their souls as the dews from heaven (see D&amp;amp;C 121:45–46). Our thoughts, controlled and bridled into virtuous paths, will lead to real love.<br><br><b>Sixth, avoid the habit of feeling sorry for yourself, which includes worrying about seeming socially unsuccessful.</b>Everybody in the world doesn't need to marry you--it only takes one. Again, be your best, real self. If someone isn't smart enough to see and appreciate your real self, then you don't want to marry that person anyway. Seek opportunities for developing friendships, as distinguished from going on dates. We discovered in our own courtship the natural growth and happiness of being friends first and sweethearts second--that sequence is worth waiting for.<br><br>Don't worry that you are not well known; seek to be worth knowing. The discouragement you may feel about your social life is often a form of the insecurity we all feel in trying to find our real selves. Without the apparent approval of your self-worth that comes through social success, you may experience feelings of self-doubt. That is not unusual--most of us wonder at times if other people love us, or even if the Lord loves us.<br><br>Some mistakenly seek the seeming symbols of success--being popular, rich, or famous to prove their worth. Sometimes you may let someone take improper liberties with you or you may indulge yourself in some practice that seems to bring temporary relief, but it only makes you feel worse in the long run. Some even make poor marriage choices just to show the world that<i>somebody</i>will have them--again, an illusion.<br><br>Ultimately, however, only the Lord's approval of our lives really matters. If you honestly seek to be worth knowing and seek earnestly to do his will, the rest will take care of itself. Remember that, as Paul said, "All things work together for good to them that love God" (Romans 8:28).<br><br><b>Seventh, let yourself belong to the natural, real order of God's laws.</b>A critically important step on the path to maturity occurs when you realize (notice the root<i>real</i>in that word) that we keep the commandments not because parents and leaders insist, but because the natural, real consequence of our obedience is our own genuine happiness--no pretending, no vain wishing. The gospel itself is simply the truth about things as they really are. Therefore, to live the gospel is to live in harmony with the natural laws of life, for there is a natural ecology in the spiritual world as well as in the physical world.<br><br>This principle is true because the universe is designed to produce deep human happiness. Living contrary to nature, contrary to things as they really are, will make us miserable, whereas living harmoniously with nature is the pathway to everlasting happiness. Hence Alma's advice that "wickedness never was happiness." The wicked "have gone contrary to the nature of God; therefore, they are in a state contrary to the nature of happiness" (Alma 41:10–11).<br><br><b>Eighth, be the person you know you are.</b>One student--we'll call her Amy--found this to be hard. She wrote:<br><br><i>I really loved this guy, and I saw no problem with our relationship. There were problems though. ... I rationalized</i>[pretended]<i>by saying, "I'm not going to marry him. It's okay. And besides, I'll be a good influence."</i><br><br><i>I finally could not stand living a lie. I was not being true to myself.</i>[And notice:]<i>I was not acting like the person that I knew I was inside. I needed to make a change in my life.</i><br><br>Amy was letting the illusion of love overpower who she really was. When she saw that illusion shattered, she realized as she said, "Remaining true to yourself and your beliefs is the best joy you can find."<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball once said that "marriage can be more an exultant ecstasy than the human mind can conceive" (<i>TSWK,</i>pp. 305–6). And when we have paid the price of patient preparation, self-discipline, and an irrevocable commitment to another person's happiness, we can taste the sweet joy of authentic romantic love.<br><br><b>Ninth, obtain your patriarchal blessing.</b>Many of you already have. Let me tell you what a patriarchal blessing meant to our friend Dean in seeing and living the reality that really matters.<br><br>When Dean was sixteen or seventeen, he fell for a girl named Consuela. As he described it:<br><br><i>The ultimate for me was this: I would turn up my collar, put on my sunglasses, and pick up Consuela. Then we would go to the drive-in.</i>[I always wanted to ask him, Wearing sunglasses to a drive-in? After dark?]<i>I couldn't seem to think about anything else except looking cool and going out with Consuela.</i><br><br>Then Dean responded to an invitation to get his patriarchal blessing.<br><br><i>When I got that blessing, it was as if someone punched a hole through the veil and I could see who I really was, where I really wanted to go, what was really important. I decided I really did want to go on a mission. I wanted to live so I could be married in the temple. That blessing literally changed how I looked at everything.</i><br><br>Before the blessing Dean saw the world through sunglasses--darkly. After the blessing he literally saw the light. In a sense he had come out from the "ugly mists of vapors" (though I think Consuela was hardly ugly) into the brightness of the sun, feeling that God was there and that God knew he was there. Knowing what he knew helped him to act, to begin the process of becoming what he could really become.<br><br>How can you build an authentic, real testimony of Christ and his gospel? As Dean discovered, to base a testimony on reality is the surest way to grow spiritually. It is the most crucial way to be rather than to seem. Maybe the simplest way to put it is step-by-step--no seeming, no pretending--one surely planted step followed by another.<br><br>A returned missionary wrote recently:<br><br><i>Once I reached my mission, I was so caught up in trying to understand what missionaries did I hardly had time to dwell on my questions too much. But I was quite conscious, still, of not wanting to say I "knew" more than I felt I really knew. As time went on I had a number of experiences in which I saw the Spirit of the Lord actively working in the lives of a few investigators, members, and missionaries. After several months I found myself feeling more comfortable in acknowledging the reality of the Lord's influence in my experience. I began learning that a testimony is a gradual, growing thing rather than a sudden yes-or-no kind of event. As time passed I could testify with more confidence that the gospel changes lives. Through all of this I never changed my conviction about being honest with myself. Then I discovered that because of that honesty, the affirming experiences I did have meant even more to me because I knew they were real.</i><br><br><i>I could literally trace my development through the verses in Alma</i>32,<i>which became a source of great comfort and understanding for me. As Alma put it</i>[verses 34–35]:<i>"For ye know that the word hath swelled your souls, and ye also know that it hath sprouted up, that your understanding doth begin to be enlightened, and your mind doth begin to expand.</i>O<i>then, is not this real? I say unto you, Yea."</i><br><br>This has been how my testimony has developed--one real step at a time. My testimony is based on real experiences. For me it has not been quickly gotten, nor based on a one-time clincher kind of experience--just piece by piece. But each piece is a true story, even if it may also have a little true preaching in it. Each piece is part of ultimate reality--an eternal circle. I feel I have learned, like Hamlet, that "I have that within which passeth show" (act 1, scene 2, line 84). Let me give you a few fragmentary word pictures:<br><br>About our marriage: It was worth waiting for. It gets better all the time--kneeling together in prayer, talking, comforting, sharing, buoying up, working, grieving, tender caring, together, until the marriage becomes the eternal circle of love that our rings symbolize.<br><br>About the gospel: Hungering to study the scriptures in order to teach. In a line once for hours to buy tickets, being struck that what I was saying to a young couple from South Africa about the gospel was true. Telling my Shakespeare class that their souls can "delight in fatness" (2 Nephi 9:51), not just from learning about corpulent Falstaff, but more fully from "feasting upon the word of Christ" (2 Nephi 31:20). Also, knowing that to know the scriptures is not enough--they must be lived. Knowing that the Lord desires that we find fulfillment. It is Satan, not God, who seeks to numb our sensibilities, to make reality seem an illusion until we are eternally miserable. And, realizing that the newborn with the white downy fluff for hair has suddenly become a college freshman, now a missionary, and he's really ready to serve. Finding that the joy is there, even in the midst of pain.<br><br>About our family: A circle of family memories--how did the Relief Society in the BYU Thirty-Eighth Ward thirty years ago know that at the birth of our first child when they gave us a Wordsworth "Trailing Clouds of Glory" quilt with the seven stars that we would have seven children? More circles of priesthood holders at blessings, ordinations, settings apart. Wedding rings--circles of friends and families around holy altars for sealings. The birth of our first grandchild--our daughter-in-law Joy sitting up gingerly in her hospital bed, holding out to me flame-haired Sarah Anne, saying, "Here she is! Want to hold her, Grandma?" And our grandson, Devin, who lived but three weeks--a circle of family and friends around his little coffin in the Lehi cemetery, feeling all the way to the core of our beings things as they really are, that Devin lives. He lives because Christ lives and gives us day-to-day his atonement. Christ's life is "an endless light"--a beacon to beckon us to know, to do, to be--to be real, to become eternal.<br><br>In the words of Henry Vaughan:<br><br><i>I saw Eternity the other night</i><br><i>Like a great ring of pure and endless light.</i><br><i>All calm, as it was bright.</i><br>[<i>Silex Scintillans</i>(1655), "The World"]<br><br>It is better to be than to seem. It is time to "get real," in the ultimate sense of eternal reality. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Marie K. Hafen was a part-time English instructor at Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 9 May 1995.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i>
<h1>e - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to you today. It is obviously with some fear and trepidation that I accepted this assignment. I thought that to break the ice I might tell a lawyer joke, but it seems a little risky given the present leadership of the university. I am encouraged, however, by the recent example of President Gordon B. Hinckley. The other day at the dedication of the Howard W. Hunter Law Library, President Rex Lee was conducting and remarked that as a lawyer in the presence of so many of his law colleagues, he shouldn't tell any lawyer jokes on such an auspicious occasion. When President Faust stood to speak, he reaffirmed that as a lawyer he felt it would be inappropriate for him to tell any lawyer jokes as well. When it came time for President Hinckley to speak, he said, "Well, I'm not a lawyer, and I know some lawyer jokes. Do you want to hear some?" I, too, know some lawyer jokes, but also, like my prophet leader, who ultimately chose not to tell any on that occasion, I won't tell any now.<br><br>I wish to speak to you regarding the fifth principle of the gospel--that being the principle of endurance. I take some liberty here in announcing this principle as the fifth because Joseph Smith wrote in the fourth article of faith:<br><br><i>We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.</i><br><br>But the Lord himself declared in section 18 of the Doctrine and Covenants that "as many as repent and are baptized in my name, which is Jesus Christ, and<i>endure</i>to the end, the same shall be saved" (D&amp;amp;C 18:22). Based on that reference, I wish to suggest that<i>endurance</i>be considered the fifth principle of the gospel, at least for my purposes today.<br><br>I have always been interested in the concept of physical endurance or the ability of the body to tolerate stress. This interest was kindled by the agony I endured as a young boy while trying to train for various sports. This agony is best illustrated in my experience as a young tenth grader trying out for the C football team at Alhambra High School in southern California. I weighed about 110 pounds, and so did the uniform and pads they gave me to wear. I remember the first day of practice and all the stretching and sprinting and twisting and hitting we did. More vividly, I remember the second day of practice when I couldn't move because I hurt so badly. I could hardly put on my uniform, let alone practice. The coach seemed a little unsympathetic as he said things like "Come on, Conlee, rub some dirt on it and get in there!" or "What's the matter, Conlee, you some special case or something? My grandmother runs faster than you!" The way I felt, I believed he was right.<br><br>Remarkably, I found that the more I trained, the less I hurt. I learned from early experiences and from a sign that hung in our locker room that "Quitters never win, and winners never quit." Something inside me said that nothing is too hard. What I did not know at the time was that I was learning eternal principles.<br><br>My military experience taught me a lot about enduring. My approach to the army was that it was a game, and I could play any game--but I watched many give up and quit. In basic training we would run for miles at a time carrying our rifle at port arms in full pack and army boots. Though it was difficult, I told myself that others had done it and it wasn't designed to kill me, or at least I hoped it wasn't, so I forced myself to continue. Some, though, would stop and walk. Others would fall down and lie there. Some of us would take their loads so they could run less burdened, and they would continue. Still, some could not keep up and eventually would give up. It was my impression that those who gave up usually ended up with graver consequences than if they had endured the temporary discomfort of fatigue. My attitude was that there was always an end, and, therefore, I forced myself to continue. I was probably still concerned that someone's grandmother was going to pass me.<br><br>In officer's candidate school, a six-month intensive training course designed to train men to be leaders in combat situations, the rules included not only physical stress but mental and emotional stress as well. Again, I said to myself, "This is a game. If others can do it, I can, too." I used to laugh at the silly methods used to harass us into becoming mentally tough. As underclassmen, the upperclassmen would stand us at attention, a very rigid posture referred to as "a brace." They would say to us in their newly developed leadership style, "Hit a brace, candidate!"<i>Candidate</i>was the affectionate term they used that, when translated into today's vernacular, meant "dummy" or "turkey" or "low life" or some other affectionate term. Anyway, while they had us at attention they would berate us verbally for the silliest little things, like having a button unbuttoned or a pencil showing out of our pocket or our boots not polished bright enough. These things were taboo and led the harassers to make inferences about our intelligence or even the origin of our ancestors. I could hardly keep myself from laughing in the middle of all this idiocy. The culmination of the episode came when an upperclassman would finally put his face right next to mine, and nose to nose he would conclude with this brilliant inquiry at the top of his voice, "Do you hear me, candidate?!"<br><br>I wanted to say, "Man, everybody can hear you, you big doughhead," but according to the rules I would say, "Sir, yes sir!" And the encounter would end. Now that may seem harmless enough, but I would see grown men brought to tears under such stress and come apart emotionally. The next day they were gone, unable to play the game because they did not understand the rules.<br><br>When I went to Vietnam, the rules of the game expanded again. Not only did we have to endure physical and emotional stress but also the fear of dying. Death and severe injury were real parts of this game. What one had to overcome was the fear of these realities, and these fears were constant every day. I found great solace and comfort in my spiritual habits. For me to perform my duties under those circumstances necessitated my complete reliance on the Lord to give me the courage necessary to act in spite of my fears. I can testify to the reality of such spiritual help.<br><br>Today, in my professional work at the university, my research interests focus on the endurance capacity of man as it relates to physical performance. The exercise physiologist attempts to determine what limits man's capacity and how those limits can be expanded through training and through other nutritional or pharmacological manipulation.<br><br>I share this with you now not to impress you with my personal life's experiences, but to help you understand my deep interest in the principle of endurance. For not only have I marveled at the principles of temporal endurance, but I have sought to understand more fully the meaning of the words<i>and endure to the end</i>in their spiritual sense. These words are stated throughout the scriptures.<br><br>My academic experience has helped me develop definitions for endurance. The opposite of endurance is fatigue.<i>Fatigue</i>is defined as the inability to maintain a given intensity of work. It does not mean a complete cessation of work. It is defined as the inability to maintain a set level of effort.<i>Endurance,</i>then, would be the ability to maintain a certain level or intensity of work. Spiritually, endurance is the ability to maintain a belief in Christ and to continue to strive to live the commandments and to perfect our lives in spite of the trials of this life. A cute story illustrates the consequences of spiritual fatigue. A fine Latter-day Saint couple had lived their lives righteously. Near the end of their lives they said, "We have worked hard. Now it is time for others to carry the load." They attended their meetings less, played more, and served less. One day they died and went to heaven. St. Peter greeted them warmly and said, "I will show you the mansion that has been prepared for you." They finally stood outside a beautiful white estate with picket fences and ornaments. They went inside and saw lovely furniture and decorations. Both were thrilled. Then the wife looked up and noticed that the roof was only half done. It really detracted from the appearance of the home. She inquired as to why the mansion was not finished. Peter said, "When you stopped performing your labors on earth, the angels also stopped working on your mansion."<br><br>We must, as I emphasized before, understand the rules of the game of life. First, none of us is exempt from facing life's trials, and the fact that we are faithful does not assure us of a life without tests. This is exemplified over and over again in the scriptures as we review the lives of the prophets. Job is the epitome of trials as he lost his family, his health, his wealth, and yet never cursed God. Paul, likewise, suffered much. But listen to his attitude as expressed in his second letter to the Corinthians: "We are troubled on every side, yet<i>not distressed;</i>we are perplexed, but<i>not in despair;</i>Persecuted, but<i>not forsaken;</i>cast down, but<i>not destroyed"</i>(2 Corinthians 4:8–9).<br><br>Paul understood the reason for trials, "For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory" (2 Corinthians 4:17).<br><br>This idea that trials are for our benefit was reinforced by the Lord himself to Joseph Smith when, after enumerating all the trials Joseph may be called on to endure, the Lord concluded by saying in Doctrine and Covenants 122:7, "Know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good."<br><br>Closer to home we have only to look to our beloved university president, Rex E. Lee, as the epitome of faith in the face of physical trial. Plagued by a disease that has robbed him of the ability to do so many of the physical things he loved to do, he stands as an example to us all of one who understands the rules of the game. Those of us who love him and anguish for him are buoyed up by his faith and perseverance.<br><br>If the rules of the game require all to endure some trials, what are the trials? If we know what to expect, we can be better prepared. I cannot enumerate every test, but I would like you to consider some categories.<br><br>First, and most obvious, is the trial of temptation to violate the commandments. We must live the commandments to be eligible for exaltation. We cannot knowingly and willingly violate the Lord's commandments and expect to be blessed spiritually in this life or exalted in the next. We must, therefore, endure to the end by living righteously. The challenge here, of course, is that we do not know when the end is. Anyone of us could be run over by a big Mack truck today, and had we willfully been in violation of any or all of the commandments, we would not have endured to the end, despite having received the other four principles of the gospel: faith, repentance, baptism, and the Holy Ghost. But I wonder if even knowing when the end would come would really protect us against the temptations of the world. I am reminded of the condition of the people of Nephi just prior to the appearance of the Lord among them as described in 3 Nephi:<br><br><i>And thus there became a great inequality in all the land, insomuch that the church began to be broken up; yea, insomuch that in the thirtieth year the church was broken up in all the land save it were among a few</i>[who]<i>were firm, and steadfast, and immovable, willing with all diligence to keep the commandments of the Lord.</i><br><br><i>Now the cause of this iniquity of the people was this--Satan had great power, unto the stirring up of the people to do all manner of iniquity, and to the puffing them up with pride, tempting them to seek for power, and authority, and riches, and the vain things of the world.</i>[3 Nephi 6:14-15]<br><br>It was not many years before this that Nephi had preached from the tower in his yard and said to the people, "O repent ye, repent ye! Why will ye die?" (Helaman 7:17), and Samuel the Lamanite had prophesied the birth and death of the Savior giving specific signs of both events. And yet we see, in spite of this foreknowledge, that the people did not endure in righteousness save it were a faithful few. We all know what happened to this region prior to the appearance of the Lord. There was mass destruction, and thousands of people lost their lives in the calamity. The Lord proclaimed to those that remained that they were spared because they were more righteous (see 3 Nephi 9:13). They had endured in righteousness, waiting for the prophecies to be fulfilled concerning the coming of the Lord. I wonder if there might be an analogy to our day. This is not the time to trifle with the commandments. We must not let Satan cheat us out of our exaltation or cause us to quit the race.<br><br>A second category is enduring the individual conditions of this life--the unique set of circumstances peculiar to us at any given time. These may be small, such as why the guy you like doesn't seem to know you exist or why you did not achieve an A in a class in spite of every diligent effort. They may be big, such as prolonged health problems or the death of a loved one. They might be financial burdens that seem insurmountable. Or, as parents, we may have to endure the often incorrect use of free agency by our children. For others it may be the inability to be a parent when the desire to be is great. And some seem destined to live this life without a mate in spite of earnest desires otherwise. Finally, it may be an offense by a Church official such as a bishop or stake president or General Authority. In all these, the test comes in<i>not</i>denouncing our faith or blaming God for our trials. So many times strong members of the Church, when faced with such conditions, denounce God for not righting the set of conditions that brings them agony. By so doing they cease enduring and stand to risk all they have worked for spiritually to that point.<br><br>One example of this came when I was a bishop in Iowa while doing my graduate work. We had just sent out the first missionary that ward had ever had, a quality young man who was loved and admired by all who knew him. Unfortunately, the young man had leukemia, which was in remission. Six months into his mission the symptoms reappeared. He returned home for treatment, but the Lord needed him for a different mission. In spite of group fasting and adamant prayer in his behalf, he died, still a full-time, set-apart missionary. The grief and mourning were difficult. But I always remember the greater anguish I felt when one faithful ward member came to me right after the incident and stated, "I do not know how a just God could allow this to happen. It is not right. He was a good boy. Why would God take him from us?" No amount of consoling helped this person. For this person, God ceased to be a loving God when he did not give us what we desperately wanted. This person became bitter and left the Church for a season.<br><br>The counsel of President Kimball seems applicable. He wrote:<br><br><i>If all the sick for whom we pray were healed, if all the righteous were protected and the wicked destroyed, the whole program of the Father would be annulled and the basic principle of the gospel, free agency, would be ended. No man would have to live by faith.</i>...<br><br><i>Should all prayers be immediately answered according to our selfish desires and our limited understanding, then there would be little or no suffering, sorrow, disappointment, or even death, and if these were not, there would also be no joy, success, resurrection, nor eternal life and godhood.</i>[<i>Faith Precedes the Miracle</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1978), p. 97]<br><br>In my callings I have been so impressed as I see people facing the challenges of life by drawing closer to their God, even when the conditions are not resolved to their desire.<br><br>Recently I was in the temple with others to witness a marriage. In the company was a couple who had been pleading with Heavenly Father to help resolve a particular family problem--in spite of their prayers, the condition was not resolved as they had hoped. I noticed this couple stealing away to a quiet room in the temple, where I sensed they laid their trials again before the Lord. They were not bitter. They only wanted to endure whatever the Lord would have them endure. The Lord himself set the example as we recall the events in Gethsemane that caused him to utter, "Nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt" (Matthew 26:39).<br><br>A third area that requires considerable spiritual strength is enduring the persecution that comes from trying to be in the world but not of the world. All of the prophets have been persecuted for the Lord's sake, and many have given their lives rather than denounce the gospel. True followers must never be ashamed of the Lord Jesus Christ. We cannot let the media shake our faith. We cannot let the so-called learned argue against the simple whisperings of the Holy Ghost. The controversial issues in the Church--the issuance of the manifesto denouncing plural marriage, priesthood to all males regardless of race, the stand against the Equal Rights Amendment, the salamander letter, to name a few--have had a purging effect because people whose faith was grounded in philosophy rather than in faith, in worldly principles rather than in godly ones, were unable to withstand the criticism toward the Church and chose to renounce their faith. If the Holy Ghost has testified to you that Jesus is the Christ and that Joseph Smith was a prophet and that President Hinckley is a prophet today and that this is the Lord's church, then we must remain allegiant to that testimony to qualify for the blessings of endurance regardless of the events of the world that would conspire against that knowledge. If the Church is true before calamity and during easy times, then it is still true during times of trial and adversity.<br><br>I love the story of Alma and Amulek found in chapter 14 of Alma because it exemplifies the courage of faithful, humble people. First, Alma and Amulek themselves resisted bitter physical and emotional persecution as they were imprisoned for preaching the gospel among the people of Ammonihah. Then they were forced to witness the martyrdom of the faithful Saints who were put to death by fire because they would not renounce their simple testimonies. These people must have been valiant to seal their testimonies with their lives. Even Amulek could tolerate it no more and suggested to Alma that they exercise the power of God to save the people from the flames (see Alma 14:10). Alma said that the Spirit constrained him from doing that and that there was a purpose in the Lord for such carnage (see Alma 14:11). What a dramatic example of enduring persecution to the end. We hope that none of us will have to face that type of persecution, but let us be strong in the face of the challenges of this day.<br><br>Now, given that trials exist and that all of us will face these trials, how are we expected to endure them? When we want to gain physical endurance we must train the body by subjecting it to an overload. Weight lifters lift weights to strengthen the muscles to be able to lift more. Runners run long distances to allow the cardiovascular system and muscles to adapt to provide the necessary delivery and use of oxygen to promote endurance.<br><br>To increase our spiritual endurance we must train spiritually. When a sudden trial overload comes, we must already be trained in order to endure it. This training involves praying every day so that when we need to pray more fervently we are already accustomed to it. This training also involves regular scripture study so that our testimonies are firm and our understanding of God's plan is deep. This training involves serving others in their plight so we can be better prepared for our own. This training involves regular Sunday worship, from which we gain the strength to discipline our lives and renew our covenants. Just as we build a physical reservoir through training, we can also develop a spiritual one as well.<br><br>Assuming we have been willing to train and to pay the price for spiritual endurance, what are the mechanisms by which we ultimately endure the trials of life? When Enos went into the forest to pray about the teachings of his father, there came a voice unto Enos saying, "Enos, thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed" (Enos 1:5). And Enos asked, "Lord, how is it done?" (Enos 1:7). And the voice said unto him, "Because of thy faith in Christ, whom thou hast never before heard nor seen" (Enos 1:8). The answer is obvious. We must place our trust in the Lord and allow the Lord's spirit to lift us. This was expressed by Jacob when he said to his fellow Nephites: "But behold, I, Jacob, would speak unto you that are pure in heart. Look unto God with firmness of mind, and pray unto him with exceeding faith, and he will console you in your afflictions" (Jacob 3:1). The scriptures are replete with the admonition to rely on the Lord. The most beautiful and recognized is Psalm 23:<br><br><i>The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.</i><br><i>He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.</i><br><i>He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.</i><br><i>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.</i><br><i>Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.</i><br><i>Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.</i><br><br>The question is: How do we rely on the Lord? How do we avoid the depression that often accompanies the trials of life? We do it by accepting the reality of the Atonement. We often think of the Atonement only in terms of relief from sins and guilt. It is clearly that, but it is more, as we read in Alma about the Savior:<br><br><i>And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.</i><br><br><i>And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.</i><br><br><i>Now the Spirit knoweth all things; nevertheless the Son of God suffereth according to the flesh that he might take upon him the sins of his people, that he might blot out their transgressions according to the power of his deliverance; and now behold, this is the testimony which is in me.</i>[Alma 7:11–13]<br><br>How does the Lord carry our burdens? Like all other principles of the gospel, it requires faith and effort. We pray earnestly and emotionally for the Lord to strengthen us and lift us, to prepare a way for us to endure, even to remove the bitter cup if it be his will, and then we release those things into his hands and believe within us that our prayers are heard and the stress of the condition will be transferred to him.<br><br>I have a strong testimony that the Lord accepts our stress and blesses us with strength and courage and hope to continue the fight. Over the years I have had the occasion to pray with great emotion for the well-being of my children and for the strength to allow them to suffer the consequences for the exercise of free agency. I have felt the inner peace that I could endure. This principle was taught in simple terms when we were driving home from a recent vacation, and, as I usually do, I was enjoying reading the various messages on bumper stickers and on the backs of trucks. I noticed on the mud flap of a big truck this simple statement: "Jesus carries my load."<br><br>Probably the most poignant example of how the Lord carries our burdens is described in Mosiah. Alma, the former priest of King Noah, and his little band had come under the oppression of the Lamanites. The people poured out their hearts to God for deliverance:<br><br><i>The voice of the Lord came to them in their afflictions, saying: Lift up your heads and be of good comfort, for I know of the covenant which ye have made unto me; and I will covenant with my people and deliver them out of bondage.</i><br><br><i>And I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions.</i><br><br><i>And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were made light; yea, the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord.</i>[Mosiah 24:13–15]<br><br>In Helaman 5:12, we read, "And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; ... a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall."<br><br>I want to make another point regarding our reliance on the Lord to carry us through the trials of life. Learned men and women of the world have developed coping strategies to help people endure the trials of life that do not always involve faith. Unbelievers do not go off the deep end the moment adversity strikes because they do not rely on God. Most see their way through. But the believer who turns to God for refuge not only finds the comfort he or she seeks but gains an increase in testimony of the reality of the Savior and of the Atonement. This is the higher purpose of trials in God's plan--to bring his children to the knowledge of him and his son. This is affirmed in Helaman 12:3, which reads, "And thus we see that except the Lord doth chasten his people with many afflictions, ... they will not remember him." When we have endured in faith, then our knowledge becomes more sure. This is what Moroni meant when he said, "I would show unto the world that faith is things which are hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith" (Ether 12:6).<br><br>This principle was made clear in a story told by David O. McKay at a Relief Society general conference meeting in 1947. He related the testimony of one of the survivors of the ill-fated Martin Handcart Company. A man was speaking to a group of people and questioning the wisdom of the Church leaders in letting a group of converts cross the plains with no more protection than handcarts could afford. A man in the audience stood up and said, "I ask you to stop this criticism. You are discussing a matter you know nothing about." He stated that he was a survivor of that company. He said,<br><br><i>We suffered beyond anything you can imagine and many died of exposure and starvation, but did you ever hear a survivor of that company utter a word of criticism? Not one of that company ever apostatized or left the Church, because everyone of us came through with the absolute knowledge that God lives for we became acquainted with him in our extremities.</i>[David O. McKay, "Pioneer Women,"<i>Relief Society Magazine,</i>January 1948, p. 8]<br><br>Thus we see that the fruits of enduring in the Lord is the miracle of testimony, and testimony helps us to endure to the end.<br><br>My talk would not be complete if I did not rehearse for you the eternal blessings that come from enduring. In 2 Nephi 31:20, we read:<br><br><i>Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.</i><br><br>Eternal life seems so far away as we live the daily trials of this earthly probation. But listen to this promise in the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>For there is a time appointed for every man, according as his works shall be.</i><br><br><i>God shall give unto you knowledge by his Holy Spirit, yea, by the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost, that has not been revealed since the world was until now;</i><br><br><i>Which our forefathers have awaited with anxious expectation to be revealed in the last times, which their minds were pointed to by the angels, as held in reserve for the fulness of their glory;</i><br><br><i>A time to come in the which nothing shall be withheld, whether there be one God or many gods, they shall be manifest.</i><br><br><i>All thrones and dominions, principalities and powers, shall be revealed and set forth upon all who have endured valiantly for the gospel of Jesus Christ.</i><br><br><i>And also, if there be bounds set to the heavens or to the seas, or to the dry land, or to the sun, moon, or stars--</i><br><br><i>All the times of their revolutions, all the appointed days, months, and years, and all the days of their days, months, and years, and all their glories, laws, and set times, shall be revealed in the days of the dispensation of the fulness of times.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:25–31]<br><br>In the temple covenant of marriage we learn about sharing all that the Father has and about receiving thrones, kingdoms, principalities, and dominions. All these will be ours if we endure to the end.<br><br>But even in this life we often are recipients of the blessings that follow righteous endurance. Such blessings usually come after faith has been demonstrated. To illustrate this point, I would like to relate one such experience that occurred in my ward when I was a bishop. I do this with permission.<br><br>Recently an elder had his missionary farewell. It was very nice but did not really reflect the emotional and spiritual energy exerted to get him to that glorious point in his life. The elder was like many young men who really do not catch the vision of the place the Church should hold in life during the teenage years. Much to the dismay of his parents, he spent many more Sundays away from meetings than in them. But his parents and friends never gave up and prayed for him and loved him in spite of his seeming lack of spiritual discipline. But, like many who struggle, he one day decided for himself that he wanted to go on his mission. And, based solely on his faith that he was supposed to go, he went. Up to the day he left, his mother still wondered about the reality of it. She had endured literally years of seeing little or no interest, and with cautious optimism she said good-bye to him as he entered the MTC. I wish now to read a letter the parents received from their son while he was in the MTC:<br><br><i>Mom and Dad,</i><br><br><i>Well, I got my hair cut today. Thanks for the money. Dad, I think you should get the GTI aligned first and get tires and get them balanced. Then, if it doesn't drive right, get a set of used aftermeshed rims. I really want to thank you, Dad, for taking all of my problems so that I can go on this mission. I really feel bad to just dump all of this on you. But I want you to know that I'm doing the right thing. Terrence and I went to the temple today, and when we went to the celestial room, we stood in a corner and Terrence prayed and then I did. We just stood there for awhile and cried and just looked at each other. I felt the spirit and happiness that I have never before felt. It's true, this church is true. I know that now.</i><br><br><i>I really want to thank you for all you are doing to give me the opportunity. I just hope that one day I will be able to repay you somewhat. I love you.</i><br><br><i>Dave</i><br><br>This simple testimony from a son is the joyous blessing that came as a result of faithful endurance. The thing is, we never know what blessings await us when we are asked to endure or when they will come, only that they will assuredly come.<br><br>I bear testimony that the Lord knows us and knows our needs. Paul states in his letter to the Corinthians, "But God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted [and I would insert<i>tried</i>] above that ye are able; but will with the temptation [or trial] also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it" (l Corinthians 10:13). If we seek the Lord to abide with us, we can make it through the darkest night. This I testify in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Robert K.

<h1>g and Preserving the Promise of America - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
You might think that a person that ran in a recent election for governor and lost would be severely disappointed, but to be here on the BYU campus and a part of the law school faculty has brought great joy and happiness to my wife and me and our family. I am so pleased to be here on campus and to have this opportunity to speak today.<br><br>I want to speak about facing challenges, about achieving our full potential, and about receiving help from others as we progress along the path of life. I want to begin with a story that illustrates these points. It concerns a young man who was seeking to become the best he could be--a champion. He wanted to be a wrestler; fortunately, he had a good coach that wanted to work with him. The two of them worked very hard for some time to prepare him to be a champion wrestler. They finally got to the point where this young man entered a wrestling tournament where he would have a chance to prove himself.<br><br>Because he had worked very hard preparing, he started the first match and was successful. He then went on to the second match. As he moved through the brackets, he won again and again until finally he got to the championship round. There he faced the true challenge of his life because he faced off against a young man that had never lost a wrestling match. This true champion had never lost because he had perfected a wrestling hold known as the pretzel. Whenever this true champion caught someone in the pretzel hold, he had always been able to pin him.<br><br>The coach told this young challenger, "When you go out there in this championship match, whatever you do, don't let him catch you in the pretzel hold!"<br><br>The challenger looked at his coach and said, "I understand." He went out there and, as he had done in all of the previous wrestling matches, he fought his heart out. He got ahead in points and, with just about a minute to go, he was in the lead. It looked like he was going to achieve his dream. But then, what had happened so many times before happened to this young challenger--that true champion caught him in the pretzel. As soon as the coach saw that, he knew what was going to happen. He couldn't bear to see this young man's dreams dashed, so he looked away.<br><br>All of a sudden, a roar went up in that gymnasium. The coach turned around just in time to see these two bodies come flying up off the mat, arms and legs going every which way. For the first time a challenger had escaped from the pretzel! He was on his feet, he still had the lead in points, the clock was running down, the buzzer sounded, the audience went ecstatic with excitement because this challenger had reached his goal. The coach was the most excited of all as he ran across the mat and grabbed the young man's shoulders. He looked him right in the eye and said, "I just have to know. How did you escape the pretzel?"<br><br>That young man looked back at his coach and said, "I don't know, Coach. When he got me in that hold, I knew exactly what it was--it was very painful. I heard count one. I heard count two from the ref. I knew I was going to get pinned, and, at the last moment, I opened my eyes and right in front of my mouth was a toe." He said, "Coach, all I could think of was "Bite that toe as hard as I could!" He said, "That's exactly what I did. It's amazing what you can do when you bite your own toe!"<br><br>Now I have presented the secret--if you want to achieve your dreams and reach your goals and meet those challenges, just remember to take off your shoe and bite your toe!<br><br>Back in 1990, when I ran for attorney general of Idaho, I felt challenged. I was seeking to become the first in my political party in twenty years to be elected to that office and the first in my county in thirty-eight years to win an election for any statewide elective office. Perhaps most interesting, I was seeking to become the first American Indian in all the history of the United States to win an election for a statewide, state constitutional elective office. Those were the three challenges I felt in my heart. That wasn't enough, though. I read from one of the leading political analysts in the state that "Larry EchoHawk starts the election with three strikes against him." He wasn't talking about my three challenges. He said, "Larry EchoHawk is a Mormon Indian Democrat." If you know Idaho, that's strike three.<br><br>What they didn't realize was that I had a strategy. My strategy was to convince the people of Idaho that EchoHawk was really an Irish name; thus I could take one of the strikes away and be able to succeed. Seriously, EchoHawk is the name given to my great-grandfather. He gave me a proud name and a proud heritage.<br><br>EchoHawk did not speak English. He was a Pawnee Indian born in the mid-1800s. The Pawnee people did not have, as we have today, a first and last name given to them. But the elders of the tribe chose individual names for something about them. Thus EchoHawk was named by the elders of the tribe. Among the Pawnee the hawk is a symbol of a warrior. My great-grandfather was known for his bravery. He was a Pawnee Indian war scout, but he was also a quiet man. He did not speak of his own accomplishments, but other members of the tribe did. As they did so, it was like an echo from one side of the village to the other, and thus he got his name--EchoHawk--"the hawk whose deeds are echoed."<br><br>I never knew my great-grandfather, or even my grandfather, but the stories have been passed down from generation to generation. EchoHawk faced enormous challenges and hardships that I'm sure I cannot fully comprehend. At one time, history teaches us, the Pawnee people occupied an area of nearly thirty million acres of land in what is now known as Nebraska. The Pawnee people were estimated to have numbered about 25,000. In the winter of 1874, at the age of nineteen, EchoHawk was marched away from his home to the Oklahoma Indian Territory and placed on a small reservation that was not a part of the Pawnee homeland area. There on the Pawnee Indian reservation in Oklahoma he was one of less than 750 Pawnee people remaining, devastated over the years by disease and conflict. Perhaps the greatest sorrow he experienced was the loss of the homeland and the inability to go to see his ancestral grave sites, to go to the sacred areas, to pursue the buffalo herds as his forefathers had done. But he was a survivor.<br><br>The pain that EchoHawk experienced in his generation did not cease. My father and his father experienced hardships far beyond, I'm sure, anything that I have faced in my life. But even in my generation, my older sister was sent home from school because she was the wrong color. I remember the years that I sat in grade school classes when I would cringe if I heard the word<i>Indian</i>mentioned because Indians were described as savage, blood-thirsty heathens--renegades.<br><br>There were all kinds of questions that arose in the mind of a young Indian student about who I was and whether I had self-worth. I had no expectation in those early years of going on to achieve a college education--it wasn't something my family did. But out of that pain was born promise--the promise of America. Six of six children born to my parents went to college--four graduate degrees, with three becoming lawyers. Four of us were educated here at BYU. We have received the best that this country has to offer. We have realized the full promise of this great nation.<br><br>Perhaps I felt this more than at any other time on election night in 1990 as I received word that I would have the opportunity to serve as Idaho's thirtieth attorney general. I remember receiving that call in a hotel room in Pocatello--the city where I had raised my family. The news media was beckoning to me to come out and make some statement about my victory. I remember sitting on a bed with my young son--he was about five years old then and the youngest of six children. He had fought very hard to stay awake that night, but because it was late he hadn't been able to and had fallen asleep. As I sat there, I looked at him and thought back over where I'd come in life and about what I might say to the news media. After a few moments of reflection, I walked out and stood in front of the news reporters with my father, the grandson of EchoHawk, at my side. I glanced over at him and saw tears in his eyes; it was very touching to me. I had my brothers and sisters and my wife and children at my side as I spoke from the heart to express the feelings I had inside.<br><br>I remembered words that I had heard when I was fifteen years old, spoken by a black civil rights leader on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. I repeated them from memory.<br><br><i>I ... have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal." ...</i><br><br><i>I have a dream that my ... children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.</i>[Martin Luther King, Jr., "I Have a Dream," speech at the Lincoln Memorial, Washington, D.C., August 28, 1963]<br><br>I believe in America. I believe in the spirit of America--the spirit that says that regardless of who you are, regardless of your religion, your race, your ethnic heritage, your economic status, you have a right and a potential to claim the promise of this great nation. America must be a land of opportunity for all people.<br><br>I want to express gratitude for the people who have helped me receive that promise. Just about a year ago, I was in the spacious office of the attorney general of the state of Idaho. I had a visitor come to see me that I had not seen in more than twenty-five years. His name was Boyd Camphuysen. He, along with Lee Pearson, had come as missionaries to my family when I was fourteen years old. Boyd Camphuysen had baptized me. It was an emotional moment. I could see it in his eyes as he thought back to me as the young man he had taught. He had marked my progress over twenty-five years. A seed had been planted. He had helped that process, and many people had nurtured it over the years.<br><br>I am grateful to a mother of six that taught her children to thirst for education, perhaps because she had only an eighth-grade education. I am grateful for a father who took his six young children and had them work at his side to provide a living for the family, which taught us the value of work.<br><br>I am grateful for the opportunity to come to this institution of higher education and to be touched by so many people. I came as an athlete, and I was touched by people who worked in the athletic department--people like Glen Tuckett; my defensive back coach, Dick Felt; even the equipment manager, Floyd Johnson. They helped teach me.<br><br>One of the great lessons I learned came from LaVell Edwards, who was instrumental in recruiting me as a football player out of Farmington High School. He was the number-one assistant coach at that time and over the defense where I played. One of the great lessons that he has taught, and I'm sure it has to do with why he has been so successful, is that the most important thing to success is<i>not</i>the will to win. Kind of a strange statement coming from a football coach--you'd think the first thing he would say would be, "The most important thing is that you've got to want to win!" Coach Edwards said to his players, "The most important thing to success is the will to prepare." What he taught to the football players is that you've got to go out Monday through Friday and work as hard as you can so that on Saturday, when you show up in a blue uniform ready to play and you want to win, you're prepared to win. That's the most important thing. A great lesson learned in life that applies in whatever challenges you take up is the value of work; it will help you to achieve your goals and your dreams.<br><br>I want to say a word about those who were involved in Indian education at the time I was here on the BYU campus. These are my mentors as well--people like Paul Felt and Dale Tingey and many others who served with them. But there was a leader that had a special impact on me, and I want to take this opportunity to just make mention of a man that I met soon after I was baptized at the age of fourteen. He was an apostle who came to a small LDS community--Kirtland, New Mexico--to attend a youth conference for Indian people. There was a lot of excitement generated because he was known as a person who had a deep love for the Lamanites. I remember how the anticipation built up. Finally, as I was gathered with a number of other youth waiting on a softball field, an automobile pulled up. Some people in business suits got out and began to walk across the field. We were waiting to meet this special person. As they walked up, I wasn't sure which one he was until, finally, the short one with a raspy voice spoke up. Within just a few minutes he broke down the barrier that was hard to break down with young Indian students. He befriended us. We went inside, and we listened to what Spencer W. Kimball had to tell us.<br><br>As a student on the BYU campus, I had an opportunity to listen to him on other occasions. I want to take this opportunity to read to you part of a speech that he gave to Indian students at BYU when he was serving as the prophet and president of the Church. These are his words:<br><br><i>In 1946, I had a dream of your progress and development. Now this is precisely what I dreamed, this was my vision for the people of the Book of Mormon. I got up from my bed and I wrote my dream, and this is what I wrote. As I looked into the future, I saw the Lamanites from the isles of the sea and the Americas rise to a great destiny. I saw the people of Lehi as engineers and builders. I saw you in political positions and functioning as administrators of the land. I saw you as heads of government of countries, and states, and cities. I saw you in legislative positions, where as legislators and good Latter-day Saints you were able to make the best laws for your brothers and sisters. I saw many of you becoming attorneys and becoming the solution to the world's problems. I saw you as owners of industries and factories. I saw you as doctors as well as lawyers looking after your people. Now that was my dream; maybe it was a vision; maybe the Lord was showing to me what this great people would accomplish.</i><br><br>Those words have had an enormous impact upon me and I'm sure upon others. I carried that statement with me for many years to help me as a blueprint of life to help invest in me a dream.<br><br>Mentors are people that are there to reach out and to uplift, inspire, and to help others. One of my mentors in life is my older brother. For many years I've been known as John EchoHawk's little brother. John EchoHawk was one of the first American Indians to obtain a law degree in this country. As he was graduating from law school, he came to me. Usually he's a very, very quiet person and seldom opens up, but I remember the occasion when he did.<br><br>He said, "Larry, I think you ought to go to law school." This was a big change because I was on the path to becoming a coach and an educator. He said, "I think you ought to go to law school. It will give you the power to change."<br><br>When he said that, I thought he meant the power to change me or to put me in a position to get a better home, to make more money, or to have a better personal life. But then I realized that's not at all what he was talking about. He meant the power to change the lives of other people for the better. He was talking about our school motto: "Enter to learn, go forth to serve"--a familiar message to us on campus. It was not new to me.<br><br>As I grew up in my home, my parents practiced a tradition that had been handed down from generation to generation in our family known as the "Indian giveaway." In times of celebration as well as in times of mourning, in the Indian culture you give what you have to others to bless their lives. Thus, when I was growing up, I saw my parents take people into our home to help sustain them. In the early years of my life I thought I had more brothers and sisters than I really did. I saw my father give his prized possessions away to other people simply because they admired something that he had, and he demanded that they take it. My father exemplified strength of character through giving what he had to help other people.<br><br>Over a year ago, on a very cold and dark day, I was walking down the center line of an Idaho highway. It was a sight that I will never forget. On this very cloudy day there was a line of cars with flashing police lights parked on both sides of the highway for about a mile. I was on the way to a funeral service for a father of four small children. His name was Wade Feldner. He'd been gunned down by a fourteen-year-old. As the attorney general of Idaho, I attended that funeral and graveside ceremony. It was impressive to witness the kind of support that was there.<br><br>As the ceremony concluded at the grave site, I remember walking up to the widow, Sherry Feldner, and extending my hand saying, in a very quiet voice, "I'm deeply sorry for the loss that you and your family have suffered."<br><br>As soon as I said this she just broke down with emotion, and we embraced. After a moment, as she regained her composure, she looked up at me and said words that I will never forget: "Please, Mr. EchoHawk, do everything you can to make sure that this does not happen to anyone else." You might imagine the kind of burden I felt as the chief law enforcement officer of the state to try to do my best to fulfill that charge. And the thoughts of that moment have haunted me since that day. But I've also realized that is not just my burden, it is a burden that we all share to make sure that we reduce the pain in our society and that we bring forth the promised America in the lives of all people.<br><br>One of the greatest threats that we face in this nation today concerns the hearts and minds of our young people. We see increased violence among our youth, we see more and more of our young people suffering from abuse, we see our prisons beginning to overflow. These are not just things I've read about in the newspaper. I've actually seen the devastating consequences of what happens in our society very directly. I've even had to witness, in my capacity as attorney general, the execution of a person that committed society's highest crime. I've seen both sides; I've seen the worst, and I've seen the best.<br><br>I would just like to close my comments today by giving you a challenge to get your education and to work hard. But remember that when you leave this campus, you go forth to serve--to serve others, to help this be a better world. Don't be overcome by discouragement and frustration as these problems mount, because that world beyond the sheltered world that you are in now is out there waiting to try and test you. Don't be overwhelmed. I'd like to leave with you words that I heard in the formative years of my life, words spoken by Senator Robert F. Kennedy: "Some [people] see things as they are and say, why; I dream things that never were and say, why not" (see George Bernard Shaw,<i>Back to Methuselah,</i>act 1). I have seen what was, but I see very clearly what we all can become, and I, too, say, Why not? I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Larry EchoHawk was a professor of law at Brigham Young University when this forum address was given on 23 May 1995.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>
<h1>A Gift with Responsibility - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Agency, the power we have to work out our salvation through choosing between good and evil, is the eternal principle that will be the focus of the time I share with you today. Agency is a divine birthright. Bruce R. McConkie encapsulated the doctrinal perspective of agency in these words:<br><br><i>Inherent in the whole system of salvation that grows out of the fall of man; inherent in the great and eternal plan that makes of this life a preparatory and a probationary state; inherent in the very atoning sacrifice of God himself--inherent in the whole eternal plan of salvation is the eternal law of agency. All of the terms and conditions of the Lord's eternal plan operate because man has his agency, and none of it would have efficacy, virtue, or force if there were no agency.</i>[Bruce R. McConkie,<i>A New Witness for the Articles of Faith</i>(Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book Company, 1985), p. 89]<br><br>Throughout all dispensations of time, the gift of agency has been given to all of our Heavenly Father's children with the capacity to think and to reason. Each one of his children has also been given the Light of Christ to guide in the personal exercise of the gift of agency. This is true whether or not the gospel has been on the earth in its fullness.<br><br>President David O. McKay reminded us, "Next to the bestowal of life itself, the right to direct that life is God's greatest gift to man" (<i>GI,</i>p. 299). It is a gift with significant personal responsibility. This responsibility was emphasized by Wilford Woodruff in this statement: "By virtue of this agency you and I and all mankind are made responsible beings, responsible for the course we pursue, the lives we live, the deeds we do" (Wilford Woodruff,<i>Discourses of Wilford Woodruff</i>[Salt Lake City, Utah: Bookcraft, 1946], pp. 8–9).<br><br>We, as spirit children of our Father in Heaven, had the opportunity to choose in the premortal existence because we possessed agency. One of the choices we made was the selection of the plan that was to govern the earth and its people: the plan of Satan<i>without</i>agency or the plan of Jesus Christ<i>with</i>agency. We chose the plan with agency--a plan which required that<i>we</i>must direct our own lives. The framework for the operation of agency was declared before we made the choice. We knew what we were choosing, and, thereby, we accepted responsibility for the decisions we make and the actions we undertake. Our Heavenly Father holds each of us accountable.<br><br>John A. Widtsoe wrote:<br><br><i>Since the law of free agency is ever uppermost in the plan of salvation, the Lord who gave the law must respect it, even though He weep at the errors of His children. It would be a violation of His own plan, should He step in.</i>[John A. Widtsoe,<i>Evidences and Reconciliations,</i>arr. G. Homer Durham (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1960, 1987), p. 217]<br><br>Our Heavenly Father conforms to the terms and conditions that govern agency and the plan of salvation.<br><br>I have a deep testimony that our<i>responsibility</i>for our agency is as sure as is the<i>gift</i>of our agency. We cannot change the terms and conditions that govern the principle. We made the decision to accept it, and now we must live by it. It is much like the decision made by those of us who are blessed to be members of the Brigham Young University community, whether we are students, staff, faculty, or administration. When we chose to join this community, if we were and are honest and forthright, we also acknowledged then, and must continue to do so now, that we made the decision to commit ourselves to the Honor Code. We made a covenant in each case--accepting the gift of agency and signing the Honor Code. Our decision was made with terms and conditions established, and it is not our option to demand changes simply because we would prefer to walk or talk or to act in ways that do not conform to the principles, patterns, and practices we knew or should have known before we made the covenants.<br><br>President Kimball said:<br><br><i>Every soul must stand trial and pay the uttermost farthing in one way or another. Escape from the consequences of acts of free agency is an impossibility. No one, however clever, bypasses the "due reward of our deeds." There are dark, deep corners, locked rooms, isolated spots, but no act, good or bad; no thought, ugly or beautiful, ever escapes being seen or heard. Every one will make the imprint on the individual and be recorded, to be met and paid for. Hence, one only deceives himself to think he is "getting by" with anything improper.</i>[<i>TSWK,</i>p. 155]<br><br>Probably all of you already understand these principles of agency and their significance in our lives, so why have I chosen to discuss this topic? The choice was made because I was impressed that I should share some of the lessons that have been intensified for me through observation, teaching, and working with others; lessons that have provided new insights, deeper understandings, intense joy, and sorrow; lessons that have enriched my life because I accepted the position as director of the Honor Code Office--a position that I did not aspire to and did not seek, but a position that came to me through a quiet, gentle, noncoercive invitation to serve. This is often the way our Heavenly Father presents opportunities and challenges to us. As I pondered the invitation, I came to know that the invitation should be accepted. I, therefore, exercised my agency to respond to what I accepted as a call. This response, over which many of my friends and acquaintances have shaken their heads in disbelief, was a response that has and will affect my life eternally.<br><br>Specifically, my experience as director of the Honor Code Office has enhanced my awareness not only of the critical nature of our exercise of agency, but also of the contrasting, sometimes conflicting, conceptions regarding the application of agency in individual lives. The insights that I will share center around three--sometimes distinct and sometimes overlapping--conceptions regarding agency. These are multidimensional conceptions that can be examined from different viewpoints. They are conceptions that I frequently encounter in my work, in the media, and in personal interactions with others.<br><br>The first conception has to do with control:<i>Who</i>is in charge of the terms and conditions under which agency operates? The second conception relates to timing: At what point should sensitivity to the importance of choices and decision become an issue in one's life? The third conception deals with<i>what</i>is one free to choose, to think, and to do? In other words, what aspects of daily life does agency affect or what is the nature of the choices for which one is responsible?<br><br>Let's begin with an examination of some of the differing viewpoints that focus on the conception of<i>control.</i>One viewpoint suggests that agency, including the terms and conditions upon which it operates, belongs to the individual, and, therefore, the individual is free to take any action or to think any thoughts so long as they are chosen and the choices feel okay to the individual making the decisions. Individuals of this persuasion respond warmly to the doctrine of Korihor that "every man fared in this life according to the management of the creature; therefore every man prospered according to his genius, and ... every man conquered according to his strength; and whatsoever a man did was no crime" (Alma 30:17). They also like Nehor's message "that all mankind should be saved at the last day, and that they need not fear" (Alma 1:4). Thus, everyone is<i>okay</i>just as they are and will be saved in the kingdom--if there is a kingdom--so not to worry.<br><br>These individuals tend to see man, especially themselves, as having great wisdom and sometimes suggest that surely this is the basis upon which man was given agency in the first place. Therefore, whatever thoughts are espoused and whatever actions are embraced are fine because they have been chosen.<br><br>The kinds of messages that have accompanied the expression of this viewpoint regarding control in the exercise of agency include "I am the boss of what, when, where, and how I will do things. After all, through the teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith I have come to know that I am to be taught correct principles and then allowed to govern myself. Don't you understand that I am free to do whatever I choose?" Somehow the anticipation, as these words are expressed, is that the consummation of such choices, having been freely made, assures one that there are no consequences emanating from them. Curiously, these thoughts are often articulated when it is evident that the principles are probably not understood. In addition, the personal certainty of those who champion this viewpoint regarding control of the exercise of agency ensures that they are unlikely to see or will not see or accept the messages before them. Self-justification becomes seductive, and rationalization alluring and provocative.<br><br>A contrasting viewpoint related to the conception of control in the exercise of agency is based on the perception that personal responsibility must be assumed because a covenant was made when the gift was accepted. Individuals who embrace this conviction understand their responsibility for exercising their agency and are sensitive about the need to make changes and adjustments in their lives. These individuals echo Nephi's words, "Wilt thou make me that I may shake at the appearance of sin? May the gates of hell be shut continually before me, because that my heart is broken and my spirit is contrite!" (2 Nephi 4:31–32). Their appreciation of the gift of agency is deep, and they understand its relationship to repentance. This level of commitment is expressed in words such as "I am grateful for the lessons I have learned from the errors I have made because they have given me insight about repentance--an insight that has been followed by my application of the principle. The process has not been easy. In fact, it has been very exacting, but I know, as never before, that the Savior loves me and that he trusts me to grow through experience and by the exercise of my agency."<br><br>The second agency-related conception,<i>timing,</i>is an issue that we each encounter frequently in our own and in the lives of others. Basically, disparate viewpoints center on<i>when</i>an individual thinks they ought to get serious about the choices and decisions that are made.<br><br>Some of the expressed viewpoints about timing as they affect agency include "Anything I do is okay until I am baptized" or "Having entered the kingdom through baptism, the Atonement takes care of all sins--so everything is splendid. What's the big deal? Why push me now?"<br><br>Or you may have heard, as I have, "When I am ready, I will take care of<i>it</i>(whatever their<i>it</i>is), so please just leave me alone. Don't bug me. The Atonement has made amends for sin already. The Savior understands me. He knows my weaknesses, and his help will be available to me when I am ready. I just need to repent, and I will do it when I am ready and not a minute sooner." I find the arrogance of this position heartbreaking--heartbreaking for the individual making the statement as well as heartbreaking for me. There is no sense of the depth of pain and anguish that was experienced in Gethsemane, no sense of the agony that accompanied the Savior's willing sacrifice, no sense of awareness that we each personally contributed to that agony, no expression of humility or gratitude that our Elder Brother cared so much that he gave his all for each of us--a sacrifice that only he could make.<br><br>The thought that some could say to themselves, let alone to others, "I will do as I please and then accept the offering when it is expedient for me" is almost inconceivable.<br><br>Another viewpoint related to the conception of timing is that expressed by those who do not desire, who sometimes even refuse, to make decisions now or in the foreseeable future. These are they who become so consumed by the responsibility to righteously exercise their agency that they fear doing anything. They are like the recipient of the "one talent" who hid it in the ground so it would not be lost. They ask, "Is it okay if I ...?" or "What should I do?" or "Why won't you just tell me what to do?" They want direction in all things at all times. Responsibility is too much for them.<br><br>Then there are those whose viewpoint of the exercise of agency encompasses both the<i>costs</i>embodied in the Atonement and the personal responsibility that comes with having accepted the gift. These individuals often acknowledge that they regret the mistakes, miscalculations, misinterpretations, and misconceptions that have led to sin in their lives. However, their experiences have also taught them to follow the counsel given by Alma to his son Corianton: "Let your sins trouble you, with that trouble which shall bring you down unto repentance" (Alma 42:29). They become more sensitive to the early warning signs of things that might cause them to stray into strange byways, and they relish the lessons that prompt them to cling more tightly to the iron rod and stay on the straight and narrow path.<br><br>Viewpoints related to "who has control of the terms and conditions that give us the framework for exercise of agency" and related to "the point at which one ought to become concerned about one's choices and decisions" often interface with the third conception:<i>Free to do what?</i>Viewpoints about "free to do what?" frequently produce a dichotomy. Choices are seen as (1) those things that one ought not to do and (2) those things that one ought to do. Sometimes the ought-to-dos are also seen as things that one ought to do but would rather not do.<br><br>Some hold that agency is only exercised when one is approaching or is on the doorstep of imprudence, impropriety, immorality, or some other thought or action cleverly presented by Satan. For those thus engaged, movement from the path of righteousness is usually an easy step-by-step process--here a little, there a little. Movement toward wrongdoing unfolds over time and seldom is a sudden leap into major misdeeds.<br><br>Contrary to the position of those who hold the view that agency is only exercised when choosing to do what one ought not to do, the exercise of agency is not unidirectional. President Brigham Young taught:<br><br><i>Does it follow that a man is deprived of his rights, because he lists in his heart to do the will of God?</i>. . .<i>I can manifest to the heavens and to the inhabitants of the earth that I am freeborn, and have my liberty before God, angels and men, when I kneel down to pray, certainly as much as if I were to go out and swear.</i>. . .<i>I believe that this course proves that I am a free agent, as much as if I were to steal, swear, lie, and get drunk.</i>[<i>DBY,</i>p. 65]<br><br>Agency is ours. Choices and decisions are ours. We are responsible for them. Let us, therefore, choose wisely. In the time that remains, let us look together at some of the fundamental options that continually require our exercise of agency.<br><br>May we willingly choose<i>obedience over disobedience</i>and<i>compliance over resistance!</i>Obedience requires, in the words of Elder McConkie, that "we voluntarily choose good rather than evil, light in preference to darkness, Deity's way in preference to the devil's, [otherwise] it is philosophically impossible to be saved" (McConkie,<i>A New Witness,</i>p. 683).<br><br>Having signed the Honor Code, thus covenanting to abide by it, a student may ask, "What difference does it make if my appearance doesn't meet the Dress and Grooming Standards? After all, it's what's inside that counts. You do not know the real me, and if you'd relax and get to know me, you'd realize that I am okay, that I do have good and appropriate intentions." However, deliberate disregard of the Dress and Grooming Standards is a visible sign of disobedience, and it does indeed speak to what's inside, but the message likely differs from what the individual perceives. The arguments used to cover the choice to do other than complying with the commitment that has been made are irrelevant.<br><br>Another example of deliberate behaviors that reflect disobedience and that frequently comes to the attention of the Honor Code Office has to do with the Residential Living Standards. Parenthetically, we are apprehensive that an increase in such reports may be experienced because teenage, coed slumber parties are in vogue in the world, and, in fact, are the hot topic on talk shows this week. Sometimes as Latter-day Saints we follow the world's patterns rather than firmly establishing and maintaining our own.<br><br>There are individuals who declare that those who support the Residential Living Standards--expecting that young men and young women not go into each other's private living spaces (bedrooms and bathrooms as opposed to public areas like living rooms and kitchens)--are residing in the Dark Ages and need to get up to the decade of the nineties. A letter from a former student reflects the folly of attempting to explain away Residential Living Standards. The letter read, "I thought that the rules regarding Residential Living Standards were the most ridiculous rules that ever existed. After all, I reasoned, you should have been able to discern that nothing inappropriate was either intended or going on. After all, we only went into the bedroom to study together, to read the scriptures, and to pray. I am sorry to have to report that I came to know that the rules were not ridiculous. They were to protect us, and they were founded on principles. The reasons are clear to me now, and I want to apologize for my disregard of them. Should my children ever have the privilege of becoming students at BYU, rest assured that they will be instructed by their parents before they leave home that Residential Living Standards matter."<br><br>Other approaches to rationalizing misbehavior--<i>choosing disobedience over obedience--</i>are reflected in such conversations as "Yes, I do know what is right and what I ought to do, but I was helping a friend" or "I need to know what it is like so that I can understand what my brother or sister who has a problem is going through. Besides, I know my strengths. I am sufficiently strong that I will not be bothered by the experience, and I will not go too far." Or a more succinct statement of some, "The Devil made me do it," which when translated means "It was all my roommate's fault. If she or he had not introduced the idea, nothing would have happened." Little do they recognize that the devil or a roommate only has power to "make us do it" if we give permission, which we may have been doing one small piece at a time until we have become hard in our hearts and blind in our minds (see 3 Nephi 2:1).<br><br>Another set of choices has to do with<i>selecting integrity over duplicity</i>and<i>virtue over vice.</i>Our word should be as good as our bond. President Kimball taught that "one might be full of wit and humor; one might be dexterous in performance, but if he has not honor and integrity, he has little or nothing" (<i>TSWK,</i>p. 388). We must decide our direction. We must determine who it is that we would like to become. As President Benson said:<br><br><i>Most individuals do not intend to be dishonest, dishonorable, or immoral. They seem to allow their characters to erode by a series of rationalizations, lies, and compromises. Then when grave temptation presents itself, they haven't the strength of character to do what they know to be right.</i>[<i>TETB,</i>p. 367]<br><br>Cheating, defrauding, flattering, and deceiving do not establish a basis of trust for family life, friendship, or career. The student who, in the midst of egregious violation of Church standards and Honor Code expectations, tells himself, "Don't think about being a BYU student, a temple-attending returned missionary who is employed by the Church, because if you do you will not be able to savor this moment, you will have to stop what you are now doing," is absorbed in deeply deceptive behavior that cheats and defrauds self more than others. A total lack of sensitivity to the absence of personal integrity and the integrity of the institutions affected by the action seems clear.<br><br>On the other hand, a student who has violated Church and Honor Code standards, who accepts responsibility for what has been done, who is remorseful, who confesses the violation, and who takes every step within the range of possibility to make amends, now says, "I wish that every student could have experienced what I have experienced because the experience has blessed my life. We all take the gospel, our membership in the Church, our student status, and the Honor Code too lightly. But it is better to not have to learn this the hard way. I will do everything in my power to help others avoid doing what I have done." This student has vigorously affirmed the desire to make integrity a central feature of daily living.<br><br>We ought also to consider the personal strength that ensues from<i>choosing righteous limits over license, leeway, and laxity.</i>In fact, we ought to give consideration to going beyond basic obedience to creating and setting limits for ourselves that enhance our reach for salvation. The limits we personally set should go beyond what we think is required. They should be limits that enhance our commitment and conformity to eternal truths. The outcome of reaching beyond the mark may be a fundamental pattern that relates to the high expectations for those who are part of the Brigham Young University family--expectations that in some specific dimensions are higher than those for Church members in general; expectations that, if met, will prepare us more fully for responsibility in the kingdom; expectations that are an assurance that the education and discipline of the spirit are critical dimensions of a BYU education.<br><br>The counsel to extend ourselves beyond basic duty came as the Savior responded to the apostles, as recorded in Luke, when they desired to know what they could do to increase their faith. Jesus said:<br><br><i>When ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.</i>[Luke 17:10]<br><br>Related to setting limits is the discipline that comes from<i>choosing industry over misdirected industry, idleness, and sloth.</i>The Book of Mormon is replete with examples of the results of industry and developing talents and the consequences of idleness, which is consistently followed by the appearance of depravity.<br><br>Daily we are presented with opportunities to make the effort to accomplish what is needful or to try to cover our deficiency by deception. Explanations we hear regarding the justification for academic dishonesty are frequently linked to lack of or misdirection of industry. Frequently, for example, it seems that attention to friends, leisure, personal interests, and addictions to television programs or computer games are more critical than studies and require so much time that there is no time left for preparation. We hear, "I am exhausted because we never get to bed before two or three in the morning. I don't have the energy or time to go to class and to study. I have to have my sleep or I will get sick." Perhaps they<i>are</i>in a sense experiencing a sickness--but one that is not evident to them--and surely this is one of a different nature than a sickness resulting from a lack of sleep.<br><br>I will ever be grateful for parents who not only assisted each of their children in the development of useful skills and talents but also provided us with the opportunity to experience the rewards and satisfaction of working hard and sharing the process with others.<br><br>Another test with which we are faced is the<i>choice of selflessness over selfishness.</i>These are choices that are central to our eternal salvation because they encompass the rendering of service. Sometimes we see selfishness as only connected to material things. The more acute test between selflessness and selfishness, however, is reflected in demands for self-gratification. Contrast, for example, those who see only their own desires to exert power over another or see only satisfaction of their own physical needs as a primary goal with those who are sensitive to others' needs and are willing to extend themselves to meet the needs. Those who see others' needs may at times see the needs more clearly than the individuals who have the needs.<br><br>Another significant set of choices for which we will be accountable grows out of repeated counsel from the prophets regarding the establishment of homes. The implications of choosing home over<i>whatever else catches our fancy</i>are touched on in some way in every general conference. President Joseph F. Smith indicated, for example:<br><br><i>There is no substitute for the home. Its foundation is as ancient as the world, and its mission has been ordained of God from the earliest of times. From Abraham sprang two ancient races represented in Isaac and Ishmael. The one built stable homes, and prized its land as a divine inheritance. The other became children of the desert, and as restless as its ever-shifting sands upon which their tents were pitched. ... The home then is more than a habitation, it is an institution which stands for stability and love in individuals as well as in nations.</i>[<i>GD,</i>p. 300]<br><br>As you make choices, give attention to the possibility that many of us may not be living in homes today but rather in houses, condominiums, or apartments. These may be mere spaces that provide no more than "wandering grounds" for a nomadic family system; spaces that only provide a place to graze and occasionally to rest; spaces where people come and go at their own paces and leisure without reference to others; spaces where family work that creates ties that bind has been eliminated to the greatest extent possible. The elimination of family work has also limited the opportunity to learn about integrity through contributing to and receiving from others. Shared work and shared responsibility produce an awareness of the consequences of the exercise of agency.<br><br>Living spaces as opposed to homes have the potential of creating a modern-day nomadic culture with weak roots. The counsel of the prophets that "no other success can compensate for failure in the home" (David O. McKay,<i>CR,</i>April 1964, p. 5) and "Remember always that the most important of the Lord's work you and I will ever do will be within the walls of our own homes" (Harold B. Lee,<i>Stand Ye in Holy Places</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1975], pp. 255–56) should receive primary attention in our exercise of agency. The distractions to home are many and colorfully presented. The decisions that must be made related to home and family are far too critical to be left to whatever time is left over. Exercise of our agency should assure that home as it encompasses family will be a top priority, requiring commitment of our most serious thought and consistent effort.<br><br>In conclusion, a student told me recently, "I have come to know that my exercise of agency has influence that extends beyond myself. I have become aware of ways in which my choices and my interactions affect others--ways that I would never have dreamed would make a difference." The student echoed President McKay's instruction that<br><br><i>there is another responsibility correlated and even coexistent with free agency, which is too infrequently emphasized, and that is the effect not only of a person's actions but also of his thoughts upon others. Man radiates what he is, and that radiation affects to a greater or lesser degree every person who comes within that radiation.</i>[<i>GI,</i>p. 302;<i>CR,</i>April 1950, p. 34]<br><br>Please recognize that our influence can be quiet and subtle. We may be unaware that the choices we make--the things we do and say--are even noted by those around us. Still, we are responsible, whether we deliberately set about to influence others or whether it happens without our forethought or our awareness. Our agency is reflected in the hundreds of small decisions made each day--the choices made in each interaction, whatever the context, influence in small or significant ways. The power of the subtle exercise of agency on you personally, or on others, might be seen by taking a short walk here on campus. Go down the sidewalk on the west side of the McKay Building past the Brimhall Building toward the Maeser Building and look carefully at the sidewalk--you will discover some sections where it appears that soon after the cement was poured leaves dropped from the trees onto the wet surface. Now the weight of a leaf is not great, but it was sufficient at that point to leave an impression in the concrete for all to see. The influence of your choices need not be ponderous or be widely advertised. The gentle impressions--whether the warmth and assurance that come through choices that lead to salvation or those that quietly dissuade from paths of righteousness--carry the message. Just as the leaves left their impression long after the leaves were no more, your choices will influence even after you are no more.<br><br>May we each be blessed with a deeper appreciation of the significance of our gift of agency: a gift with responsibility, a gift that is the foundation of our soul's progress toward salvation. May we know that our daily exercise of agency has eternal reverberations. May we understand that we have both control and responsibility within the terms and conditions of the gift we have been given. May we know that<i>now is the time</i>to take seriously and give attention to the choices we make. May we know by the witness of the Spirit that the greatest reflection of the exercise of our agency is found when--against all odds, against all pressure, persuasion, and enticement--we still choose the right. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Ruth E.

<h1>uit of Happiness - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Greetings to all! What a great blessing to me personally to be here, to share a few thoughts with you, and to express my testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>I have so many blessings--all too many to enumerate here. My family, as with most of you, is at the top of my list. Another great blessing, which we take for granted all too often, is this outstanding school of higher education. This is a blessing. It is also a blessing to be a student here. (And, by the way, it's okay to lose once in a while to that school to the north.)<br><br>When first asked if I would accept this invitation to be with you today, the thought rushed through my mind: What could I say that would be helpful, that would cause students to pause and to think?<br><br>One of my outstanding teachers--an English teacher, incidentally--once said that the only goal we had all year long was to learn to think.<br><br>In this quest, and after prayerful consideration, it came to me that we're all looking for happiness and joy--wherever we are, whatever our past. The pursuit of happiness has been a dream of all people from the time of Adam and Eve. It's a founding principle of this great country of ours. The Declaration of Independence declares that among our inalienable rights are "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."<br><br>How would you define happiness?<br><br>President David O. McKay stated, "Happiness is not an external condition, it is a state of the spirit and attitude of the mind" (<i>CR,</i>October 1934, p. 93).<br><br>Dale Carnegie said, "Happiness doesn't depend on outward conditions. It depends on inner conditions. It isn't what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about" (<i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i>[New York: Pocket Books, 1981], p. 71).<br><br>In simple terms, a righteous life is the way--the only way--to happiness, joy, and peace. As one of our hymns reminds us, "Choose the right! There is peace in righteous doing" ("Choose the Right,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 239).<br><br>If there be a theme to my remarks, it is found in the Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 2:25: "Men are, that they might have joy."<br><br>Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin taught in his general conference address in October 1989:<br><br><i>Our Heavenly Father knows the way for you</i>[and me]<i>to enjoy happiness and peace; the principles of the gospel mark the way. They are</i>[his]<i>gift to</i>[each of us].<br><br><i>On the other hand, Satan will try, at every step of the way, to lead</i>[us]<i>off course. His objective is to make you</i>[and me]<i>unhappy and miserable like he is. (See 2 Ne. 2:27.)</i>[Maybe that's the source of the oft-heard phrase "Misery loves company."]<i>Vast sums of money are spent each year to package and disguise sin and evil to make them appear enticing, attractive, even harmless. However, regardless of appearances, "wickedness never was happiness" (Alma 41:10) and never will be. Never find yourselves in the position of the Nephites just a few years before the birth of the Savior. They "sought .</i>. .<i>for that which [they] could not obtain;</i>. . .<i>for happiness in doing iniquity, which thing is contrary to the nature of that righteousness which is in our great and Eternal Head." (Hel. 13:38.) You cannot find happiness in sin and iniquity.</i><br><br><i>The Lord has given</i>[us]<i>the gift of agency (see Moses 7:32) and instructed</i>[us]<i>sufficiently to know good from evil (see 2 Ne. 2:5).</i>[We]<i>are free to choose (see 2 Ne. 2:27) and</i>[we]<i>are permitted to act (see 2 Ne. 10:23; Hel. 14:30), but</i>[we]<i>are not free to choose the consequences. With absolute certainty, choices of good and right lead to happiness and peace, while choices of sin and evil eventually lead to unhappiness, sorrow, and misery.</i>[Joseph B. Wirthlin, "Running Your Marathon," Ensign, November 1989, p. 75; emphasis added]<br><br>My first point of emphasis: Place the Lord Jesus Christ at the center of all you do. Only by so doing can you find true and lasting happiness.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught:<br><br><i>Happiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it; and this path is virtue, uprightness, faithfulness, and holiness, and keeping all the commandments of God.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>pp. 255–56]<br><br>Another prophet, President Ezra Taft Benson, taught:<br><br><i>You cannot do wrong and feel right. It is impossible! Years of happiness can be lost in the foolish gratification of a momentary desire for pleasure. Satan would have you believe that happiness comes only as you surrender to his enticements, but one only needs to look at the shattered lives of those who violate God's laws to know why Satan is called the Father of Lies.</i>["A Message to the Rising Generation,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1977, p. 30]<br><br>To assist you in finding and keeping true happiness, the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are placing renewed emphasis on some very basic instructions: namely, to pray daily--petitioning our Heavenly Father for guidance and direction and at the same time expressing thanks and appreciation; and to read our scriptures daily also--not necessarily so many pages per day but, instead, to ponder, study, and review verses by a subject or a principle of doctrine. This, combined with loving, Christlike service to others, leads us to place the Lord Jesus Christ at the center of our lives. This is the means of obtaining true and lasting happiness.<br><br>My second point of emphasis, which I have already touched on, is to know that enduring happiness comes from what we really are--our thoughts, our deeds of service, the decisions we make--and not from possessions, positions, or prominence.<br><br>In this world of ours, society places an undue emphasis on the wrong things. As a result, we sometimes seek to measure success--even happiness--by material goods. This is<i>not</i>a true measure! It is so temporary. What matters most is the happiness and joy that comes from living the gospel of Jesus Christ. The laws of God are given for our happiness.<br><br>Let me quote again from the Prophet Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>But in obedience there is joy and peace unspotted, unalloyed; and as God has designed our happiness--and the happiness of all His creatures, he never has--He never will institute an ordinance or give a commandment to His people that is not calculated in its nature to promote that happiness which He has designed, and which will not end in the greatest amount of good and glory to those who become the recipients of his law and ordinances. Blessings offered, but rejected, are no longer blessings, but become like the talent hid in the earth by the wicked and slothful servant; the proffered good returns to the giver; the blessing is bestowed on those who will receive and occupy.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>pp. 256–57]<br><br>A third point I should like to emphasize is that we should be cheerful in the face of adversity. Just think of these words Joseph Smith wrote to the persecuted and suffering Saints while he himself languished as a prisoner in Liberty Jail: "Therefore, dearly beloved brethren, let us cheerfully do all things that lie in our power" (D&amp;amp;C 123:17).<br><br>The Saints had been driven from the comforts of their homes and were scattered on the plains of Missouri. The Prophet himself was in jail, facing death--a time in his life when he may have been discouraged, concerned, unhappy. But what did he say? "Therefore, dearly beloved brethren, let us cheerfully do all things that lie in our power."<br><br>This leads to my next point of emphasis. Happy people are of a cheerful countenance. The Lord has frequently admonished us to "be of good cheer" (John 16:33, D&amp;amp;C 61:36). The Lord has also declared, "Wherefore, lift up thy heart and rejoice, and cleave unto the covenants which thou hast made" (D&amp;amp;C 25:13).<br><br>Commenting on this verse, President Gordon B. Hinckley said:<br><br><i>I believe he is saying to each of us, be happy. The gospel is a thing of joy. It provides us with a reason for gladness. Of course there are times of sorrow. Of course there are hours of concern and anxiety. We all worry. But the Lord has told us to lift our hearts and rejoice. I see so many people, . . . who seem never to see the sunshine, but who constantly walk with storms under cloudy skies. Cultivate an attitude of happiness. Cultivate a spirit of optimism. Walk with faith, rejoicing in the beauties of nature, in the goodness of those you love, in the testimony which you carry in your heart concerning things divine.</i>["If Thou Art Faithful,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1984, pp. 91–92]<br><br>This inspired counsel from our prophet reminds me of the words of the song we sang as children: "No one likes a frowning face. Change it for a smile. Make the world a better place By smiling all the while" ("Smiles,"<i>Songbook,</i>p. 267).<br><br>The next point I would like to emphasize is that it is important to distinguish between the pursuit of happiness and the pursuit of pleasure. Sometimes we get so mixed up in our pursuit of happiness that we settle for pleasure. Pleasure is so short-lived. It is here one moment and gone in almost the next breath.<br><br>In this respect, consider these observations on the difference between pleasure and happiness by the scholar and apostle Elder James E. Talmage:<br><br><i>The present is an age of pleasure-seeking, and men are losing their sanity in the mad rush for sensations that do but excite and disappoint. In this day of counterfeits, adulterations, and base imitations, the devil is busier than he has ever been in the course of human history, in the manufacture of pleasures, both old and new; and these he offers for sale in most attractive fashion, falsely labeled,</i>Happiness.<i>. . .</i><br><br><i>Happiness includes all that is really desirable and of true worth in pleasure, and much beside. Happiness is genuine gold, pleasure but gilded brass. . . . Happiness is as the genuine diamond, which, rough or polished, shines with its own inimitable luster; pleasure is as the paste imitation that glows only when artificially embellished. Happiness is as the ruby, red as the heart's blood, hard and enduring; pleasure, as stained glass, soft, brittle, and of but transitory beauty. . . .</i><br><br><i>Happiness leaves no bad after-taste, it is followed by no depressing reaction; it calls for no repentance, brings no regret, entails no remorse; pleasure too often makes necessary repentance, contrition, and suffering; and, if indulged to the extreme, it brings degradation and destruction.</i>[<i>Jesus the Christ</i>(Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1916), pp. 247–48; emphasis in original]<br><br>Furthermore, there is an even higher level of happiness. Lehi declared, "Men [speaking generically to include women] are, that they might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25).<br><br>Elder Dallin H. Oaks has stated:<br><br><i>Joy is more than happiness. Joy is the ultimate sensation of well-being. It comes from being complete and in harmony with our Creator and his eternal laws.</i><br><br><i>The opposite of joy is misery. Misery is more than unhappiness, sorrow, or suffering. Misery is the ultimate state of disharmony with God and his laws.</i>["Joy and Mercy,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1991, p. 73]<br><br>I'd now like to share with you a potpourri of thoughts regarding happiness by some anonymous writers:<br><br>• Someone observed, "People so often play up the bad side of things. Nobody ever puts out a sign that says, 'Nice Dog.'"<br><br>Each night on the TV news, we hardly ever hear good news. It's the bad side of life we hear about--death, accidents, floods, wars, violence. Even so, there are great things happening each and every day--untold stories of love and charity. Help comes here and there and everywhere. It may not be news, but it is uplifting and character building.<br><br>• Another said, "Now and then it's good to pause in our pursuit of happiness and just be happy."<br><br>Be yourself. Don't be "uptight." Don't be phoney in your doings.<br><br>Let me share an experience I had as I graduated from "that other school." We were in the process of job interviews, and most of the people in my class had interviewed with a particular company and with a particular person. All of my associates had reported to each other all of the questions the interviewer would ask and also shared thoughts as to what answers he was looking for. Can you imagine? Talk about phoney!<br><br>I wasn't myself in that interview. I answered with what someone else had said. I failed that interview so badly. I tried to tell that man what I thought he wanted to hear instead of what was in my heart and my true feelings.<br><br>A few more thoughts:<br><br>• Happiness is never stopping to think if you are.<br><br>• A man was going through some stress in his life and had become rather short-tempered and grumpy. He recognized that he was making life rather miserable for his wife and, comparing himself to the Seven Dwarfs, said to his wife: "I've gone from 'Happy' to 'Grumpy.' What's next?" His wife quickly replied, "'Lonely.'"<br><br>• Even seemingly miserable conditions can be full of happiness. For example, consider the following: Happiness is what is being experienced by a business executive who has left his cool, comfortable, air-conditioned office for a fishing trip and is sitting in a leaky boat under a blazing sun, wearing woolen socks, musty rubber boots, and fish-smelling pants, sweating profusely as he kicks over a can of worms while untangling a backlash in his fishing line.<br><br>We all need a change in our daily routine from time to time so we can really see the big picture.<br><br>Arthur Rubinstein, the great pianist, made this observation:<br><br><i>Most people, in my opinion, have an unrealistic approach toward happiness because they invariably use the fatal conjunction "if" as a condition. You hear them say: I would be happy</i>if<i>I were rich, or</i>if<i>this girl loved me, or</i>if<i>I had talent, or, their most popular "if":</i>if<i>I had good health. They often attain their goal, but they discover soon some new "ifs."</i><br><br>. . .<i>As for myself, I love life for better or for worse, unconditionally.</i>[Arthur Rubinstein,<i>My Young Years</i>(New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1973), p. 362; emphasis in original]<br><br>My good friends, have you ever lost something so important or precious to you that it caused you to lose sleep or has brought you to the point that it was the thing that consumed your thoughts? You may know that it's not really lost but just misplaced, but there is such relief or joy that comes over you when it is found. There is something very special about this feeling of relief, happiness, and joy.<br><br>Isn't it like the joy expressed in the New Testament, in the Gospel of Luke, chapter 15?<br><br><i>What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?</i><br><br><i>And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.</i><br><br><i>And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.</i><br><br><i>I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.</i>[Luke 15:4–7]<br><br>And then, in the same chapter, we read of the joy of the father of the prodigal son, and we also learn a lesson about the brother's feelings of jealousy.<br><br><i>A certain man had two sons:</i><br><br><i>And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living.</i><br><br><i>And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.</i><br><br><i>And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.</i><br><br><i>And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.</i><br><br><i>And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.</i><br><br><i>And</i>w<i>hen he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!</i><br><br><i>I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,</i><br><br><i>And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.</i><br><br><i>And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.</i><br><br><i>And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.</i><br><br><i>But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:</i><br><br><i>And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry:</i><br><br><i>For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.</i><br><br><i>Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing.</i><br><br><i>And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.</i><br><br><i>And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.</i><br><br><i>And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and in treated him.</i><br><br><i>And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:</i><br><br><i>But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.</i><br><br><i>And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.</i><br><br><i>It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.</i>[Luke 15:11–32]<br><br>There is also happiness and joy that comes from completing our Church callings in a pleasing way to our Heavenly Father.<br><br>One of the stake presidents in Phoenix, Arizona, made the following report that really touched me:<br><br><i>I was humbled to learn that last quarter 100 percent of our single adults and single parents were visited. It is humbling, while also sad, to realize that in many homes the home teacher is considered the father by the children who reside there.</i><br><br><i>This past month I met two families in the stake who shared the same home teacher. They had just learned that their home teacher was moving because of a job transfer.</i><br><br><i>During the last sacrament meeting the home teacher attended prior to his move, several children from the homes he taught sang "Lord, I Would Follow Thee"</i>(Hymns, 1985,<i>no. 220). At the halfway mark in the third verse, the children began to cry and could not continue singing. As a quiet began to rush over the congregation, the words of the song began to be heard from the back of the chapel. It was the remainder of the family members singing from their hearts. As they sang, they stood--a single mother with her other children and another sister and her nonmember husband. It was one of the most moving things I have ever witnessed. As the music stopped, it was as if everyone could still hear a heavenly choir.</i><br><br><i>I later learned that this wonderful home teacher had, for years, visited each of his families once a week. Though he had never held a ward position viewed by others as significant, I had a witness that his work in his call as a home teacher had dwarfed any accomplishment of any leader in his ward or our stake. I came away from that meeting with a better understanding of the Lord's feelings regarding the call of a home teacher than from any talk I have ever heard.</i><br><br>Certainly this story illustrates how dedicated, unselfish service brings great joy and happiness to the one rendering the service as well as to the ones being served. What a contrast this home teacher was to the selfish people who think only of themselves.<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell observed that "selfish people are forever taking their own temperature, asking themselves, 'Am I happy?'" (<i>All These Things Shall Give Thee Experience</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1979], p. 60).<br><br>In summary, I encourage you to:<br><br>1. Place the Lord Jesus Christ at the center of all you do.<br><br>2. Know that enduring happiness comes from what we really are and not from possessions, positions, or prominence.<br><br>3. Be cheerful in the face of adversity.<br><br>4. Have a cheerful countenance.<br><br>5. Distinguish between the pursuit of happiness and the pursuit of pleasure.<br><br>My brothers and sisters, the gospel is true. Not only that, it truly is "the great plan of happiness" (Alma 42:8). To act contrary to the principles and covenants of the gospel of Jesus Christ is to be "in a state contrary to the nature of happiness" (Alma 41:11).<br><br>We are guided and directed by a prophet of God, yes, President Gordon B. Hinckley. The priesthood of God was restored to the earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith. I testify of these things in the name of him whose Church this is, he who beckons us to follow the true road to happiness, even Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>W. Mack Lawrence was a member of the Second Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 13 June 1995.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>mith’s Christlike Attributes - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In late May the Mississippi River runs swift and high, sparkling and bubbling in the midday sunlight. Birds sing; the air is redolent with fragrances; distantly you can hear a soft Sabbath bell toll; the earth and all about is richly abundant with life.<br><br>Some eleven miles to the east, across the farmlands away from the great Mississippi, stands the small town of Carthage, Illinois. On Sunday, May 21, of this year, my family and I solemnly walked the paths of Carthage and examined anew the momentous events of that place.<br><br>I could not help but look toward today's assignment, knowing I would stand before you marvelous and gifted students at BYU and your devoted administration and faculty, wanting and wishing with all my heart that each of you could feel what I was feeling at that moment as I tried to absorb it and take it all in--knowing this would be the exact anniversary of the Martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph Smith and of his brother Hyrum Smith, June 27, 1995. One hundred and fifty-one years ago today, Joseph, the prophet of the Restoration, and Hyrum, patriarch of the Church, gave their individual lives for the sake of their testimony of Jesus Christ.<br><br>In the fifth hour after noon, each suffered multiple shots. It is interesting, and I think even important, that in Jewish symbolism the number<i>five</i>denotes sanctification and/or purification. Five hours after noonday Joseph and Hyrum died.<br><br>Neither brother sought death, but it was not unforeseen. Joseph had forebodings as early as April 1829, when the Lord told him, "And even if they do unto you even as they have done unto me, blessed are ye, for you shall dwell with me in glory" (D&amp;amp;C 6:30). Joseph went to Carthage, in his words, "like a lamb to the slaughter" (D&amp;amp;C 135:4). The ruthless death of these brothers was their final witness of the Savior whom they served. As John Taylor wrote of Joseph:<br><br><i>Like most of the Lord's anointed in ancient times,</i>[he]<i>has sealed his mission and his works with his own blood. ...</i><br><br><i>... The testators are now dead, and their testament is in force.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 135:3, 5]<br><br>In sealing his testimony with his blood, Joseph followed the pattern of the Savior. It was in reference to the Savior, the "mediator of the new testament," that Paul taught, "For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator. For a testament is of force after men are dead" (Hebrews 9:15–17). I will never forget Carthage and the impression it left on my soul. Nauvoo was next. This is where I met a missionary couple whose strong and humble witness of Joseph so affected me that I asked if they would write down their feelings for me about their mission in the City of Joseph. A few weeks ago I received a reply from Elder and Sister Wood that seems appropriate here. They said:<br><br><i>Since our call to serve a mission at the Nauvoo Visitors' Center, our knowledge and testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith has grown immensely. We</i>[already]<i>knew that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God. ... We also knew that he had undergone many trials for the Church, but we didn't know or realize just what he endured and to what lengths and depths he went to help bring forth the kingdom of God and restore it to the earth.</i><br><br><i>One day, while testifying to a couple in front of the</i>Christus [statue]<i>that Jesus Christ gave his life and atoned for our sins so we, his brothers and sisters, might return to live with our Heavenly Father, I suddenly realized more fully that Joseph Smith gave</i>[up]<i>his life, too, ... that we might have the fullness of the gospel.</i><br><br>Both the Savior and the Prophet Joseph gave their lives in a divine cause. Yet President David O. McKay once wrote, "I confess that [Christ's shedding His blood] has moved me less than the realization that in His life He lived for His fellow men" ("The Atonement,"<i>Instructor,</i>March 1959, p. 66). Similarly, I am more inspired by Joseph Smith's life than by his death. Quoting John Taylor again, he "left a fame and name that cannot be slain. He lived great" (D&amp;amp;C 135:3). It is vital to commemorate the Prophet's death; we must never forget. Yet his life is a model of one possessed of mighty faith in Jesus Christ. The Lord asked the Nephites, "What manner of men ought ye to be?" and then answered his own question, "Even as I am" (see 3 Nephi 27:27). The Lord is our model and guide or, in Joseph Smith's words, "the prototype or standard of salvation" (<i>Lectures on Faith,</i>comp. N. B. Lundwall [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1959 (1972 printing)], p. 63). To be saved is to become like our Savior. We measure our spiritual progress against this standard. Joseph Smith so faithfully emulated the Master that he too becomes a model, a standard by which we can gauge our spirituality.<br><br>Because Joseph patterned his life after the Savior, whom he knew so well, we can better follow the Savior's pattern. Joseph Smith taught:<br><br><i>When men begin to live by faith they begin to draw near to God; and when faith is perfected they are like him; and because he is saved they are saved also; for they will be in the same situation he is in, because they have come to him; and when he appears they shall be like him, for they will see him as he is.</i>[<i>Lectures on Faith,</i>pp. 62–63]<br><br>Nephi wrote, "Unless a man shall endure to the end, in following the example of the Son of the living God, he cannot be saved" (2 Nephi 31:16). By looking at some of the Savior's divine attributes, we can compare them with Joseph Smith's life to see how he patterned it after his Lord. This can be a powerful reminder of what we must do to be saved or to become like Jesus Christ.<br><br>The beloved disciple John stated simply, "God is love" (1 John 4:16). Kindness and compassion flowed from the Only Begotten Son's soul as pure water from a pristine spring. Sacrifice and service were as natural to him as eating and sleeping are to us.<br><br>One of my favorite examples of the Lord's love is his raising of Lazarus, the brother of Mary and Martha. Lazarus was sick, and his sisters sent for the Lord, saying, "He whom thou lovest is sick." We are also told that "Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus." Jesus had perfect faith that he could restore Lazarus to health, as he had done on numerous occasions with others. In this instance he had both temporal and spiritual purposes in mind. He had tarried two days, and Lazarus had died. He said, "I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him." When Jesus arrived in Judea, Lazarus had lain in the grave for four days. His sisters were sorrowful. Martha said, "If thou hadst been here, my brother had not died." Even so, Martha was trusting, and said, "But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee." Jesus taught Martha, "I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live." When Jesus arrived at the grave, he saw the two sisters and others weeping. Jesus "groaned in the spirit, and was troubled." Then "Jesus wept." Jesus mourned for his friend Lazarus. The law of mourning instructs: "Thou shalt live together in love, insomuch that thou shalt weep for the loss of them that die" (D&amp;amp;C 42:45). The Lord deeply felt Mary's and Martha's anguish along with his own. Lazarus was restored to his family, and many believed on Jesus (see John 11:1–46). This gives us hope that we can indeed, one day, be like him, for we have glimpsed him as he is.<br><br>Joseph Smith taught this principle of love:<br><br><i>Love is one of the chief characteristics of Deity, and ought to be manifested by those who aspire to be the sons of God. A man filled with the love of God, is not content with blessing his family alone, but ranges through the whole world, anxious to bless the whole human race.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 174]<br><br>He further said, "I love your soul, and the souls of the children of men, and pray and do all I can for the salvation of all" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 22). Among those who knew Joseph's charity and regard was a nineteen-year-old young man named William Taylor, who spent two weeks with the Prophet. William said, "I have never known the same joy and satisfaction in the companionship of any other person" (<i>Young Woman's Journal</i>17 [1906], p. 548). It was remarked of Joseph that "he did not like to pass a child, however small, without speaking to it" (Lyman O. Littlefield, "The Prophet Joseph Smith in Zion's Camp,"<i>Juvenile Instructor</i>27, no. 4 [15 February 1892]: 109). There are stories of Joseph picking flowers for children or drying their tears or wiping mud from their shoes. Thus, Joseph humbly followed his Savior's lead in loving and blessing little children.<br><br>At the funeral of Lorenzo Barnes, he exclaimed, "O that I had the language of the archangel to express my feelings once to my friends! But I never expect to in this life" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 296). As mayor of Nauvoo, Joseph was called upon to render judgment on Anthony, a black man who had not only been selling liquor in violation of the law but had been doing it on the Sabbath. Anthony implored Joseph for leniency, stating that he needed money to buy the freedom of his child held as a slave in a southern state. Joseph said, "I am sorry, Anthony, but the law must be observed, and we will have to impose a fine." The next day Joseph gave Anthony a fine horse to purchase the freedom of the child. Joseph's largeness of soul is legendary. He wrote, "It is a duty which every Saint ought to render to his brethren freely--to always love them, and ever succor them. To be justified before God we must love one another" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 76). To show love in this same spirit is a decision each of you can make today, even at this moment.<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball, another great prophetic example of love, taught:<br><br><i>One can learn to be loving. If one patterns his life in the mold of love--if he consciously and determinedly directs his thoughts, controls his acts, and tries to feel and constantly express his love, he becomes a person of love, for "As he thinketh in his heart, so is he." (Proverbs 23:7.)</i>[<i>TSWK,</i>pp. 245–46]<br><br>You could at this moment think of someone, picture a face or think of a name, and then connect it with some act of service you could perform. If you will try this, with real intent, you will be inspired. You will know what to do. Of course, then, after you know, you must do. Act on the inspiration you receive. You will become a loving person after the pattern of Jesus and Joseph.<br><br>Love, then, is an attribute developed by choice, a deliberate decision to follow the Lord. I remind you, however, that even Jesus experienced obstacles to love, just as we do. For example, he suffered "hunger, thirst, and fatigue, even more than man can suffer" (Mosiah 3:7), but he served anyway. All of the kind, compassionate, loving things that Christ did were done in the shadow of the cross.<br><br>Consider, for example, his conversation with the Samaritan woman at the well. Jesus and his disciples were journeying from Judea to Galilee. The record states that he stopped at Jacob's well, "being wearied with his journey," and his disciples went to buy meat. Despite his weariness, he took time to teach the woman of Samaria. The record does not state whether he was ever able to rest. Apparently he did not, because the Samaritans "besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days. And many more believed because of his own word" (see John 4:1–42). We can be grateful that he sacrificed rest for responsibility. His words about living water have refreshed and brought rest to multitudes throughout the centuries.<br><br>In a comparable way, all that Joseph Smith did was in the shadow of Carthage. Persecution of the darkest hue began the first time he recounted his experience of the First Vision.<br><br>Four months after the Church was organized, he was told, "Be patient in afflictions, for thou shalt have many" (D&amp;amp;C 24:8). On the one hand, picture Joseph Smith ministering to the Saints, directing the affairs of an infant church, sending missionaries abroad, building temples, and leading his family. On the other hand, picture Joseph hiding from false accusers; dealing with contrived legal charges; enduring unjust imprisonment; hearing news of the murder, rape, and torture of his beloved Saints; coping with the venom of apostates; suffering beatings, attempted poisonings, and other mob lunacy.<br><br>He once wrote, "My family was kept in a continual state of alarm, not knowing, when I went from home, that I should ever return again; or what would befall me from day to day" (<i>Times and Seasons</i>1, p. 3). His burdens were beyond our comprehension. To paraphrase Isaiah, it is a vexation of the spirit just to hear the report of his troubles (see Isaiah 28:19).<br><br>The Prophet was not adverse to introspection, even when prompted by scurrilous tales. Stories about Joseph, many of them twisted or blatantly false, circulated constantly. Yet the Prophet said something like this:<br><br><i>When I have heard of a story about me, I sit down and think about it and pray about it, and I ask myself the question, "Did I say something or was there something about my manner to give some basis for that story to start?" And often if I think about it long enough, I realize I have done something to give that basis. And there wells up in me a forgiveness of the person who has told that story, and a resolve that I will never do that thing again.</i>[See<i>They Knew the Prophet,</i>comp. Hyrum L. Andrus and Helen Mae Andrus (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1974), p. 144]<br><br>Joseph's soul was enlarged through suffering. Too many in our day, even among Church members, become contracted through trials or ill fate. Rather than forgetting themselves in service, they withdraw into shells of bitterness and self-pity. All of us have trials and temptations adapted to our capacity. After all, this is mortality. It does no good to ask, "Why me?" Rather, we should concede, "Why<i>not</i>me?" and become more like him.<br><br>President Kimball also gave profound counsel in this area:<br><br><i>Only when you lift a burden, God will lift your burden. Divine paradox this! The man who staggers and falls because his burden is too great can lighten that burden by taking on the weight of another's burden. You get by giving, but your part of giving must be given first.</i>[<i>TSWK,</i>p. 251]<br><br>Both the Lord and the Prophet Joseph gave and gave and gave. Both were ministers of salvation. Their service and sacrifice extended to all mankind in love.<br><br>To Moses, the Lord said, "For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). The Savior's mission was centered on others' spiritual and temporal welfare. President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., said that the Savior left as a heritage for his Church the carrying on of two great activities:<br><br><i>Work for the relief of the ills and the sufferings of humanity, and the teaching of the spiritual truths which should bring us back into the presence of our Heavenly Father.</i>[<i>CR,</i>April 1937, p.22]<br><br>Thus we see the Savior healing the lepers, giving sight to the blind, causing the infirm to leap to their feet, and bringing comfort to all who would believe. He set a precedent of service. He went about relieving the ills and sufferings to which mortals are natural heirs.<br><br>In addition, the Savior taught gospel principles. His Sermon on the Mount, repeated and amplified among the Nephites, is unparalleled. His teachings concerning the bread of life and the living water are transcendent truths. When some of his disciples murmured because of his teachings, the Savior said, "The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life" (John 6:63). The Lord invited all to believe in him and to be born again, and in Mosiah's words, to be "changed from their carnal and fallen state, to a state of righteousness, being redeemed of God, becoming his sons and daughters" (Mosiah 27:25). Joseph emulated the Savior's devotion to the salvation of all mankind. As president of the Church, he organized the united order to bless the Saints temporally. He taught:<br><br><i>We must visit the fatherless and the widow in their affliction, and we must keep ourselves unspotted from the world: for such virtues flow from the great fountain of pure religion, strengthening our faith by adding every good quality that adorns the children of the blessed Jesus, we can pray in the season of prayer; we can love our neighbor as ourselves, and be faithful in tribulation, knowing that the reward of such is greater in the kingdom of heaven. What a consolation! What a joy! Let me live the life of the righteous, and let my reward be like his!</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 76]<br><br>Joseph ministered in power to relieve the considerable suffering experienced by the Saints. On what was referred to as the "day of God's power," July 22, 1839, the Prophet lay stricken with a vile disease, as were many of the Saints. Neighbor cared for neighbor, parents for children, and children for parents. There were so many ill that the caregivers were overwhelmed and exhausted. Moved upon by the Spirit, Joseph rose from his sickbed and went across the river to Montrose, Iowa. Dozens were immediately healed on that day. He states in his journal, "Many of the sick were this day raised by the power of God" (in B. H. Roberts,<i>New Witnesses for God: I. Joseph Smith, the Prophet</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret News, 1911], p. 259). The Prophet Joseph also followed the Savior in teaching the gospel of salvation. Through modern revelation, comforting and exalting doctrines were revealed to him. The Lord told him, "This generation shall have my word through you" (D&amp;amp;C 5:10). In 1841 the Prophet "told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book" (<i>HC</i>4:461). Plain and precious truths were restored through Joseph Smith's inspired translation of sacred records, bringing generations to an understanding of their Lord and Savior. We measure our fidelity to God's word through the principles revealed in the Book of Mormon.<br><br>Who besides Joseph has offered the world such a saving book? Who can match him? Who in this dispensation has surpassed the King Follett Discourse, for example? Where can we find a greater statement on faith than the<i>Lectures on Faith,</i>which were prepared under his tutelage? Who has mastered the ordinances and principles of temple worship better than he through whom the keys were restored? Joseph Smith was, indeed, a teacher of supernal truths. Brigham Young said of him:<br><br><i>The excellency of the glory of the character of brother Joseph Smith was that he could reduce heavenly things to the understanding of the finite. When he preached to the people ... he reduced his teachings to the capacity of every man, woman, and child, making them as plain as a well-defined pathway.</i>[<i>JD</i>8:206]<br><br>Therefore, our duty is to minister to the needs and wants of others, both temporally and spiritually. Joseph Smith taught, "Let the Saints remember that great things depend on their individual exertion, and that they are called to be co-workers with us and the Holy Spirit in accomplishing the great work of the last days" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 178). In the last general conference President Gordon B. Hinckley taught our responsibility:<br><br><i>We are all in this great endeavor together. ... Your obligation is as serious in your sphere of responsibility as is my obligation in my sphere. No calling in this church is small or of little consequence. All of us in the pursuit of our duty touch the lives of others. To each of us in our respective responsibilities the Lord has said: "Wherefore, be faithful; stand in the office which I have appointed unto you; succor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees" (D&amp;amp;C 81:5).</i>["This Is the Work of the Master,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1995, p. 71]<br><br>Your life, as President Stephen L. Richards used to say, is a mission, not a career. If you are wise, you will prepare for a life of service.<br><br>One reason for the Prophet's serenity in distress was his total, unflinching commitment to God's will. A dictionary definition of faith is "belief and trust in and loyalty to God." Joseph Smith loved God with a fervor born of personal experience, for he had seen him. He knew his power and glory. His trust was complete. His loyalty was unquestioning.<br><br>Jesus was the greatest person ever to walk this earth. He had infinitely greater wisdom and power than any man. He had power over life and death. He could command the elements. Yet he said, "I can of mine own self do nothing: ... because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me" (John 5:30). President Joseph F. Smith saw in vision "the hosts of the dead ... who had offered sacrifice in the similitude of the great sacrifice of the Son of God" (D&amp;amp;C 138:11–13). How can our sacrifices be in the similitude of the Savior's great infinite and eternal sacrifice? We can submit our wills to the Father's. Rather than persisting in our own "carnal wills and desires," our will, like the "will of the Son," should be "swallowed up in the will of the Father" (see Mosiah 16:12 and 15:7). This is how Christ lived, and this is how Joseph Smith lived. Such submission to God led ultimately to death. Joseph's martyrdom was indeed in similitude of the Lord's great sacrifice, for he went where he was sent and did what he did knowing full well where it would lead.<br><br>Brigham Young said, "I heard Joseph say many a time, 'I shall not live until I am forty years of age'" (<i>DBY,</i>p. 467). Yet Joseph also stated confidently, "God will always protect me until my mission is fulfilled" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 366). The chances that you and I will be called upon to die for our convictions is remote. How then can we offer a sacrifice in similitude of the great sacrifice of the Son of God? President Marion G. Romney said:<br><br><i>I decided in my youth that for me the best approach to the solution of problems and the resolving of questions would be to proceed as Jesus proceeded: foster an earnest desire to do the Lord's will; familiarize myself with what the Lord has revealed on the matters involved; pray with diligence and faith for an inspired understanding of his will and the courage to do it.</i>["What Would Jesus Do?"<i>New Era,</i>September 1972, p. 5]<br><br>The Savior concluded his mortal life as he began it--in purity and innocence. Judas painfully recognized that he had "betrayed the innocent blood" (Matthew 27:4), and Pilate called the Lord a "just person" (Matthew 27:24). Jesus was a lamb without spot or blemish. He was the sinless Son of God. His death insured that salvation could come to all who believe and obey.<br><br>Joseph Smith also concluded his life as it began--humble and obedient. He had fulfilled his mission. He said, "I have a conscience void of offense towards God, and towards all men. I shall die innocent" (D&amp;amp;C 135:4). Elder Neal A. Maxwell said:<br><br><i>The Prophet Joseph Smith, of course, was not a perfect man. There has been only one such--Jesus Christ. But Joseph Smith was a special witness for Jesus Christ. ... We do not, as some occasionally charge, worship Joseph Smith, nor place him on a par with Jesus. But we do venerate him, remembering, hopefully, that the highest and best form of veneration is emulation.</i>["The Prophet Joseph Smith: Spiritual Statesman," Annual Joseph Smith Memorial Sermons, Logan, Utah, 19 January 1975, p. 12]<br><br>My friends in Nauvoo, Elder and Sister Woods, have a deep and abiding love for the Savior and his servant Joseph Smith. They said, "Every day our experiences here give more indications of [their] greatness." To close their letter, the Woods spoke about the spirit of Joseph that still permeates the City Beautiful and related a tender experience about John.<br><br>John (not his real name), about thirty years old, walked into the visitors' center alone, where he was greeted by the Woods and asked if he'd like to take a tour--the Woods asked how much time he had. John answered, "As long as it takes to see it all." John said he was a member but had not been inside a church in almost twenty years.<br><br>I paraphrase Brother Woods' story as follows:<br><br><i>I was prompted to conduct him as though he knew nothing about the Church and began the tour about the founding of Nauvoo, the First Vision, the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, and the organization of the Church. I asked him often, "Do you remember hearing about that in Primary?" And many times he affirmed that he did remember.</i><br><br><i>I bore my testimony to John. Next I took him into the theater to see</i>Remembering Nauvoo.<i>John was the only one there for the film. As the movie began, I withdrew, but returned twenty minutes later just as John exited. He had enjoyed the presentation, and we continued the tour.</i><br><br><i>This part includes details about the city of Nauvoo and its temple--during which we arrived at the</i>Christus<i>statue, where we played the message of the Savior. Generally I don't bear my testimony here, but for some reason I sat down beside him and afterward bore my testimony about Jesus Christ.</i><br><br><i>I saw tears come to his eyes and felt impressed to say, "John, when you return home to Florida, will you seek out your bishop and tell him you want to become actively involved in the Church? Ask him what you have to do, and he will advise and help you all the way." John looked me in the eye and promised me he would do that. The tour continued to the martyrdom scene, and I again bore testimony--this time as to Joseph Smith being a true prophet. Again John's eyes moistened</i>[and]<i>we continued on to the Saints' arrival in Salt Lake and the temple there. I explained that my temple marriage to Sister Wood was for time and eternity--if we live worthy. John said, "Awesome."</i><br><br><i>We completed the tour and said our emotional good-byes. But John stopped and turned and said, "Can I ask you a very important question?" I answered, "By all means." John asked, "When you started the movie, did you stay in the theater with me or did you leave?" I told him I had left--why? John answered with tears in his eyes, "All during the movie I kept looking over my shoulder to see who else was in the theater." I asked him who he thought was there. He said, "I guess my grandparents are trying to tell me to clean up my act." By this point he was crying openly. We embraced and wept joyful tears together. I told him I loved him and knew he was sent to us not by chance. Elder Wood closed this account by saying, "It is the spirit ... of Joseph Smith</i>[in Nauvoo]<i>that allows experiences like this ... and gives us the hope and courage to carry on and endure to the end."</i><br><br>In closing, I testify to these words in section 135 of the Doctrine and Covenants: "Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it" (D&amp;amp;C 135:3). And I say, "Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah! Jesus anointed that Prophet and Seer" ("Praise to the Man,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 27). Joseph knew Jesus! He communed with him in our behalf. He was a chosen vessel of the Lord to whom angels ministered, thus preparing "the way that the residue of men may have faith in Christ, that the Holy Ghost may have place in their hearts" (Moroni 7:32).<br><br>May we, too, come to know the Lord, commune with him, and learn to be like him, as did Brother Joseph, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Jack H.

<h1>ers and Prophets - Lawrence R. Flake - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My brothers and sisters, I'm very grateful for the prayer, the introduction, and especially for the beautiful musical numbers. I agree with the late apostle Adam S. Bennion, who used to say, "What we need in this church is better music and more of it, and better speaking and less of it" (see Sterling W. Sill,<i>Leadership,</i>vol. 3 [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1978], p. 288). "Come, Come, Ye Saints" is one of our most loved hymns, not only because of its pleasing music or even its poignant words but because of the feelings it evokes as we reflect on the nobility and courage of the first and second generations of valiant Latter-day Saint pioneers who laid the foundation of this mighty kingdom. Some of us are descended from these remarkable stalwarts. Like many others, my great grandfather, William Jordan Flake, answered the call of President Brigham Young to leave the Salt Lake Valley and lead a colonization effort into northern Arizona. The town he established under the apostolic leadership of Erastus Snow was named in honor of both of them--Snowflake, Arizona. I'm told that Snowflake once had a sheriff named Jack Frost. When he told people he was Jack Frost from Snowflake ...<br><br>Over the years we've taken a lot of flack because of the name<i>Flake.</i>My missionary son found it hard enough to be known as Elder Flake, but it got even worse when he was assigned a companion named Elder Looney! People really had to be honest in heart to accept the gospel from Elder Flake and Elder Looney. Incidentally, Snowflake is just down the road from another little Mormon town called St. Johns, one of whose favorite sons is the president of this university.<br><br>It is a wonderful blessing to have been raised hearing stories of pioneer ancestors on both sides of my family and from many other families as well. Not all of these stories were of major trials and tribulations. Sometimes they concerned funny little incidents of everyday life. Listen to this entry from the journal of Henrietta Williams as she crossed the plains.<br><br><i>They knew that I was no cook, but left that job for me. I built a fire after gathering buffalo chips, and getting it started, the wind playing with it as it pleased. I put the dutch oven on to heat with the cover by the side of it. I made a pie of dried apples, putting it into the oven, the lid still heating, and turned toward the wagon several yards away from the fire for safety. A nice cow sneaked up and helped herself to the pie and sneaked off, when a girl called to me to look at my rice. I had a hard time cooking the biscuits as I was jumping in and out of the wagon, climbing over the provision box, watching my baby girl and getting what</i>[my husband]<i>wanted as it was his misfortune never to find anything that he was looking for. The fire had its own way of burning. I thought, "Oh, Zion, will we ever reach thee?"</i>[Quoted in Nancy Clement Williams,<i>After One Hundred Years</i>(Independence, Missouri: Zion's Printing and Publishing Company, 1951), p. 157]<br><br>I enjoyed hearing my father and grandfather tell of one pioneer brother confessing his folly. He was leading two rather large calves with a rope in each hand. When he came to a gate, he needed both hands to open it. Not wanting to let the calves escape, he tied one rope around each of his legs. Here is this note from his journal: "Those calves had not dragged me fifty feet before I figured out what I'd done wrong."<br><br>A number of years ago I traveled by chartered bus to Palmyra, New York, with 150 wonderful young women from BYU and other Utah schools. These young ladies served as special missionaries to help put on the Hill Cumorah Pageant. On our return trip we visited several Church history sites along the pioneer trail. One of these sites was the Mormon cemetery at Winter Quarters near Omaha, Nebraska. As we walked quietly up the hill containing many graves of the Saints who died there, our spirits were subdued. Located at the top of the hill is that impressive Avard Fairbanks monument with which you are no doubt familiar. It is a statue of a pioneer mother and father, a shovel in his hand, standing before the open grave of their baby. At the base of the monument in bronze are listed in alphabetical order most of the names of the 600 pioneers buried there. Those 600 are just a tithing of the 6,000 whose graves lie along the rest of the trail. Without a cue or suggestion from anyone, the girls began to sing "Come, Come, Ye Saints." At first they sang very strongly, but as the words and spirit of that great hymn sank deeper in their hearts, their singing turned more into sobbing. By the last verse I think I was the only one still singing. As I voiced the words "And should we die before our journey's through," I was scanning the list of names on the bronze plaque. In the F's two names caught my attention--Samuel Flake, age five months, and Frederick Flake, age one day. Then I stopped singing, too.<br><br>As the Church continues to expand, especially in foreign lands, the percentage of members who are literal descendants of the pioneers decreases, but I believe that those who bind themselves to this great work that the pioneers began are somehow spiritually adopted and become descendants of those noble forbears. This very real bond was touchingly displayed for me once when I listened to one of my students with tears running down his cheeks express love and gratitude for his heroic pioneer ancestors who crossed the plains. This would not have been so unusual except that his name was Doug Sakaguchi and he was a Japanese convert. In a very real way, I believe Brother Sakaguchi is just as much a descendent of the pioneers as I am.<br><br>Many years ago, Dr. Earl V. Pullius, a non-Mormon scholar, told a story on this campus that deeply impressed me with the connection between the first and second generations of pioneers and the present generation of young people and converts in the Church. Before World War II, the renowned musician Bruno Walter was the conductor of the Vienna Symphony. This symphony was a unique musical organization with a spirit and unity and synergism that produced glorious music, powerful and unmatched by any other symphony. When the Nazis took over Austria, the conductor fled to America. It was not until 1947 that he was finally able to return to Austria. His first priority was to visit his beloved Vienna Symphony. As he approached the concert hall where they were practicing, he could hear the strains of their remarkable music. He said that if he had been anywhere on the face of the earth and heard that sound, he would have been able to identify it as coming only from the Vienna Symphony. When he entered the concert hall, to his amazement he discovered that although the exquisite musical quality was still there, not one of the musicians playing with the symphony had played with it when he was its conductor. All of them were new, but the powerful spirit remained. All of the first and second generations of pioneers are gone. Our challenge is to keep alive that great, valiant spirit of sacrifice and courage that characterized their lives and service.<br><br>A few weeks ago, Elder Jack H. Goaslind of the Seventy gave <a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/jack-h-goaslind_joseph-smiths-christlike-attributes/"><span style="color: #33cccc;">a moving address from this pulpit</span></a>. It was the 151st anniversary of the assassination of the Prophet Joseph and his brother Hyrum. As Elder Goaslind reflected on that tragic event, my mind was drawn to a copy of a newspaper clipping I have in my file containing an interesting, though somewhat garbled, account of the Martyrdom reported two weeks after the fact in the<i>New York Weekly Herald.</i>The headline reads: "Important News from Nauvoo: Death of Joe and Hyrum Smith: Terrible Excitement in the West." In part the article said, "We yesterday received by western mail the following particulars of the death of Joseph Smith the Prophet and his brother Hyrum. They were both shot. There was tremendous excitement in the west in consequence of their death" (8 July 1844). The article continued and then ended with this three-word conclusion and prediction: "Thus ends Mormonism."<br><br>This newspaper was not alone in that gloomy forecast. Many observers, both friendly and antagonistic, believed that with the death of its dynamic leader, the church Joseph founded would go the way of numerous other flash-in-the-pan religious movements. That prognostication likely would have come to pass had Joseph Smith in fact been the founder of the Church, but he was not. I bear my witness with yours that the establishment of this Church is the very fulfillment of Daniel's prophecy that in the last days "shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed" (Daniel 2:44). In Doctrine and Covenants 33:5, the Lord proclaims, "And verily, verily, I say unto you, that this church have I established and called forth out of the wilderness." Expectations that the Church would disintegrate had been voiced frequently before the Martyrdom and have been heard many times since. Even now, anti-Mormon writers engage in wishful thinking as they see what they believe are the foundations of Zion crumbling. When the authors of a book critical of the Church predicted, "The future of the Church is dim ," President Gordon B. Hinckley responded with characteristic politeness:<br><br><i>Without wishing to seem impertinent, I should like to ask what they know about that future. They know nothing of the prophetic mission of this Church. The future must have looked extremely dim in the 1830s. It must have looked impossible back in those Ohio-Missouri days. But notwithstanding poverty, notwithstanding robbing, notwithstanding murders, notwithstanding confiscation and drivings and disfranchisement forced upon the Saints, the work moved steadily on. It has continued to go forward. Never before has it been so strong. Never before has it been so widespread. Never before have there been so many in whose hearts has burned an unquenchable knowledge of the truth.</i>["Counsel to Religious Educators," 14 September 1984 (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1984), p. 7]<br><br>One of the early antagonists of Joseph Smith and the Saints was Thomas Ford, governor of Illinois. He was a willing facilitator, if not an active perpetrator, of the death of the Prophet. His view of Joseph Smith and the future of the Church is expressed in his<i>History of Illinois:</i><br><br><i>Thus fell Joe Smith, the most successful impostor in modern times; a man who, though ignorant and coarse, had some great natural parts which fitted him for temporary success, but which were so obscured and counteracted by the inherent corruption and vices of his nature that he never could succeed in establishing a system of policy which looked to permanent success in the future.</i>[Thomas Ford,<i>A History of Illinois: From Its Commencement as a State in 1818 to 1847</i>(Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1995), p. 249]<br><br>In an address given on this campus in January of 1988, President Hinckley detailed how after Thomas Ford's betrayal of Joseph Smith, the governor's fortunes declined until he died in obscurity and poverty six years later. President Hinckley observed:<br><br><i>It is a thing of interest to me that except for his connection with the death of the Prophet Joseph, Governor Ford is almost entirely forgotten today. The decline of his fortune and the sad end of his life, and that of his wife, together with the tragic experiences of their five orphan children, become a tale of defeat, bitterness, and misery.</i><br><br><i>While Thomas Ford has been largely forgotten, love and respect for the Prophet who was murdered at Carthage have grown across the world.</i><br><br><i>"Great is his glory and endless his priesthood.</i><br><i>Ever and ever the keys he will hold.</i><br><i>Faithful and true, he will enter his kingdom,</i><br><i>Crowned in the midst of the prophets of old."</i><br>("Praise to the Man,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 27)<br>[Gordon B. Hinckley, BYU fireside address, 10 January 1988, not published; but see Hinckley, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1994/05/the-greatest-miracle-in-human-history?lang=eng"><span style="color: #33cccc;">The Greatest Miracle in Human History</span></a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1994, pp. 72–75]<br><br>May I share with you three short stories that may or may not be connected but that underscore this theme of maintaining the continuity of the pioneer spirit.<br><br>In 1900, Thomas J. Yates, a Mormon student attending Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, had an interesting conversation with the cofounder of that institution, Andrew Dixon White. Dr. White had served as U.S. foreign minister in Russia several years earlier and told Brother Yates of a visit he had had with the famous Count Leo Tolstoy. Tolstoy, as you know, is considered by many to be the greatest Russian philosopher, social critic, and novelist of all time. His best-known work, the lengthy classic<i>War and Peace,</i>has been read and viewed in movie form by millions the world over. The Russian movie version is six and a half hours long. It was so long, I'm told, they charged three different admission prices: one for those under twelve, one for those over twelve, and one for those who turned twelve during the movie. I don't know if that's really true or not.<br><br>According to Brother Yates' recollection of what Dr. White told him concerning the exchange with Tolstoy, the great Russian scholar asked Dr. White to tell him about the American religion. Puzzled, Dr. White explained that we don't<i>have</i>an American religion, "that each person is free to belong to the particular church in which he is interested." Tolstoy is reported to have shown a little impatience in replying:<br><br><i>"I know all of this. ... But the Church to which I refer originated in America, and is commonly known as the Mormon Church. What can you tell me of the teachings of the Mormons?"</i><br><br><i>"Well," said Dr. White, "I know very little concerning them. They have an unsavory reputation, they practice polygamy, and are very superstitious."</i><br><br><i>Then Count Leo Tolstoi ... rebuked the ambassador. "Dr. White, I am greatly surprised and disappointed that a man of your great learning and position should be so ignorant on this important subject. ... If the people follow the teachings of this Church, nothing can stop their progress--it will be limitless. There have been great movements started in the past but they have died or been modified before they reached maturity."</i><br><br>And then, according to Yates via White, Tolstoy made this powerful prediction:<br><br><i>"If Mormonism is able to endure, unmodified, until it reaches the third and fourth generation, it is destined to become the greatest power the world has ever known."</i>[Thomas J. Yates, "Count Tolstoi and the 'American Religion,'"<i>Improvement Era,</i>February 1939, p. 94]<br><br>While some have questioned the accuracy of both White's and Yates' memories, it is clear that Tolstoy had an interest in Mormonism and referred to it in his journal, in print, and in conversation. One of Brigham Young's daughters, Susa Young Gates, corresponded with him and sent him several books and pamphlets, including the Book of Mormon. It is also clear that this statement attributed to Tolstoy found its way into the speaking and writing of the Church in the early part of the century. After graduating from Cornell in 1902, Brother Yates returned to Utah, where he apparently shared the Tolstoy prophecy with various interested members of the Church, possibly including President Joseph F. Smith.<br><br>The second story, which as I say may or may not be related to the first, is told by President Spencer W. Kimball, then a member of the Twelve, in an October conference address in 1969:<br><br><i>When I was a youngster, a stirring challenge came to me that moved me not a little. I cannot remember who issued the challenge nor under what circumstances it came. I remember only that it struck me like a "bolt out of the blue heavens." The unknown voice postulated:</i><br><br><i>"The 'Mormon Church' has stood its ground for the first two generations--but wait till the third and fourth and succeeding generations come along! The first generation fired with a new religion developed a great enthusiasm for it. Surrounded with bitterness, calumny of a hostile world, persecuted 'from pillar to post,' they were forced to huddle together for survival. There was good reason to expect they would live and die faithful to their espoused cause.</i><br><br><i>"The second generation came along born to enthusiasts, zealots, devotees. They were born to men and women who had developed great faith, were inured to hardships and sacrifices for their faith. They inherited from their parents and soaked up from religious homes the stuff of which the faithful are made. They had full reservoirs of strength and faith upon which to draw.</i><br><br><i>"But wait till the third and fourth generations come along," said the cynical voice. "The fire will have gone out--the devotion will have been diluted--the sacrifice will have been nullified--the world will have hovered over them and surrounded them and eroded them--the faith will have been expended and the religious fervor leaked out."</i><br><br><i>That day I realized that I was a member of the third generation. That day I clenched my growing fists. I gritted my teeth and made a firm commitment to myself that here was one "third generation" who would not fulfill that dire prediction.</i>[<i>CR,</i>October 1969, pp. 18–19]<br><br>The third story may identify the source of the unknown voice that spoke to President Kimball of the dangers of the third and fourth generations.<br><br>Sometime in 1904 or 1905, when Spencer Kimball would have been nine or ten years old, the president of the Church, Joseph F. Smith, gave a powerful address entitled "The Third and Fourth Generations." It is possible that this is where young Spencer heard the challenge that he said moved him "not a little."<br><br>Another person who was moved by President Smith's address was Evan Stephens.<br><br><i>When Evan Stephens was conductor of the Tabernacle Choir he was thrilled on one occasion by a sermon delivered by the late President Joseph F. Smith on the subject of "The Third and Fourth Generations."</i><br><br><i>At the close of the service Professor Stephens strolled alone up City Creek Canyon pondering the inspired words of the President. Suddenly the muse came upon him and seated upon a rock which was standing firm under the pressure of the rushing water and happily symbolic of his theme, he wrote with a pencil the words of "True to the Faith" and with roughly drawn staves composed the music.</i>[J. Spencer Cornwall,<i>Stories of Our Mormon Hymns</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1961), p. 174]<br><br><i>Shall the youth of Zion falter</i><br><i>In defending truth and right?</i><br><i>While the enemy assaileth,</i><br><i>Shall we shrink or shun the fight?</i><br><br><i>No! True to the faith that our parents have cherished,</i><br><i>True to the truth for which martyrs have perished,</i><br><i>To God's command,</i><br><i>Soul, heart and hand,</i><br><i>Faithful and true we will ever stand.</i><br>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/music/library/hymns/true-to-the-faith?lang=eng"><span style="color: #33cccc;">True to the Faith</span></a>,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 254]<br><br>Whether these three incidents are closely related or not, I do not know, but I am intrigued by that possibility. I do know that Mormonism has and will endure unaltered not only to the third and fourth generations, but to all generations of time, for it is the very eternal gospel of Christ. Sister Vilate C. Raile penned these words regarding the pioneers:<br><br><i>They cut desire into short lengths</i><br><i>And fed it to the hungry fires of tribulation.</i><br><i>Long after when the fires had died,</i><br><i>Molten gold gleamed in the ashes.</i><br><i>They gathered it in bruised palms</i><br><i>And handed it to their children‚</i><br><i>And their children's children forever.</i><br><br>May we be true to the faith and true to the truth, that with our valiant pioneer ancestors we may ever stand, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Lawrence R. Flake was an associate professor in the Department of Church History and Doctrine at Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 18 July 1995.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>e, Creation, and Freedom - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, when I was a graduate student in New York, there was a distinguished gentleman at the university named Morris Bishop, an emeritus professor of Romance languages. For many years he carried the great ceremonial mace in academic processions at the university. During the unrest of the sixties, he even used it once, playfully, to subdue a student who was trying to seize the mike. He was a noted scholar, but also a regular contributor of light verse to<i>The New Yorker.</i>In one of his poems he writes:<br><br><i>Of all the kinds of lecturer</i><br><i>The lecturer I most detest</i><br><i>Is he who finishes a page</i><br><i>And places it behind the rest.</i><br><br><i>I much prefer the lecturer</i><br><i>Who takes the pages as he finishes</i><br><i>And puts them on a mounting pile</i><br><i>As the original pile diminishes.</i><br><br><i>But best of all the lecturer</i><br><i>Who gets his papers in confusion</i><br><i>And prematurely lets escape</i><br><i>The trumpet-phrase: "And in conclusion . . ."</i><br>["Lines Composed in Fifth Row Center,"<i>The Best of Bishop: Light Verse from</i>The New Yorker<i>and Elsewhere,</i>ed. Charlotte Putnam Reppert (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1980), p. 64]<br><br>I stand before you with a little stack of pages, intending to be at least the second kind of speaker. But given the way my hands are shaking, we may all get lucky and I'll turn out to be the third. I know that if I'm not done in thirty-six minutes, the trap door I'm standing on will open--and you will hear me no more.<br><br>I've chosen to speak today about a principle of the gospel I have struggled with over the course of my life to understand and to love--or even to feel positively about. That principle is obedience. I know that obedience is not among the most popular topics; it has certainly not been among my favorite. I have felt hesitation about it for at least two reasons: first, because obedience seems to restrict freedom, and second, because I have tended to let my view of it be colored by negative examples of misused authority. It may be that some of you have also had these reservations. What I hope to do today is to develop an argument for considering obedience in positive terms--not as something restrictive and confining, but as a dynamic force in our lives.<br><br>I suspect that all of us can summon from our experience and our reading images of abused authority, which may even operate hypocritically under the guise of religion or high principles. Among literary examples, we might think of the clergyman Theobald Pontifex in Samuel Butler's<i>The Way of All Flesh</i>who thrashes his little son Ernest for being "self-willed and naughty" because he continues to pronounce "come" as "tum," and who then returns, his hand still red from the beating, to call his household to prayer. Then there are grim examples of "benefactors" and schoolmasters like Mr. Brocklehurst in<i>Jane Eyre,</i>who seeks to make the girls of Lowood School "children of Grace" through humiliation and mortification; the sadistic Wackford Squeers in<i>Nicholas Nickleby;</i>or Mr. Treharne in Leslie Norris' story "Some Opposites of Good." Though the degree of malice varies, all of these insist first and foremost on being obeyed; all are quickly enraged and vindictive at the slightest challenge to their authority or will.<br><br>To use an example from my own experience, I remember the alarming inversion of much of what I valued as I entered basic training in the army after my freshman year at BYU. Our sergeant's manner was malevolent, his language foul and abusive. On the first day he asked the college graduates to raise their hands; there was one in the group. He then asked those who had attended college at all to raise their hands; a few of us did. He went on down the levels of education until he reached someone who had dropped out after sixth grade. He appointed this person as platoon leader and the next four dropouts as squad leaders. The graduate and the rest of us who had attended college were put at once on KP duty. Over the next few weeks, he took particular pleasure in bullying and hounding the college students and others toward whom, for whatever reason, he had developed a disliking. We spent many hours at tasks like cleaning latrines and grease traps, to which were added patently absurd assignments like scrubbing the pavement with our personal toothbrushes. I do understand that basic training is not designed to be a picnic, and that an army requires discipline and obedience so that commands will be followed in extreme wartime circumstances, but the sadistic pleasure some took within this broader necessity disgusted me then and disgusts me now. As an antidote, I spent my few free periods reading--and relishing--Thoreau's<i>Civil Disobedience.</i>And I have never since warmed to the hymn "We Are All Enlisted," with its repeated "Happy are we! Happy are we!" (<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 250).<br><h2><b>I Am Commanded--Therefore I Am: Obedience and Creation</b></h2><br>But this talk did not have its beginning in negative instances like these, nor in a recent TV spot announcing the Western Regional Obedience Contest to be held in August (I think this has to do with dogs rather than with intercollegiate sports, but the ad wasn't entirely clear). Nor did my talk grow out of the positive example of President Hinckley's article in the July<i>Ensign.</i>The kernel of the idea came to me some time ago when I was thumbing through a book by the remarkable Jewish thinker Abraham Heschel, entitled<i>Who Is Man?</i>Toward the end of the book, I came upon a subheading that jarred me. It read:<i>I am commanded--therefore I am.</i><br><br>I asked myself, Can this be true? What can Heschel mean by this revision of Descartes' "I think, therefore I am"?--That I exist to be bossed around? To endure servitude? To be the plaything of another's desire to exercise authority? I could think of people who, believing themselves born to rule, might say, "I<i>command,</i>therefore I am." But why cast this in the passive voice: "I<i>am commanded,</i>therefore I am"? When I read further and thought more carefully, though, my view of obedience began to be transformed.<br><br>What Heschel argues is, "Over all being stand the words: Let there be!" Being is itself an obedient response to the commandment of creation. "To be is to obey," Heschel writes. "What Adam hears first is a command"; "'Thou art' precedes 'I am.'" "To the Greek mind, man is above all a rational being. . . . To the biblical mind, man is above all a commanded being, a being of whom demands may be made"<i>(Who Is Man?</i>The Raymond Fred West Memorial Lectures, 1963 [Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1965], pp. 97, 98, 107). Heschel continues:<br><br><i>Do I exist as a human being? My answer is:</i>I am commanded--therefore I am.<i>There is a built-in</i>sense of indebtedness in the consciousness of man,<i>an awareness of</i>owing gratitude,<i>of being</i>called upon<i>at certain moments to reciprocate, to answer, to live in a way which is compatible with the grandeur and mystery of living.</i>[Ibid., p. 111; emphasis in original]<br><br>These passages caused me to notice, as I had not really done before, how central the idea of obedience is to creation, especially in the account given in the book of Abraham. Over and again, at each stage of creation, the text says, "And the Gods saw that they were obeyed" (Abraham 4:10, 12). At the creation of the sun and the moon, we can almost see the outstretched, ordering hand as we read, "And the Gods<i>watched</i>those things which they had ordered<i>until they obeyed"</i>(Abraham 4:18; emphasis added). In the biblical account, God pronounces the work of each day "good" (Genesis 1:10, etc.); in the book of Abraham, this goodness is equated with obedience. For example, as the fishes and birds are created, we read, "And the Gods saw that they would be<i>obeyed,</i>and that their plan was<i>good</i>(Abraham 4:21, cf. 25; emphasis added). In Genesis, God pronounces the work of the sixth and last day "very good" (Genesis 1 :31); in the book of Abraham we read, "And the Gods said: We will do everything that we have said, and organize them; and behold, they shall be<i>very obedient"</i>(Abraham 4:31; emphasis added).<i>Very good</i>and<i>very obedient</i>are one and the same. The goodness of creation depends upon obedience.<br><br>But what does this have to do with us now? Wasn't the Creation completed a very long time ago? Yes, in a sense it was. The world came into being at God's command; it was populated by all manner of living forms that set about to fill the measure of their creation. But in another sense, creation is ongoing, since its aim has not been fulfilled. If it is God's "work and [his] glory" to "bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (see Moses 1:39), creation is not complete until we have fulfilled the measure of our creation. To Abraham, God declared the central aim of our creation, saying, "We will make an earth whereon these may dwell; And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do<i>all things</i>whatsoever the Lord their God shall<i>command</i>them" (Abraham 3:24–25; emphasis added).<i>All things</i>goes beyond the single command "Let there be man." For human beings, the obedience that creation requires extends until God's purpose, the measure of our creation, is fulfilled.<br><h2><b>Ongoing Creation 1: Human Work and Creativity</b></h2><br>In a certain sense, the idea of ongoing creation is even richer and may imply the value of human work and creativity. Listen to a passage from the Jesuit theologian Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's book<i>The Divine Milieu:</i><br><br><i>We may, perhaps, imagine that the creation was finished long ago. But that would be quite wrong. It continues still more magnificently, and at the highest levels of the world.</i>. . .<i>And we serve to complete it, even by the humblest work of our hands. That is, ultimately, the meaning and value of our acts. Owing to the interrelation between matter, soul and Christ, we bring part of the being which he desires back to God</i>in whatever we do. [<i>The Divine Milieu,</i>rev. ed. (New York: Harper, 1968), p. 62; emphasis in original]<br><br>Arguing for the "divinisation of our activities," Teilhard is suggesting that human work, however modest, is part of ongoing creation. The creation is not complete, it does not reach its plenitude without our collaboration, our laboring with the Lord in his work, without what we do and what we create. This includes not only the great works of the past like the tragedies of Sophocles, the Cathedral of Chartres, and Bach's Mass in B Minor, but also all the products of<i>our</i>minds and hands, from the lowliest to the best: the gardens we plant, the trees we prune, the meals we prepare, the tools we sharpen--to say nothing of the hypotheses we prove or the poems or pottery we shape. If we were to view our work and our creativity as part of God's ongoing creation, would we approach them in the same way? Would, for example, the papers we write be the same?<br><br>A beautiful statement that suggests what such an idea might imply for our immediate BYU context is from President Kimball, in the address he gave at President Holland's inauguration in 1980:<br><br><i>This university shares with other universities the hope and the labor involved in rolling back the frontiers of knowledge, but we also know that, through divine revelation, there are yet "many great and important things" to be given to mankind which will have an intellectual and spiritual impact far beyond what mere men can imagine. Thus, at this university among faculty, students, and administration, there is, and there must be, an excitement and an expectation about the very nature and future of knowledge.</i>["Installation of and Charge to the President," Inaugural Addresses, 14 November 1980 (Provo: Brigham Young University, 1980), p. 9]<br><br>This passage sends chills up and down my spine. Its antithesis is found in D&amp;amp;C 93: "And that wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth, through disobedience" (D&amp;amp;C 93:39).<br><h2><b>Ongoing Creation 2: Laboring With the Lord in His Vineyard</b></h2><br>I have mentioned laboring with the Lord in his ongoing work of creation. It seems to me that the allegory of Zenos in Jacob 5 suggests the Lord's ongoing effort to restore creation when its goodness is diminished or lost. You remember that over a very long period of time, the Lord and his servant labor in the vineyard, tending and nurturing the olive trees, returning over and again to observe, to test, to graft, and to cultivate. The trees seem intractable; they incline toward uncreation as they bring forth wild fruit. The labor is long and often disheartening--so much so that at one point we read, "It came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard wept, and said unto the servant: What could I have done more for my vineyard?" (Jacob 5:41). But at those times when the work succeeds, we can hear an echo of Genesis, and it is as if the goodness of the original creation has been restored: "And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard looked and beheld the tree . . . and it had sprung forth and begun to bear fruit. And he<i>beheld that it was good"</i>(v. 17; emphasis added). And later, "He beheld . . . that it had brought forth much fruit; and he beheld also that it was good" (v. 20). Finally, the Lord says, "I have preserved the natural fruit, that it is<i>good, even like as it was in the beginning,"</i>and the Lord blesses his servant(s), "because<i>ye</i>have been diligent in laboring with me in my vineyard" (v. 75; emphasis added). It is true that the allegory is, at one level, historical, representing the work of the Lord in different dispensations, but it also can represent our own laboring with him in the vineyard of his kingdom. And it is obedience to the voice of creation that again produces the "natural fruit [which] is<i>good"</i>(v. 61; emphasis added) and "most precious unto him<i>from the beginning"</i>(v. 74; emphasis added).<br><h2><b>Man Alone is Free Not to Obey the Lord of Creation</b></h2><br>The idea of incomplete creation should be understood most importantly in the context of obedience to God's commandments, to the principles and ordinances of the gospel. Of all creation, only human beings have the freedom<i>not</i>to obey. Over all else, the Lord of creation exercises dominion. As he tells Abraham:<br><br><i>I am the Lord thy God; I dwell in heaven; the earth is my footstool; I stretch my hand over the sea, and</i>it obeys my voice;<i>I cause the wind and the fire to be my chariot; I say to the mountains--Depart hence--and behold, they are taken away by a whirlwind, in an instant, suddenly.</i>[Abraham 2:7; emphasis added]<br><br>Nephi, son of Helaman, agonizing over the awful cost of human agency, contrasts the willful disobedience of human beings with the responsiveness of all the rest of creation to the majestic voice of the Lord. He writes:<br><br><i>O how great is the nothingness of the children of men; yea, even they are less than the dust of the earth.</i><br><br><i>For behold, the dust of the earth moveth hither and thither, to the dividing asunder, at the</i>command<i>of our great and everlasting God.</i><br><br><i>Yea, behold at his</i>voice<i>do the hills and the mountains tremble and quake.</i><br><br><i>And by the</i>power of his voice<i>they are broken up, and become smooth, yea, even like unto a valley.</i><br><br><i>Yea, by the</i>power of his voice<i>doth the whole earth shake;</i><br><br><i>Yea, by the</i>power of his voice,<i>do the foundations rock, even to the very center.</i>[Helaman 12:7–12; emphasis added]<br><br>The catalog of the Lord's power over nature continues for several verses, then Nephi concludes with the one source of hope: "Therefore, blessed are they who will repent and<i>hearken unto the voice</i>of the Lord their God; for these are they that shall be saved" (Helaman 12:23; emphasis added).<br><br>To quote again from Heschel:<br><br><i>All that exists obeys. Man alone occupies a unique status. As a natural being he obeys, as a human being he must frequently choose. . . . His acts do not emanate from him like rays of energy</i><br><br><i>from matter. Placed in the parting of the ways, he must time and again decide which direction to take.</i>[<i>Man Is Not Alone: A Philosophy of Religion</i>(New York: Farrar, Straus, &amp;amp; Young, 1951), p. 207]<br><br>If ongoing creation depends upon obedience and if, of all creation, only we human beings have the freedom not to obey, what happens when we choose not to obey? We thwart, deform, and undo God's creation.<br><h2><b>Conformed to Christ: Augustine's Doctrine of Reform</b></h2><br>I've mentioned the effort to restore creation in the allegory of Zenos. Consider with me for a moment an idea from the early Christian thinker Augustine of Hippo, on whose autobiography, the<i>Confessions,</i>I am currently working. (Augustine is the one who said in his youth, "Lord, give me virtue, but not yet.") Beginning with the formation of man in the image of God, which he often refers to as the "form of God" (<i>forma Dei</i>)<i>,</i>Augustine suggests that through the Fall and through our disobedience the image of God in us is<i>deformed,</i>that the goodness of creation is deprived of its goodness.<i>Deformity</i>is, therefore, the condition of fallen man or, in Book of Mormon terms, of "natural man" (Mosiah 3:19). Images of deformity abound in the<i>Confessions.</i>How is this deformity to be remedied? Augustine writes:<br><br><i>We . . . must after a fashion resculpt</i>[the image of God in us]<i>and</i>reform<i>it. But, who would be able to do this, except if he were the artist who shaped it? We could</i>deform<i>the image</i>. . . ,<i>but we cannot</i>reform<i>it.</i>[Sermon 43.3.4, in Gerhart B. Ladner,<i>The Idea of Reform: Its Impact on Christian Thought and Action in the Age of the Fathers</i>(Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1959), p. 194; emphasis added]<br><br>Augustine's doctrine of reform is centered in Christ. The image of God in which we were originally created can only be<i>re-</i>formed through faith in Christ and through the ongoing process of repentance under the influence of his grace. The relationship between creation and repentance is clearly marked out. Note how the language of Genesis pervades Augustine's writing:<br><br><i>We were</i>covered over by the darkness<i>of ignorance. . . . But because your</i>Spirit was borne over the water,<i>your mercy did not abandon our misery, and you said,</i>"Let there be light.<i>Repent. The kingdom of heaven is at hand. Repent.</i>Let there be light." [<i>The Confessions of St. Augustine,</i>trans. John K. Ryan (New York: Doubleday, 1960), p. 343 (13.12.13); emphasis added and translation slightly adjusted with an eye both to the Latin and to the King James Version]<br><br>And in another passage:<br><br><i>But first "wash yourselves, be clean" . . . so that</i>the dry land may appear.<i>"Learn to do good, judge for the fatherless, defend the widow," so that</i>the earth may bring forth the green herb and the tree yielding fruit.<i>Come, let us discuss it, says the Lord, so that</i>lights may be made in the firmament of the heaven. [<i>Confessions,</i>p. 350 (13.19.24); emphasis added]<br><br>For Augustine, the full reformation of the image of God is foreshadowed in the original creation, to which he returns at the end of his autobiography. He expresses his deep longing and hope for its restoration in such passages as:<br><br><i>I will not be turned away until out of this scattered and</i>[deformed] state<i>you gather all that I am into the peace of</i>[the Heavenly Jerusalem],<i>and you</i>conform<i>and confirm me into eternity, my God, my mercy.</i>[<i>Confessions,</i>pp. 317–18 (12.16.23); emphasis added]<br><br>In the word<i>conform</i>(meaning to form according to the pattern of) we can hear an echo from Paul's letter to the Romans:<br><br><i>And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.</i><br><br><i>For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be</i>conformed to the image of his Son. [Romans 8:28–29; emphasis added]<br><br>Through faith in him, through repentance, through following his example, we are<i>conformed</i>to Jesus Christ, our Savior. But for Latter-day Saints the goal is not only, as it was for Augustine, to recover the condition of Adam and Eve before the Fall. The doctrine of the restored gospel is clear; our Heavenly Father's desire is for us to become more fully his sons and daughters, heirs of his kingdom, kings and queens, gods and goddesses. To this end, Christ is the way and obedience the key.<br><h2><b>The Obedience of Christ</b></h2><br>Consider with me now the idea of obedience in relation to Christ. Though Son of God, creator of the world, and Jehovah of the Old Testament, Christ subjected himself to lowly birth. As Paul writes, he "made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men" (Philippians 2:7). In this humble state he learned line upon line and precept upon precept; "he received not of the fulness at the first, but received grace for grace" (D&amp;amp;C 93:12) as he was obedient to each level of knowledge he received. Found in the temple, where the doctors who heard him "were astonished at his understanding," he nevertheless returned with his parents, who "understood not," and was, as Luke writes,<i>"subject</i>unto them" (see Luke 2:47, 50–51; emphasis added).<br><br>At the beginning of his ministry, he allowed himself to be baptized, not for the remission of sins, for he was sinless, but as Nephi writes, to show "unto the children of men that, according to the flesh he humbleth himself before the Father, and<i>witnesseth</i>unto the Father that he<i>would be obedient</i>unto him in keeping his commandments" (2 Nephi 31:7; emphasis added). During his ministry he obeyed the Father's will so closely that he could say toward the end, "Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?" (John 14:9).<br><br>But it is in his suffering at Gethsemane and on the cross through which, as Paul writes, "he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death" (Philippians 2:8) Jesus showed most clearly his obedience to the Father, because it is here that we see, for a brief, sacred moment, a divergence of wills before Christ surrendered himself wholly to his Father's will: "And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt" (Mark 14:36). To Joseph Smith, Christ later revealed that the suffering<br><br><i>caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit--and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink--</i><br><br><i>Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 19:18–19]<br><br>Christ's obedience at this moment was so great that Abinadi, who foresaw it just before his own death by fire, says that "the will of the Son [was]<i>swallowed up</i>in the will of the Father" (Mosiah 15:7; emphasis added).<br><br>And yet Christ was the freest being ever to have lived on earth. Though of lowly station, he showed glimpses during his ministry of the Lord of creation that he was. He had power over the elements; people marveled and asked, "What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him" (Luke 8:25). He had power over disease, power over life and death--not only in the raising of Lazarus but in his own freedom to choose whether to subject<i>himself</i>to death. But, paradoxically, he was never freer than when he said to the Father, "Nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done" (Luke 22:42) and allowed--yes, allowed--his will to be "swallowed up" in his Father's.<br><br>It is he who, having set before us the example of his own obedience, commands us to obey. As we read in Hebrews:<br><br><i>Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;</i><br><br><i>And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.</i>[Hebrews 5:8–9]<br><br><b>The paradox: obedience the means to freedom.</b>Does obedience limit our freedom? Christ says to each of us, "Follow thou me" (2 Nephi 31:10). One of his greatest followers, the apostle Paul, desired so strongly to do Christ's will that he sometimes referred to himself as "the prisoner of Jesus Christ" (Ephesians 3:1), "the prisoner of the Lord" (Ephesians 4:1), or as "an ambassador in bonds" (Ephesians 6:20), "bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ" (2 Corinthians 10:5). But this language is essentially paradoxical and contrasts with the real bondage of becoming subject to Satan, which is described as "being delivered up to the devil, who hath subjected them, which is damnation" (Mosiah 16:11). As Nephi writes, we "are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil" (2 Nephi 2:27).<br><br>In a talk given at BYU in 1971 (maybe some of your parents were students here then), Elder Packer, who had been an apostle for a little over a year, discussed in personal terms the paradoxical relationship between obedience and freedom. He writes:<br><br><i>I would expose you this morning to some tender, innermost feelings on this matter of agency. Perhaps the greatest discovery of my life, without question the greatest commitment, came when finally I had the confidence in God that I would loan or yield my agency to Him--without compulsion or pressure, without any duress, as a single individual alone, by myself, no counterfeiting, nothing expected other than the privilege. In a sense, speaking figuratively, to take one's agency, that precious gift which the scriptures make plain is essential to life itself, and say, "I will do as thou directs," is afterward to learn that in so doing you possess it all the more.</i>[Boyd K. Packer,<i>"That All May Be Edified": Talks, Sermons and Commentary</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1982), pp. 256–57]<br><br>"Strangely enough," Elder Packer writes, "the key to freedom is obedience" (ibid., p. 256).<br><br><b>God will not compel us.</b>God will never compel our obedience; to do so would thwart the purpose of our creation. Maybe this analogy will help: Six years ago we moved to our present house east of the campus. One of the things that attracted us to it was that it has aspen trees in various parts of the yard, including a cluster along our bedroom window (we like to watch the play of shadows in the moonlight). A couple of months after we moved in, a windstorm came up during the night, and we listened to the trees being blown about, sometimes striking against the eaves of the house. The next morning our daughter Bronwen came in to say that one of the trees had blown over. When we went out to look at it, thinking it broken, we discovered that it was not broken at all--the trunk had no split in it--the tree was simply drooping to the ground like a wet noodle. The trunk was four or five inches in diameter--the same as (maybe bigger than) other aspens in the yard--but it hadn't the strength to bear the weight of its foliage. Early on it had been tied to the house and had grown with that continual support for years. To all appearances it was no different from other freestanding aspens in the yard. But when the wind came and tore the support away, it hadn't developed the strength to stand on its own, to move in the wind without toppling. The measure of its creation was thwarted; all we could do was push it back up and cinch it again to the eaves of the house.<br><br>We cannot become the beings God has created us to be if we are tied and constrained as our aspen tree has been, if we are "compelled in all things" (D&amp;amp;C 58:26). Our fuller creation requires our free obedience. Listen to President Hunter describe the way God acts as he works, eliciting our obedience and our love, to bring about the ends of his creation:<br><br><i>God's chief way of acting is by persuasion and patience and long-suffering, not by coercion and stark confrontation. He acts by gentle solicitation and by sweet enticement. He always acts with unfailing respect for the freedom and independence that we possess. He wants to help us and pleads for the chance to assist us, but he will not do so in violation of our agency.</i>. . .<br><br><i>To countermand and ultimately forbid our choices was Satan's way, not God's, and the Father of us all simply never will do that. He will, however, stand by us forever to help us see the right path, find the right choice, respond to the true voice, and feel the influence of his undeniable Spirit. His gentle, peaceful, powerful persuasion to do right and find joy will be with us "so long as time shall last, or the earth shall stand, or there shall be one man upon the face thereof to be saved." (Moro. 7:36.)</i>["The Golden Thread of Choice,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1989, p. 18]<br><br><b>Natural consequences: obedience is for our good.</b>Some commandments, like the<i>ordinances,</i>teach us exactitude through strict observance of "the letter of the gospel" (D&amp;amp;C 107:20). Others require us to reason and to ponder and to seek inspiration in order to apply<i>principles</i>of the gospel. Others require a willingness to accept the counsel of the Lord's chosen servants. To each of us may also come tests that may seem as hard as Abraham's, tests to see whether we, too, will say, "Thy will be done." But in all these contexts, obedience is for<i>our</i>good, not to satisfy the arbitrary and sanctimonious will of some cosmic Mr. Brocklehurst.<br><br>The consequences of disobedience are, in a sense, natural, attached to eternal laws. To illustrate this in a mundane way, let me tell you a joke: There are two guys driving along in a truck. On the dashboard is a sticker giving the truck's height and weight specifications. The sticker reads "13 feet, 4 inches." The truck is approaching an underpass. In front of it is a series of warning signs, including a large one that says, "Danger! Low Clearance! Maximum Height 11 Feet, 10 Inches." Seeing the sign, the driver looks around furtively and asks his companion, "D'ya see any cops?" Most of the commandments are like this, signposts of warning for our good. We can laugh at the stupidity of the truck driver, but is his judgment really different from this man's in the book of Job?: "The eye . . . of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face" (Job 24:15). The point is not whether someone is watching but that personal disaster will follow. Both the truck and the man in Job are cruising toward serious uncreation.<br><br><b>Three propositions: a dynamic force, a noble gift, an expression of love.</b>In several passages the D&amp;amp;C makes a connection between principle and theory. For example: "Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, [and] in doctrine" (D&amp;amp;C 88:78, cf. 97:14). What I have tried to do is to develop a theoretical framework that might allow us to think more positively about obedience. I know there are<i>many</i>aspects concerning the application of this principle that I haven't dealt with. Nor have I addressed the examples of misused authority with which I began; that would require a different talk. Here I will only say that I think an answer lies in the contrast between the exquisite beauty of the revelation contained in D&amp;amp;C 121 on the principles by which authority should be exercised and the extraordinary abuse of authority which led to, and attended, Joseph Smith's imprisonment at Liberty Jail. That contrast is central to the message, and I am grateful to Darren Watts for evoking that occasion as he sang for us the setting of Joseph's prayer.<br><br>In conclusion (yes, here is that trumpet phrase), I would like to state three propositions about obedience that I think emerge from what I have said:<br><br>1. Obedience is a dynamic force; it is the force by which creation comes about and by which we can participate with the Lord in the ongoing creation of the world.<br><br>2. Obedience is a gift, the noblest gift we can give to God. In laying this gift before him, we give what is truly our own--that which he has the power to coerce from us but never will, else all creation were lost.<br><br>3. Obedience is the highest expression of our faith and of our love. Christ says to us, "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15). Through obeying, we declare our love and express our gratitude--we say to him, "[I will]<i>keep</i>[thy commandments] in the midst of [my] heart" (Proverbs 4:21; emphasis added) and "I will keep thy commandments with all my heart" (Alma 45:7).<br><br>In the course of preparing this talk, I've read many insightful statements about obedience, not only in the scriptures, but also in the works of figures ranging from Aristotle to C. S. Lewis. But one of the wisest statements I've encountered is from a student. As a teacher, I'm always learning things from my students, and as a parent, from my children. This student also happens to be a son. Talking recently with his mother about obedience, our son Doug said that he used to think of obedience primarily as a<i>means--</i>if I obey I will get a certain blessing--but that he had now come to feel that<i>obedience is itself the blessing.</i><br><br>May we recognize and cherish this blessing in our lives I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>George S. Tate was a professor in the BYU Department of Humanities, Classics, and Comparative Literature when this devotional address was given on 25 July 1995.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>ll All Righteousness -Cecil O. Samuelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am grateful for this opportunity to be with you. I have chosen to consider with you a general theme that for me, at least, is far from finished in terms of my own explorations and endeavors. I believe that I am beginning to understand more of the dimensions and wrenching commitments that are required to fully grasp it and am trying, like most of you, to be headed in the proper direction.<br><br>I believe I have come not only to understand but to appreciate that the necessary and exciting quest to become more like Jesus is a lifelong process rather than a single, identifiable event, as some might suppose. Further, the Savior's Atonement, which is most fundamental to all that we believe and teach, is fully operative now for those who have chosen to be facing the direction Jesus has pointed out for us--as well as it will be on that great day when "every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess" who and what he is (Mosiah 27:31).<br><br>In spite of these truths to which we subscribe, there yet remain great possibilities and temptations in our lives for distraction. I recognize both your devotion and sophistication in these matters and yet sense that we all might profit from certain reminders from time to time.<br><br>Often we may become so preoccupied with or distracted by things that are sad, negative, disappointing, frightening, frustrating, evil, sensational, or even positively exciting that we may be deflected from proper consideration and application of the small, seemingly routine yet vital parts of life that ultimately make such a difference. Many of the good things that you do routinely, or should do, will not be considered newsworthy by most--thank goodness!--but nevertheless have consequences that are vastly underestimated. In fact, it is these apparently "little" things that often make the most difference in our lives and in the lives of others.<br><br>The Savior taught that it is often the seemingly inconsequential thought, word, or act that is deterministic in the eventual outcome of our lives (see Matthew 5:13–48). Faithful but impetuous Peter needed to be reminded of this yet again when Jesus washed the feet of the Twelve (see John 13:1–15). The rich and successful man, who seemed to have everything and who thought comfortably that he had consistently kept the commandments, was still pointedly rebuked by Jesus and told, "Yet lackest thou one thing" (Luke 18:22). Even those who are doing the basic things so well and are so deserving of commendation for their efforts to build the Lord's kingdom and qualify as his faithful disciples perhaps might profit by considering what thing or things may yet be lacking in their lives. Many of us might find an honest list uncomfortably long from time to time!<br><br>The prophet Nephi, explaining why the Savior was to be baptized in spite of his being "holy" or perfect, used an interesting phrase: to "fulfil all righteousness" (2 Nephi 31:5–6). Later, at the time of this most sacred event, Jesus himself used this phrase, "to fulfil all righteousness" (Matthew 3:15), in his explanation of the necessity of this ordinance to the reluctant but obedient John the Baptist.<br><br>Assuming that we would also like "to fulfil all righteousness," we need to clearly and more fully understand what this entails.<br><br>Righteousness has, I suppose, come to have several meanings, but that to which I refer and believe the prophet was describing is that which is "acting in accord with divine<i>. . .</i>law" (<i>Merriam-Webster's Dictionary</i>).<br><br>Clearly, because the Savior was sinless and without blemish, fulfilling all righteousness requires much more than just the avoidance of sin. The righteous life then cannot be a merely passive existence but obviously requires active performance and behavior, which has never been promised to be easy.<br><br>Understandably, in our zeal to do "the right thing," our focus may be almost entirely on not doing "wrong things." Lest I be misunderstood, it is not only proper but absolutely essential that certain things be assiduously avoided if we wish to be righteous. In fact, as the Lord revealed the Ten Commandments to Moses, we all recognize that the majority of these commandments were given in the "thou shalt not" format (see Exodus 20:1–17).<br><br>As important as it is to avoid the sins of "commission ," I would like to suggest that some of the risks and temptations related to the sins of "omission" are also very worrisome. Both might be profitably considered in the context of some of the superficially tiny things that may really matter most.<br><br>As somewhat of an aside, I am quite pleased that many of our friends and observers in the world increasingly characterize the Latter-day Saints in a positive light for the things we typically do not indulge in, such as alcohol, drugs, tobacco, and sexual immorality. I do worry that far fewer might not affirmatively think of or mention the extraordinarily good things that many of you are trying to do, largely as a consequence of your conscious discipleship of the Savior.<br><br>Again, lest I be misunderstood, I recognize with gratitude that Latter-day Saints are more and more being recognized for their positive family values, their willingness to be involved community citizens--particularly in the context of earthquakes, floods, and other disasters--and for the exemplary lives lived by an increasingly large number of faithful Latter-day Saints in a broad array of activities and endeavors.<br><br>As important as the perceptions of others are, however, I would like to concentrate primarily on how we might view ourselves and how we might properly structure our own attitudes and activities as we attempt to "fulfil all righteousness."<br><br>In the first decade of the organization of the Church in this dispensation, many conditions and circumstances and even the geographical locations of the main bodies of the Church changed rapidly. What did not seem to change, however, was that the message of the Restoration was not uniformly received with affection and appreciation. This was especially true for the representatives and advocates of the then newly emerging Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In fact, it was often not only risky to one's popularity but even to one's mortal existence to be too closely identified with the Latter-day Saints.<br><br>Happily, in our time some of the obvious physical risks to life and limb for disciples of the Savior in his restored Church have been greatly lessened; but, unhappily, the adversary's compensatory attacks and challenges upon our spiritual lives have not decreased in the least but have only become more insidious and sophisticated.<br><br>Most of you are familiar with the general details of the history of the Church in those first few years. After relocating from New York and Pennsylvania to Kirtland, very soon many of the Saints and leaders of the Church were drawn to Missouri with the potentially great blessings the Lord had promised to his Saints, predicated on their faithfulness, in that part of the land.<br><br>It was there, in the emerging community of Far West, Missouri, that a very important and instructive revelation was received by the Prophet Joseph Smith on July 8, 1838. In that remarkable communication from the Lord, among other instructions, were given very precise directions related to the beginning and unfolding of international missionary work. Almost unique among the published revelations given through the Prophet Joseph was that the Lord specifically instructed his servants as to not only their missionary labors "over the great waters," but also as to the exact time and place from which they should take their leave (see D&amp;amp;C 118).<br><br>At the time the revelation was received in July 1838, although the Saints were having difficulties with their neighbors in Missouri, I suppose most of the leaders and members did not appreciate how difficult fulfillment of this revelation, with its attendant specific prophecies, would finally be. In the ensuing months, after the revelation was received, conditions became even more difficult. Persecution increased, and the Prophet Joseph, together with several companions, was incarcerated in Liberty Jail while the body of the Church was physically expelled from Missouri by an edict of the governor.<br><br>Interestingly, this revelation outlining the departure of the Twelve Apostles as the first missionaries to Great Britain from the temple site at Far West, Missouri, on April 26, 1839, was not only well known to the leaders of the Church and to most of the members generally, but also to the opponents and detractors of the Church, several being apostates or dissidents.<br><br>The attitudes of those involved or observing these events were interesting and could be divided principally into three groups. The first group included those who actively opposed the Prophet Joseph, the Church, and the mission of the Restoration. These were those who recognized that this revelation (D&amp;amp;C 118) was unusual with respect to the specific prophecies related to the time and place of certain events. They felt strongly that if they could prevent these events from taking place, the Prophet, the Church, and the work of the Restoration would be discredited. They spoke vigorously and organized aggressively to prevent the remaining members of the Quorum of the Twelve, and other key leaders who were not in prison, from returning to the temple site in Far West and doing their parts in fulfilling the prophecy that had been declared by the Lord through the Prophet Joseph.<br><br>The second group may have, in fact, been the largest. These were those who were interested in the revelation for various reasons but considered themselves to be only bystanders. There is evidence to suggest that even some of the basically faithful leaders and members of the Church felt that though the revelation and prophecies had been given with specificity, because conditions had changed the Lord would excuse his servants from attempting to fulfill them, and the mandate to accomplish the important work that had been previously prescribed by the Lord was no longer operative, as was the case in some other instances in Church history.<br><br>The third group, although small in number and perhaps seemingly insignificant at the time, is the one on whom I would like to center our attention. These faithful Saints were those who not only understood the revelation and the prophecies included, but also felt heavy personal responsibility to see them fulfilled.<br><br>In 1869, thirty years following these most significant circumstances, Elder Wilford Woodruff of the Twelve, who had been a participant in these events, recalled them with great feeling. He reported that even among the Brethren in April 1839, the question arose, "What is to be done?" Said Elder Woodruff:<br><br><i>The general feeling in the Church, so far as I know, was that, under the circumstances, it was impossible to accomplish the work; and the Lord would accept the will for the deed. . . . Joseph was not with us, he was in chains in Missouri, for his religion. When President Young asked the question of the Twelve, "Brethren, what will you do about this?" the reply was, "The Lord has spoken and it is for us to obey." We felt that the Lord God had given the commandment and we had faith to go forward and accomplish it, feeling that it was His business whether we lived or died in its accomplishment.</i>[Wilford Woodruff, 12 December 1869,<i>JD</i>13:159]<br><br>Elder Woodruff then went on to describe the trip of the remaining Twelve and a few trusted associates back to Missouri and the events of that early morning of April 26, 1839, in Far West, including the laying of the cornerstone of the temple and the other business that was conducted. He concluded his account of this experience by saying, "We then returned, nobody having molested or made us afraid. We performed that work by faith, and the Lord blessed us in doing it" (ibid.). A miracle had happened, but as Moroni explained, it would not occur "until after the trial of [their] faith" (Ether 12:6).<br><br>I suppose that no one, even those who faithfully participated, could fully understand at the time the great impact on the kingdom of that cumulative and courageous act of faith which is so obvious today. Although the mission to Britain that was commenced by the Twelve at that time was not without great difficulty, the future success of the work was not only greatly strengthened but ensured by the fulfillment of the prophecy of July 1838.<br><br>Given the prophetic calling of the Twelve, it is very possible that they might have clearly understood the long-term implications of their actions. However, it seems more likely that most were involved in doing what they did not because they necessarily understood with any detail or clarity the future consequences of their acts, but rather because they wanted "to fulfil all righteousness."<br><br>Most of us are familiar with the miraculous healing of Naaman, the Syrian, through the instrumentality of Elisha the prophet (see 2 Kings 5:1–14). Indeed, Jesus made reference to this wonderful and unique event in his own teaching (Luke 4:27). To be healed of leprosy was by itself spectacular. For Naaman, a rich and prominent man, to also learn the valuable lessons of faith and humility during this process was indeed a significant added blessing for him and all involved. A point of importance, however, that is easily and often overlooked is the small but vital antecedent act of the little Israelite servant maid to Naaman's wife. She it was, in a seemingly tiny but dramatic act of faith and testimony, who identified for Naaman's household the possibility and hope of a cure for Naaman from the vexing leprosy through the offices of a prophet of the Lord.<br><br>A small thing? Yes, but a superficially trivial statement that profoundly changed the life of Naaman for the better. Said the little maid to her mistress, "Would God my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy" (2 Kings 5:3).<br><br>Most of us will not, nor are we expected to, fully appreciate the implications of all of our decisions or actions. Likewise, not all of our choices or deeds will have the same level of impact or influence on ourselves or others. The challenge, however, is that we cannot know, usually, in a prospective way what it is that will make a real difference in our personal lives or in our efforts to serve and bless others. As a result, if we are prudent, we must really act and understand that all we do has the potential to make the real difference for us and for others. Likewise, we must accept the potential reality that what we<i>do not</i>do will also have possible geometric repercussions for many more, and in many more ways, than we might estimate.<br><br>As important as our good intentions are, in the last analysis it is what we do or do not do that determines real outcomes in our quest to become more like Jesus.<br><br>These sobering reflections alone might provide a basis for doing all that we can to "fulfil all righteousness," because even though the Lord knows the end from the beginning, we are most often not privileged to know now. Admittedly, we do need to do whatever is necessary to avoid the "big" mistakes, but we cannot afford such preoccupation with only escaping sin and bad decisions that we are deflected from doing the good we must do and making the hard but necessary choices we must make.<br><br>Likewise, we must painstakingly resist being tranquilized or overly encouraged by the displacement of major transgressions with "little" imperfections in which some of us seemingly take such pride. The adversary understands this principle much better than apparently do some of us.<br><br>The desensitization that has occurred in society over the last few generations in the media, music, and movies also sadly occurs in some individuals in a gradual way. That infamous swear word first publicly uttered, at least in movies, in the film<i>Gone with the Wind,</i>which was incidentally thought to be so scandalous at the time, is now so commonly used that the originally objectionable term is not only tame but, by comparison, fairly inoffensive to many. Likewise, the Ten Commandments have retrogressively become to many the "ten suggestions," if they are even acknowledged at all.<br><br>Lucifer understands the significant power of incrementalism and also the disasters that can occur very gradually if only he is patient enough and persistent enough. He is subtle enough to do whatever is required to be occasionally or, hopefully, consistently invited into the lives of those who most of the time are doing the right things.<br><br>A wonderful representation of a very sad phenomenon is represented by C. S. Lewis in an amusing and insightful fictional correspondence between an elderly retired devil, Screwtape, and his young nephew devil, Wormwood, who is just beginning his work.<br><br>Wormwood, like many young people, devils and saints alike, tended to focus on the spectacular. He confessed to his Uncle Screwtape his disappointment in not being able to tempt his assigned client into committing some of the really big sins that ensure notoriety. Rather, he was distressed that he was only able to cause his assigned project to commit "little" sins or transgressions. His wise and experienced uncle, speaking from a devil's perspective, gave some very helpful observations.<br><br><i>You will say that these are very small sins; and doubtless, like all young tempters, you are anxious to be able to report spectacular wickedness. But do remember, the only thing that matters is the extent to which you separate the man from the Enemy. It does not matter how small the sins are, provided that their cumulative effect is to edge the man away from the Light and out into the Nothing. Murder is no better than cards if cards can do the trick. Indeed, the safest road to Hell is the gradual one--the gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts.</i>[C. S. Lewis,<i>The Screwtape Letters</i>(New York: Macmillan, c. 1961, 1982), p. 56]<br><br>Screwtape understood that we are much more susceptible to superficially minor deviance from expected norms than we are to the really big aberrations. He also clearly appreciated that not only might little things lead to bigger ones but that even if they did not, they could and would keep participants from achieving what they should accomplish (see<i>The Screwtape Letters,</i>pp. 55–56).<br><br>What would the history of the Church have been had Brigham Young, Wilford Woodruff, and the others not returned to Far West that fearful April in 1839? It is impossible to say, but it is likely the Lord would have found them wanting. It is possible that Elders Young, Kimball, Taylor, and Woodruff would not have had the faith to do the really big things that they accomplished later, not only in the mission field but throughout their ministries, had they not faithfully taken that one significant step on that fateful day in Far West.<br><br>Would the history of strife and conflict in the Middle East have been different if the servant girl from Israel had not shared her faith in God and hope with Naaman's wife? Probably not, but the continuing impact for good on Naaman and his household would have certainly not occurred without her conviction-based testimony to her mistress.<br><br>Many of our responsibilities, opportunities, challenges, and crises are uniquely and individually crafted for our own growth, development, and testing. For those that are without direct parallels which might be observed in the lives of others around us, special and individual responses are necessary if we are to be successful in meeting them. Happily, whatever the specific challenges, we have been promised sufficient help to overcome or meet them if we do our parts faithfully.<br><br>Most of what we face, however, is quite similar to that which others also encounter. This includes not only the multiple frustrations and opportunities of daily living, but also the basic commandments of God that have been given by our loving Father in Heaven to assist us, build us, and guide us to successfully meet all of the challenges and wonderful opportunities of mortal life.<br><br>The commandments or "rules" of God, if you will, have not been given to capriciously or arbitrarily or thoughtlessly vex or punish us. Rather, they have been provided to us as protectors, guides, leaders, teachers, and loyal friends to ensure we have what we need to "fulfil all righteousness" and to avoid the necessary sorrow that eventually and universally comes with the realization that after all, we may lack some thing or things that are necessary for eternal life.<br><br>In this blessed university setting, there are few who fail to understand what is expected of each of us in our quests to "come unto Christ" (Moroni 10:30). This certainly applies to the big things, but equally pertains to the little ones as well. Our challenge then seems to be to apply equally the Savior's injunctions and example in all areas and facets of our lives, including the small things as well as the large, to qualify to be described by him as those "whoso heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them" (3 Nephi 14:24).<br><br>May we live so that we can do all the things--and especially those that seem only "little" things--that are so necessary for us "to fulfil all righteousness."<br><br>I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O.

<h1>of the Sabbath - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Several months ago I accompanied President Gordon B. Hinckley to a regional conference. On Saturday afternoon we instructed the priesthood brethren. In the course of the instruction, President Hinckley expressed some of the concerns he has with respect to the members of the Church. One of his concerns was "our tendency to take on the ways of the world." He then said:<br><br><i>We don't adopt them immediately, but we slowly take them on, unfortunately. . . . I wish I had the power to convert this whole Church to the observance of the Sabbath. I know our people would be more richly blessed of the Lord if they would walk in faithfulness in the observance of the Sabbath.</i>[Heber City/Springville Regional Conference, Priesthood Leadership Meeting, May 13, 1995]<br><br>So far as I can recall, I have always had a testimony of the gospel. I cannot remember when I did not have a testimony. I believe this is due to my having been reared in a god-fearing home. I am the oldest of ten children. Both of my parents are active members of the Church, and while we were growing up the Church was our life. We were taught to emulate the faith and example of our parents.<br><br>One element of their faith and obedience was the proper observance of the Sabbath day. If I may have your faith and the utterance of the Spirit, I would like to discuss with you my understanding of the teachings of the Church as they relate to the proper observance of the Sabbath day.<br><br>When President Hinckley expressed a concern that our people may "take on the ways of the world" by not observing the Sabbath day, I thought of the revelation of the Lord through the Prophet Joseph Smith in section 59 of the Doctrine and Covenants. In verse 9, the Lord states as follows:<br><br><i>And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day.</i><br><br>Is it not coincidental that the Lord counseled us, 164 years ago tomorrow, that we as a people may keep ourselves "unspotted from the world" by properly observing the Sabbath? We, as a community of Saints, should emulate the traditions of our fathers and be known as a people who honor the Sabbath. There should be no misunderstanding among our associates and friends, who are or are not members of the Church, about how we, individually and as a community of Saints, observe the Sabbath day. This example of our people should reflect how we act as well as what we teach. Although others may watch how we observe the Sabbath day, we should not be self-righteous or appear to elevate ourselves in the eyes of others. We should simply observe the Sabbath day in the proper manner because we know it is correct and we receive personal joy and strength from doing so.<br><br>The word<i>Sabbath</i>comes from the Hebrew<i>shabbath,</i>meaning "day of rest" (see<i>MD,</i>p. 658).<br><br>Flavius Josephus, an oft-quoted scholar in the first century, stated that the Sabbath was a day "set apart from labour; [and] dedicated to the learning of our customs and laws" so that the people might learn a good thing and avoid sin (<i>The Complete Works of Flavius Josephus,</i>trans. William Whiston [Grand Rapids, Michigan: Kregel Publications, 1981], p. 338 [book 16, chapter 2]).<br><br>It is interesting to me how closely this secular definition parallels the scriptural basis for honoring the Sabbath.<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball said that in honoring the Sabbath, one "contemplates quiet tranquility, peace of mind and spirit. It is a day to get rid of selfish interests and absorbing activities"<i>(TSWK,</i>p. 215).<br><br>What is the origin of the Sabbath day? We often think that it originated with Moses when he gave the Israelites the Ten Commandments. In Exodus, chapter 20, the fourth commandment (which incidentally consists of ninety-four words as compared to some of the commandments that consist of only four words) reads as follows:<br><br><i>Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.</i><br><br><i>Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:</i><br><br><i>But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:</i><br><br><i>For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.</i>[Exodus 20:8–11]<br><br>Elder Bruce R. McConkie states that Sabbath observance is an eternal principle, and he notes<i>five</i>occurrences in the scriptures when observance of the Sabbath day was required by the Lord (from<i>MD,</i>p. 658; emphasis in original):<br><br>First: "From the day of Adam to the Exodus from Egypt, the Sabbath commemorated the fact that Christ rested from his creative labors on the 7th day" (see Genesis 2:2–3, Exodus 20:8–11).<br><br>Second: "From the Exodus to the day of his resurrection, the Sabbath commemorated the deliverance of Israel from Egyptian bondage" (see Deuteronomy 5:12–15).<br><br>Third: "From the days of the early apostles to the present, the Sabbath has been the first day of the week, the<i>Lord's Day,</i>in commemoration of the fact that Christ came forth from the grave on Sunday" (see Acts 20:7).<br><br>Fourth: "The Latter-day Saints keep the first day of the week as their Sabbath . . . because the Lord so commanded them by direct revelation." This revelation was given on Sunday, August 7, 1831, and is recorded in section 59 of the Doctrine and Covenants.<br><br>Fifth: "Sabbath observance was a sign between ancient Israel and their God whereby the chosen people might be known" (see Nehemiah 13:15–22, Isaiah 56:1–8, Jeremiah 17:19–27, Ezekiel 46:1–7, and Exodus 31:12–17).<br><br>As I earlier stated, I learned to observe the Sabbath day from my parents. I grew up on a large farm where we had animals to feed and care for, cows to milk, and vegetables to pick, harvest, and market. It would have been very easy for our family to break the Sabbath day. Although we attended to the essential chores--such as feeding the animals and milking the cows, taking the water turns when they came, and preparing our large trucks with harvested and packed fresh fruits and vegetables for a 4:00 a.m. Monday departure for market--we never did other farm work on Sunday. Our tractors were turned off, and no plowing, planting, or cultivating was done on the Sabbath. We never hauled in the hay before a coming storm. My parents had a very simple philosophy: "The day we violate the Sabbath day and have to miss our Sunday meetings to care for the farm is the day we sell the farm." As I grew up, married, and had a family of my own, my wife and I taught these same principles to our children.<br><br>When our family was young, we lived in Connecticut and were the only members of the Church in our small community. When our oldest son was nine years of age, he was invited to play Little League baseball. He was outfitted with a complete baseball suit, and he practiced very hard to be a good member of the team. Several days before the first game was to be played, the coach of his team came to our home and informed us that due to a recent scheduling change, all games would be played on Sunday. Our son was devastated. We convened a family home evening the next Monday and discussed the matter and left the decision to our son. He, knowing of our heritage and principles, made the decision that he would not play. I can still recall his heartbreak as I drove him to the coach's home, where he turned in his newly acquired baseball uniform. I am eternally grateful that all of our children, to this day, properly observe the Sabbath.<br><br>I recall reading several years ago a talk given by President Hinckley telling of the faithfulness of our pioneer forefathers in their observance of the Sabbath. He said:<br><br><i>May I take you back 142 years when there was, of course, no tabernacle here, nor temple, nor Temple Square. On July 24, 1847, the pioneer company of our people came into this valley. An advance group had arrived a day or two earlier. Brigham Young arrived on Saturday. The next day, Sabbath services were held both in the morning and in the afternoon. There was no hall of any kind in which to meet. I suppose that in the blistering heat of that July Sunday they sat on the tongues of their wagons and leaned against the wheels while the Brethren spoke. The season was late, and they were faced with a gargantuan and immediate task if they were to grow seed for the next season.</i>But President Young pleaded with them not to violate the Sabbath then or in the future. [Gordon B. Hinckley, "An Ensign to the Nations,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1989, p. 51; emphasis added]<br><br>Can you possibly imagine how tempting it must have been for our pioneer forefathers to break the Sabbath day? Their survival depended upon the food they could grow and harvest. Yet their leaders counseled them to exercise faith in the promises of the Lord and to respect the Sabbath day.<br><br>You students and faculty and administration leaders are the beneficiaries of that heritage and of the promises of the Lord to those who are faithful. Always remember who you are and that you are different from the world. We expect that much of you.<br><br>I would like to read two scriptures that teach us what we should do on the Sabbath and that tell of the promises that come from keeping the Sabbath. The first scripture is found in the Old Testament in Leviticus 26:2–6, 9:<br><br><i>Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the Lord.</i><br><br><i>If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;</i><br><br><i>Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.</i><br><br><i>And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.</i><br><br><i>And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land. . . .</i><br><br><i>For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.</i><br><br>Did you note the promises of the Lord? Can you relate to them in a modern-day world? Do you not need today, just as the Israelites did in the Old Testament, to have the land yield her increase and the trees of the field yield their fruit? Do you not also need to have rain in due season, peace in the land, to be able to lie down and not be afraid, and to not have the sword or wars go through your land? Do you not also want the Lord to have respect for you and help you be fruitful and multiply you and establish his covenant with you? All of these promises apply to us today. I personally believe that perhaps some of the destruction and suffering we see and experience in the world today are the result of a people who mock God and who do not keep his simple commandments such as properly observing the Sabbath day. One of the key messages of the Book of Mormon is how people suffer when they do not keep God's commandments. President George Albert Smith said, "Much of the sorrow and distress that is afflicting . . . mankind is traceable to the fact that they have ignored his [God's] admonition to keep the Sabbath day holy" (<i>CR,</i>October 1935, p. 120).<br><br>Examine your own life and you will see how, by keeping these commandments, each of these promises could bless and prosper you today.<br><br>The second scripture is found in D&amp;amp;C 59:9–13:<br><br><i>And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day;</i><br><br><i>For verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors, and to pay thy devotions unto the Most High;</i><br><br><i>Nevertheless thy vows shall be offered up in righteousness on all days and at all times;</i><br><br><i>But remember that on this, the Lord's day, thou shalt offer thine oblations and thy sacraments unto the Most High, confessing thy sins unto thy brethren, and before the Lord.</i><br><br><i>And on this day thou shalt do none other thing, only let thy food be prepared with singleness of heart that thy fasting may be perfect, or, in other words, that thy joy may be full.</i><br><br>Please note some of the things we are counseled to do on the Sabbath:<br><br>• The Sabbath is a day of rest.<br><br>• It is a day of worship to pay our devotions to the Most High.<br><br>• It is a day to offer up our vows in righteousness.<br><br>• It is a day to confess our sins.<br><br>• It is a day to partake of the sacrament.<br><br>• It is a day to prepare our food with singleness of heart.<br><br>• It is a day to perfect our fasting.<br><br>Now, beginning with verse 16, please note the promises, which are similar to those found in the book of Leviticus, that come to those who live the law of the Sabbath:<br><br><i>Verily I say, that inasmuch as ye do this, the fulness of the earth is yours, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, and that which climbeth upon the trees and walketh upon the earth;</i><br><br><i>Yea, and the herb, and the good things which come of the earth, whether for food or for raiment, or for houses, or for barns, or for orchards, or for gardens, or for vineyards;</i><br><br><i>Yea, all things which come of the earth, in the season thereof, are made for the benefit and the use of man, both to please the eye and to gladden the heart;</i><br><br><i>Yea, for food and for raiment, for taste and for smell, to strengthen the body and to enliven the soul.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 59:16–19]<br><br>Once again the promise is that "all things which come of the earth" are for our benefit if we will observe the Sabbath. I believe that we as a people, a community of Saints, would be entitled to these marvelous blessings pronounced by the Lord in these two scriptures if we would keep the Sabbath day holy as required by the Lord.<br><br>President Kimball taught how we might observe the Sabbath:<br><br><i>The Sabbath is a day on which to take inventory--to analyze our weaknesses, to confess our sins to our associates and our Lord. It is a day on which to fast in "sackcloth and ashes." It is a day on which to read good books, a day to contemplate and ponder, a day to study lessons for priesthood and auxiliary organizations, a day to study the scriptures and to prepare sermons, a day to nap and rest and relax, a day to visit the sick, a day to preach the gospel, a day to proselyte, a day to visit quietly with the family and get acquainted with our children, a day for proper courting, a day to do good, a day to drink at the fountain of knowledge and of instruction, a day to seek forgiveness of our sins, a day for the enrichment of our spirit and our soul, a day to restore us to our spiritual stature, a day to partake of the emblems of his sacrifice and atonement, a day to contemplate the glories of the gospel and of the eternal realms, a day to climb high on the upward path toward our Heavenly Father. [TSWK,</i>p. 216]<br><br>President David O. McKay said: "Sunday is a day when we change our clothes, put on clean linen. It is truth that 'cleanliness is next to godliness,' and the Lord said, 'Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord'" (<i>CR,</i>October 1956, p. 90).<br><br>We have always tried to teach our children that perhaps we can better observe the Sabbath by the manner in which we dress on the Sabbath. It may not be that we would always remain in our white shirts, ties, and suits all day Sunday, but it also might be that we would not quickly change to our "grubbies" or commonly worn workaday clothes on Sunday. Perhaps we ought to consider being a little better dressed on Sunday than we are for the rest of the week. This will help us to properly observe the Sabbath and to do the things that ought to be done on the Sabbath.<br><br>A member of the Seventy once shared with several of us that in his home the family observed the Sabbath by following three principles: attitude, appearance, and activity. They tried to focus on reverence as they observed these principles. I think this is wise counsel. What is your attitude of what you should do on the Sabbath? Is your appearance conducive to proper Sabbath worship and observance? A proper attitude and appearance will always lead to proper activity on the Sabbath.<br><br>President Kimball also reviewed some additional excellent suggestions from the Brethren on what types of activities we might consider doing on the Sabbath:<br><br><i>"As we plan our Sunday activities, we may want to set aside time for our family to be together, for personal study and meditation, and for service to others. We might want to read the scriptures, conference reports, and Church publications; study the lives and teachings of the prophets; prepare Church lessons and other Church assignments; write in journals; pray and mediate; write to or visit relatives and friends; write to missionaries; enjoy uplifting music; have family gospel instruction; hold family council meetings; build husband-wife relationships; read with a child; do genealogical research, including the four-generation program and family or personal histories; sing Church hymns; read uplifting literature; develop our appreciation for the cultural arts; plan family home evening study and activities; plan other family activities; friendship nonmembers; fellowship neighbors; visit the sick, the aged, and the lonely; hold interviews with family members."</i>[<i>TSWK,</i>p. 217]<br><br>As we consider these teachings of the prophets, we should not be judgmental of others who do not believe or practice as we do. Tolerance and humility, in a personal sense, are true attributes of a follower of Christ.<br><br>President Ezra Taft Benson has given similar counsel:<br><br><i>--Engage in activities that contribute to greater spirituality.</i><br><br><i>--Attend essential Church meetings in the house of prayer.</i><br><br><i>--Acquire spiritual knowledge by reading the scriptures, Church history and biographies, and the inspired words of our Church leaders.</i><br><br><i>--Rest physically, get acquainted with your family, relate scriptural stories to your children, and bear your testimony to build family unity.</i><br><br><i>--Visit the sick and aged shut-ins.</i><br><br><i>-- Sing the songs of Zion and listen to inspiring music.</i><br><br><i>--Pay devotions to the Most High through prayer (personal and family), fasting, administration, and father's blessings.</i><br><br><i>-- Prepare food with a singleness of heart: simple meals prepared largely on Saturday.</i><br><br><i>-- Remember that Sunday is the Lord's day, a day to do his work.</i>["Keeping the Sabbath Day Holy,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1971, p. 6]<br><br>I have observed that when we follow the prophets we will be blessed. I think it is not asking too much for you to give strong consideration to following these counsels.<br><br>One way to more effectively keep the Sabbath day is to prepare in advance. President Benson has given us the following additional suggestions:<br><br><i>--Houseclean, straighten up, refuel the car, and prepare clothing and meals in advance on Saturday.</i><br><br><i>-- Provide for recreation and amusements during the week and provide for a holiday during the week, if possible.</i><br><br><i>--Get a good rest on Saturday night.</i>["Keeping the Sabbath ," p. 6]<br><br>These practical suggestions might well be performed by all members of the family--husband and wife and all children cooperating together before the Sabbath to be prepared and ready for the Sabbath.<br><br>We might also consider what activities do not fit the spirit or purpose of the Sabbath. President Benson has offered the following suggestions:<br><br><i>--Overworking and staying up late Saturday so that you are exhausted the next day.</i><br><br><i>--Filling the Sabbath so full of extra meetings that there is no time for prayer, meditation, family fellowship, and counseling.</i><br><br><i>--Doing gardening and odd jobs around the house.</i><br><br><i>--Taking trips to canyons or resorts, visiting friends socially, joy riding, wasting time, and engaging in other amusements. (See</i>Discourses of Brigham Young,<i>p. 165; Daniel H. Ludlow,</i>Latter-day Prophets Speak,<i>pp. 360–63.)</i><br><br><i>--Playing vigorously and going to movies.</i><br><br><i>--Engaging in sports and hunting "wild animals" which God made for the use of man only "in times of famine and excess of hunger." (See D&amp;amp;C 89:15.) . . .</i><br><br><i>--Reading material that does not contribute to your spiritual uplift.</i><br><br><i>--Shopping or supporting with your patronage businesses that operate on Sunday, such as grocery stores, supermarkets, restaurants, and service stations.</i>[Benson, "Keeping the Sabbath ," pp. 6–7]<br><br>Regarding not filling up the Sabbath day with extra meetings so there is no time for true worship and observance, one of the General Authorities recently reported the following: At a stake conference a priesthood leader told the General Authority that their local stake presidency worked hard and, in fact, started at 6:00 a.m. every Sunday morning and seldom returned home before 9:00 that evening. The General Authority said he then had to counsel the hardworking brother that that is not expected of nor suggested to priesthood leaders. Use better judgment in how you schedule your special Sunday meetings. The family is not to be neglected as a result of our Sunday schedules.<br><br>There is one other very important matter with respect to the Sabbath day that I would like to discuss with you--that is<i>shopping on Sunday.</i><br><br>When President Hinckley counseled the priesthood leaders that he was concerned that our people would become like the world by not properly observing the Sabbath, he made the following additional statements:<br><br><i>There isn't anybody in this Church who has to buy furniture on Sunday. There really isn't. There isn't anybody in this Church who has to buy a new automobile on Sunday, is there? No. There isn't anybody in this Church who, with a little care and planning, has to buy groceries on Sunday. No. We all have refrigerators. A quart of milk will hold, insofar as the bacteria go, from Saturday till Monday. There is no question about that. You don't need ice cream to be bought on Sunday. You don't need to buy groceries on Sunday, brethren. You don't need to make Sunday a day of merchandising. I don't think we need to patronize the ordinary business merchants on the Sabbath day. Why do they stay open? To get customers. Who are those customers? Well, they are not all nonmembers of this Church. You know that and I know that.</i>[Heber City/Springville Regional Conference, Priesthood Leadership Meeting, May 13, 1995]<br><br>Several months ago, I read in our newspaper of a local car dealer who was quoted as follows: "Utahns can do something they cannot do anywhere else: shop for a new automobile on Sunday." He then noted that some twenty-five years ago, Utah automobile dealers were successful in overturning a state "blue law" that required them to close their showrooms on Sunday. Although legal to open on Sunday, no automobile dealership did. This car dealer said that<br><br><i>times have changed.</i><br><br><i>Utah's population is more diverse than it was 2 1/2 decades ago. . . . And there are more people in the state who have no religious objection to shopping on Sunday, whether it is for a new suit or a new sport-utility vehicle.</i><br><br>He then continued that he saw few, if any, disadvantages to selling vehicles on Sunday, although some members of his sales force preferred not to work on that day ("Car Dealer Finds Profit in Sales on Sunday,"<i>Salt Lake Tribune,</i>May 28, 1995, p. F-l). This is tragic.<br><br>For most of our married life, my wife and I have lived outside of the state of Utah and in foreign countries. In many of these places, there is no shopping on Sunday. Malls, supermarkets, and all but the very emergency and essential services are closed on Sunday. When we returned to Utah, we were shocked and amazed at the large number of businesses that are open for shopping on Sunday. Elder Dallin H. Oaks has said:<br><br><i>Modern-day prophets have encouraged us not to shop on Sunday. . . . Those of us who shop on the Sabbath cannot escape responsibility for encouraging businesses to remain open on that day. Essential services must be provided, but most Sabbath transactions could be avoided if merchants and customers were determined to avoid doing business on the Lord's day.</i>["Brother's Keeper,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1986, p. 21]<br><br>The Lord taught us that principle many years ago. In Nehemiah 10:31, the people were taught to observe the Sabbath with the following instruction: "And if the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on the sabbath day to sell, . . . we would not buy it of them on the sabbath, or on the holy day."<br><br>Brothers and sisters, friends and students, let's not shop on Sunday. One way we avoid this is by planning ahead. Fill up the gas tank of your car on Saturday. Acquire the needed groceries for the weekend on Saturday. Don't you be the means of causing someone to work on Sunday because you patronize their establishment. Of course, we know that there are essential businesses that must be open on Sunday. These are usually the emergency, medical, transportation, and other forms of business and government service.<br><br>President Kimball once interviewed a man when he was reorganizing a stake. He said:<br><br><i>"What is your occupation?" And</i>[the man]<i>said, "I operate a service station." And I asked, "Do you operate on the Sabbath?" His answer was, "No, I do not." "Well, how can you get along? Most service station operators seem to think they must open on the Sabbath." "I get along well," he said. "The Lord is good to me." "Do you not have stiff competition?" I asked. "Yes, indeed," he replied. "Across the street is a man who keeps open all day Sunday." "And you never open?" I asked. "No, sir," he said, "and I am grateful, and the Lord is kind, and I have sufficient for my needs."</i>[<i>TSWK,</i>p. 227]<br><br>One hundred and twenty-four years ago, Elder George Q. Cannon, a member of the Twelve, gave the following counsel:<br><br><i>A man deceives himself when he thinks that, by working on Sunday, he advances his labor or his interests. So also with those who take that day for excursions and pleasure hunting. A man who strictly confines his labors to six days, and will not work himself, nor suffer his animals to work on Sunday, will perform more labor during the year and be prospered to a far greater extent, than the man who is careless upon this point. So also with those who seek pleasure; they lose by using the Sabbath for that purpose. If they would select some other day, they would find themselves better off at the end of the year than they would be in using Sunday for this purpose. It should be an inflexible rule with every man, woman and child in the Church to hold Sunday sacred for the worship of the Lord, and never to perform any labor on that day if it can possibly be avoided.</i>[<i>Juvenile Instructor</i>6, 2 September 1871, p. 140; also, see George Q. Cannon,<i>Gospel Truth,</i>sel. Jerreld L. Newquist (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1987), pp. 394–95]<br><br>For those who work on the Sabbath when it is not necessary, and they do not have to, President Kimball said: "I wonder if money earned upon the Sabbath, when it is unnecessary Sabbath earning, might not also be unclean money" (<i>TSWK,</i>p. 227).<br><br>May I offer a personal counsel to students on a concluding subject that might be rather tender and touching, but one in which I feel very strongly? That is the matter of studying on the Sabbath.<br><br>I know what you experience and the challenges you face in trying to be good students. I have attended three universities, spent three years in law school, and acquired an advanced master's degree in corporate law. While acquiring the latter degree, I served as a bishop of a ward of a thousand people in New York City, and I was working full-time for a Wall Street law firm. I had every temptation and opportunity to study on the Sabbath day to be prepared for class and to acquire good grades.<br><br>I made it a simple matter of principle that I would take the Lord at his word and avoid, at all cost, studying on Sunday. I have felt that the Lord honored my commitment, and I completed all that I attempted and, in my humble opinion, excelled where I needed to. I found that by observing the Sabbath day, particularly as it relates to studying, I commenced Monday morning with an invigorated body and an enlightened mind to perform the labors of the week with ease and pleasure. And I always felt that I was prepared for school if I planned ahead and kept the Sabbath day.<br><br>President Kimball, in speaking on the matter of studying on the Sabbath, made the following statement:<br><br><i>I hope students will use the Sabbath for studying only as an emergency. . . . I believe that generally, with careful organization of time through the week, most studying can be done on weekdays, leaving the Sabbath for worship.</i>. . .<i>There might be times when one would feel forced to study, when he might feel that it was an ox in the mire. I am expressing only my personal opinions on this matter, but since we are talking to students, it would be my hope that your studying could be done in the season thereof and not as a cramming process just before you go on Monday mornings.</i>[<i>TSWK,</i>p. 229]<br><br>Once again, these are personal goals to be set and achieved in the spirit of humility and meekness--not in judgment of others. I have a personal testimony that when we can achieve this level of Sabbath observance, we will experience quiet strength, knowledge, and peace.<br><br>In conclusion, I like the statement of Elder Mark E. Petersen, who said:<br><br><i>We can readily see that observance of the Sabbath is an indication of the depth of our conversion.</i><br><br><i>Our observance or nonobservance of the Sabbath is an unerring measure of our attitude toward the Lord personally and toward his suffering in Gethsemane, his death on the cross, and his resurrection from the dead. It is a sign of whether we are Christians in very deed, or whether our conversion is so shallow that commemoration of his atoning sacrifice means little or nothing to us.</i>["The Sabbath Day,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1975, p. 49]<br><br>In summary, President Hinckley was concerned that we as a people, a community of Saints, might "take on the ways of the world" by not properly observing the Sabbath. The temptations are all about us. The prophets have spoken, and their words are true. "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy" (Exodus 20:8). In latter-day revelation the Lord has commanded us to keep the Sabbath, and by doing so we will keep ourselves "unspotted from the world." We honor our living prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley, and eliminate his concern for us when we keep the Sabbath.<br><br>I boldly, but humbly, bear witness and testimony to you that observing the Sabbath day is a commandment of the Lord, and the Lord is very displeased when we do not honor his day. If we as a people, and each of us as individuals, will follow the counsel of the prophets, we will truly be in the world but not of the world. I further add my testimony to the scriptural promises previously read for those who keep the Sabbath day that we as a people will be blessed when we know and observe and keep the Sabbath holy. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Earl C. Tingey was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 6 August 1995.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>e Supreme Physical Manifestation of Inner Convictions - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Everything I needed to know I have learned in Primary by singing two songs: "I Am a Child of God" and "Jesus Wants Me for a Sunbeam."<br><br>Knowing what these songs teach makes all the difference in how I want to live my life.<br><br><i>I am a child of God,</i><br><i>And he has sent me here,</i><br><i>Has given me an earthly home</i><br><i>With parents kind and dear.</i><br><i>Lead me, guide me, walk beside me ...</i><br>["I Am a Child of God,"<i>Children's Songbook,</i>p. 2]<br><br>Learning about Jesus, the Son of God, and knowing that he wants me to be his light on earth makes me want to follow his example of patience, kindness, charity, and love "at home, at school, at play" ("Jesus Wants Me for a Sunbeam,"<i>Songbook,</i>p. 60).<br><br>The two questions we most often ask of ourselves, of trusted others, and of the Lord, are Who am I? and Why am I here? I suggest that we have the answers to these two questions--and that we are now ready for a barometer for measuring the third introspective and evaluative question: How am I doing?<br><br>We have scriptural references and interpretations from Church leaders to assist us in these self-evaluations. I hope that what I present here today will be helpful to you by creating in you an urgency to better understand the purpose of our time on earth and to put into daily practice those habits that are beneficial to becoming the daughter or son who deserves the blessing of this life on earth.<br><br>So let's start at the very beginning: We learn from Genesis 1:16–25 that on the fourth day, God made two great lights--"the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night"; and thus the sun of the heavens (the source of all energy) was created. And on the fifth day the fish and fowl were created. We further read, "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them" (v. 27).<br><br>It has always been interesting to me that the<i>sun</i>is the source of all energy on earth without which we cannot live, and that the<i>son</i>of God, named Jesus Christ, was sent to earth to give us the plan for living and the plan of salvation.<br><br>In section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants we are told that our purpose for coming to earth is to obtain a mortal body and that the spirit and body are the soul of man; neither is complete without the other.<br><br>In section 89 we were given the Word of Wisdom, showing forth the order and will of God in the temporal salvation of all Saints in the last days: "Given for a principle with promise, adapted to the capacity of the weak and the weakest of all saints, who are or can be called saints" (v. 3). Verses 5 and 7 through 9 are the do not's:<br><br><i>Inasmuch as any man drinketh wine or strong drink among you, behold it is not good....</i><br><br><i>...Strong drinks are not for the belly....</i><br><br><i>...Tobacco is not for the body, neither for the belly, and is not good for man....</i><br><br><i>...Hot drinks are not for the body or belly.</i><br><br>And in verses 10 through 14 we are given the do's:<br><br><i>All wholesome herbs God hath ordained for the constitution, nature, and use of man--</i><br><br><i>Every herb in the season thereof, and every fruit in the season thereof....</i><br><br><i>Yea, flesh also of beasts and of the fowls of the air, I, the Lord, have ordained for the use of man with thanksgiving; nevertheless they are to be used sparingly;</i><br><br><i>...only in times of winter, or of cold, or famine.</i><br><br><i>All grain is ordained for the use of man and of beasts, to be the staff of life, not only for man but for the beasts of the field, and the fowls of heaven.</i><br><br>The promise is given in verses 18 through 20:<br><br><i>All saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones;</i><br><br><i>And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures;</i><br><br><i>And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint.</i><br><br>Like Rabbi Harold S. Kushner, who spoke at a forum here, I, too, am thankful that we have a Father in Heaven who is interested in what we eat and how we care for our bodies (see "The Human Soul's Quest for God,"<i>Brigham Young Magazine,</i>February 1995, pp. 22–29).<br><br>A few years ago I was asked to speak to a group relative to the health and fitness of the members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. After six months of collecting data, I was not able to verify that Mormons were healthier than the general population in the United States. Most of our members do fairly well at abstinence from tobacco and alcohol--the do not's of the Word of Wisdom--however, we seem to ignore the importance of the do's.<br><br>When did we, members of the Church of Jesus Christ, receive this counsel? Section 88 was given in 1832, and section 89 was given in 1833. Generally speaking, a new generation is born every twenty years or so--you are now living in the sixth or seventh generation since this revelation was given to the Prophet Joseph Smith. What you are today is a composite of<i>your heritage</i>and<i>your lifestyle</i>since birth. We have to ask ourselves, Why are we not the healthiest people? Have six generations failed to follow these truths that are verified scientifically today? You can blame your heritage for the color of your eyes, your hair, and other individual characteristics as well as for your skeletal frame, the nature and length of muscle fibers, even the places where fat is stored on your body and the propensity to store fat. However, you are responsible for your present level of health and fitness--the strength of those muscles, your cardiovascular endurance, even the amount of fat tissue you carry. Today you can make a commitment to yourself to start living a life that will benefit the future generations of your family line.<br><br>In the south foyer of the Richards Building is a portrait of Stephen L Richards and a plaque with this quote:<br><br><i>The human body is sacred--the veritable tabernacle of the divine spirit which inhabits it. It is a solemn duty of mankind to develop, protect, and preserve it from pollution, unnecessary wastage and weakness.</i><br><br>Let me repeat: It is a solemn duty of man, male and female, to<i>develop the body, protect the body, and preserve the body</i>from pollution, unnecessary wastage, and weakness.<br><br>This statement is worthy of your visit to the south entrance of the Richards Building for your contemplation and self-evaluation.<br><br>Professor Truman Madsen once made a statement that will serve as a personal barometer for evaluating your present and future life style: "This generation will be known as those who trash the treasures and treasure the trash."<br><br>I know of no greater verification of that quote than to apply it to the human body.<br><br>How often do you or those with whom you associate trash the treasure of the sacred body with junk food and drink--foods high in fat, sugar, or salt and low in nutrients--in preference over fruits, vegetables, and grains packed with nutrients and low in fats, sugar, and salt? How many of you are addicted to such trash as soft drinks--high in sugar, salt, and carbonated gas--a poor substitute for the recommended daily intake of sixty-four ounces of water so essential for the healthy functioning of the body systems? Do you trash the heart, lungs, and other muscles of the body by living the life of a couch potato? The human body is designed for activity. It is strengthened by<i>proper</i>use, and it is weakened and deteriorates with misuse and no use. Do you treasure the trash and thereby trash the treasure of the greatest of all of God's creations--the sacred body, "a veritable tabernacle for the divine spirit which inhabits it"?<br><br>I have recently thought about influences in my life that have developed my convictions about the human body and about<i>my</i>body in particular. Growing up on a farm in southeastern Idaho provided me with many opportunities to develop and test my physical body. While I was very young, one of my chores was to get up early and run to the pasture to bring the cows into the milk barn. I got up at five o'clock--that habit has stuck with me all of my life. This daily activity--considered a chore by others--was a wonderful experience for me as I ran through the pasture, jumping the ditches, dodging the gopher holes, skipping, leaping, changing movement patterns, finding new routes to travel, and finding the exhilaration of the body moving through the atmosphere. I also remember the wonderful inner feeling I received when I first noticed that the cows were interested in my physical entrance into their presence. Old Pet, the leader of the herd, would be the first, and soon the entire herd would watch my antics as I rounded them up.<br><br>I had other positive experiences and challenges during those early years. My parents liked to dance, and as children we took our turn being danced around the room in the arms of one of them or standing with our feet on top of theirs as they danced us around the room. One experience that made a lasting impression on me, relative to challenges, was an attempt to cross the irrigation ditch. When I told my father I wanted to get across the ditch, he said, "Jump." When I said, "I can't," his answer was, "You can jump halfway, can't you?" I tried, landing in the middle of a ditch full of water. That experience taught me two things: (1) not to trust my father--he loved to give challenges, and he loved to have a good laugh; and (2) never try to jump a ditch of water until you have tried it out on a<i>dry</i>ditch.<br><br>My challenges and opportunities for physical development were many in that setting. What about you in your environment? What about here and now? Do you have someone to challenge you? Do you have something to do on a daily basis that challenges your physical body? You probably don't have a pasture to run in or the twice-daily responsibility and opportunity to perform for an appreciative audience of Holstein cows, but I recommend that you put into your life daily physical exertion--park a mile from campus just think how that would solve the traffic problem here), be a participant in the studios, on the grass fields, on the track.<br><br>Something that might give additional incentive is another valuable lesson I learned on the farm as I worked with animals. I noted that when they became good and fat they were hauled off to market.<br><br>Recently I read an article in the<i>Daily Universe</i>relative to dance at BYU. The leading caption was "Dance Dilemma: Some Say It Is Art, Others P.E." I would like to respond to that caption and emphasize that the purpose of P.E. (physical education) is to educate man (male and female) on how to maintain, "develop, protect, and preserve [the body] from ... unnecessary wastage and weakness" and that dance is a vehicle or a means by which the participant can exercise, care for, and discipline the body. Dance is physical education. Dance is for everyone, a<i>general education</i>for invigorating the body, mind, and spirit for effective study and living, whether the participant is majoring in science, music, mathematics, engineering, education, law, or any other chosen area of academics.<br><br>According to Rousseau, the great French philosopher of the seventeenth century:<br><br><i>It is a lamentable mistake, to imagine that bodily activity hinders the working of the mind, as if these two kinds of activity might not advance hand in hand, and as if the one were not intended to act as a guide to the other.</i>. . .<br><br><i>To learn to think we must therefore exercise our limbs, our senses, and our body organs which are tools of the intellect; and to get the best use out of these tools the body which supplies us with them must be strong and healthy.</i>[Quoted in Charles A. Bucher,<i>Foundations of Physical Education,</i>5th ed. (St. Louis: C. V. Mosby Company, 1968), pp. 127, 129]<br><br>Some people seem to think that physical education is for only those who are already highly skilled and physically fit. This thinking is as naive as thinking that mathematics is for only those who can succeed at a high level in mathematics or that English is only for those who already understand the language and can write skillfully.<br><br>It is equally ludicrous to think that if you study and talk about health and fitness, you are physically educated. The same would be true of taking a math class without the discipline of correctly computing any of the math problems or taking the English class without the discipline of writing essays.<br><br>Let me quote a devotional speech given by Sara Lee Gibb in this same setting six years ago:<br><br><i>There is no aspect of our existence--whether it be social, intellectual, or spiritual--that is not affected by our physical well-being or lack of it.</i>["Our Mortal Body--A Sacred Gift,"<i>BYU 1988–89 Devotional and Fireside Speeches</i>(Provo: Brigham Young University, 1989), p. 136]<br><br>Physical education is the act<i>of doing, of becoming</i>a healthy individual--better today than you were yesterday with the goal of becoming the healthiest and reaching the highest level of neuromuscular skill possible for you, not based on what someone else achieves but on your own heritage and your own physical abilities and disabilities. To add an additional barometer for measuring "How am I doing?" A Greek historian said:<br><br><i>What a disgrace it is for a man</i>[male/female]<i>to grow old without ever seeing the beauty of which his</i>[or her]<i>body is capable.</i>[Xenophon, 435 B.C.; quoted in Bucher,<i>Foundations,</i>p. 129]<br><br>Yes, dance is physical education, and dance is a performing art, the only performing art in which the total body is the performing instrument.<br><br>Just as poetry is the most eloquent form of human languages, dance is the most eloquent form of human movement--there is no language barrier. Dance is the supreme physical manifestation of inner convictions.<br><br>In this mechanized, materialized, computerized world, how much better it would be that at an early age our children were engaged in creative, imaginative activity that involves the total being--the body, mind, and spirit--rather than sitting with computer games, watching TV, or participating in other sedentary activities six to eight hours each day.<br><br>At my invitation, Rachel Kocherhans agreed to join us to share a dance she created to her selection of musical accompaniment. Rachel has been involved in the creative dance program since she was four years old.<br><br><i>[A three-minute creative dance performance was presented.]</i><br><br>Dance has been and continues to be an aspect of Mormon culture. From the writings of the late Leona Holbrook, as published under "Dance" in the<i>Encyclopedia of Mormonism,</i>I quote:<br><br><i>In 1830 when the Church was organized, many Christian denominations were hostile toward recreation and play, particularly dance. However, the Prophet Joseph Smith and his successors advocated dance and participated in recreational dancing. Joseph Smith was a skillful dancer and enjoyed hosting dances in his home (Holbrook, p. 122). Brigham Young and the Quorum of the Twelve "danced before the Lord" to the music of a small orchestra in the Nauvoo Temple after long days of joyous participation in temple ordinances (HC 7:557, 566; Holbrook, p.123).</i><br><br><i>...Early Latter-day Saints commended dancing as healthful to body and mind, but only when conducted in accordance with Church principles. Emphasis was on propriety, good company, and the spirit of praising the Lord. During their difficult trek west, the pioneers danced as "camps of Israel." President Brigham Young said, "I want you to sing and dance and forget your troubles. ... Let's have some music and all of you dance" (Holbrook, p. 125). Around the campfires they danced polkas, Scotch reels, quadrilles, French fours, and other figures.</i>[<i>Encyclopedia of Mormonism,</i>vol. 1 (New York: Macmillan, 1992), p. 354]<br><br><i>[The Brigham Young University Folk Dancers presented a segment of dances representing early Mormon culture.]</i><br><br>The culture of the LDS Church and the spirit of the gospel of Jesus Christ has been shared with people worldwide as the dance and music groups have represented Brigham Young University and the Church, bringing hope, peace, beauty, and friendship to the peoples of the world.<br><br>Dance is a most eloquent form of communication, and as such has also been a tool for promoting the work of the devil. The entertainment world is full of the sexy, sadistic, profane forms of body language, and through this means many are invited into a life of glitz, sensuality, and satanism.<br><br>We hope that students of the dance programs of Brigham Young University and other institutions of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints can counteract the satanical and bring to the world the eloquent, the beautiful, the wholesome, the sacred.<br><br>In closing, I wish to read to you the published Statement of Philosophy of the Brigham Young University Department of Dance:<br><br><i>With the belief that dance, as an expressive art, is an optimal educational vehicle to harmonize the body, mind and spirit, our work seeks to integrate the scientific, the historical, cultural, and the aesthetic, in theory and practice. Dance at Brigham Young University celebrates the worth of the "whole individual," including the sacredness of the physical body. It is based upon a philosophy of love, hope, enthusiasm, and a striving for excellence refined by a desire to serve, exemplifying the values of our Savior Jesus Christ. We believe in the dignity and potential of every human being and seek to provide a full spectrum of dance experiences for all who have a desire to be enriched through the joy of movement.</i>[Department of Dance, "Self-Study Document," 15 March 1995, p. 1]<br><br>I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>[Amy Clark Lives--a protégée of the children's and teen's creative dance program, a graduate of the dance major program, and a dance teacher at BYU--danced "the supreme physical manifestation of inner convictions." She was accompanied by vocal soloist Kim Underwood, a voice teacher in the Department of Music.]</i><br><br><i>Phyllis C.

<h1> Our Hearts to God - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In the book of Helaman we read that four decades before the Savior's birth, the ancient Nephites began to experience great pride within the Church, even to the persecution of many of the members. But there remained a humble part of the people who<br><br><i>did fast and pray oft, and did wax stronger and stronger in their humility, and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ, unto the filling their souls with joy and consolation, yea, even to the purifying and the sanctification of their hearts, which sanctification cometh because of their</i>yielding their hearts unto God. [Helaman 3:35; emphasis added]<br><br>Today we are in the presence of one who epitomizes the yielding of one's heart to God. This man is President Rex E. Lee. I first became acquainted with President Lee thirty-six years ago, when I came to BYU as a student. He was a returned missionary from Mexico serving as the student body president. Even then one could tell he was destined to become a great leader. He was confident but not pompous, friendly, and without guile. It was here that he met the beautiful Janet Griffin, and their friendship soon turned to love. He took the courageous step of inviting this sophisticated city girl to come home with him to St. Johns, Arizona, to meet all of his cowboy relatives. As they approached the thriving metropolis of St. Johns, Rex stopped the car in front of an isolated one-room shack on the outskirts of town. With a deadpan look on his face, he calmly opened up the trunk of the car and started taking out the luggage. Janet's anxiety turned to panic, thinking of the prospect of spending a glorious weekend in this little shack with all the relatives. Suddenly Rex burst into laughter, and she realized she had been the subject of heartless Arizona humor. They loaded up the luggage and his guitar, and they headed for his real residence.<br><br>In 1971 Rex responded to the call of the Brethren to leave a lucrative law practice to return to BYU and become the dean of the J. Reuben Clark Law School and also the bishop of the BYU 51st Ward, where I had the privilege of serving with him. Ten years later President Reagan invited him to become the solicitor general of the United States. Again, subsuming private preferences for the good of his country, Rex answered the call and served with distinction from 1981 to 1985. It was during this time that a pesky thorn in his flesh emerged to test his faith and to try the endurance of his lovely Janet. But Janet's faith and prayers and tender loving care, the faith of their seven children and other loved ones, all combined with the power of the priesthood, sustained him--he came off victorious.<br><br>One early morning in the summer of 1989, I saw Rex and Janet in the parking lot of the Church Administration Building. They had obviously just concluded a meeting with one of the Brethren because I detected a special, radiant glow about them. After chatting briefly with them, I felt I had just spoken with the next president of BYU. A few days later my suspicions were confirmed. Alas, it wasn't long before President Lee announced to the faculty and students that once again more thorns of the flesh had reared their ugly heads to try his patience and his faith. But like the Nephites of old, Rex and Janet have gladly yielded their hearts to God, and in the process they have claimed the promised blessings of purification and sanctification.<br><br>Last fall President Lee conducted an awards banquet at which one of the honorees was Elder Rex D. Pinegar of the Presidency of the Seventy. President Lee said it was an honor for him to present an award to another man named Rex. He then explained that he had recently returned from a visit to the Middle East. There he had been the guest in the home of a very prominent family that had a beautiful dog. Rex asked them the name of the dog, to which they replied, "In the Middle East we don't give names to dogs." But later in the afternoon he overheard the maid calling to the dog, "Here, Rex. Here, Rex."<br><br>Rex E. Lee has always taken the gospel seriously, but seldom does he take himself seriously. Rex and Janet, we admire you and love you, and we are grateful for your example of faith and courage and devotion in yielding your hearts to God.<br><h2><b>Making Connections</b></h2><br>On April 17, 1978, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that it had been six months since the last known case of smallpox had been reported in Somalia, Africa. The dreaded and disfiguring scourge of smallpox had been virtually eliminated from the face of the earth (see Donald A. Henderson, "Smallpox--Epitaph for a Killer?"<i>National Geographic</i>154, no. 6 [December 1978]: 796–805).<br><br>Two centuries previous to this heartening announcement, a young British country physician by the name of Edward Jenner had shown great concern with this widespread disease that had killed and disfigured so many Europeans during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. One day Jenner made a very important observation. It seemed that all of the young milkmaids in England who had contracted very mild cases of<i>cowpox</i>appeared to be naturally immune to<i>smallpox.</i><br><br>On May 14, 1796, Dr. Jenner took some matter from a cowpox lesion of Sarah Nelmes, a young dairymaid, and inoculated James Phipps, a boy of eight, who later developed only a slight fever and a few cowpox lesions. Six weeks later, young James was inoculated again, but this time with virulent smallpox matter--but no infection occurred. He was immune to smallpox. A breakthrough of gigantic proportions had been made; and though it would take two centuries to do so, smallpox was doomed to extinction.<br><br>Whether discoveries occur in Archimedes' bathtub or under Sir Isaac Newton's apple tree, most scientific breakthroughs result from establishing connections. For centuries milkmaids had only been subjected to very mild attacks of cowpox whereas the rest of the population suffered from the scars and fatalities of smallpox. It took Edward Jenner, at age twenty-seven, to make this important connection in identifying the desirable immunization properties of the very mild disease of cowpox that could be utilized to protect individuals against the dreaded disease of smallpox.<br><br>A quarter-century after Jenner's earth-shattering connection, an even greater connection was made by a young boy who was studying the Bible in the spring of 1820. He seemed to be the kind of young lad who did not just<i>read</i>the scriptures. He had an inclination to<i>study</i>them and to<i>ponder</i>their meaning. One day he read a passage that hundred s of biblical scholars and millions of Christian believers had read during the preceding centuries. But just as British physicians and farmers had failed to make the connections later made by Edward Jenner, previous students of the Bible had failed to make the saving connection that Joseph Smith made when he read those immortal words of James: "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God" (James 1:5–6).<br><br>Joseph described his reactions in the following words:<br><br><i>Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart. ...</i><br><br><i>... I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in darkness and confusion, or else I must do as James directs, that is, ask of God.</i><br><br>[JS--H 1:12–13]<br><br>Joseph's inspired ability to make<i>this</i>connection led him into the Sacred Grove. From thence, during the intervening years, he became an instrument in the hands of God in bringing forth the Book of Mormon, in restoring the true church of Christ, and in restoring the gospel in its fullness, including priesthood power and keys and all of the eternal ordinances necessary for us to return to the presence of God.<br><br>It all began when a young man made a connection between a scripture and a sacred grove and yielded his heart to God.<br><h2><b>Powerful Ideas</b></h2><br>Because of Joseph Smith's experience, we are all gathered here today. You are the "extra-milers" in the kingdom of God. Your presence confirms that you are among those who "hunger and thirst after righteousness" (Matthew 5:6). Your minds are drawn to interesting, challenging, and powerful ideas. Elder Neal A. Maxwell has suggested that we maintain an inventory of insights and powerful ideas gleaned from reading, especially from the scriptures.<br><br>The purpose of our sojourn in mortality is to learn and to do those things necessary to qualify us to regain the presence of God. In order to do so, we must continually make connections between actions and consequences. One extremely important connection to make early in life is that "wickedness never was happiness" (Alma 41:10). In the Russian classic<i>Anna Karenina,</i>Leo Tolstoy observed that "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way" (<i>Anna Karenina,</i>trans. Constance Garnett (New York: Random House, 1939), p. 1). Inasmuch as the Book of Mormon teaches us that "men are, that they might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25), we would do well to maintain in our hearts and minds those powerful teachings that bring us joy.<br><br>Another important connection is the discovery that "when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated" (D&amp;amp;C 130:21). Those who share the gospel with others and who engage in family history and temple work claim blessings and joy that simply cannot be gained any other way.<br><br>Still another valuable insight is "that the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven" (D&amp;amp;C 121:36). A few months ago I had a wonderful experience I have had several times previously in reorganizing a new stake presidency. I was given the assignment by President Boyd K. Packer of the Council of the Twelve. After praying for inspiration and guidance, a regional representative and I began interviewing several brethren whom the stake president and his counselors had arranged for us to meet.<br><br>As we interviewed a ward Young Men president, a very warm and impressive feeling came into both my heart and the heart of the regional representative. The confirmation of the Spirit was clear and unmistakable that this man was to be the next stake president.<br><br>After interviewing his wife and extending the call to him, we gave him some time to prayerfully select his counselors. The next morning we presented their names to the entire congregation. The voting was unanimous in the affirmative. We call this the law of common consent. This was not a majority vote as part of a democratic political process but rather a physical manifestation signified by the raised hand that each and every member of that congregation believed "that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands by those who are in authority, to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof" (Articles of Faith 1:5).<br><br>The outgoing stake presidency were all professional men with a combined experience of more than two dozen years serving in a stake presidency. They were in their mid-fifties, men of wisdom and sound judgment and experience. They were replaced by men in their early forties with no experience at all in a stake presidency, but it was readily apparent from the outpouring of love and support they received that the members of that particular stake fully realized that the Church is organized "for the perfecting of the saints" (Ephesians 4:11–12). "The Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind" (D&amp;amp;C 64:34), and these three men and their eternal companions had met that test by "yielding their hearts unto God" (Helaman 3:35).<br><br>Those called to work in the Primary nursery, on the ward newsletter, in the library, as Scoutmasters and Laurel advisors, as ward organists and choir directors also demonstrate by their actions that they have yielded "their hearts unto God."<br><br>The Lord in his infinite wisdom calls his servants through divine inspiration. Sometimes those servants are fishermen and carpenters, and sometimes they are lawyers and doctors. Sometimes the most obvious man in the ward is<i>not</i>called to be the bishop so that he may continue learning humility, and the one who<i>is</i>called may become perfected enough to receive inspiration and guidance for the entire ward.<br><h2><b>Oliver Cowdery</b></h2><br>When called upon to sustain someone who appears to be less qualified than ourselves, there may sometimes be an inclination to follow the course of Oliver Cowdery in eventually looking down upon a leader less educated than we are.<br><br>In October 1834 Oliver eloquently recounted the great spiritual experience he had while serving as Joseph's scribe:<br><br><i>These were days never to be forgotten--to sit under the sound of a voice dictated by the</i>inspiration<i>of heaven, awakened the utmost gratitude of this bosom! Day after day I continued, uninterrupted, to write from his mouth, as he translated with the</i>Urim and Thummim ...<i>the history, or record, called "The book of Mormon."</i>[<i>Messenger and Advocate</i>1:14; emphasis in original]<br><br>Oliver then referred to the ecstatic joy that filled their hearts as the resurrected John the Baptist conferred the Aaronic Priesthood upon Joseph and himself (ibid., pp. 15–16).<br><br>Joseph's confidence in and reliance upon Oliver is reflected by the fact that in February 1835, the Prophet invited Oliver to give the newly called Council of the Twelve their apostolic charge. Among other excellent counsel, Oliver admonished them to "cultivate great humility; for I know the pride of the human heart" (<i>HC</i>2:195).<br><br>In April 1836 Oliver was in the Kirtland Temple with the Prophet when they "saw the Lord standing upon the breastwork of the pulpit" (D&amp;amp;C 110:1). Moses, Elias, and Elijah subsequently restored priesthood keys to them. But not long after, Oliver committed some serious transgressions and lost the Spirit of the Lord. He failed to attend to the responsibilities of his calling and began persecuting the Brethren and defaming the character of the Prophet Joseph (see<i>HC</i>3:16–17).<br><br>In April 1838 Oliver was invited to appear before a disciplinary council to be tried for his membership in the Church. Among the charges was the allegation that he had persecuted the Brethren through urging lawsuits against them. It was also alleged that he had defamed the character of the Prophet and that he had treated "the Church with contempt by not attending meetings." It was further alleged that he had forsaken his calling "appointed him by revelation, for the sake of filthy lucre, and turning to the practice of law" (<i>HC</i>3:16–17).<br><br>Oliver refused to attend the disciplinary council and to face his brethren, but he did send a letter to Bishop Edward Partridge in response to the charges made against him. Note the change in this man who, in humbler days, had enthusiastically served as the Prophet's scribe. Note the justification of his behavior and his arrogant attitude as he wrote the following:<br><br><i>My venerable ancestor was among the little band, who landed on the rocks of Plymouth in 1620--with him he brought those maxims, and a body of those laws which were the result and experience of many centuries, on the basis of which now stands our great and happy government; and they are so interwoven in my nature, have so long been inculcated into my mind by a liberal and intelligent ancestry that I am wholly unwilling to exchange them for anything less liberal, less benevolent, or less free. ...</i><br><br><i>This attempt to control me in my temporal interests, I conceive to be a disposition to take from me a portion of my Constitutional privileges and inherent right--I only, respectfully, ask leave, therefore, to withdraw from a society assuming they have such right.</i>[<i>HC</i>3:18]<br><br>Oliver had been a man of great native intellect, of eloquent speech, of unflinching loyalty to the Prophet as he served as second elder of the Church and later as assistant president of the Church. And now he had thrown it all away because he refused to accept the counsel of others.<br><h2><b>Safety in Counsel</b></h2><br>We would do well to remember a great principle taught in Proverbs: "Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellors there is safety" (Proverbs 11:14). It generally takes longer to make a decision when several people are involved than when we make a decision alone. But when others are involved, they serve as an error-correction mechanism. Others see the blind spots that elude our own view of the vicissitudes of a given problem.<br><br>We gain valuable insight from the book of Abraham with regard to the council held to discuss the creation of the earth:<br><br><i>And the Gods took counsel</i>among themselves<i>and said: Let us go down and form man in our image, after our likeness. ...</i><br><br><i>And the Gods said among themselves: On the seventh time</i>we<i>will end</i>our<i>work, which</i>we<i>have counseled; and</i>we<i>will rest on the seventh time from all</i>our<i>work which</i>we<i>have counseled.</i>[Abraham 4:26, 5:2; emphasis added]<br><br>Notwithstanding his omniscience and omnipotence, our Heavenly Father counseled with the other gods. Can we as mortal women and men do any less than to counsel with those around us, with our children, with our spouses, and with all those with whom we labor in the Church?<br><br>The law of common consent is part of the invisible glue that binds members of the Church to their leaders. Wherever we happen to live, we may often be better prepared than those with whom we labor in the kingdom, and there may at times be an Oliver Cowdery inclination to reject the counsel of others. But as we are called to serve as counselors and on councils and on committees, it is good to remember the Lord's injunction to the presiding quorums of the Church that "every decision made by either of these quorums must be by the unanimous voice of the same [or] their decisions are not entitled to the same blessings" (D&amp;amp;C 107:27–29).<br><br>We may well be the brightest person in the bishopric or Young Women presidency or high council, but unless and until we subordinate our will to the law of common consent and are willing to receive counsel as well as to give counsel and are willing to concede and compromise and obtain consensus, then our potential influence for good will be greatly limited.<br><h2><b>He Must Increase, But I Must Decrease</b></h2><br>One of the paragon examples of one who yielded his heart unto Christ was John the Baptist. John was born into the world with a very special mission "to make ready a people prepared for the Lord" (Luke 1:17). As he reached manhood and began his ministry in the process of preparing the way, John acquired many devoted disciples of his own. In addition to baptizing them, he taught his disciples how to pray (see Luke 11:1) and the importance of fasting (see Matthew 9:14). In all of his teaching, however, John invariably pointed his disciples toward the coming of the Savior--such as when he told them:<br><br><i>I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.</i>[Matthew 3:11]<br><br>John clearly understood his mission as a forerunner to the redeemer of all mankind. After he had baptized the Savior, John continued teaching and baptizing (see John 3:23), and some of his disciples became very concerned that<i>others</i>were being baptized by the disciples of Jesus and they were beginning to follow the Savior (see John 3:23–26, 4:1–2).<br><br>The meekness and humility of John the Baptist and his unqualified devotion to the Savior are reflected in his spiritually mature response to his overly concerned followers:<i>"He</i>must increase, but<i>I</i>must decrease" (John 3:30; emphasis added). And so it is in each of our lives. If we are to become true disciples of the Savior,<i>he</i>must increase, but<i>we</i>must decrease.<br><br>A few months ago I flew to Sacramento with Elder Henry B. Eyring. We hadn't planned to fly on the same plane--it just turned out that way. Our stake conference assignments were in similar areas. His seat was behind mine. A little girl about ten years old said to him, "Excuse me, sir. That's a window seat. It's mine."<br><br>As she took her seat, this humble apostle with a string of degrees and other accolades said, "What's your name, my dear?"<br><br>She answered, "My name is Sarah."<br><br>And he said, "Hi, I'm Hal."<br><br>I could have heard the words "I'm Luke" or "I'm James" ringing in my ears.<br><h2><b>Becoming Prisoners of Christ</b></h2><br>You will recall that it was the young Saul of Tarsus who looked after the clothes of those involved in the stoning of Stephen (see Acts 7:58). Thereafter Saul pursued a zealous career of making "havock of the church," frequently punishing the Saints "in every synagogue" and assenting to their imprisonment and death (Acts 8:3, 26:10–11). His fanatical "threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord" struck great fear in the hearts of the Saints of the Church (Acts 9:1).<br><br>And then, on the road to Damascus, he had a very dramatic spiritual experience that would forever change his life. He later wrote to the Galatians that after his conversion he went into the Arabian desert, and "then after three years" he finally "went up to Jerusalem to see Peter," who was the head of the Church (Galatians 1:16–18).<br><br>As Saul of Tarsus began his mission, he changed his name to Paul and turned his life to Christ. On several different occasions the apostle Paul referred to himself as a "prisoner" of Christ (see Ephesians 3:1, 4:1; 2 Timothy 1:8; Philemon 1<b>,</b>9, 23). Once he had made the decision to serve the Lord, that decision was irrevocable.<br><br>Paul's frequent use of the term<i>prisoner</i>of Christ is very significant, for he was very familiar with prisons and prisoners. Before his conversion he had personally sent numerous Saints to prison (see Acts 26:10), and after his conversion he himself had been forcibly committed to prison (see Acts 23:10–11, 28:17–18). He had observed firsthand the restricted latitude of free will in the lives of other prisoners and had experienced this confinement in his own life when imprisoned.<br><br>Thus, when Paul confessed that<i>he</i>had become a willing prisoner of Christ, he disclosed that he had willingly chosen to use his moral agency to do only the will of the Lord. In doing so, he unraveled the mystery of the Savior's paradoxical promise that "he that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it" (Matthew 10:39). Those who willingly become prisoners of Christ "shall know the truth, and the truth shall make [them] free" (John 8:32). Those who resist becoming prisoners of Christ shall hear the truth, and the truth shall make them mad.<br><br>As Paul became Christ's prisoner, his life began to more closely approximate the Savior's life. His relationship with Christ became more like the Savior's relationship with<i>his</i>Father. A myriad of scriptures could be cited to describe this relationship between father and son, but let us review only a few of them in headline form.<br><br>At the pool of Bethesda, after healing the man who had suffered an infirmity for thirty-eight years, the Savior humbly declared: "The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do" (John 5:19). He later added: "I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me" (John 5:30).<br><br>After forgiving the woman taken in adultery, the Savior reiterated that "I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me. ... I do always those things that please him" (John 8:28–29; see also John 4:34, 6:38, 7:17).<br><br>The prophet Abinadi foresaw the Savior's earthly ministry, during which time he would "be led, crucified, and slain, the flesh becoming subject even unto death,<i>the will of the Son being swallowed up in the will of the Father"</i>(Mosiah 15:7; emphasis added). What an eloquent description of what it means to be truly obedient: "the will of the Son being swallowed up in the will of the Father."<br><br>And then that fateful hour arrived as the Savior began to atone for our sins in the Garden of Gethsemane. The weight of your sins and mine caused him to bleed from every pore and moved him to plead: "Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me:<i>nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done"</i>(Luke 22:42; emphasis added).<br><br>Inherent in each of these scriptures, and in countless others, is the fact that the Savior's entire life reflected his humility and meekness in subordinating his will to the will of his Father.<br><h2><b>Charles C. Rich</b></h2><br>The spirit of "thy will be done" was strongly reflected in the life of Elder Charles C. Rich. Brother Rich was ordained an apostle in 1849 at the age of thirty-nine after serving as a general in the Mormon Battalion. Two years later Elder Rich was called to settle San Bernardino, California. Then, in 1863, President Brigham Young asked Elder Rich to establish a settlement in the Bear Lake Valley in what is now southeastern Idaho.<br><br>In June of 1864 the entire Rich family joined a band of nearly a thousand residents at Bear Lake and began constructing log houses with roofs made up of "a layer of willow branches, then a covering of straw topped off with thick sod" (Leonard J. Arrington,<i>Charles C</i>.<i>Rich</i>[Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1974], p. 259). That first summer Brother Rich proposed that the Saints celebrate the Fourth of July in grand style with a homemade flag, a little brass band, and lots of dancing (see p. 261).<br><br>But the joy of the occasion was short-lived. The very next day frost killed the spring wheat and stunted the growing corn. The subsequent winter was bitter cold, and the potatoes and wheat froze because of lack of storage facilities. The John Clifton family grew so short of supplies that their children "were kept in bed to conserve their strength" (p. 263).<br><br>As the individual and collective misery of the Saints increased, murmuring began to emerge from their ranks. Some of the brethren asked for a meeting with Brother Rich to discuss the possibility of abandoning the settlement for a more hospitable environment elsewhere. Elder Rich, sensing their concerns even before they were expressed, rose to his feet and addressed those in attendance:<br><br><i>Brethren--in the fall of 1863 President Young called me into his office and said, "Brother Rich, I want you to go up to Bear Lake Valley and see if it can be opened for settlement; and if it can, I want that you should take a company there and settle it."</i><br><br><i>That was all I needed. It was a call. I came up here, with a few brethren; we looked over the valley; and, although the altitude was high, the snows heavy, and the frosts severe, there was plenty of water for irrigation purposes and plenty of fish in the lake and streams. So, with a company, I came here and settled with my family.</i><br><br><i>There have been many hardships. That I admit ... and these we have shared together. But if you want to go somewhere else, that is your right, and I do not want to deprive you of it. If you are of a mind to leave here, my blessing will go with you. But I must stay here, even if I stay alone. President Young called me here, and here I will remain till he releases me and gives me leave to go.</i>[Arrington,<i>Charles C. Rich,</i>p. 264]<br><br>Elder Charles C. Rich, Mormon general, Western frontiersman, apostle of the Lord, and prisoner of Jesus Christ, died nineteen years later in the Bear Lake Valley at Paris, Idaho, on November 17, 1883. He claimed the blessings of the Book of Mormon promised to those who yield "their hearts unto God" (Helaman 3:35).<br><h2><b>Heiko Masurek</b></h2><br>A contemporary prisoner of Christ is my good friend Heinz Konrad Masurek. Ten years ago Heiko, as he is called, was a young music student in Vienna during the time I was serving in the mission presidency in Austria. One day Heiko was walking down the streets of Vienna when a Book of Mormon street display caught his eye. His Latter-day Saint girlfriend had awakened in him some interest in the Church, so he stopped to talk with the missionaries, and they gave him a copy of the Book of Mormon. He began to read it and accepted the missionary discussions; eventually he was baptized.<br><br>Shortly after his baptism he moved back to Germany to accept a position in a symphony orchestra and a job teaching in a music school. I was concerned that this new convert might get lost in the shuffle of moving to a new ward in a new country so shortly after baptism. I knew Heiko's new stake president since the days when I served in Germany as a young missionary, so I called President Ulrich Rueckauer and asked him if he could give Heiko some special attention to assure that he remained active in the Church.<br><br>A few weeks later this caring stake president invited Heiko to make a three-hour train trip to Stuttgart to share his conversion story in a Saturday afternoon stake priesthood leadership meeting. Heiko accepted the invitation with considerable fear and trepidation.<br><br>He had never spoken to a large audience before, so the evening prior to his appointed speech he spent a rather sleepless night tossing and turning. When the alarm clock finally rang, he turned it off and promised himself he would just sleep for a few more minutes and then get up. But he was so exhausted from his fitful night's sleep that he awoke too late to catch the train for Stuttgart in time to arrive punctually at the stake center to give his talk.<br><br>He hurriedly dressed and called a taxi to take him to the small airport outside of town, and, although he was a financially struggling musician, he chartered a small plane to fly him to Stuttgart. The cost of the flight was 900 deutsche marks, or about $450. Upon landing, he checked on the bus schedule into the city, and it was immediately clear that the bus made too many stops along the way for him to arrive at the stake center in time. So, although the taxi fare for the twenty-mile trip was another forty dollars, he hired a cab and headed for Stuttgart.<br><br>President Rueckauer called me in Vienna after the meeting and described how Heiko had arrived all out of breath just ten minutes after the meeting had begun. But he gave a marvelous and inspiring talk, and all in attendance were grateful for the sacrifice he had made to attend.<br><br>Several months later Heiko came to visit us in Vienna, and we asked him to recount his experience of chartering the small plane to Stuttgart in order to attend the meeting on time. After he rehearsed the details, I asked him: "Heiko, why didn't you just call up President Rueckauer and tell him you would not be able to make it to the meeting and that you would be willing to speak on some future occasion?"<br><br>Heiko looked at me almost indignantly as he said: "When the missionaries taught me the gospel, they explained the importance of commitments and of covenants, and they said that when we make a promise to the Lord or to one of his servants, we are expected to keep our commitment."<br><br>Heiko, Elder Charles C. Rich, the apostle Paul, John the Baptist, and Rex E. Lee share a commitment in common with the ancient Nephites, who became purified and sanctified because they yielded their hearts unto God.<br><br>Robert Robinson and John Wyeth have aptly captured the essence of yielding our hearts unto God in that grand old hymn "Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing," which will now be performed by the BYU Symphony and combined choruses under the direction of Professor Mack Wilberg:<br><br><i>O to grace how great a debtor</i><br><i>Daily I'm constrained to be!</i><br><i>Let thy goodness, as a fetter,</i><br><i>Bind my wandering heart to thee.</i><br><i>Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,</i><br><i>Prone to leave the God I love;</i><br><i>Here's my heart, O take and seal it;</i><br><i>Seal it for thy courts above.</i><br>["Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing,"<i>Hymns,</i>1948, no. 70]<br><br>I pray that each of us may live our lives in the spirit of "not my will, but<i>thine,</i>be done," which the Savior exemplified throughout his earthly ministry, that we, too, may yield our hearts to God. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Spencer J. Condie was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 22 August 1995.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>ome, Ye Saints” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I welcome the BYU community this morning as we begin another school year. I especially welcome those who are new among us. In many searches and circumstances, we have prayed you here, just as you have prayed about coming here.<br><br>We who gather today in the Marriott Center are the largest part, but not the entirety, of the BYU community, whose members and influence now stretch into a far-flung empire that serves and blesses much of the earth. One evening a few months ago I spoke by phone to Noel Reynolds, who was participating in a conference of scholars on the Dead Sea Scrolls at the BYU Jerusalem Center. One of my children interrupted to tell me that Phillip Smith of the BYU--Hawaii faculty was calling on the other line. As I put Noel on hold long enough to tell Phil I would call him back, I realized that the easternmost and westernmost outposts of Brigham Young University had just come together "live," right there in my Orem telephone lines. I verified with my two callers that the sun was just going down in Hawaii as it was just coming up in Israel. And then it hit me: the sun never sets on the Cougar Kingdom!<br><br>With that note on the breadth of life at BYU, may I describe a recent morning when I sensed some heights of life at BYU. On the morning of June 21, I welcomed the Institute of Applied Statistics to our campus. Those number crunchers were ecstatic to be meeting at the nation's largest private, church-related university on the longest day of the year, the warmest June 21st in 23 years, following the wettest Utah May in 17 years. They quivered with delight to discover that the Talmage Building has 130,893 square feet and that the BYU campus has 638 acres, 482 buildings, and 399 miles of sidewalks. They loved learning that the BYU Statistics Department has done a special study on skiing accidents to help those who come to Utah for the 2002 Winter Olympics. According to these statistically valid data, most skiers who break their legs on Utah slopes do so on the last run of the day.<br><br>As I left the statisticians to go to my office that morning, I saw Hugh Nibley walking toward me near the ASB parking lot. Suddenly he stopped walking, turned around, and began looking intently northward. The inimitable Nibley removed his sunglasses, tipped back his canvas hat, and stood transfixed, as though his eyes drank in a vision. Then I saw what had stopped him--and an aesthetic and spiritual view of BYU replaced the statistical one. A clearing storm and rising sun had left a ring of heavy, low clouds around the neck of Mt. Timpanogos, like a richly flowered lei. The familiar Timp skyline poked above the clouds, glistening in the sunlight with a light layer of fresh snow, the white peaks contrasting brilliantly with the blue sky and the full green foreground. I stopped, too, looking not just at Timp but at Hugh Nibley looking at Timp. No matter how many hundreds of times he had seen that mountain, no matter how full his head from his latest reading and his always brimming stream of consciousness, Hugh looked up longingly at Timp. He doesn't take it for granted. For Nibley, Timp is like a wonderful poem or painting or scripture or trip to the temple--always revealing new meaning and new inspiration to those who probe its depths. Elizabeth Barrett Browning's lines apply with special force to life at BYU:<br><br><i>Earth's crammed with heaven,</i><br><i>And every common bush afire with God;</i><br><i>But only he who sees takes off his shoes;</i><br><i>The rest sit round it and pluck blackberries</i>.<br>[<i>Aurora Leigh,</i>book 7, lines 820–23]<br><br>We have been trying to combine both statistical and spiritual perspectives on BYU during this past year's work on the self-study. We are reviewing the university at two levels simultaneously: a study of each department, both academic and academic support; and a large-scale institutional evaluation. We have done some of this work to satisfy the 10-year requirements of our regional accrediting association, but much of it we have imposed upon ourselves, trying to build a better BYU. The project has four purposes: (1) to enable a fresh and complete dialogue about the purpose and the performance of each program or activity and of the entire university; (2) to clarify our priorities and make our resource allocations more closely reflect those priorities; (3) to create a set of tools that enable future improvement and increased accountability; and (4) to involve the entire BYU community with the Board of Trustees in shaping and defining BYU's future destiny. If the Church of the 21st century can have only one university, what should it look like?<br><br>I have been at once elated and sobered by the amount of time and energy so many of you have given to the self-study. I have never seen better committee work or better cross-campus collaboration. The members of the campus community also showed their good faith by willingly accepting, as premises for their reasoning, the constraints and guidelines established by the Board and the administration before the study began. The net result is the most thoughtful analysis of our work at BYU in a long time. With the wonderful side benefit of a renewed sense of community and shared purposes.<br><br>We've all wondered how the coming change in the university's leadership will affect the self-study. After reviewing in detail the project's findings and current status, Commissioner Henry B. Eyring has encouraged us to keep moving on our original timetable, which calls for an initial set of recommendations to him by November. The Board of Trustees will then be involved before the accreditation report is submitted in early 1996. Because the self-study is more a process than an event, much of what is being done now will have its greatest influence next year and beyond. Elder Eyring will discuss the self-study further tomorrow in the meetings for all faculty and for all administrators and staff personnel who have been involved in it.<br><br>One reason why the self-study can simply keep moving is that it was always intended to be a project for the entire community. Administrators come and go, but the Board, the faculty, and the staff at BYU enjoy ongoing continuity. Thus the process has tried to maximize openness and participation. We seek a shared vision for BYU that is analyzed and informed by the community, shaped by the administration, then further shaped and guided by the Board.<br><br>As the multiple components of the self-study have started coming together, several university-wide themes are emerging. Unlike the sage who observed that an administrator is a solution in search of a problem, our institutional committees have explored both diagnosis and prescription possibilities regarding several strategic issues. Before the administration decides what it should propose to the Board, we need to hear the community's responses to the diagnoses and prescriptions the committees are proposing. Tomorrow you will have an opportunity for that, and we welcome your direct written observations as well. Today I will emphasize several institutional themes that are coming into focus, and tomorrow you will hear more detailed impressions.<br><br>In what follows I will draw upon numerous data sources developed in the past year. Our able institutional task committees have developed very sophisticated research designs and conducted a long list of rigorous empirical studies among every relevant population in the BYU community, within and beyond the campus. To take a couple of examples, these research reports include the "University Values Survey," which analyzes the relative importance assigned by the faculty and other BYU personnel to 99 possible university goals--comparing how we "ought" to pursue each goal with how we actually "are" pursuing it; an exhaustive survey of 11,000 recent BYU alumni, which yielded a return rate above 70 percent; and a comprehensive study of student perspectives called "The Student Experience."<br><br>In general, the aggregation of this data reveals a university that is remarkably robust and healthy. Nonetheless, some change is needed. I will note seven institutional themes, devoting more time to some than to others.<br><br>First, the data show an incredibly high level of agreement among all of the university's constituents that BYU's most important purpose, and its most distinctive characteristic, is to nurture an educational environment based on the integration of both spiritual and academic values. Given the priority of that widely shared premise, it is most heartening to discover that an overwhelming percentage of students, faculty, staff, alumni, and Church members all find that, in general, the university is effectively fulfilling this high aspiration. These are not trivial findings in a day when American higher education is being buffeted to an unprecedented degree by philosophical confusion and dwindling public support.<br><br>However, our Committee on the External Environment tells us that certain forces will increasingly threaten our ability to pursue this unique and successful mission. Because of a disturbing pattern of social deterioration and moral permissiveness, combined with a trend toward secular sameness throughout higher education, we can expect less tolerance for religious explanations of BYU's distinctiveness. This puts a premium on our ability to perform with unarguable competence. Only if we demonstrate clear professional soundness can we defend our religiously based approach against ever less tolerant critics. As Elder Neal Maxwell once said, we cannot let the world condemn our value system by pointing to our professional mediocrity. To the extent that BYU people respond favorably to this challenge, the coming environment will not only tolerate us--many in that environment will look to us for both moral and intellectual leadership in American and international society. It will be a time of great opportunity for us, and I believe we will be equal to it.<br><br>This theme of an integrated spiritual and academic learning environment does produce some challenges on the campus. Our Combined Surveys Analysis Committee found that this theme engenders strong feelings, not because some care about it and others don't, but precisely because everyone cares about it so much. On closer analysis, the Committee reported the rich insight that, although BYU faculty differ among themselves about the choice of<i>means</i>to achieve religious development and the integration of spiritual and academic goals, the faculty do not differ about the important of the ultimately religious<i>ends</i>for which the university exists. There is stunningly broad agreement that BYU's most important specific goals are to develop students who behave ethically, who serve God and their fellow beings, and who have strong testimonies of the restored gospel. But people choose various ways of achieving these goals, leading not only to a variety of approaches but also to deep concerns among some about the methods used by others.<br><br>I find great reassurance in these insights. Ours is not a community that is divided about its loyalties. It is, rather, a community of sometimes diverse opinions about how best to fulfill our deeply shared loyalties to the Lord, his Church, and our students. It helps me to realize that differing approaches to shared ends will produce occasional tensions. Those tensions are healthy--even needed, when handled properly--in part because not all students respond well to the same approach.<br><br>For example, I know a BYU student who is struggling to gain a testimony of the gospel. It bothers him when some of his 19-year-old peers glibly begin speaking the language of testimony and missionary enthusiasm as if they were performing a role in a play. He and I both know a few returned missionaries who played the missionary role for a time, then came home and stepped out of their roles as effortlessly as they had stepped into them. Integrity is a crucial issue in developing an authentic, rather than a superficial, belief structure. I am haunted by a little boy's question to his grandfather: "Was that a true story, Grandpa, or were you just preaching?" Each of our students must come to know through honest and genuine experience that the Restoration really is "a true story" and not just "preaching" or role playing.<br><br>At the same time, the desire for integrity in testimony can go so far that it demands more certainty and more advance explanations than may be possible in a mortal sphere where we walk by faith and not by sight. That is why a teacher who, in the name of integrity, delights in publicly expressing his doubts or challenging Church authority can undermine the development of students' religious faith. Alma taught us that we<i>cannot</i>know the truth of his words to complete certainty before we take the long walk--sometimes the leap--of faith. So how can we help each BYU student develop spiritual integrity in an attitude of faith? The best answer just might vary with the individual student and with the distinctive experience each of us brings to the teaching task.<br><br>A teacher who wants to encourage a student to be more believing may emphasize the need to trust authority; a teacher who wants to emphasize students' responsibility for their own learning may encourage a student to ask probing questions. One person's approach can seem wrongheaded to those who take a different approach. When that happens, let us not dogmatically condemn another teacher's choice of<i>means</i>to the ends we all share. We might even consider the strengths of the other person's approach as we adapt our advice to the needs of an individual student. Our tolerance for differing means should, of course, stay within boundaries that affirm professional civility and reinforce the divinity of the Lord's church. But we would do well to avoid leaping to conclusions about the methods and motives of our colleagues on many professional as well as religious questions, large and small. For instance, we should be just as skeptical about the claimed influence of anonymous letter to Salt Lake City alleging antispiritual attitudes at BYU as we are about the claims of anonymous letters to the faculty alleging antiintellectual attitudes in remodeling the Bookstore.<br><br>A second major theme from the self-study is that the spiritual and educational welfare of BYU students is clearly the number one concern of the faculty and the staff. Of all the goal categories in the values survey, our community ranks the cluster dealing with<i>students</i>well ahead of all other categories. And the good news is that the students themselves are, on the whole, quite satisfied with their BYU education in both its spiritual and academic dimensions. Recent empirical studies also show that a BYU education has strong positive effects, not only on our students' prospects for employment and graduate studies, but also on their future Church commitments and activity.<br><br>However, our research tells us that we have serious shortcomings in how we respond to particular student needs. For example, The Student Experience Committee report found considerable student disappointment, and it found two common causes for many student problems: (1) a lack of real relationships with faculty and (2) impersonal treatment by campus entities. Particularly for freshmen, this and other studies demonstrate that classes are too often taught by graduate students, many classes are too large, and large classes are statistically related to excessively high rates of dropout and nonattendance. Moreover, our approach to both academic and career advisement needs major renovations, including special attention to advisement for women students.<br><br>In addition, the university has given inadequate attention to defining and evaluating its intended educational aspirations--not just academic outcomes, but all that we expect our students to gain from a BYU education. Last winter we introduced a draft document entitled "The Aims of a BYU Education," which was widely discussed and then revised. A final version of this statement has now been warmly endorsed by the Board of Trustees as an important instrument of university policy--but it won't mean a thing if it is left in drawers or three-ring binders. We must find ways to bring the spirit and the substance of that eloquent statement to life in the experience of every student, every faculty member, and all others in the BYU community.<br><br>Measured against those specific aspirations, we already know that we are falling short in teaching students the attitudes and skills that energize lifelong learning and that instill a mind-set of public service and a sense of obligation to society. The data reported by many faculty also underscore the need to strengthen our students' communications skills, especially in writing.<br><br>Interestingly, the third major theme is related to the second: members of the BYU community generally sense that we should pay more attention to teaching. Ours is a strong teaching university that values the scholarly and creative work of its faculty. Still, simply because this community values teaching so highly, the self-study is identifying a number of ways to become even stronger. For example, most faculty believe that teaching is insufficiently rewarded here, partly because we need to do a better job of evaluating teaching quality.<br><br>In addition, I hear a growing consensus that BYU simply must give careers in teaching a more honored place in the eyes of our students and the public--not only because we must replace 60 percent of our own faculty due to retirements and attrition in the next 10 years, but also because the nation's public school system simply cries out for us to provide that system with more imaginative and energetic support. It may be time for BYU to consider a new, institution-wide emphasis on teacher education. The nation hungers for better schools, the Church has a rich tradition of service-oriented teaching, and BYU was historically a teachers college--a "normal" college. Years ago David O. McKay believed that when the day came that BYU could not admit all the Church members who would want to study here, the university should train more and better school teachers with the unique vision of a BYU education so they could pass that vision along to an ever-widening circle of students.<br><br>One hears echoes of concern about teaching throughout American higher education these days. Many college and university leaders now acknowledge that typical PhD programs focus so single-mindedly on honing research skills that they make little serious effort to help prospective university faculty learn how to teach--even though most PhD students enter their programs to become college-level teachers. The Faculty Center at BYU has undertaken a successful orientation program for new faculty here, but we could do far more to provide intensive, substantial training for new faculty, not only for the profession of college teaching, but also to transmit BYU's unique educational vision. In addition, our Task Committee on Educational Technology tells us that we must undertake new measures to clarify the place of technology in teaching and to increase our support for promising technology-based innovations.<br><br>To emphasize teaching is not to deemphasize the importance of scholarship. Indeed, as one BYU task committee has written, "Rewards for teaching excellence not rooted in scholarship would be meaningless, [even] counterproductive." Still, the committee found that "if we want good teaching, we have to evaluate and reward it at least as conscientiously as we do research or creative work and citizenship. We are not doing that currently." With better evaluation we can "give teaching its proper place in the value structure of the university."<br><br>A fourth theme deals with issues of university governance and communication. Our task committees have found some faculty and staff concern about inadequate participation in campus decision making. The Combined Surveys Analysis Committee offered the insight that those registering this concern are not necessarily asking for greater roles in governance; they mostly want better two-way communication with administrators based on a foundation of mutual understanding, candor, and trust.<br><br>Some of us in the administration have also at times felt a communications gap, which may be our perception of the same organizational distance that others sense. This is a complex organization, and the administration has needed better tools to understand departmental-level units well enough to provide well-informed support and accountability. We have also needed more of the small-scale settings and the foundation levels of information that foster mutual understanding.<br><br>Whatever else we may do to bring ourselves closer together, I have sensed that the self-study itself is revealing some promising possibilities. This process is enabling an unusually complete, candid, and fair-minded exchange on matters of substance and mutual importance. Support units and academic departments and colleges have fully articulated their aspirations and concerns, which are being reviewed by an independent self-study committee with extensive involvement by deans and university administrators. There will be more administration interaction with both academic and support units after the committee completes its recommendations. Our experience together is teaching us the value of better communication on matters both philosophical and programmatic. In addition, we are learning how a more rigorous program review process and increased databases can better inform all of our interaction. As suggested by the first theme I mentioned, we are blessed at BYU with a level of shared educational vision that cannot possibly be matched at any other university this size. In Leo Tolstoy's phrase, we enjoy the "spirit of the army" (see Hafen, <a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/bruce-c-hafen_spirit-army/"><span style="color: #33cccc;">"Spirit of the Army,"</span></a> in the 1994 Annual University Conference addresses). On that natural foundation, surely we can find ways to keep alive the spirit of the self-study, which can be one way of bringing this large and busy campus closer together.<br><br>I will mention only briefly two other emerging themes, because our colleagues will talk more about them tomorrow. The fifth theme is that we are overloading the faculty. This issue has two different dimensions--(1) trying to do too much and (2) lacking focus in setting priorities and allocating resources. This is an important problem because it especially affects how the university allocates the precious resource of faculty time. Faculty frustrations in this area can aggravate normal tensions over teaching versus research issues and can make faculty feel they don't have time for students. A sense of overload can also contribute to the impression that the university is sending mixed messages, at times appearing to aspire to more than it is willing to pay for.<br><br>The theme of the overextended faculty is related to an occasional lack of clarity in academic programs and sometimes in what a department, or the university, expects of an individual faculty member. One of the chief values of the self-study process is that its evaluation phase is identifying gaps and ambiguities that can be remedied by simplifying, prioritizing, and refocusing in academic programs. In addition, two institutional committees are recommending ideas that will help us define individual faculty roles and rewards in new ways.<br><br>As a sixth theme, the self-study shows some evidence of emerging tensions between the loyalties that faculty feel to their academic disciplines/departments and the loyalties they feel toward BYU as an institution. In his book The Academic Revolution, David Riesman argues that university faculties are generally shifting their loyalties away from their institutions and toward their disciplines, a potentially dangerous development for students and for campus coherence. BYU faculty have always felt an unusual degree of allegiance to this campus, but as our academic stature has increased, we have encouraged our faculty to earn the respect of their disciplinary peers. That respect remains crucial, but it should not trump institutional claims lest we undermine the university's overriding commitments to religious education, general education, interdisciplinary work, and BYU's distinctive educational mission.<br><br>A seventh, rather specific theme has arisen within the strategic concern of how BYU's unique resources can bless the Church. The Church needs BYU people who can do quality scholarly wok on a variety of important religious subjects. To frame the issues under this heading, the Board of Trustees recently approved a general policy indicating that BYU faculty, including those outside Religious Education, may undertake controlled amounts of Church-related scholarship with appropriate forms of approval and peer review. The Board also authorized the creation of an on-campus coordinating body on religious scholarship, along with creating a clarified partnership between BYU and the independent Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS).<br><br>I've not said much about themes relating to the academic support areas of the university because those evaluations are not yet in, having been designed to follow the academic reports. However, we are already seeing the need to clarify a number of departmental roles in the support areas as we compare original purposes with contemporary needs. In addition, we need to clarify how staff and administrative personnel may more efficiently exercise appropriately delegated authority. We will continue to share impressions about these and related topics.<br><br>Speaking more generally now, I began with a couple of images in my mosaic of memories from the year just past. I'd like to share four more such images. I think of a group of several hundred thoughtful educators I met in Zurich, Switzerland, who are concerned about the deterioration of the social, intellectual, and moral fabric in Western society. When they learned about Brigham Young University, with 1,500 faculty and nearly 30,000 bright and able students who live drug-free lives of integrity, chastity, and rigorous intellectual and spiritual development, one of them asked in a voice near tears, "Is there really such a place? Are there really 30,000 students in one place who freely choose to live and learn that way? Such a place fulfills my dream for the ideal education, for it builds the ideal society."<br><br>I think next of a moment last spring in an advisory board meeting in New York City for a group of scholars interested in issues of religion and society in the United States and beyond. A noted religious and intellectual leader unexpectedly asked if I would tell the group "what is new these days among the Mormons." He explained that he was asking this question because he realizes increasingly that, compared to other American religious groups, the Mormons are becoming what he called "major players," a growing Church with "great vitality." Others in the group commented on the growing influence they see across the country from faithful and able Mormon scholars, mostly from the BYU faculty. They also displayed an astute understanding of the spectrum that ranges from Mormon scholars who are faithful to their Church to those who are uncomfortable with their Church--a phenomenon they have commonly seen in other religious groups. They continued with serious but sincere questions, wondering why we do missionary work in Latin America and how our leaders are chosen. It became very clear to me that these sophisticated people knew more about us than we might assume. And they take BYU very seriously, urging our help in addressing the social and religious issues of the day. To them, this university is coming of age, both intellectually and spiritually--and it s doing so not in spite of our serious religious commitments, but precisely because of them.<br><br>Then I recall the picture of Rex Lee presiding recently at his last BYU commencement. He doesn't want any of us to start a good-bye party now that lasts four months, but I won't have a better opportunity than today to thank him and Janet for teaching me by the power of their example how to deal gracefully with adversity. Their lives these past few years capture what I would call "grace under pressure."<br><br>In the sport of diving, a diver is judged not only by his or her overall execution, but by the difficulty of the particular dive. The responsibilities Rex has carried these past six years would never be easy, but under the physical constraints he has faced, the difficulty quotient kept ratcheting upward until his was one really tough dive. Yet he has done it with exquisite grace. I have known Rex Lee at close range for a long time, and I've never known anyone who was more cheerful and more patient in the midst of aggravating and sometimes agonizing afflictions. And what I have learned in watching him is that his patience and cheerfulness have invited the Lord's strength into his life.<br><br>In the 24th chapter of Mosiah we read the story of Alma and his people, who were in bondage to the wicked Amulon. Because Alma's people could not fight back, they cried to God in their hearts for deliverance. The voice of the Lord came to them, promising that, because of their covenants with him, the Lord would "ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs . . . that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions." As Alma and his people responded faithfully, we read, "The Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord" (Mosiah 24:14–15). Eventually the Lord delivered them from their bondage.<br><br>President Lee has had the same experience as did Alma and his people: when we are graceful in affliction, submitting "cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord," then God is graceful too--and his grace gladly bears up against all the pressure there is.<br><br>Finally, let us consider Alma's story in a more general application to life at BYU. Before going to bed one night last week, I picked up my current late-night reading, which is Orson F. Whitney's biography of Heber C. Kimball. I read there a quotation from D&amp;amp;C 45:66-67 about the New Jerusalem, called Zion: "a land of peace, a city of refuge, a place of safety for the saints of the Most High God; And the glory of the Lord shall be there." And then I went to sleep. Just before five the next morning, I awoke to find so many thoughts in my mind that I couldn't go back to sleep. I got up and wrote down a few ideas, hoping vainly that I could then return to sleep.<br><br>The thread of these ideas was that Mosiah 24 is not only a story about patience in adversity--it is also a story about what happens to all the people who come fully to Christ through his atonement and thereby enjoy the influence of his presence in this life. As the Lord told the early Saints, "I am in your midst and ye cannot see me" (D&amp;amp;C 38:7). The sacrament prayer promises that if we are faithful and always remember him, we may always have his spirit to be "with" us. The people who have this experience are the Saints of the Most High God. Then these words began running through my mind, so familiar, but with a meaning I never knew before:<br><br><i>Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor fear;</i><br><i>But with joy wend your way.</i><br><i>Though hard to you this journey may appear,</i><br><i>Grace shall be as your day.</i><br>["Come, Come, Ye Saints,"<i>Hymns</i>, 1985, no. 30]<br><br>Perhaps this means, come, ye Saints, all ye that are heavy laden, come to the Savior of Mankind; keep your covenants with him, and he will carry not only the burden of your sins--he will also ease the burdens of your hardest toil and labor "that even you cannot feel them upon your backs." Then you will wend your way with the joy that Adam and Eve discovered when they embraced the covenants of the Atonement amid the burdens of the lone and dreary world. Even called it "the joy of our redemption" (see Moses 5:10–11).<br><br>And though the journey of mortality can sometimes be very hard, grace shall be as your day--meaning, in Nephi's words, "it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do" (2 Nephi 25:23). Thus the Lord's grace extends further as our individual days grow longer, and harder. If we are faithful he will give us whatever the "day" of our personal circumstances may require.<br><br>Then came another line from the song:<br><br><i>We then are free from toil and sorrow, too;</i><br><i>With the just we shall dwell!</i><br><br>Who are "the just"? All those whose uneven printed margins are "justified," made straight; those for whom Christ satisfied the demands of justice. They will inhabit the celestial kingdom, for, according to section 76, they are the "just" men and women who are "made perfect through Jesus" (D&amp;amp;C 76:69).<br><br>The verse continues:<br><br><i>But if our lives are spared again</i><br><i>To see the Saints their rest obtain,</i><br><i>Oh, how we'll make this chorus swell--</i><br><i>All is well! All is well!</i><br><br>How do the Saints obtain their "rest"? The prophet Mormon once spoke of "the peaceable followers of Christ [who] have obtained a sufficient hope [that they] can enter into the rest of the Lord" (Moroni 7:3). Joseph F. Smith described "the rest of the Lord" as a deep spiritual peace the Lord bestows on those Saints "who have set their eyes upon the mark of their high calling with an invincible determination in their hearts to be steadfast in the truth, and who are treading in humility and righteousness the path" of the "followers of Jesus Christ." The Lord's influence gives those who enter into his rest a tangible "spiritual contentment . . . here upon the earth, . . . now, today" (<i>Gospel Doctrine,</i>126–27).<br><br>We read in D&amp;amp;C 84 that Moses "sought diligently to sanctify his people. . . . But they hardened their hearts and could not endure his presence; therefore, the Lord . . . swore that they should not enter into his rest while in the wilderness, which rest is the fulness of his glory" (D&amp;amp;C 84:23–24). To see the Saints obtain their rest, then, is to see their "invincible determination" lead them into the influence of the Lord's presence.<br><br>Perhaps, in addition to being a memorable song of encouragement and hope for weary pioneers, "Come, Come, Ye Saints" is--like the story of Alma and his people in their bondage--also a song about the meaning of the Lord's gracious power in the adversity and toil of our lives. If so, it is also a song about the extraordinary blessing of living among a community of believers who yearn to enter the rest of the Lord.<br><br>God promised the Nephite people as a community that if they would keep his commandments, they would "prosper in the land." We ordinarily assume the word "prosper" in this context means material prosperity. I once heard Elder Marion D. Hanks offer an alternative interpretation; namely, that "prosper in the land" means being within the constant influence of the Lord's presence. He derives this interpretation from the Lord's phrasing of his promise: "Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land; but inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my presence" (2 Nephi 1:20). The Saints' faithfulness thus allows them to enter into his rest and to stay there.<br><br>I believe this promise extends to the Saints of the BYU community. When we so live that this community "prospers" in this sense, we are in the world but we are not of the world. We are no longer of the world because having the Lord's Spirit abide with us lifts us above the constraints of mortality, even as it strengthens us to endure the demands of mortality. As Alma's people found, God's influence makes our mortal burdens lighter. As Moses found when he entered God's presence, that holy environment replaces our myopic sense of time with the eternal perspective of Him for whom all things are present. And as Joseph F. Smith taught, the Lord blesses those who enter into his rest to be free from "unsettled, restless" feelings of mortal discouragement, "suspicion, unrest, [and] uncertainty" (<i>Gospel Doctrine,</i>126). In this condition of transcending our own mortality, we will have cast the influence of Satan from our midst as Moses did before regaining the Lord's presence. We will also be free from the spirit of contention, which cannot be where God is. Then we will know what Enos called "the joy of the saints" (Enos 1:3).<br><br>In some miraculous way, living this close to the Lord can transform our perspective and ultimately our nature. Perhaps this transformation is symbolized by our movement during mortality from the telestial to the terrestrial world, enabled by overcoming the adversary and increasing our obedience. We know this can happen to individuals. Can it happen to communities? Joseph and Brigham and Heber thought a community of faith made the transformation more likely because of the reinforcement made possible when people "love one another and never dissemble, But cease to do evil and ever be one" ("Now Let Us Rejoice,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 3). That is why the early Saints longed for Zion--"a land of peace, . . . a place of safety . . . ; And the glory [the presence] of the Lord shall be there" (D&amp;amp;C 45:66–67). Is it inconsistent to think of a university as such a place? No, for the Lord himself said, "I . . . am well pleased that there should be a school in Zion" (D&amp;amp;C 97:3).<br><br>Someone recommended recently that BYU should have a religious monument on the campus symbolizing our distinctive understanding of restored Christianity and our collective commitment that we will overcome the profane life and live the sacred life. But perhaps these 638 acres are already holy ground, and perhaps the Carillon Tower is already such a religious symbol. But only those who know the hourly song of the carillon bells take off their shoes; the rest just enjoy the music.<br><br>Each of us is under pressure. Some of us just can't do all that is expected of us, and as a result we don't live as we planned to and we are not always there for those who need us most. Some of us feel great financial pressure. Some of us are pressured by personal weaknesses, others by high-pressure people who tempt us or manipulate us. Some of us feel the pressure of children who disappoint us or spouses who have come to seem too distant from us. Especially in our university life we may feel the pressure of not performing well enough or, worse, performing well but being misjudged or otherwise not supported by those who supervise our work. The passing years may have brought us failing health or the loss of those we most loved. The self-study tells us about the pressures of being institutionally overcommitted without enough attention to students who need us or enough communication with colleagues who don't understand us.<br><br>May the song of the bells remind us of the Lord's promise to give us strength, insight, and grace under such pressures, easing the burdens that are placed on our shoulders. May we be like Hugh Nibley, feeling the reverence to lift our eyes to the hills or to take off our shoes on holy ground, thereby regaining perspective. May we be like the Lees and the people of Alma, submitting cheerfully and with patience to God's will. May our own religious lives reflect spiritual integrity in an attitude of faith so that our personal example can be our students' best teacher. We can live this way at BYU, for this is a school in Zion.<br><br>So when the carillon bells ring out across the campus at every hour, "Come, come, ye Saint, no toil nor labor fear; But with joy wend your way," may we know for whom these bells toll--they toll for the Saints of the Most High God. And may the bells call us as individuals and as a community to come unto Christ until we are within his holy influence, where, even in this life and in this place, we and our precious students may together enjoy the eternal quality of life God gives to all the obedient. Then we will know that<i>all</i>is well. For this I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Bruce C.

<h1>ee&#039;s Final University Conference Address - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As I told you last year, I regard these Annual University Conference talks as the most important that I give each year. They are also the ones over whose preparation I agonize the most. This one is different only in that I recognize it will be my last. I appreciate more than words can tell the expressions of love and support that I have received from so many of you. I have also sensed, and appreciated, our shared objective that that these remaining months not be characterized by waiting, wondering, and winding down, and that our institutional mind-set be one of finishing strong. I especially appreciated Bruce's remarks this morning, coming as they did from a dear friend of unquestioned loyalty with whom I have worked literally side-by-side at this university on two different occasions and covering a span of 10 years.<br><br>It seems appropriate on this occasion to share with you some of my thoughts about our university from our beginnings in the 1870s to our future as we enter the 21st century.<br><br>Accordingly, I would like to examine Brigham Young University from three different historical perspectives:<br><br>1. Where we have been, and the progress we have made over the now 120 years of our existence.<br><br>2. Where we are now.<br><br>3. What will be some of the likely characteristics of the BYU of the 21st century, or at lest the early portion of it.<br><h2><b>I. The Path by Which We Arrived</b></h2><br>The Brigham Young Academy began life as one of many Church "academies" scattered throughout the Church and designed to serve the needs of local areas. The day-to-day, year-to-year overpowering issue during its first three or four decades was survival. The total annual teacher payroll between 1877 and 1882 ranged from $2,265.45 to $4,263.90. During that same period tuition averaged about $4 per term, and very little of that was paid in cash. Residents generally brought their grain, fruit, beef, cloth, and other commodities to the tithing office, where they received the value of the goods in scrip, which was then used to pay tuition. Faculty members in turn used the scrip to procure supplies at local stores and at the tithing office, though local stores often discounted the scrip by about 10 percent. Even earlier, teachers at the Timpanogos Branch of the University of Deseret--the immediate predecessor of the BYA--were compelled to "make monthly peregrinations with huge wheelbarrows to collect the school fees paid in turnips, molasses and pumpkins." Worst of all, faculty members sometimes went months at a time without any compensation at all.<br><br>Similar deprivations were felt by our students. Rose Vickery in the fall of 1897 made the three-day trip from Levan, Utah, to Provo by wagon and team with her parents to attend Brigham Young Academy. She records that on October 31, 1897, "after arriving home after meeting [we] felt quite despondent from the fact that we had no supper and what was worser there was nothing to eat. A shout of joy went up however when our Nellie emerged from the bottommost realm of the flour bin with a hard and blackened crust which we ate in grateful silence and soon afterward retired. Half a loaf is better than no bread and ditto with that crust. Good night."<br><br>These stories of great sacrifice by students, faculty, and administrators were matched by local Church leaders, without whose financial support the Brigham Young Academy would never have survived into the 20th century. Abraham O. Smoot was, by the standards of his day, a wealthy local businessman, but he died virtually insolvent because he was willing to use his fortune to save the academy. Although he and Jesse Knight were among the most prominent of our early financial benefactors, there were many others, and we must always remember and be grateful to them.<br><br>It is not only helpful but also, I think, necessary that we periodically remind ourselves of our humble yet proud early beginnings. Today our support from the Church, both financial and otherwise, is generous and solidly committed. Never again will we function, as we did for the first 25 years, without indoor plumbing or electricity, and never again will our faculty members be forced to go door-to-door to neighbors in Provo filling wheelbarrows with turnips and pumpkins. The hardships of those early days will never be repeated. And we would no more want to bring them back than we would the crickets, or Haun's Mill, or the Extermination Order.<br><br>Although those early experiences will not be repeated, neither are they irrelevant. We have much to learn and to relearn from those early stalwarts who were willing to sacrifice so much and thereby laid the foundation for what we are today.<br><h2><b>II. The BYU of 1995</b></h2><br>And what are we today? We are the nation's largest private, church-related university, consisting of two campuses, one located in Provo and the other in Laie, Hawaii. Our dominant emphasis is undergraduate teaching, though at our Provo campus about 10 percent of our 27,000 students are engaged in graduate programs and our 1,400 faculty members are engaged in research efforts that make significant contributions to the body of the world's knowledge, keep us abreast of our own particular fields, and generally enhance the quality not only of our teaching but also of our total academic efforts. Most important of all, in my opinion, we stand alone among the universities of the world in the success of our efforts to accomplish excellent scholarship and learning in an environment of great faith.<br><br>The single most prominent feature of our history over the 12 decades of our existence has been our steady and remarkable progress. Each of those decades has been quite different from any of the others, and at the conclusion of any one of them we were a notably better school than at the conclusion of the preceding one, whether measured by the traditional academic standards of the world or by our own twin objectives of academic and spiritual achievement. It has been my privilege to be a personal participant as a student, faculty member, and administrator through substantial portions of five of those 12 decades--the early '50s through the mid-'90s--and to observe this steady increase in quality over that period of time. The BYU to which I returned as a faculty member and dean of the law school in 1972 was a much different and much better university than the one from which I graduated in 1960, and I have also seen that incremental quality enhancement continue over the years since that time.<br><br>Beyond any question, the quality of a university is determined principally by the quality of its faculty. Faculty cannot function without a supporting staff, and at this university we are blessed with the very best. But the ultimate objective of a university, imparting knowledge through teaching and discovering new knowledge--and here, at BYU, merging discovered knowledge with revealed knowledge--is the province of the faculty, and the excellence of a university is very properly measured by the excellence of its faculty.<br><br>When this administration took office a little over six years ago, we recognized that our most important challenge was based on two demographic facts. First, assuming an average retirement age of 65, between 35 and 40 percent of our faculty would be retiring during the decade of the 1990s. Change was therefore inevitable, and it could range all the way from near disaster to significant improvement. The second projected demographic phenomenon of the '90s was a nationwide decrease in available PhD graduates seeking academic employment, particularly in some of the sciences.<br><br>So far at least, the effects on us of any shortage of candidates has been minimal. In most disciplines we have had several highly qualified candidates for each available position. The bottom line is: This fall we will welcome the seventh entering "class" of new faculty who have joined us since I became your president. By a large margin, the strength of those 700 new faculty members, taken as a whole, is the most significant accomplishment of my administration. To be sure, over that time we have lost some very strong teachers and scholars to retirement. But it is equally clear that the BYU faculty of today is notably stronger than it was seven years ago, and stronger than it has ever been in the history of our university. There is a temptation to point to some of the superstars--persons with international reputations from some of the world's finest universities--who have joined us over that period. But the incremental growth in the quality of our faculty is not measured alone by superstars rather, it is manifest across the entire breadth of our new hires over the past seven years.<br><br>There has also been an increase in the quality of our students--some aspects of which are measurable and others of which are not. The consistent increases in the numerical credentials of our entering freshman classes are both encouraging and also sobering. For this fall's admitted freshman class at the Provo campus, the average ACT score is 27.2 and the average high school GPA is 3.72. As most of you know, for the past five years we have not made our admissions decisions based strictly on spiritual worthiness--that is, a simple yes or no decision by the bishop--and high school performance as measured by grades and ACT scores. Rather, we have combined those objective considerations with an effort to ascertain qualities of leadership and seriousness about and devotion to the kinds of values that we hope to instill in our students. If we had not included these subjective factors in our admissions decisions, the average ACT score and high school GPA of this year's entering freshman class would be even higher.<br><br>The sobering aspect of these figures is, of course, our inability, because of our enrollment cap, to accommodate additional highly qualified applicants whose lives would be enriched by a BYU education and whose presence would also improve the quality of our university. For example, just five years ago, without the subjective factors, our average high school GPA and ACT scores were 3.52 and 26.6, respectively. That is one of two reasons why our graduation initiatives, designed to reduce our average graduation time from 12 semesters to eight, are so important. The other reason is the benefits that will accrue to those whom we have admitted if we can add an additional two years to their lives after graduation. It is not our objective to rush our students' educational experience, nor to detract from its quality, but in the great majority of instances, four years should be sufficient to obtain a degree.<br><br>And so, the two most important answers to the second question that I posed at the outset--"Where are we now?"--are that we have an excellent faculty and a well-prepared student body, and there is every indication that both of these will continue to improve. There are also some other significant responses to that second question. Our academic freedom document, our standards for continuing university employment, and the procedures by which those are implemented have clarified and put into place principles and standards that in my view have long been cornerstones of our university's values and procedures, but which have now been made more explicit, thanks to the work of faculty committees whose recommendations were approved by the board of trustees.<br><br>The BYU of today is also involved in two initiatives having inter-related long-range implications. They are our strategic long-range planning study and our capital campaign. The first has involved literally tens of thousands of hours of effort by virtually everyone on this campus and should enable us for years into the future to take concrete administrative, budgeting, and other resource allocation steps that will better enable us to be the kind of university that we, through our own efforts and those of our board of trustees, have determined we want to be. And the capital campaign, which is now in its silent phase and which will be publicly announced sometime next spring, should provide many of the resources to achieve those objectives and to raise the quality of our university to a new plateau.<br><br>The BYU of 1995 is also a university where very significant expansion of our academic and other buildings is now underway or has recently been completed. Frankly, this has come as a surprise to me. One of my assumptions upon entering my present responsibilities was that with a frozen enrollment there would be very little need for additional buildings. By contrast, our physical plant people inform me that the projects of the last few years plus others to which we are now committed constitute the period of most intense building activity in their experience and probably the most intense period of our history. I am now convinced that, notwithstanding our enrollment ceiling, there will always be building activity on this campus, for reasons that fall into several categories. First, some buildings simply become physically worn out to the point that it is more economical to replace them. The classic example is our Joseph Smith Building. Other buildings do not become physically obsolescent but have to be replaced because the nature of the academic discipline has changed so remarkably--as illustrated by changes that have occurred over the past half century in the way the physical and biological sciences are taught, thereby necessitating the addition of our new Ezra Taft Benson Building and the complete renovation of the Eyring Science Center.<br><br>A third category of building activity that has traditionally been necessary and currently constitutes one of our largest and most expensive projects involves our two libraries. One of these projects, the Howard W. Hunter Law Library, is already underway, ground having been broken on Law Day, May 1, of this year; and the major expansion of our Harold B. Lee Library is scheduled to begin in May of 1996. We are told that sometime after the turn of the century advancing technology should overtake the ever-expanding need for additional library capacity so that our successors may not need to continue these very expensive library expansions every 20 years, or at least not on the same scale. But that time has not yet come, and as a consequence our library expansion is one f the largest and most expensive building projects ever undertaken on this campus.<br><br>A final category consists of what we sometimes refer to as "enrichment" buildings--buildings whose contributions to our basic academic endeavor vary from building to building. These enrichment buildings have consistently been financed by what we refer to as "local funds"--such as those resulting from our development efforts or from reserves built up by the activities conducted in those buildings. Classic examples are our Museum of Art, the football stadium and other athletic facilities, and the Wilkinson Center, which is now undergoing major renovation and expansion.<br><br>The short answer to the questions Where are we today? therefore, is that our faculty, our student body, and our administrators and staff are the strongest group in our history. Although we still have some space needs, on the whole our physical facilities are attractive and well suited for their purposes. With the adoption of our constitutional-type organic documents, we have a good understanding of what is expected of us as faculty and staff. And, finally, with our strategic planning effort and our capital campaign we are well positioned to build for the future, using as the basis for this growth and progress the values and objectives that we and our board of trustees have identified and to whose achievement our financial supporters throughout the world are willing to contribute. All of these strengths position us well toward achieving our central reason for existence: integrating discovered knowledge and truth with revealed knowledge and truth as inseparable parts of a single learning whole, with demonstrated and acknowledged competence and excellence in each. To paraphrase President McKay, if we fail in that objective, then our other successes will not matter much. And if we succeed, then all of the effort and sacrifice of those who have gone before, and the very considerable efforts that are being expended today and will be in the future, will have borne good fruit.<br><h2><b>III. Some Speculations About the BYU of the 21st Century</b></h2><br>And this brings us to the third and final question, What about the BYU of the future? From time to time people have asked me what I think will be the dominant characteristics of our university 10, 15, or 20 years from now. I have enjoyed speculating on this issue, and this, my final Annual University Conference address, seems an appropriate time to share with you some of my conclusions, so long as you are aware that they rest only on my own speculation. I have tried to separate what I really believe will happen from what I hope will happen, but I am not sure I have been totally successful. Against that background, and with the full acknowledgement that many of the conclusions may turn out to be completely wrong, let me offer the following:<br><br>First, the BYU of the 21st century, and even beyond, will always be what we are now and what we have been from the beginning, a predominantly LDS university. Our reason for being, as well as our unique niche among American colleges and universities, is solidly grounded in our religious affiliation.<br><br>I am convinced that the three keys to a religious university remaining a religious university (a rare occurrence, as demonstrated by our American experience of the past century or so) are (1) a governing board composed of members of the sponsoring church, preferably the same leaders who have authority and responsibility not only over the university but also for the larger church; (2) a faculty that is composed predominantly, though not exclusively, of church members; and (3) heavy and continuous church financial support. Let me expand briefly on each of these.<br><br><i>1. The University's Governing Board.</i>This nation and its people need greater religious influence in higher education, not less--more fine universities that take their religious sponsorship seriously, not fewer. The starting point for the achievement of that objective is the composition of the university's governing board.<br><br>The reason I feel so comfortable with our own governance arrangement is that our board of trustees consists of the same people who are charged with implementing worldwide the Restoration in all of its aspects. At any given time, our board includes, among others, all three members of the First Presidency and half the members of the Quorum of the Twelve. There are no members of the board who are not also general officers of the Church. Thus, governing policies set for BYU are inseparably tied to those of the larger Church as it expands and strengthens the restored kingdom.<br><br><i>2. The Faculty.</i>Given the centrality of the faculty of any university to carrying out the university's mission, I am convinced it follows necessarily that a university attempting to integrate faith and intellect as inseparable parts of a holistic learning process should be composed of those who not only understand but also are adherents to those spiritual objectives.<br><br>In this respect there is a difference between the faculty and the board of trustees. Because of the very different nature of their respective involvements with the university--the one a deliberative body dealing in many instances with confidential, sensitive matters and the other carrying out the day-to-day work of the university--the faculty need not be composed entirely of those who adhere to the sponsoring religion. Indeed, I will go further: a religious university can perform both aspects of its mission better if some of its faculty--not a large percentage, but some--are nonmembers of the sponsoring church but who understand and support its principles and practices. Our board's policy establishes a definite preference for LDS Church members, but it is a preference that can be overcome in specific instances.<br><br>I want to make it very clear that there is an important difference between the initial hiring on the one hand and opportunities available to all faculty members once they are hired related to such important matters as promotion, tenure, salary, etc. there is a higher hurdle for the non-LDS applicant at the initial hiring stage, but once the applicant has cleared that higher hurdle, there are no distinctions drawn between members and nonmembers with respect to opportunities for advancement and other advantageous treatment.<br><br><i>3. The Financial Support.</i>For as long as I can remember, reaching back at least to my days here as a student, BYU presidents, including me, have reminded our students and our broader public that the percentage of their total educational expenses borne by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has varied between the high 60s and the low 70s. And there it sits today. The Church's share hovers somewhere around 70 percent.<br><br>It is possible--indeed, some of us consider it desirable--that in the future BYU tuition may bear significantly more than a 30 percent share of the cost of what we impart to the student. Exactly what that share will be is beyond my ability to perceive and will be determined by others who are wiser and have greater insight than I. But the one thing of which I am certain is that there is a far greater issue at stake here--and the greatest mistake we could possibly make would be to permit the Church's share to drop too low.<br><br>I recall a report of a conversation by one of our faculty members with a colleague from another university concerning the proportion of our funds that come from the Church. After first expressing astonishment, this person said to our faculty member, "Well, I'm sure your president is attempting to change that, because if he can't, he will never establish his independence or that of the university."<br><br>That view, while doubtless shared by most secular academics, is located a whole 180 degrees away from my own. I thought about his comment, and then I concluded that if someone were to offer a multibillion dollar endowment, the earnings of which would be sufficient for and would be used to pay our annual educational expenses, I would recommend that our board of trustees reject the offer. And I am confident they would reject it. My reasoning? History teaches and teaches unmistakably that there is a direct tie between the source of a religious school's financing and its ability to remain serious about its religious mission. It doesn't happen all of a sudden, and usually there are a couple of identifiable transitional phases, but without any exception of which I am aware, when the Church funds dwindle, so does the spiritual commitment.<br><br>Indeed, of the three factors that are essential to prevent the secularization of a religious school--governing board, faculty, and financial support--the one for which history supplies the most compelling evidence is this third one, the financial support. George Marsden, professor of history at the University of Notre Dame (and one of our forum speakers next winter), has written an interesting and informative book called<i>The Soul of the American University</i>in which he traces the very substantial exodus from religious influence experienced by so many of our American universities and some of the causes and consequences of that change.<br><br>The historical high point of the religious university occurred about the turn of the century. Just how high that high point was is dramatically illustrated by the fact that when the Carnegie Pension Fund was established in 1906, setting up a generous pension fund for college and university teachers but available only to those private institutions not owned or in any formal way controlled by a denomination, only 51 of all schools in the United States and Canada qualified. Within a short time, however, that pattern changed dramatically, and the principal instrument of change was the shift in financial support from the churches to other sources, institutional and individual, most of whom, according to Marsden, regarded denominational ties as an "embarrassment" (<i>The Soul of the American University: From Protestant Establishment to Established Nonbelief</i>[New York: Oxford University Press, 1994], 279). Very often this occurred under the leadership of presidents or chancellors who were themselves religious and wanted to maintain the religious quality of their schools but promoted their school with interested philanthropists as focused on broad moral principles instead of on their distinctive religious beliefs. Chancellor James Hampton Kirkland, at Vanderbilt, is described as "always tend[ing] to translate 'Methodist' into 'Christian' . . . Christian into 'liberal Christian' or the 'upbuilding of Christ's kingdom,'" a phrase that Marsden says "could encompass everything constructive in modern civilization." Marsden uses the experience of Syracuse University during the early 1900s as another prominent example fo the effort "to steer a middle course and discovering how difficult that was." In 1910, after Syracuse had been rejected as a recipient of Carnegie Foundation money because it was sectarian, Chancellor James Day boldly asserted that "no university can teach people of the ideals of manhood and forget its self-respect and honor or sell its loyalty and faith for money. . . . 'The Money perish with thee' is the only answer to it" (284–85).<br><br>Brave words. Commendable words. But before the decade had passed, they were empty words.<br><br>It is quite apparent that Chancellor Day genuinely wanted to maintain Syracuse as a legitimate Methodist university and that he was not alone among the leaders of sectarian schools. But his overriding objective was to make Syracuse a great university. That requires money, and the need for money placed Syracuse in the very predictable dilemma of having to choose between academic quality and spiritual values. Notwithstanding Chancellor Day's bold statement in 1910, "The Money perish with thee," Marsden concludes that "the effect of Day's chancellorship was to remove Syracuse from any effective Methodist control."<br><br>How blessed we are--how uniquely blessed--not to have to make the either/or decisions that so many other universities faced because of their need for financial support. There is no other university in America, and probably not in the world, that receives from a church the level of financial support that we enjoy here. I am convinced that this will continue to be one of Brigham Young University's fortunate characteristics over the coming decades.<br><br>Another distinctive cornerstone of our university that I am confident will not change over the years is our commitment to undergraduate education. There is, I think, not another university of our size and quality that devotes anywhere nearly as large a percentage of its resources--including the most valuable resource of all, faculty time--to undergraduate teaching. To be sure, we have some very fine graduate programs, and our annual research reports show the quality and the magnitude of valuable research that is done on this campus. We are unquestionably a better university because of these graduate programs. But I do not expect our 90–10 ratio of undergraduates to graduates to change at any time in the future, for two interrelated reasons. The first ties back to our primary objective: to teach not only the basic academic disciplines but also to integrate that knowledge and understanding with a commitment to a value system based on principles of restored truth. Drawing on my own experience as a college and graduate student, I am convinced that it is during the undergraduate years that the opportunities for imparting that kind of spiritual/academic bilingualism are the greatest. This conclusion would appear to be bolstered by our self-study.<br><br>In addition, graduate education, not just in the sciences but generally across the board, is more expensive than undergraduate education. Taking these two factors together--the inverse relationship between the age of the student and our ability to instill a combination of academic and values training plus the increased cost of graduate education--means, quite simply, that in terms of the largest of objectives we are trying to accomplish here, we get a bigger return from our undergraduate than from our graduate investments. Again I reiterate: This is not a prediction that we will discontinue or even diminish the extent of our graduate programs, but only that they will not increase from the existing 90–10 ratio. Hence, undergraduate education will continue to be the jewel in our BYU crown, but our graduate programs will also, I am convinced, continue to get better and better because they are an essential part of our total university.<br><br>What about the size of our school 10, 20, 30, or more years from now? For several reasons I predict that our present enrollment caps of 27,000 at our Provo campus and 2,000 in Hawaii will not change much, if any. From an administrative standpoint this prospect of nongrowth is a real blessing. Although we presently need some additional space for faculty offices and other uses, our two campuses and our entire infrastructure are designed to accommodate a student body of about our present size. Expanding significantly beyond our present student enrollment would necessarily syphon much of our effort away from attending to the quality of our educational program. There will be pressures, as the Church expands, for higher education experiences that incorporate a spiritual element that distinctively ties back to restored truth. But I believe the response to those pressures will not include an expanded BYU. Other alternatives include significantly enriched institute programs or possibly adding other two-year schools.<br><br>Though I do not see an increase in the quantity of our students, I do see an increase in their quality. Assuming our student enrollment caps remain at about 27,000 and 2,000 respectively, the level of preparation of our students will necessarily continue to increase, not only academically but spiritually as well. Two side effects should result from this increasing quality. First, I believe there will be a corresponding increase in the quality of our classroom teaching as our faculty members are challenged more and more by better-prepared students. Second, I believe that the number of BYU undergraduate students who go on to obtain advanced degrees will increase and that this will continue to be our great strength in faculty recruitment: students who obtain their first degree here then go on to get a doctor's degree somewhere else and return as members of our faculty.<br><br>Over the coming decades I see an increase in the ability of our university to contribute effectively to a growing international church. For a variety of very practical reasons the proportion of our international students will never match our international church membership, but I do anticipate that over the years international students in increasing numbers will come to BYU. Then, after what we hope will be their acquisition of substantial intellectual and spiritual value because of their BYU experience, they will be more effective leaders throughout the world in the Church and in their broader communities. The Marriott School has already taken the lead in this effort, and their experience shows two things. The first is that it costs money, and the second is that the results probably justify the cost, at least up to a certain point. I believe that an additional long-range linkage between our university and a growing international church will be an increase in the ability of our faculty to assist in selected projects throughout the world that will be useful to the growth of the kingdom.<br><br>I am convinced that over the coming years the levels of discomfort with our academic freedom policy will gradually, but steadily, diminish to the point of virtual nonexistence. The reasons are quite simple. Our academic freedom statement contains, in the final analysis, only one important restriction, and that is that members of our faculty should not use their positions as faculty members--whether in the classroom, in their publications, or elsewhere--to do things that are adverse to the interests of our sponsoring church. There are some people for whom that is a significant limitation. There are others for whom it is irrelevant. There is a third category of people for whom a very large academic freedom concern--indeed, for some, our largest academic freedom concern--is the freedom to explore, teach, and publish concerning the ways that our faith strengthens our scholarship and teaching and vice versa. Over the years our academic freedom standards and requirements for continuing employment--now that they have been formally published--will become more generally known and more generally understood among our applicants. There will certainly be a corresponding self-selection process in which people for whom it is important to take positions either in the classroom, or through their publications, or otherwise that are harmful to the Church simply will not apply here. That will mean a proportionately larger increase in the applicants whose views fall in the overlapping second and third categories, those for whom taking positions harmful to the Church is not important but who are interested in the academic freedom to pursue relationships between their faith and their scholarly disciplines. And this will necessarily lead not only to a decreasing level of discomfort, eventually reaching the point of virtual nonexistence, but also to an increase in true academic freedom because of the shift just described in the academic interests of applicants for faculty positions.<br><br>I also believe that the coming years at BYU will see a gradual decrease in an unfortunate pattern that has existed at BYU for a long time: the practice of raising directly with members of the board of trustees or other General Authorities, either anonymously or otherwise, complaints that ought to have been raised initially with the person involved. The counsel of the Doctrine and Covenants on this issue is quite precise: "And if thy brother or sister offend thee, thou shalt take him or her between him or her and thee alone" (D&amp;amp;C 42:88). Failing resolution at this initial stage "between him or her and thee alone," I further predict that the issues will proceed as they should through the regular university channels before being raised, if necessary, with members of the board.<br><br>Now, before you cry out that I have lost all touch with reality, let me tell you why I think this will happen. Under procedures established in connection with our standards governing academic freedom and continuing employment at the university, communications concerning the university that are sent directly to any General Authority are not to be acted upon by the person receiving that communication unless they involve ecclesiastical mattes, in which case they may be sent to the stake presidents. Matters involving the university, as most of them do, are forwarded to the commissioner of the Church Educational System. The commissioner then sends those communications to us, and we send them down the line until they reach the person with whom the matters should have been raised in the first instance. Failing resolution at that stage, the matter will then proceed up through established university channels and eventually, if necessary, to the commissioner or the board. It is not a perfect system; the preferred one would be for those who feel a compulsion to complain to General Authorities to follow instead the process counseled by the Doctrine and Covenants and then let the grievance proceed from the bottom up, rather than from the top down. But I believe that in time that is where we are headed as people come to realize--as each of you now realizes because I have told you--that since the only consequence of complaining directly to the Brethren will be that the complaint is swiftly remanded to where it ought to have started, everyone's interests are better served by beginning the process at the proper place. I regard this procedural reform, as simple and as rooted in common sense as it is, to be one of the most important that has occurred during my time in office. If followed--and each of you can help by raising your initial complaints at the bottom rather than at the top--it will lead to enhanced feelings of brotherhood, sisterhood, and collegiality.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>The achievement of what I am convinced is our all-subsuming goal, integrating intellect and faith as mutually supportive means by which learning is acquired, is something that we are now and have been for a long time in the process of accomplishing. For me there have been very few instances in which I have not been able to reconcile what I seem to have learned through these twin channels of intellect and faith. There are, however, a very few. Let me tell you of one simple, yet for me compelling experience that I had rather early in life that brought home to me in an almost revelatory way how to deal with my own inability to reconcile those rare instances in which my mind tells me one thing and my testimony tells me another.<br><br>During my growing-up years my family was in the sawmill business, and I spent all of my summers in sawmill camps, little communities created for the sole purpose of supporting the sawmilling and logging operations. It was a kind of life that simply does not exist anymore. Until I was about 16 years old, none of the camps in which we lived had any kind of indoor plumbing or electricity. And then, when I was about a junior in high school, we acquired a little diesel-powered light plant that would generate electricity from 6:00 to 10:00 p.m. Each night it was my job to turn off the light plant at 10:00 p.m. It was a noisy machine, and for some reason when I turned it off every dog in the camp (they outnumbered the human beings about two to one) would howl for about 15 seconds. Because of the remoteness of our location the air was pristine pure and clear, the sky black, and the stars--myriads that I could see and millions more that I knew were out there--stood out in brilliant contrasts to the blackened sky. As I would gaze out into those awesome spaces, I would always come around to the ultimate question: What is really out there? The scriptures told me that space is without end. My brain was unable then, and is unable still, to comprehend that fact. I simply lack the capacity to perceive how it is that space can continue on and on and never come to an end. And yet my mind is sufficiently developed to comprehend that the alternative is totally unacceptable. If there is some point out there where it all comes to an end, then what is on the other side? It was on those evenings as I stood there at the side of our light plant gazing into the massiveness of our Heavenly Father's creations, that I came to an appreciation both of the powers of the human mind and also of its limitations. I concluded then that the rational and the extrarational are two processes by which thinking, believing sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father can gain understanding. Any proficiency we acquire in the use of one should lead only to increased respect for the other. Those rare instances where we are unable rationally to explain a principle of revealed truth prove nothing more than that there are some facts, some truths, some realities that our mortal minds are simply unable to comprehend.<br><br>It is with profound and somewhat conflicting emotions that Janet and I anticipate the next chapter of our lives, scheduled to begin about four months from now. On May 12, 1989, when President Hinckley announced that I was to be the 10th president of BYU, I referred to my lifelong love affair with this university. The intervening six and a half years have served only to deepen and strengthen those feelings and give them additional dimension and meaning. Truly we have experienced "how good and how pleasant it is to dwell together in unity." I have never pictured myself as a university president or any other kind of academic administrator and would never have selected any such career options. Indeed, over the years I have responded quickly, politely, and negatively to the few overtures for such opportunities that I have had from other schools. But BYU and the presidency I am now bringing to a close are completely different, for two separate but quite interrelated reasons. The first is what we have been discussing this morning and on numerous occasions: this place is very different; we are constantly striving to make it even more different; and the difference involves nothing less than our reason for being. Second, so very much of everything that I am--my values, my aspirations, the way I think and the things I do, my original acquaintance with Janet, our developing relationship over the years, and even my relationships with my children--is solidly and inextricably tied to BYU. Not accepting the offer of this position would have been tantamount to rejecting a large part of myself.<br><br>There has been no period in my life that has been more rewarding and fulfilling, both personally and professionally, than the last 75 months, principally because far more than any other responsibility I have ever had, this is one that I shared with Janet. It has truly been a partnership arrangement, which has made the performance of my duties not only more effective but also more enjoyable. In addition to the usual tasks traditionally performed by BYU presidential wives, Janet has magnified the position with several innovative and useful initiatives, including functions with new faculty, faculty women, and faculty wives and a variety of activities with the students.<br><br>There are so many things that we will deeply miss as we open the pages of the next chapter of our lives. But the things we will miss are not as important as the things of which we will continue to be a part--things like the love and common understanding that you and I have for each other and for BYU, our shared dedication to bringing our institution and ourselves to the full measure of our potential and to the fullest understanding of what the Lord must have meant when he urged us to gain understanding, even by learning and also by faith. These are the big things. These are what make BYU what it is now and what it is sure to become in the future. And Janet's and my great joy is that as continuing members of the BYU community, working and living here as part of this great experimental enterprise, even though in a different capacity, we will still be, as everyone here today is, an integral and indispensable part of that great undertaking.<br><br>Truly it is a great undertaking. And we can and must make it work. This is not just another university precisely because our sponsoring church is not just another church. It is the restored kingdom of Jesus Christ. I was not there on that spring day in 1820 when Joseph Smith saw the Father and the Son. Neither was it my privilege to be present on the banks of the Susquehanna River on May 15, 1829, when John the Baptist laid his hands on the heads of Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery and restored the same priesthood by which he had baptized the Savior Himself. But I can tell you with the same surety as though I had actually been there and witnessed those events, they really occurred. The Restoration is real. Prophets are once again here among us. And this our university, this college that we love, is an integral part of, and we must make it a more effective part of, that broader restored kingdom. Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Rex E. Lee was president of Brigham Young University when this Annual University Conference address was given on 28 August 1995.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1> a Whole University - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
A week ago last Friday I attended the 40th reunion of my graduating class at BY High School. During that evening and the all--BY High reunion the next night, I contracted a case of nostalgia that will infect parts of what I say today. Under our present circumstances I had hoped not to be too drippy about things, but my mind is subject to economic law: the bad thoughts always drive out the good. During our reunion one classmate, in an attempt to be kind, remarked that I hadn't changed a bit. That troubled me a good deal. It was hard to think of myself as a half-gray, half-bald, tri-focaled, pot-bellied, 17-year-old!<br><br>Things do change, including our university. But as I contemplate the university today, in all its diversity and strength, I believe that is our capacity to build upon the past and to preserve the ideals, community, and culture of our predecessors that will make us unique and enable us to improve. I feel a daily sense of debt to those unselfish women and men who built BYU.<br><br>During this conference you have heard, and will continue to hear, of efforts to make education at BYU even stronger. I, too, will list a number of items, but I intend to focus these items on one large issue. Although I consider the topic to be of central importance to this or any other university, I am not stimulated to talk about it by any sense of crisis. Indeed, it is precisely because I have seen evidence of our unique capacity in this area that I want to encourage its preservation and strengthening. I have not arrived at any set of solutions to meet what I believe will be ever-increasing challenges. Rather, I would like to help stimulate discussion among all of us. My illustrations will come largely from faculty-related matters, but the issue transcends the classroom or faculty research.<br><br>The general question I would ask is "How do we remain focused on the university's and our students' interests when so many influences, including some parts of our own reward systems, move us toward departmental, smaller-unit, or personal concerns?" In other words, when centrifugal forces drive us toward specialties and individual pursuits, how can we concentrate on the things that must cohere if we are to continue to achieve what a good university--especially this good university--should do? How do we stay together when so much would pull us apart?<br><br>These questions, of course, are not new. The old description of universities as independent departments linked only be central heating systems is reflected in much of the literature of higher education. However, the durability of such clichés is not a manifestation of their lack of validity but of their fundamental truth. I first thought carefully about this issue while reading<i>The Academic Life,</i>Burton R. Clark's 1987 study of American university faculty done for the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. Clark analyzed survey and interview responses of a large number of college and university faculty members and observed that for the faculty of many universities--especially those with the Carnegie classification of research university--colleagues from the same university no longer are considered the primary peer group. Rather, the peers are professors in the same discipline or subdiscipline found in universities scattered throughout the nation or the world. The primary interest of these professors are focused on those activities that will bring the approval and admiration of that peer group. According to Clark, such activities rarely include teaching, since evaluation of and rewards for teaching rarely transcend the particular institution in which the professor is employed.<br><br>I cite this particular tension as an example only. What it seems to illustrate is that the forces that lead professors toward external peer approval may lead them away from activities that are critical for the university. There are equivalent pressures in other parts of the university. For example, it is possible that the need to show a good bottom line in an auxiliary operation could lead to overpricing or to less-than-optimal service.<br><br>When I was a student at the University of Hamburg, I found it interesting that, at that time at least, admission to one German university effectively meant admission to them all. The transfer process could be completed in an hour or less. Their system, upon which many of the American graduate schools were based, was to think of the students as really studying with one professor, and students could shop around various universities until they found that appropriate professor and until the appropriate professor agreed to work with them. Although students were supposed to pay for each lecture they wished to attend, little or no attention was given to who was or wasn't there. (My philosophy teacher, for example, always drew a few hundred more students than were registered for the class.) The real work of the university, it was felt, took place with advanced students in the preparation of papers and dissertations.<br><br>In the United States, however, we still place a great deal of emphasis on the reputation for quality of the whole university. Prep schools make their reputations on the basis of their students' admissions to elite colleges and universities, and students are concerned about which institution they can attend. We believe that institutions as a whole--not just departments or individual professors--provide the education we wish our students to receive. This belief is particularly prevalent when we talk of undergraduate education. Thus, when we find rankings of undertraduate colleges and universities, the focus is on whole institutions, whereas most rankings of excellent graduate and professional schools are listed by discipline.<br><br>The American emphasis on whole institutions implies that there are many things that we expect from universities in addition to excellent preparation in a specific specialty. Among other matters, these usually include preparation for participation in civic affairs, excellent writing and other communication skills, some kind of general education experience, etc. At BYU we have tried to articulate these kinds of matters in the so-called "Aims of a BYU Education" document. As we attempted to make clear, the responsibility for providing the education described in this document rarely is limited to one department; often many or all of the units of the university are involved. The ultimate concern is for the education that our students receive. What is a bit uncertain is how we can assure that all departments and individual professors will continue to contribute toward these aims when it is not obvious that such contributions will lead to immediate rewards.<br><br>The values survey of faculty and others that was undertaken as part of the self-study provides a good deal of hope on this matter. One of the clusters of values that received the highest scores from the faculty was that group of issues concerning students and their experience here. It is refreshingly clear that we have faculty and staff who are very anxious to provide an excellent education for our students. Many demonstrate on a daily basis that they are willing to put great energy into their teaching and other contacts with students. But as we become ever more well known for other achievements, temptations to sacrifice this focus to matters more noticeable to others will inevitably arise.<br><br>Let me now mention a few of the areas where I see some possible concerns in the future.<br><br>It has long been recognized that the teaching of articulate writing is time-consuming and difficult, yet one of the most critical things that a university can do. Occasionally, however, some consider leaving the teaching of writing to the English Department and to a few other units that have formal writing courses. Yet studies consistently show that students need to connect writing to a variety of subject matters, and especially to their major, if they are to develop real skill in the area. Writing assignments require a good deal of efforts in development and in correction if they are to be effective.<br><br>Data acquired in the UCLA study of faculty indicate that BYU professors assign more writing than their peers at other institutions--a very encouraging finding. There is some evidence, however, that the teaching of writing is somewhat random throughout the university. It seems to me that we need more systematic writing instruction in many of our departments. But there are tensions that could move some of us away from this responsibility--including the need for increased time to concentrate on scholarly work. I would invite you to think how we can become more effective in this aim despite the natural desire to spend our efforts in more exciting activities than questioning transitions, noting comma splices, and so forth. I do not wish to see us having to confront the stacks of themes and essays that decorated the offices, studies, and living rooms of our great colleagues of the past, but I hope we have inherited some of their concern for our students' writing abilities.<br><br>General education and service courses compose another major responsibility of the university but are areas that often fail to receive recognition equivalent to that accorded other important activities. We might think of the matter with the following questions: Do we teach general and service courses in large sections to preserve teacher contact hours for classes in the major? Do we reserve essay examinations for our advanced students while using machine-corrected tests in general education classes? Do general education students and nonmajors have the same access to faculty consultation as departmental majors? In which classes do we assign writing? Are our best teachers reserved for courses that enroll specialists? I am aware that a number of circumstances, including resource limitations, make it unlikely that all courses will be treated equally. But we should still question ourselves when we are tempted to give preference to those students who are following our own career directions.<br><br>When I think of teachers who took an interest in my own undergraduate education--Orea Tanner, Irene Spears, Stan Welsh, Max Rogers, Lawrence Sardoni, and many others--I am struck by how many of them came from fields outside my major. In fact, I mentioned none from my major, although several were very influential. This part of my educational heritage is important to me, especially when I reflect on the studies done by Richard J. Light and his colleagues in the Harvard Assessment Seminars. They list personal contact with a full-time professor as the single most important factor contributing to the success of beginning students. Many students at this level will not have chosen a major, of course. Thus, general education and service courses assume an even more critical significance.<br><br>Surveys of our alumni and current students show that they chose BYU more for its LDS environment and potential for strengthening their faith than for any other reason. And their response to the spiritual environment here is overwhelmingly affirmative. They feel very good about religion classes and such experiences as devotionals and firesides. If there is an area in which they might wish greater emphasis on the gospel and on spiritual matters, it is in the courses offered as part of their academic major.<br><br>A few years ago I was invited to have lunch with a number of Ezra Taft Benson scholars. During our conversation, I asked them if anything had surprised them about BYU. I expected that at least some of them would say that it had been more difficult than they had expected. Instead, they answered, almost to a person, that they had expected more discussion of the gospel in their nonreligion classes. I do not related this story to be critical; indeed, I believe that the integration of all truths achieved by this faculty is remarkable. What I do mean to say is that we need feel no embarrassment about fulfilling our aim to be spiritually strengthening in all of our courses. Our students expect it and desire it.<br><br>Many of us who are not full-time members of the Religious Education faculty are asked to contribute to the formal teaching of religion. I hope that departments select some of their finest teachers for this responsibility and that those faculty selected expend as much effort on this activity as they do on courses intended for their majors. (I also hope that department and college advancement committees will give appropriate credit for excellence in the religion classroom.)<br><br>Our students also expect all of us, faculty, administration, and staff, to take seriously our Honor Code and our Dress and Grooming Standards. Again, we are talking of a whole university matter. The principles given in these guides to behavior and appearance belong to all of us. Students expect faculty and others to support and reinforce these matters. There are no awards for supporting honor, but there are lives and souls saved by so doing.<br><br>I have already mentioned that students need contact with full-time teachers if they are to adjust well to the university. This need is so widely recognized that Elaine El-Khawas reports in<i>Campus Trends 1995</i>that 83 percent of the campuses she surveyed for the American Council on Education have instituted some programs for improving the freshman year. Our Freshman Academy (formerly SHINE) and the faculty mentoring program begun last year are among our own efforts in this direction. I expect that the self-study will result in additional recommendations for helping our beginning (and perhaps reentering) students. Once again, however, we will be faced with the challenge of fitting these critical activities into a national education culture that has traditionally emphasized other contributions.<br><br>Related to our concerns about freshmen, but extending to all of our students, is the matter of advisement. I am impressed by the competence of our professional advisement staff. Indeed, I suspect that a very high portion of our students' complaints about advisement would be solved if they would make full use of the services we already provide. But our survey data indicate that students and alumni feel a need for more careful advisement--particularly advisement about careers. It is apparent to me that we must integrate the faculty with our professional advisors if we are to fill what our students feel is one of the greatest needs. Again, I think that we can expect concrete proposals from the self-study. I extend thanks to those who sacrifice personal concerns to extend themselves to their students in this important way.<br><br>On previous occasions I have expressed my view that preparing students for elementary and secondary school teaching is one of our very important tasks. This is a particularly challenging responsibility on the secondary level because it requires good cooperation between the public schools, the College of Education, and the various arts and science departments. Once again, for many professors and departments, teacher education is not one of the areas that will bring increased national stature, but our record in this areas is exemplary. We will undoubtedly hear more about this vital challenge in months to come. Let me simply commend those of you who are committed to this effort and encourage even greater coordination and dedication in the future. I especially ask departments to think of ways to evaluate and reward this activity.<br><br>I have always felt that students entering BYU should come here with the intention of graduating. There are, of course, good reasons why some will not reach this goal, but the university needs to do everything it can to assure that capable students will not be prevented from attaining this important objective because of our actions or lack thereof. This is one university-centered matter where we are doing better than our predecessors. Graduation rates for all our students, and particularly for women students, are improving each year. In my view this is the most important result of our graduation initiative. We have clarified and unified our general education requirements and made some progress toward getting major hours under control. This is another area where we must put students first. I know the temptation to feel that students will have a better education if they are required to take just two (or three of four or who knows how many) additional classes in the major. But we are wrong. The universities that are repeatedly cited as the best in the country graduate a much higher proportion of their entering students than we do. They graduate them having required far fewer hours than some of our majors demand, and they do it with no loss in educational quality. As the "Aims" document expresses it, "Undergraduate study should be targeted at entrance-level, not expert-level, abilities. An interest in depth should not lead to bachelor's degrees that try to teach students everything they will need to know after graduation. Students should be able to complete their degrees within four years."<br><br>My last major point may seem a bit at odds with the others I have mentioned, but I consider it an important university-wide problem. This is the matter of grade inflation. I know the reasons we cite for higher grades: better entering students, achievement-based evaluation, compassion, the need to protect scholarships or to facilitate admission to graduate and professional schools, etc. But the fact is, we have gone too far. Last year, slightly more than one-half of all the grades that we awarded were either A or A–. Our catalog still lists the letter grade A as designating "excellent" performance. As much as I love and admire our students and respect their abilities, I cannot imagine that their average performance is achieving this level. A professor who values students will not deceive them into believing that anything less than their best work deserves our highest grades.<br><br>At the beginning I expressed my indebtedness to many who came before us. I would like to extend that expression to those with whom I now work. Because of the likelihood that this will be my last public opportunity, I was tempted to name a large number of associates who make the worst moments bearable and the best an absolute joy. But the list is too long. I feel a debt to colleagues in the faculty and staff whose vision is more farsighted than mine and who strive, often without thought of immediate reward, to bring BYU to its prophetic destiny.<br><br>I have always loved the hymn "Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing," in part because it contains one of my favorite lines in all writing: "O to grace how great a debtor / Daily I'm constrained to be!" ("Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing,"<i>Hymns</i>, 1948, no. 70). I do feel my greatest sense of indebtedness to our Heavenly Father for his tender mercies.<br><br>I was a bit shocked last Tuesday when Elder Spencer J. Condie chose to end his devotional talk by playing the video of Mack Wilberg and the combined choirs and philharmonic orchestra of BYU performing Professor Wilberg's arrangement of this great hymn. I had planned to conclude my remarks by showing that remarkable piece to you. After reflecting on the number of faculty that stay around during Education Week, however, I decided that I would take the chance and play it anyway. Better than any other way I know, it expresses my sense of debt. It is also the best visual symbol I know to show what BYU is really about.<br><br>May we join together in the great work of a unified university, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Todd A.

<h1>-White Birds - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I greet you tonight with the blessings and good wishes of the First Presidency of the Church, who serve as the officers of the board of trustees and represent them in this assignment. With the faculty, staff, and administration present, only the students are missing. It is in their interest that I have entitled my message "The Snow-White Birds."<br><br>A few days ago President Lee asked me to substitute for Elder M. Russell Ballard, who is recovering from heart surgery and is doing very well. President Lee urged me to reminisce about my years of association with Brigham Young University.<br><br>My preparation, of necessity, has been limited to small blocks of time pried open in an already solid schedule--mostly when you were asleep. I have been shaken by the thought that my presentation this evening might bring you to that same condition!<br><br>President Harold B. Lee told me once that inspiration comes easier when you can set foot on the site related to the need for it. With a very sincere desire to be guided in preparing what I should say to you, early Sunday morning, before you were about, I stood in the Maeser Building, and I found that President Lee was right!<br><br>In one sense, this is a graduation. President Rex Lee has reported periodically to the public on the condition of his health, most often with Janet at his side. I do not know of anyone else who has shown the wisdom and the courage to do that. The Lees have served faithfully and well. I do not know another first lady of BYU who has shown more devotion. She has sparkled in public and has been an unfailing support to our president in the greater role known only to them. Together they deserve the highest marks. President Lee, never satisfied with less than his best, has earned them now. They both have our commendation and affection.<br><br>In one sense, I too am graduating tonight. After 34 years on the board of trustees for BYU, most of it on the executive committee, I have been released.<br><br>Members of the Quorum of the Twelve will now be rotated on the board. That is as it should be, for the Twelve, under the direction of the First Presidency, are responsible to watch over and "set in order"<sup>1</sup>the Church in all the world.<br><br>Since the future of the Church rests with our youth and since the budget for their education is the second largest of all Church appropriations (the budget for BYU alone is in the hundreds of millions of dollars), you deserve the responsible attention of all of the Twelve. And I am sure you will have that.<br><br>It has been said that<i>young</i>men speak of the future because they have no past, and<i>old</i>men speak of the past because they have no future. Responding to President Lee's request, I will act my age and reminisce.<br><br>Our first visit to this campus was 48 years ago this month. Donna and I were returning from our honeymoon. Seven years later I walked into the Maeser Building, then the administration building, to an office I was to occupy as chairman of a summer school for all seminary and institute personnel. There were problems, and so we had been called in for some reinforcement, some shaping up.<br><br>Our instructor was Elder Harold B. Lee of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. He invited guest lecturers. President J. Reuben Clark Jr. came more than once; President Joseph Fielding Smith, Elders Spencer W. Kimball, Mark E. Peterson, Marion G. Romney, LeGrand Richards, Delbert L. Stapley, and Richard L. Evans, President Belle S. Spafford of the Relief Society (one of the greatest women of our time), and others came. For two hours a day, five days a week, for five weeks we were taught at the feet of the apostles. The influence of those days is still evident in our lives and in Church education.<br><br>The following year, as a supervisor of seminaries and institutes, I returned to the Maeser Building. I occupied an office there until the administration moved to the newly completed Smoot Building.<br><br>In 1958 A. Theodore Tuttle, the other supervisor of seminaries, was called as a member of the First Council of the Seventy.<br><br>In October 1961 I was called as an Assistant to the Twelve. One of my first assignments was to the Church Board of Education, the BYU Board of Trustees, and the executive committee.<br><br>I can remember Presidents Franklin S. Harris, Howard McDonald, and Acting President Christen Jensen. I have had a close association with Presidents Wilkinson, Oaks, Holland, and Lee.<br><br>I remember as well Sunday, January 8, 1956. To understand why that is memorable to me, we must go back to 1910.<br><br>George Brimhall, having already served 19 years as president of BYU, determined to establish a recognized teachers college. He had hired three professors: one with a master's degree from Harvard, one with a doctorate from Cornell, and the other with a doctorate from Chicago. They hoped to transform the college into a full-fledged university. They determined that practicality and religion, which had characterized the school, must now give way to more intellectual and scientific philosophies.<br><br>The professors held that "the fundamentals of religion could and must be investigated by extending the [empirical] method into the spiritual realm," and they "considered evolution to be a basic, spiritual principle through which the divinity in nature expressed itself."<sup>2</sup>The faculty sided with the new professors and the students rallied to them.<br><br>Horace Cummings, superintendent of Church schools, became concerned because they were "applying the evolutionary theory and other philosophical hypotheses to principles of the gospel and to the teachings of the Church in such a way as to disturb, if not destroy the faith of the pupils," and he wrote, "Many stake presidents, some of our leading principals and teachers, and leading men who are friends of our schools have expressed deep anxiety to me about this matter."<sup>3</sup><br><br>Superintendent Cummings reported to the board that:<br><br><i>1. The teachers were following the "higher criticism". . . , treating the Bible as "a collection of myths, folk-lore, dramas, literary productions, history and some inspiration."</i><br><br><i>2. They rejected the flood, the confusion of tongues, the miracle of the Red Sea, and the temptation of Christ as real phenomena.</i><br><br><i>3. They said John the Revelator was not translated but died in the year A.D. 96.</i><br><br><i>4. "The theory of evolution is treated as a demonstrated law and their applications of it to gospel truths give rise to many curious and conflicting explanations of scripture."</i><br><br><i>5. The teachers carried philosophical ideas too far: (1) "They believed sinners should be pitied and enlightened rather than blamed or punished," (2) and they believed that "we should never agree. God never made two things alike. Only by taking different views of a thing can its real truth be seen."</i><br><br><i>6. . . . .</i><br><br><i>7. The professors taught that "all truths change as we change. Nothing is fixed or reliable."</i><br><br><i>8. They also taught that "Visions and revelations are mental suggestions. The objective reality of the presence of the Father and the Son, in Joseph Smith's first vision, is questioned."</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>Superintendent Cummings concluded his report by saying that the professors "seem to feel that they have a mission to protect the young from the errors of their parents."<sup>5</sup><br><br>President Brimhall himself defended the professors--that is, until some students "frankly told him they had quit praying because they learned in school there was no real God to hear them."<sup>6</sup><br><br>Shortly thereafter President Brimhall had a dream.<br><br><i>He saw several of the BYU professors standing around a peculiar machine on the campus. When one of them touched a spring a baited fish hook attached to a long thin wire rose rapidly into the air. . . .</i><br><br><i>Casting his eyes around the sky he</i>[President Brimhall]<i>discovered a flock of snow-white birds circling among the clouds and disporting themselves in the sky, seemingly very happy. Presently one of them, seeing the bait on the hook, darted toward it and grabbed it. Instantly one of the professors on the ground touched a spring in the machine, and the bird was rapidly hauled down to the earth.</i><br><br><i>On reaching the ground the bird proved to be a BYU student, clad in an ancient Greek costume, and was directed to join a group of other students who had been brought down in a similar manner. Brother Brimhall walked over to them, and noticing that all of them looked very sad, discouraged and downcast, he asked them:</i><br><br><i>"Why, students, what on earth makes you so sad and downhearted?"</i><br><br><i>"Alas, we can never fly again!" they replied with a sigh and a sad shake of the head.</i><br><br><i>Their Greek philosophy had tied them to the earth. They could believe only what they could demonstrate in the laboratory. Their prayers could go no higher than the ceiling. They could see no heaven--no hereafter.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>Now deeply embarrassed by the controversy and caught between opposing factions, President Brimhall at first attempted to be conciliatory. He said, "I have been hoping for a year or two past that harmony could be secured by waiting, but the delays have been fraught with increased danger."<sup>8</sup>When an exercise in<i>administrative diplomacy</i>suddenly became an<i>issue of faith,</i>President Brimhall acted.<br><br>And now to Sunday, January 8, 1956. President David O. McKay came to Brigham City to dedicate a chapel built for students of the Intermountain Indian School. I stood next to him to introduce those who came forward to shake his hand.<br><br>A very old man, a stranger to me, came forward on the arm of his daughter. He had come some distance to speak to President McKay. It was impossible for me not to hear their conversation. He gave President McKay his name and said that many years ago he had taught at BYU. President McKay said, "Yes, I know who you are." Tears came as the old man spoke sorrowfully about the burden he had carried for years. President McKay was very tender in consoling him. "I know your heart," he said. That old man was one of the three professors who had been hired by President Brimhall in 1910.<br><br>Let me share with you another experience or two from which I learned valuable lessons.<br><br>During our BYU years we lived in Lindon. Early one Christmas Eve I received a telephone call. I told Donna that I must run in to Provo to the office. By doing so, one of our teachers could have a much happier Christmas.<br><br>I thought I was alone in the Maeser Building. Not so. President Ernest L. Wilkinson, whose office was at the other end of the hall, walked into President Berrett's office, then into Brother Tuttle's office, looked in the storeroom, and then stepped into my office. Without saying a word to me, he looked around my office and walked out. Although I knew him to be absorbed in whatever he did, I shook my head and muttered to myself, "Well, cuss you!"<br><br>Shortly thereafter, Vice President Harvey L. Taylor came into the office and made the same tour. Startled to find me at my desk, he asked, "What on earth are you doing here on Christmas Eve?" I explained why I was there. He then told me how much I was appreciated and how grateful he was for one who would go the extra mile. He wished me a merry Christmas and left.<br><br>After he was gone, I had generous thoughts about President Wilkinson. If he was smart enough to have a man like Harvey Taylor follow him around, I could put up with his exasperating ways.<br><br>Some time later I was summoned to a meeting of the Administrative Council in President Wilkinson's office. They were discussing the appointment of someone in St. George to recruit the graduates of Dixie Junior College to BYU. I recommended the director of the institute there and said, "To appoint someone else would be misunderstood."<br><br>The others there agreed. But after discussion, President Wilkinson said someone else would be better. I responded, "That's all right, President, but you are still wrong."<br><br>Suddenly there was dead silence. When President Wilkinson was greatly amused or angry, he had a way of running his tongue around the inside of his cheeks. He stood up and walked around his desk two or three times. I suppose he was trying to get control of himself. Finally he sat down, and Joseph T. Bentley said quietly, "President, Brother Packer is right."<br><br>At that point I was excused from the meeting. That night I told Donna that we would be leaving BYU, and I hoped we could return to Brigham City to teach seminary. Two days later I received a memo from President Wilkinson appointing me to the Administrative Council of Brigham Young University.<br><br>During the years I served on that council, I came to appreciate President Wilkinson. He had a profound influence on the university, and the naming of a building, this building, for him is little enough by way of tribute to him.<br><br>In 1966 BYU underwent an accrediting evaluation. The evaluation of the College of Religion by two clergymen from differing faiths was thought to offer a fresh insight into the role of religion at BYU.<br><br>These two "outsiders" expressed concern over the intellectual climate and the "revelational and authoritarian approach to knowledge." They recommended that, for the purpose of intellectual ferment and free inquiry at BYU, the university should have one or two atheists on the faculty.<br><br>President Wilkinson wrote a response to the accreditation report and asked for corrections. He pointed out that "there were no limitations on teaching about these philosophies, but there were cautions about advocating them!"<br><br>Although the chairman of the commission invited a response to President Wilkinson's letter, none was ever received.<br><br>Perhaps the answer came from the 1976 Accreditation Committee. They explained in the introduction of their report:<br><br><i>Institutional evaluation, as practiced by the Commission on Colleges, begins with an institution's definition of</i>its own nature and purposes;<i>and a declaration of</i>its goals and objectives<i>pursuant upon that definition. The institution is then evaluated, essentially in</i>its own terms,<i>from the point of view of how well it appears to be living up to</i>its own self-definition;<i>and how well its goals and objectives fits that definition, as well as the extent to which they appear to be carried out and achieved in practice.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>That 1976 accreditation report was highly favorable. They found BYU "to be a vibrant and vital institution of genuine university caliber."<sup>10</sup><br><br>Perhaps this is enough reminiscing. Yesterday President Lee spoke with keen insight about the future of Brigham Young University, and he did it very well.<br><br>Perhaps young men do speak of the future because they have no past, and old men of the past because they have no future. However, there are 15 old men whose very lives are focused on the future. They are called, sustained, and ordained as prophets, seers, and revelators. It is their right to see as seers see; it is their obligation to counsel and to warn.<br><br>Immediately ahead is the appointment of a new president of BYU. A search committee has been appointed. Elder L. Tom Perry of the Quorum of the Twelve has been named chairman of that committee. Members of the committee are Elders M. Russell Ballard and Henry B. Eyring of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Presiding Bishop Merrill Bateman, and President Elaine Jack of the Relief Society.<br><br>They are now at work. The appointment of the next president of Brigham Young University is a crucial one. During the next 10 years, 59 percent of the faculty will retire. That comes about because of the enormous growth during the Wilkinson years. Imagine a 60 percent turnover in faculty!<br><br>The board has long since charged the administration to refine the hiring process to ensure that those who will come to replace you will be of the same quality of worthiness, spirit, and professional competency as you were at the beginning of your careers.<br><br>It is not always possible to give the watch care that you deserve. When things come to us a piece at a time, without an explanation of how they fit together, we may fail to see overall changes that are taking place.<br><br>Several years ago, the then president of the Relief Society asked why the name of one of the colleges at BYU was changed. It concerned her. She had watched the establishment of the College of Family Living, a decision that was far ahead of its time. The Joseph F. Smith Family Living Center, one of the largest buildings on campus at the time, was built to house the college. BYU stood unique in all the world in organizing such a college.<br><br>Why, she asked, did they change the name of the College of Family, Home, and Social Sciences? Her concern was that family would be lost to<i>social</i>and to<i>science.</i>The names of the courses were changed, things were shifted about, and their objectives shifted toward the professional and theoretical.<br><br>I thought that the Relief Society president asked a very insightful question, and I shared her concern. She was told that, since there was no counterpart in other universities to a college that concentrated on the family, there were academic reasons for the changes.<br><br>When researchers are too focused on what<i>is</i>, they may lose sight of what<i>ought</i>to be. A kitchen then may be regarded as a research lab, and a family as any group of unrelated people who spend the night under the same roof--defined that way because experts in the world convince the government that it is supposed to be that way.<br><br>Has something like that happened in the other colleges as well? Is the teaching of religion given a preeminent place, and are those who teach religion full-time recognized for the vital contribution they make to every other discipline? Has there been a drift in the College of Education? Has the responsibility to prepare teachers been divided up and parceled out and lost? Have words such as<i>training, instruction,</i>and<i>values</i>been brushed aside in favor of loftier theoretical and intellectual considerations? Consider these lines:<br><br><i>Today a professor in a garden relaxing</i><br><i>Like Plato of old in the academe shade</i><br><i>Spoke out in a manner I never had heard him</i><br><i>And this is one of the things that he said:</i><br><br><i>Suppose that we state as a tenet of wisdom</i><br><i>That knowledge is not for delight of the mind</i><br><i>Nor an end in itself, but a packet of treasure</i><br><i>To hold and employ for the good of mankind.</i><br><br><i>A torch or a candle is barren of meaning</i><br><i>Except it give light to men as they climb,</i><br><i>And thesis and tomes are but impotent jumble</i><br><i>Unless they are tools in the building of time.</i><br><br><i>We scholars toil on with the zeal of a miner</i><br><i>For nuggets and nuggets and one nugget more,</i><br><i>But scholars are needed to study the uses</i><br><i>Of all the great mass of data and lore.</i><br><br><i>And truly our tireless and endless researches</i><br><i>Need yoking with man's daily problems and strife,</i><br><i>For truth and beauty and virtue have value</i><br><i>Confirmed by their uses in practical life.</i><br>[Anonymous]<br><br>If students are going to partake of the fruit that is "desirable to make one happy," yeah, "desirable above all other fruit,"<sup>11</sup>which Lehi saw in his vision, they had better have their ladder leaning against the right tree. And they had better hold onto the iron rod while they are working their way toward it.<br><br>Now, in an absolutely remarkable consensus, leaders in politics, government, law enforcement, medicine, social agencies, and the courts recognize that the breakdown of the family is the most dangerous and frightening development of our time, perhaps in all human history. They are casting around for answers.<br><br>There is a desperate need for stable families and teachers who know how to teach values. Were we not better equipped a generation ago to produce them? Have some among us measured themselves against the world and its sophisticated intellectual standard? Have they "cast their eyes about as if they were ashamed"<sup>12</sup>and let go of the iron rod of Lehi's vision?<br><br>The prophet Jacob spoke of wasting one's time by following those who, "when they are learned they think they are wise." "To be learned is good," he further said, "<i>if</i>they hearken unto the counsels of God."<sup>13</sup><br><br>Your faculty committees are now at work on the self-evaluation of the university. We have heard good reports of their progress. Those committees might well look thoughtfully and long and prayerfully at these issues.<br><br>Surely you will remember that the board of trustees has directed that in order to contribute to the central mission of the Church, "BYU is a Church-related [and I might say parenthetically totally owned], very large, national, academically selective, teaching-oriented, undergraduate university offering both liberal arts and occupational degrees, with sufficiently strong graduate programs and research work to be a major university, but insufficient sponsored research and academic doctoral programs to be a graduate<i>research</i>institution."<sup>14</sup><br><br>Let them honor this direction from the minutes of the board of trustees: "Boards make policy and administrators implement policy.<br><br>"Boards must be informed of<i>all</i>proposed changes in basic<i>programs</i>and<i>key personnel</i>in order to achieve better understanding with the administrators."<sup>15</sup><br><br>Your committee, indeed all of you, would do well to read carefully Jacob's parable of the olive vineyard in the Book of Mormon. You might stand, as the Lord of the vineyard did, and weep when he saw that some branches "grew faster than the strength of the roots, taking strength unto themselves."<sup>16</sup>You might ask with him, as we have asked, "What could I have done more in my vineyard? Have I slackened mine hand, that I have not nourished it?"<sup>17</sup>And yet some branches bring forth bitter fruit. And you might do as the lord of the vineyard did and as Brother Brimhall did. They pruned out those branches that brought forth bitter fruit and grafted in cuttings from the nether most part of the vineyard.<br><br>And by so doing, "the Lord of the vineyard had preserved unto himself the natural fruit, which was most precious unto him from the beginning."<sup>18</sup><br><br>Now I must speak of the snow-white birds that Brother Brimhall saw in his dream or vision. I say<i>vision</i>because another old man, Lehi, told his son Nephi, "Behold, I have dreamed a dream; or, in other words, I have seen a vision."<sup>19</sup><br><br>We have now enrolled in our institutes of religion 198,000 students. We spend approximately $300 a year on each of them. We spend more than $7,500 a year on each student at BYU and over $12,000 per student on the Hawaii campus, all of it from tithing funds.<br><br>That inequity worries the Brethren. We are trying to reach out to those in public colleges, as well as to the college-age members who are not, for various reasons, in school. We have invited them to attend classes in the institutes.<br><br>General Authorities often speak at firesides in the Marriott Center. Lately we have been broadcasting these messages to the institute students by satellite. Last time I was assigned, I spoke from Seattle. I wanted to show an equal interest in and an equal desire to be close to those who do not attend Church schools.<br><br>They need our help, these snow-white birds who now must fly in an atmosphere that grows ever darker with pollution. It is harder now for them to keep their wings from being soiled or their flight feathers from being pulled out.<br><br>The troubles that beset President Brimhall were hardly new. Paul told Timothy that, even in that day, they were of ancient origin:<br><br>"As Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses," he told Timothy, "so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith."<sup>20</sup><br><br>Paul prophesied plainly that those challenges would face us in the last days. They seem to cycle back each generation. They emerged in the early '30s. The Brethren called all of the teachers of religion together for a summer school at Aspen Grove. President J. Reuben Clark Jr., speaking for the First Presidency, delivered the landmark address "The Charted Course of the Church in Education" (1938). That address should be read by every one of you every year. It is insightful; it is profound; it is prophetic; it is scripture.<br><br>That opposition emerged again in the institutes of religion in the early '50s, and the Brethren called the summer session of which I spoke earlier, with Elder Harold B. Lee of the Twelve as our teacher.<br><br>We need to be alert today. Although there are too many now in our schools for us to call all of you together, here at BYU much is being done to reaffirm standards. You yourselves have helped refine the credentials for one who will influence these snow-white birds of ours. That standard is temple worthiness, with a recommend in hand for members and a respect for our standards by those who are not.<br><br>But that is not all. There must be a feeling and a dedication and a recognition and acceptance of the mission of our Church schools. Those standards will and must be upheld. The largest block of the tithing funds spent at BYU goes for teaching salaries. We cannot justify spending the widow's mite on one who will not observe either the letter or the spirit of the contract he or she has signed. Every department chair, every director, every dean and administrator has a sacred obligation to assure that no one under their care will pull the snow-white birds from the sky or cause even one to say, "Alas, we can never fly again!" or to "believe only what could be demonstrated in a laboratory" or to think that "their prayer could go no higher than the ceiling, or to see no heaven--no hereafter."<br><br>We expect no more of anyone than that you live up to the contract you have signed. We will accept no less of you. The standards of the accreditation agencies expect no less of us. It is a matter of trust, for we are trustees.<br><br>I have said much about teachers. Many of you look after housing and food services or maintain the libraries, the museums, or the sports fields or keep the records, protect law and order and safety, service equipment, keep up the campus, publish materials, manage the finances, and a hundred other things. Without you this institution would come apart in a day. You are absolutely vital to the mission of Brigham Young University.<br><br>You obligation to maintain standards is no less, nor will your spiritual rewards fall one bit below those who are more visible in teaching and in administration.<br><br>All of you, together with the priesthood and auxiliary leaders from the community who devote themselves to these snow-white birds of ours, are an example, an ensign to the whole Church and to the world. The quality of your scholarship is unsurpassed, your service and dedication a miracle in itself. There is not now, nor has there ever been, anything that can compare with you. Much in the future of the restored Church depends on you. Your greater mission lies ahead.<br><br>The prophet Isaiah said:<br><br><i>He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength.</i><br><br><i>Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:</i><br><br><i>But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.</i><sup>21</sup><br><br>President Brigham Young told Karl G. Maeser: "I want you to remember that you ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God. That is all. God bless you. Good-bye."<sup>22</sup><br><br>Now I would, as one standing among those who hold the keys, do as President Young did, and that is invoke a blessing. I invoke the blessings of the Lord upon you, as teachers, as administrators, as members of the staff, as husbands and wives, brothers and sisters, parents and grandparents. May you be blessed in all that you do, that the Spirit of the Lord will be in your hearts, and that you will have the inspiration combined with knowledge to make you equal to the challenge of teaching the snow-white birds who come to you to learn how to fly. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Boyd K.

<h1>d Name - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, President Snow, for that introduction. It is a thrill for me to think of you in so many settings. I have tremendous respect for you, the work you are doing, and the decisions you are making at this time in life. If I have ever visited with any of you in the past, perhaps you noticed that my name has changed. I was married in April to a wonderful man who had also lost his spouse. I am appreciative that not only did President Snow use the correct name, but he also pronounced it correctly.<br><br>Has anyone ever mispronounced your name? I would guess that even though we each try to overlook such an error when it occurs, it always feels a little disappointing that the person doesn't really know you or perhaps has not given you much careful consideration.<br><br>After being Janette Hales for forty years, it has been no small project to change my name on written documents. One business sent my statement as Janette Hales Beck. When I called to make a correction, the secretary replied lightly, "Oh, Janette Hales Beckham is too long for the line on the computer."<br><br>My experiences have kept me thinking about names. In the state of Utah it is not unusual to have towns named after people in the Book of Mormon. I heard of a tourist couple who were driving through Utah and commenting on the unusual names of the towns. As they saw Nephi on the map, the wife said, "Do you suppose that is Nep-hi?" Her husband responded, "Perhaps Nephy." They decided to stop for lunch, and when the waitress brought their check, she asked if she could do anything else to help them. The gentleman said, "Tell us how to pronounce the name of this place." The waitress responded, "Burger King."<br><br>Just as a little child starts to develop a sense of identity as he or she repeatedly hears a name, I believe our names are important to our identity always. As a young mother I returned to take a class from the university I attended and found naturally that things were very much changed. I didn't know anyone. One day one of my past professors came into the room, noticed me, and said, "Janette Callister, how nice to see you." She turned to my current professor and said she remembered me as a good student. I still remember the good feeling I had that somebody really knew me and remembered me for good. Many of you perhaps share with me that great feeling of being recognized in a positive way when you are in a strange place.<br><br>One of my dear friends said her son tried out as a walk-on for the BYU football team. One day during the tedious drills, Coach LaVell Edwards said, "How 'ya doing, Hogan?" Her son came home with new enthusiasm and reported, "Coach Edwards knew my name." As a national leader in the football profession, Coach Edwards has become known as one who knows his players, both present and past, and calls them by name. This is no small accomplishment when you have names such as Elias Fahapula, Itula Mili, and Vaha Ongo-ongotau.<br><br>As a young wife I often gave my name as Mrs. Robert Hales at places like the cleaners or when doing business over the telephone. I realize I did that because it was easier to spell. When I said "Janette Hales," almost always someone would ask, "How do you spell it?" When I said "Mrs. Robert Hales," at least the Robert or Bob part was a little easier.<br><br>One day when one of my daughters was going through registration in college, she called to ask if I would come down and sign for her so she and her roommates wouldn't have to pay a deposit for the telephone. Evidently someone with a home and an account with the phone company could guarantee a new account. After standing in a very long line (which I'm sure most of you could relate to), I got to the clerk with the necessary paperwork filled out. To my surprise she said, "You don't have an account with us." I FELT NONEXISTENT! I knew I had been paying bills to the telephone company for twenty years, but my name was not Robert Hales. From that time on I made sure I had a name. I made sure my name was recorded on accounts, that it was spelled correctly, and I used my name.<br><br>Names are always important, and names have meaning. In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, naming is a priesthood ordinance, and it comes with a blessing. It is significant that we are known by the name our parents choose for us on the records of the Church and throughout our mortal lives. This given name has importance in all the priesthood ordinances, including the endowment and the sealing temple ordinances.<br><br>We use other names that are meaningful as we mature and take responsibility. New names bring blessings, and not just for babies.<br><br>Missionaries become "elder" and "sister" and all but forget their first names. This is a symbolic but very real manifestation of their putting aside their own pursuits to be joined to the purposes of the Lord. Other names bring blessings and responsibilities: Mother, Father, Bishop, President.<br><br>Before record keeping began, most people had only one name, such as John. As the population increased, it became necessary to distinguish between individuals with the same name. Descriptive information had to be added, such as John Christiansen (son of Christian), John Geldzahler (gold counter), or John Rotkoph (redhead).<br><br>This practice still happens today. Elder Packer told of one young boy who, until he was four years old, thought his name was Johnny . . . Stop. Sometimes we use as names or as nouns words that would be less limiting as adjectives. Have you ever heard parents say, "Oh, he's our athlete" or "She's our scholar"--as if we only have to be one thing. Our naming or descriptions may unintentionally limit a person's self-image: "Oh, she's our little tomboy" or "I guess he is our black sheep" (as if we each had to have one). A label is attached when a person may only be showing a temporary interest or a momentary struggle. Beware of names that are negative or limiting.<br><br>You might ask your parents how your name was selected. Listen to what Helaman tells his sons Nephi and Lehi about their names:<br><br><i>Behold, my sons, I desire that ye should remember to keep the commandments of God; and I would that ye should declare unto the people these words. Behold, I have given unto you the names of our first parents who came out of the land of Jerusalem; and this I have done that when you remember your names ye may remember them; and when ye remember them ye may remember their works; and when ye remember their works ye may know how that it is said, and also written, that they were good.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, my sons, I would that ye should do that which is good.</i>[Helaman 5:6–7]<br><br>Nephi and Lehi carried in their names the identity of the good works of their ancestors. Just as your name gives identity to you, your behavior can give identity to your own name. When you are born, the identity is given to you as your parents give you your name. An infant's identity is attached to the parents or caregivers. Children gradually enlarge their identity to family and even belongings, then later to friends, school, labels, styles. Yet we are reminded in Proverbs "Even a child is known by his doings" (20:11). Let's consider the identity we get through attachments. I remember many years ago attending a high school basketball tournament after my own children had all graduated. I had somehow forgotten the noise and enthusiasm of such an event. As we found our places in the upper balconies surrounded by students with the right colors, I quickly evaluated the appropriate behavior for the occasion. In my detached state, the scene momentarily became rather humorous to me. A student observing my momentary stupor seemed to increase his volume as he chanted, his eyes bulging and the veins prominently standing out on his neck: "We're Number One! We're Number One! We're Number One!" Something devious in me wanted so badly to whisper, "Number one what?" All we had done was buy a three-dollar ticket.<br><br>We're Number One--I call that identity by attachment. My team is outstanding, therefore I am outstanding. A bit temporary but a good feeling nonetheless. We might consider some of those attachments that give us temporary identity. It is easy to get stuck there. The right club, the right car, the right clothes may seem who we are--identity by attachment. There is danger in this. The Savior warned, "Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven" (3 Nephi 14:21). But he warned the hypocrite, "And then will I profess unto them: I never knew you" (verse 23). Strengthening our identity with our Heavenly Father takes a different kind of commitment. It has much more to do with our behavior than our belongings. Usually as a person matures spiritually, more of identity comes from developing one's own talents and increasing one's ability to serve others. As you mature, your life and characteristics will give identity to your name. Your work and behavior will better define who you are.<br><br>Perhaps many of you have read the story of President George Albert Smith that he referred to as "Your Good Name." He described an experience he had in his later years.<br><br><i>I became so weak as to be scarcely able to move. It was a slow and exhausting effort for me even to turn over in bed.</i><br><br><i>One day, under these conditions, I lost consciousness of my surroundings and thought I had passed to the Other Side.</i><br><br>George Albert Smith described what he saw and then wrote:<br><br><i>I saw a man coming towards me. I became aware that he was a very large man, and I hurried my steps to reach him, because I recognized him as my grandfather. . . . I remember how happy I was to see him coming. I had been given his name and had always been proud of it.</i><br><br><i>When Grandfather came within a few feet of me, he stopped. His stopping was an invitation for me to stop. Then--and this I would like the . . . young people never to forget--he looked at me very earnestly and said:</i><br><br><i>"I would like to know what you have done with my name."</i><br><br><i>Everything I had ever done passed before me as though it were a flying picture on a screen--everything I had done. Quickly this vivid retrospect came down to the very time I was standing there. My whole life had passed before me. I smiled and looked at my grandfather and said:</i><br><br><i>"I have never done anything with your name of which you need be ashamed."</i><br><br><i>He stepped forward and took me in his arms, and as he did so, I became conscious again of my earthly surroundings. My pillow was as wet as though water had been poured on it--wet with tears of gratitude that I could answer unashamed.</i><br><br>President Smith continued:<br><br><i>I have thought of this many times, and I want to tell you that I have been trying, more than ever since that time, to take care of that name. So I want to say to</i>. . .<i>the young men and women, to the youth of the Church and of all the world: Honor your fathers and your mothers. Honor the names that you bear, because some day you will have the privilege and the obligation of reporting to them (and to your Father in heaven) what you have done with their name.</i>[George Albert Smith,<i>Sharing the Gospel with Others</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1948), p. 111–12]<br><br>What a wonderful heritage George Albert Smith had received from his grandfather, and he was able to continue that righteous tradition. Perhaps some would relate more, however, to the experience of a young woman who shared her story in the<i>New Era.</i>This young woman, a convert, came from such a wildly dysfunctional family that she decided she had bad blood. She felt second class to lifelong Church members she considered "born in the covenant." Through a priesthood blessing the young woman was told that the story of Ruth had a special message for her. She read the story but at first didn't understand the significance. She writes what happened:<br><br><i>Finally, through the Spirit, it came to me. The key was at the very end of the book, where it mentions Ruth's part in the lineage of . . . Christ. Ruth, . . . the convert from a foreign land, showed such great faith that she became an integral part of the most blessed bloodline of all. This great woman, who came from generations of idol worshipers, would be a forebear of the Savior of the world.</i>[Kay Hago, "From One of the Best Families,"<i>New Era,</i>June 1991, p.20]<br><br>The young woman added that just one scripture story helped her find her place in life and the kingdom by teaching that no blessing would be withheld from her because she wasn't born to LDS parents. She found out she came from the best of families, our Heavenly Father's family. As this woman strengthened her identity with our Heavenly Father, she felt differently about her potential and her purpose in life.<br><br>We have accounts in biblical history when the change of a person's name becomes a symbol of a major change in a person's life. When the Lord appeared to Abram when he was ninety-nine, he said:<br><br><i>Walk before me, and be thou perfect. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.</i><br><br><i>Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.</i>[Genesis 17:1–5]<br><br>Jacob's name was changed to Israel at the time he saw God (see Genesis 32:28). The apostle Paul was known as Saul in his early life, but he was called Paul after the beginning of his ministry (see Acts 13:9).<br><br>A friend pointed out that Paul's references as he introduced himself changed as his ministry progressed. In Corinthians he referred to himself as an apostle and later as a servant (see Romans, Philippians, and Titus), a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and a fellow laborer (see Philemon).<br><br>It is interesting that as Paul's ministry progressed, his self-identity seemed to become less important or at least secondary to his work in representing the name of Jesus Christ and His teachings in establishing the Church. He had strengthened his identity with our Heavenly Father, and God's purpose became his purpose.<br><br>As I considered changing my name, I thought perhaps I could learn to be a better person. After deciding to remarry, there were many decisions to be made, such as where we would live. It seems a bit immature now that I think about it, but none of the decisions seemed more important to me than what I would be called. I had been Janette C. Hales for forty years, and it bothered me when one of my children said, "I guess we won't be the Hales' family any more." Of course we will, but they had to think through their mother having a different name. When the marriage announcements went out, someone from the Church magazines called the Young Women office and asked what I would be called after my marriage. My secretary instructed very clearly that I would be Janette Hales Beckham. The person on the other end of the line asked, "But will she be Sister Hales or Sister Beckham?"<br><br>A friend of mine suggested I might try her husband's advice to her: "If you give a poor talk, use your maiden name."<br><br>I remember well the day my first granddaughter was blessed and named Emily Janette. Her parents had chosen to give her my name. My heart reached out as her father, holding the Melchizedek Priesthood, took her in his arms and gave her a name and a blessing. I found myself wanting all the best for this little granddaughter. As I expressed my love and bore my testimony that day, I thought how my feelings must be in small measure how our Heavenly Father must feel as we take upon us the name of His Son, Jesus Christ. I am reminded that He wants all the best for us. With His name we have the opportunity to become changed and take upon ourselves His attributes.<br><br>For little Emily, now four years old, as well as for each one of us, this requires learning and experience as well as a great deal of commitment. Although we are each innocent at birth, we are basically self-centered, lacking in experience, and quite intent on survival.<br><br>At baptism Emily will take upon herself the name of Jesus Christ as most of us have done. That responsibility and blessing becomes our new identity. Attend baptisms. Listen to the words. I believe we have to make a conscious effort to strengthen our identity with our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.<br><br>Attend confirmations. Listen to the blessings when the Holy Ghost is given. We must each remind ourselves of our eternal identity.<br><br>Recently a young woman wrote to me with concerns about her progress. She wrote:<br><br><i>I have been wondering about making it back to our Heavenly Father. Worried is more like it. My mom once told me that to worry is to lack faith in God, so using that word kind of makes me cringe. But, to me I feel if I don't make it even when I try my hardest, it will be the biggest disappointment. I guess you could say that I have</i>little<i>faith.</i>Little<i>everything is more like it. You asked us what is the biggest problem facing the</i>[young people]<i>in the Church today. Among the answers some gave were drugs, alcohol, things like that. While those, along with teenage pregnancies, are rich among the community, I don't think that those are the main problems. Yes in the world, but not in the Church. To me, I see struggling to know who we are. Struggling to know the truth, wanting to be loved and cherished for what we do, needing lots of hugs and "I love you's," needing to feel needed.</i><br><br>This is a wonderful letter--so normal, so honest, so sincere. Sometimes we feel our faith is "little" when it is really just young and inexperienced. Sometimes when we add a long list of emotional needs to our need to know who we are, we confuse the issue. Focusing on finding ways to strengthen your personal identity will very likely help get some of the other needs met in the proper time. You do strengthen your identity with our Heavenly Father when you practice doing the things He has asked you to do.<br><br>How can you strengthen your own personal identity? I can tell you how in three simple words. Do good things! If that sounds too simplistic, let's try three other words. Keep the commandments! I could continue. Do more good! Love one another! Serve one another! I could continue. Keep a journal! President Spencer W. Kimball said through keeping a journal we come to know ourselves (see<i>TSWK,</i>p. 351; also see "President Kimball Speaks Out on Personal Journals,"<i>Ensign,</i>December 1980, p. 61). Three words that can mean so much: Be more Christlike!<br><br>The search for identity and purpose is fundamental to everyone. The scriptures are filled with events in the lives of those searching for answers to these fundamental questions. We read of the struggles of those who found false identity.<br><br>In Alma 1 we read of a man, "and his name was Nehor" (verse 15), "and he began to be lifted up in the pride of his heart, and to wear very costly apparel" (verse 6). And the people who found their identity in his false teachings "began to be proud" (verse 22). As those contentious people caused affliction to the Church, we read in Alma 1:24: "The hearts of many were hardened, and their names were blotted out, that they were remembered no more among the people of God."<br><br>Alma himself recounts to his son Helaman his own search for identity: "For I went about with the sons of Mosiah, seeking to destroy the church of God; but behold, God sent his holy angel to stop us by the way" (Alma 36:6).<br><br>Alma had such remorse for the awful things he had done, he longed to be nonexistent. In his words, "Oh, thought I, that I could be banished and become extinct both soul and body" (Alma 36:15). Then, as he continues to relate the torment he suffered remembering his sins, he said, "I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world" (verse 17). Alma was again in touch with his divine identity through a loving Savior. Speaking again to Helaman:<br><br><i>Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy.</i><br><br><i>Yea, methought I saw, even as our father Lehi saw, God sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels, in the attitude of singing and praising their God; yea, and my soul did long to be there.</i><br><br><i>But behold, my limbs did receive their strength again, and I stood upon my feet, and did manifest unto the people that I had been born of God.</i>[Alma 36:21–23]<br><br>In the Church we learn about our identity very young in our families. In family home evening and in Primary we sing "I am a child of God." Children strengthen their identity as they learn to be nice, don't hit, help mommy; but it becomes more complex: say you're sorry, tell the truth, do your homework, forgive your brother, say your prayers.<br><br>As we grow and live and learn, as we love and serve one another, we understand how our choices, our behavior, help us become who we are. Alma warned his son Corianton that "wickedness never was happiness" (see Alma 41:10). He teaches him that the kind of person or the identity he develops in this life is the identity he will have in the Resurrection.<br><br><i>Therefore, my son, see that you are merciful unto your brethren; deal justly, judge righteously, and do good continually; and if ye do all these things then shall ye receive your reward; yea, ye shall have mercy restored unto you again; ye shall have justice restored unto you again; ye shall have a righteous judgment restored unto you again; and ye shall have good rewarded unto you again.</i><br><br><i>For that which ye do send out shall return unto you again, and be restored.</i>[Alma 41:14–15]<br><br>Alma understood the change and the behavior that helps us develop our divine and eternal identity. Bruce R. McConkie spoke of the doctrine of the new birth:<br><br><i>There is a natural birth, and there is a spiritual birth. . . . The natural birth creates a natural man, and the natural man is an enemy to God. . . .</i><br><br><i>The spiritual birth comes after the natural birth. . . . It is to begin a new life, . . . a spiritual life.</i>[Bruce R. McConkie,<i>A New Witness for the Articles of Faith</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1985), p. 282]<br><br>For Alma, the change took place in a dramatic way. For many, it is a gradual change. Those changes in behavior can best be observed as we see good people become refined spiritually as they serve and sacrifice and honor eternal covenants.<br><br>Just prior to my first husband's death, he spoke in a ward conference. He told of a couple who had been coming to him as patients for twenty-five years. In the early years one would drop the other at the office and then run errands while the eye examination took place.<br><br>As years passed, each spouse would wait while the other was being examined. As more years passed, he noticed the wife was the driver, and she would assist her husband as he came into the office. Then they started coming to the examining room together. In time the wife started coming to the office alone. My husband inquired about her husband's health. She explained that she wasn't able to lift or care for him alone anymore and he was living in a rest home. She said, "I go every day, but I don't believe he even knows me. This morning I said, 'Clarence, do you know who I am?'" He studied her face carefully and then said, "No, but I know you're someone who loves me." Perhaps that is all that really matters. Are you recognized as one who loves others?<br><br>Life is about learning how to be more like our Savior, to strengthen our identity with Him. We learn to sacrifice our wants for the needs of others. We learn to love as He loved.<br><br>Our prophets have said there is only one name under heaven whereby man can be saved. It is the name of Jesus Christ (see D&amp;amp;C 18:23).<br><br>Does changing my name make me a different person? I want to be a better person. Marriage gives me new opportunity to love, share, and serve; but changing my name was also a reminder of the importance of a name and the blessing of His name, the name of Jesus Christ. Each one of us through the Atonement can leave behind that identity that would hold us back or tear us down. We can repent, forgive, forget. We can strengthen our identity with our Heavenly Father as we change and as we serve. There are many characteristics in the scriptures that distinguish a righteous people--those who take upon themselves the name of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Do any of you experience feelings of trauma or self-doubt when you are going through times of change--a new school year, a new job, a mission? There is great opportunity that comes with change. That is the way the gospel works in our lives. We have the opportunity to change, to become better, to strengthen our identity with our Heavenly Father. Perhaps this year will be a significant time for you to strengthen your identity in good ways.<br><br>As we each consider our own names,<br><br>I believe the scriptures will be a helpful guide: "A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches" (Proverbs 22:1).<br><br>The Savior warned of those who would have a false identity.<br><br><i>Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</i><br><br><i>Ye shall know them by their fruits. . . .</i><br><br><i>A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. . . .</i><br><br><i>Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.</i>[Matthew 7:15–16, 18, 20]<br><br>As we strengthen our identity with our Heavenly Father, it is important that we revere the name of God and His Son, Jesus Christ.<br><br><i>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.</i>[Exodus 20:7]<br><br>As we follow the teachings of our Heavenly Father, it is important that we respect and revere the names of one another. I read a study by the National School Safety Center. The center's executive director, Ronald G. Stephens, stated that "fourth-through-12th graders around the nation . . . mentioned name-calling, cursing or staring . . . as the most common triggers for violence" (quoted in Ellen Graham, "Language of Childhood: No Expletives Deleted,"<i>The Wall Street Journal,</i>17 July 1995, p. B-1).<br><br>The old saying "Sticks and stones will break my bones, but names will never hurt me" is probably not true. We should use respectful names and respect the proper names of others. Our Heavenly Father would expect that of us. As the Lord has told us, He will not hold those guiltless who take His name in vain. The Lord has also told us that he will not forsake those that know his name and trust in him (see Psalms 9:9–10).<br><br>Surely our Heavenly Father could recognize us as His children if our behavior resembled those who believe on His name.<br><br>In Moroni we read:<br><br><i>And none were received unto baptism save they took upon them the name of Christ, having a determination to serve him to the end.</i><br><br><i>And after they had been received unto baptism, and were wrought upon and cleansed by the power of the Holy Ghost, they were numbered among the people of the church of Christ; and their names were taken, that they might be remembered and nourished by the good word of God, to keep them in the right way, to keep them continually watchful unto prayer, relying alone upon the merits of Christ, who was the author and the finisher of their faith.</i>[Moroni 6:3–4]<br><br>The changing of a name is symbolic. The change in us must be real. As we strengthen our identity with our Heavenly Father, surely it will be evident in our behavior.<br><br>President Hinckley has spoken to us regarding our divine identity. He has said:<br><br><i>You are</i>[sons and daughters]<i>of God, each of you, endowed with something of his divinity. It is a part of your eternal nature. You cannot afford to live beneath that portion of divinity.</i>. . .<br><br><i>You will not need to be reminded to be virtuous, you will not need to be reminded to be clean, if you will remember always that you are</i>[sons and daughters]<i>of God, that a portion of his divinity is within you, and that you must make an accounting to him.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley,<i>The Wonderful Thing That Is You and the Wonderful Good You Can Do</i>(Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1988), pp. 3, 8]<br><br>May we remember as we partake of the sacrament each Sunday the great blessing it is to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ. Listen to the words that we covenant with our Eternal Father:<br><br><i>That</i>[we]<i>are willing to take upon</i>[us]<i>the name of thy Son, and always remember him, and keep his commandments which he hath given</i>[us],<i>that</i>[we]<i>may always have his Spirit to be with</i>[us]. [Moroni 4:3]<br><br>May we strengthen our identity with our Heavenly Father and remember that we have taken upon ourselves the name of His Son is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ.

<h1>e Lord Is My Light:&quot; Conquering Fear with Faith - Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Today marks a fresh beginning for students, teachers, administrators, and staff, as well as parents, friends, and all those connected with a new school term. Others listening may be charting unfamiliar courses as life's circumstances constantly change. But as we all know, walking an unknown path--even when we have chosen to pursue that course--comes with feelings of excitement and joy that are sometimes shrouded with apprehension and fear.<br><br>In a few months Rex and I will open a new chapter in<i>our</i>lives as he retires from the presidency of BYU. We leave you with our love and appreciation along with our hope that your future will be bright and rewarding. It is not easy for us to close the book on this segment of our journey that has been so blessed with the intermingling of your lives. As Rex and I walk hand-in-hand into our new adventure, we want to walk in faith instead of in fear.<br><br>With a desire to remind myself and others who might have cause to be afraid of new challenges, I want to share some thoughts concerning why we should not be fearful. Many years ago Elder Franklin D. Richards said that the consequence of fear is that it "destroys faith and deprives us of many blessings" (<i>CR,</i>October 1968, p. 113). Understanding this concept helps us realize the reason we are so often cautioned against fear in the scriptures. Comforting words from the Lord tell us: "Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee" (Isaiah 41:10).<br><br>Recently I found something I had written about my childhood that brought faith and fear into perspective for me. As a child, I failed to see the symbolism in the experience, but as an adult, standing at the edge of an unknown path, it now holds great meaning.<br><br>When I was very young, my family lived in a beautiful little community in New Jersey that surrounded a lake. It was a child's paradise. In summer we splashed in cool water, climbed lush trees, and picked wild flowers and berries. In winter, snow and ice gave variety to our play as we skated, sledded, and built carrot-nosed snowmen. In any season we rarely tired of the great outdoors and reluctantly ventured inside only when it was dark.<br><br>One summer evening was an exception. I had been invited to a friend's house to watch a favorite television program. When it was time to go, I said good-bye and began walking home along the winding, wooded path between our two houses.<br><br>In the darkness, the path I thought I knew became a fearsome jungle. I couldn't see the occasional gnarled roots and sharp rocks protruding from the packed-down earth, and I tripped and fell. With my face in the dirt, sobs of frustration and fear wracked my seven-year-old body. As my tears subsided, I remained face down and immobile for a few seconds, fearing that I might be eaten by monsters, which were surely lurking behind every tree.<br><br>Then I remembered that before leaving home, my brother had tucked his penlight into my pocket, explaining that it would be dark when I returned. Relieved to find it just where he had placed it, I stood up, brushed off the dirt, and turned on the light. Although it produced only a dime-sized circle on the ground where I pointed it, and I couldn't get the full vision of what was on either side or ahead of me, I<i>could</i>see where to step safely. And so, hesitantly, I headed for home, hoping that I was going in the right direction.<br><br>My confidence increased with my new visibility, and, glancing up for a brief moment, I became aware of another light at the end of the path. I was relieved to recognize it as my porch light. Someone who cared about my safe return had turned it on for me. I was still groping step by step along the path, but with my destination in sight my fear diminished.<br><br>Then, suddenly, my little circle of light grew broader. At first I questioned the power of my tiny penlight, so I stopped and turned it around to examine its intensity. Despite the small circle of light now shining in my face, the path ahead was flooded with light illuminated by another source. Puzzled, I looked up and could see my older brother standing a few feet away, directing his Boy Scout flashlight on my path. With this added light came a new perspective. I could now see my path more clearly, and with increased vision I was aware of the dangers on either side.<br><br>I couldn't see the details along the entire stretch of my journey, but with my light now strengthened by my brother's and the porch light marking my goal, I no longer felt afraid. I held my little light tightly, letting it shine where the brilliance of his led the way. That joint effort glowed gloriously. I could see now that each step in the right direction took me closer to my destination. With my tiny circle joining my brother's larger light, we walked together toward home.<br><br>When we were almost there I asked, "How did you know I needed help, that I couldn't find my way alone?"<br><br>"I just knew," was his only reply. And he took my hand and led me safely inside.<br><br>Each of us who comes to this earth has had a light tucked into our pocket by a kind and loving Elder Brother so that we might see our path of life more clearly. He has told us, "I am the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world" (D&amp;amp;C 93:2). How comforting it is to know that we are better prepared for the darkness of this world than we sometimes realize. And when our path becomes dark and we trip along the way, the monsters of life can seem very real as we lie in the dirt, wondering what will become of us. At those times we need to remember our gift of light and with renewed faith put fears aside, pick ourselves up, brush ourselves off, and go on. "Fear not," the Savior reassures us, "I am with you always."<br><br>Our "porch light" is the gospel of Jesus Christ that shines as a beacon, pointing out our destination and directing our footsteps. His gospel is exactly why we need not fear. We can find comfort in knowing that a loving Heavenly Father has turned on the porch light to protect us from the darkness of the world.<br><br>But when we lose sight of that destination and our little light becomes dim, we lose our way and falter. Then, how important it is for us to humble ourselves before our Heavenly Father in prayer seeking guidance. And sometimes even when we do not ask, our Elder Brother "just knows" when to shine his light along our darkened path, guiding us and giving needed perspective so that we can find our way safely home.<br><br>Even now for brief moments I occasionally feel like that seven-year-old child as I look out at the darkness of the unknown. At such times I remind myself that it was the light shed along my wooded childhood path that took away my fear and led me safely home. I was not given an easier path to walk--the gnarled roots and sharp rocks were still there--but with light I could see where I was going and was given help in getting there. We all need help. We cannot walk our paths alone in darkness.<br><br>The words of a favorite hymn express this concept beautifully:<br><br><i>The Lord is my light; then why should I fear?</i><br><i>By day and by night his presence is near. . . .</i><br><br><i>The Lord is my light; tho clouds may arise,</i><br><i>Faith, stronger than sight, looks up thru the skies.</i>. . .<br><br><i>My weakness in mercy he covers with pow'r,</i><br><i>And, walking by faith, I am blest ev'ry hour.</i><br>["The Lord Is My Light,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 89]<br><br>That night long ago I was grateful for a sensitive, caring older brother who with his light helped me return home. Today, many years and experiences of life later, I want to tell you of my gratitude for our sensitive and caring Elder Brother, Jesus Christ. I know that he is the Savior and the Light of this world. I know that he stands ready to share his light with each of us, to help us find our way out of darkness and back to our heavenly home. I know that he has given us the gospel as a beacon to direct our footsteps. I pray that we will remember our gift of light, keep our eye on the light of the gospel, and walk in the path of righteousness illuminated by the light and life of our Elder Brother, Jesus Christ, in whose name I pray. Amen.<br><br><i>Janet G. Lee, wife of Rex E. Lee, gave this devotional address at Brigham Young University on 5 September 1995.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>y, Honesty, and Ethics - Rex E. Lee - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Today is literally one of the highlights of my life. My soul is filled with joy and thanksgiving. From the time I was a little boy, the opening day of school has always been one of excitement and anticipation. It is for this reason that a high point of my years as president of BYU has been the opportunity for Janet and me to share some thoughts with you at the beginning of each fall semester.<br><br>This one, of course--for reasons Brother Hafen has explained--is also laden with an extra element of emotion. It is our seventh September devotional, and we realize that it will be our last. I have appreciated more than words can tell the expressions of support, loyalty, and love that I have received from you, and I want you to know how deeply Janet and I care for each of you and the great hopes that we have for your success and happiness not only during your time here at BYU, but also throughout this life and the next.<br><br>It is for this reason that I have pondered and prayed long over what message I want to leave with you on this very special day, my last devotional at the beginning of a new school year. There are so many hopes I have for each of you. I want you to be well educated, in the fullest sense of that word. I want you to be learned in the wisdom of the world. I want your education to help you to be happier and give you a fuller understanding of the awesome significance of what it means that in these last days the Father and the Son have actually come here to this earth and personally chosen a prophet through whom the great prophecies of Daniel and Peter have come to pass and through whom a restitution of all things is possible.<br><br>We could discuss so many things as a consequence of these grand truths. I have chosen one topic, and I hope it will be helpful to you. The principle of living that I want to discuss with you today can carry anyone of several possible labels. A very popular one, and a good one, is<i>ethics.</i>Another is<i>honesty.</i>Frankly, the one that I slightly prefer is<i>integrity</i>because for me it includes not only the values implicit in the other two, but also reminds us that what we are striving for is a wholeness and completeness of all that is good. As President Kimball has taught us: "Integrity is one of the cornerstones of character. . . . [It] is a state or quality of being complete, undivided, or unbroken" (<i>TSWK,</i>p. 192).<br><br>Whatever we call it, the quality we are talking about is easier to illustrate than it is to label or to define, and both negative as well as affirmative illustrations are available. At the negative end is the classic statement of Leona Helmsley that "only little people pay taxes" or Ivan Boesky's equally insightful counsel to UCLA business students in 1986 that "greed is a good thing" or Leo Durocher's well-known observation that "nice guys finish last."<br><br>There is a<i>Peanuts</i>cartoon in which Charlie Brown first shot the arrow and then drew the bull's-eye and the rest of the supporting target around his arrow. When Lucy complained that that was not the way it was supposed to be done, Charlie Brown responded, "If you do it my way, you never miss!"<br><br>Let me give you an example at the opposite end of the spectrum. It involves a boyhood hero of mine, Ted Williams, one of the greatest baseball players of all time. A. Thomas Young, president and chief operating officer of Martin Marietta Corporation, who observed that "ethics will continue to be the issue of the 90s," reports Williams' experience as follows:<br><br><i>More than 30 years ago, Ted Williams was closing out his career with the Boston Red Sox. He was suffering from a pinched nerve in his neck that season.</i><br><br><i>"The thing was so bad," he later explained, "that I could hardly turn my head to look at the pitcher. "</i><br><br><i>For the first time in his career he batted under .300, hitting just .254 with 10 home runs. He was the highest salaried player in sports, making $125,000. The next year, the Red Sox sent him the same contract.</i><br><br><i>When he got the contract, Williams sent it back with a note saying that he would not sign it until they gave him the full pay</i>cut<i>allowed.</i><br><br><i>"I was always treated fairly by the Red Sox when it came to contracts," Williams said. "Now they were offering me a contract I didn't deserve. And I only wanted what I deserved."</i><br><br><i>Williams cut his own salary by 25 percent, raised his batting average by 62 points and closed out a brilliant career by hitting a home run in his final at bat.</i>[A. Thomas Young, "Ethics in Business,"<i>Vital Speeches of the Day,</i>15 September 1992, pp. 725–26; emphasis in original]<br><br>Wallace F. Smith, a Berkeley business school professor, defines ethics as "the inherent inner voice, the source of self-control in the absence of external pressure or compulsion" ("Readers Report,"<i>Business Week,</i>4 May 1992, p. 11).<br><br>This Ted Williams story is, I submit, the classic illustration. This great hero did what he did because he was exercising "self-control in the absence of external pressure or compulsion." My own favorite definition comes from Potter Stewart, an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court. He defines ethics as "knowing the difference between what you have a right to do and what is the right thing to do."<br><br>Justice Stewart is also one of my heroes and was one of history's finest justices and lawyers. I hope that throughout your lives you will remember and ponder his advice about the distinction between what you have a right to do and what is the right thing to do. You have a legal right, for example, to gossip, lie (unless you do it under oath), cut corners across BYU grass, burn flags, read pornography, be disrespectful to your parents, criticize and attack your Church leaders, apostatize from the Church, pay less than a full tithing, smoke cigarettes, be insensitive to your family members' needs, sit by silently doing nothing while your neighbor drowns--all the while writing a poem called "Ode to a Drowning Man"--or wear a red sweater in Cougar stadium the afternoon of November 18, when the Cougars play the University of Utah. But the fact that you have a right to do these things does not make any of them the right thing to do, and ethics, as defined by Justice Stewart, consists of knowing the difference between the two.<br><br>One of the most important observations to make about ethics or integrity or whatever we call it is the danger of over-compartmentalization, that is, treating ethical issues as something separate and apart from other aspects of what we do. A law student reported, for example, that when she raised a question in one of her first-year classes whether a certain practice might be ethical, the professor responded, "You will take your ethics course next year." When I read this law professor's response, it reminded me of Elder Neal A. Maxwell's insightful observation that:<br><br><i>Developing congruency and avoiding the compartmentalization of one's life is, of course, necessary for the wholeness and integrity we all crave, but which is so elusive at times. So many of us have a "public self" and a "private self." Jesus made it crystal clear that outer appearances and inner feelings must, ultimately, coincide. If the teachings of the gospel about honesty make for an honest tithe but wash against an attitudinal wall in terms of business practices, honesty is being applied differentially. We are saying that "honesty is the best policy--part of the time!"</i>[<i>"A More Excellent Way"</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1973), pp. 126–127]<br><br>One of the best tests of whether we are or are not compartmentalizing our lives, I submit, is whether we would be willing to give our pet parrot to the town gossip.<br><br>I also like Elder Bruce R. McConkie's explanation that these principles of ethics, which are so universally accepted, and properly so, are grounded in more than common sense and respect for others. In his words:<br><br><i>In teaching the gospel, it is far less effective to say "Be honest, for honesty is the best policy," and then to reason from a social standpoint why this is so, than to link honesty with the gospel out of which it grows by teaching: "Wo unto the liar, for he shall be thrust down to hell." (2 Nephi 9:34.) It is only when gospel ethics are tied to gospel doctrines that they rest on a sure and enduring foundation and gain full operation in the lives of the saints.</i>[<i>A New Witness for the Articles of Faith</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1985), p. 700]<br><br>I believe that one of the most important indicators of how honest we are is the seriousness with which we keep agreements that we have made. One of the most sobering problems facing our society today, in my opinion, is the failure of so many people simply to do what they have agreed to do. It is becoming quite commonplace, for example, not only for professional athletes but also for others to insist on "renegotiating" their contracts because they conclude that they are now in a position to make a better deal than the one to which they earlier committed themselves.<br><br>A bit more subtle perhaps, but certainly just as important, are our obligations to organizations and institutions to which we belong, and with whom we have made certain commitments, either expressly or by virtue of our membership or affiliation.<br><br>One of the institutions--and the people who compose it--to whom we have an integrity obligation is the nation of which we are citizens. In the case of most of us, that country is the United States of America. For me, the most consistently dismaying lack of individual integrity in this respect is the failure of rather large numbers of American citizens to pay their income taxes. Equally dismaying are the reasons given by some of these people. The two most common are that the income tax is either unconstitutional or (in the case of some LDS Church members) inconsistent with gospel principles. Each of these positions is absurd. Concerning constitutionality, the income tax is explicitly authorized by the Constitution itself. The Sixteenth Amendment states, in words that could not be more plain: "The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes." I have spent a good part of my life arguing and litigating over what is and is not constitutional. But I have never understood how any rational human being can take the position that a part of the Constitution itself is unconstitutional. And the notion that the anti-income tax position is rooted in gospel principles is equally insupportable in light of President Harold B. Lee's statement describing as "vicious and wicked" the practice of those "who are taking the law into their own hands by refusing to pay their income tax because they have some political disagreement with constituted authorities" ("Admonitions for the Priesthood of God,"<i>Ensign,</i>January 1973, pp. 105, 106).<br><br>Another opportunity to demonstrate our institutional integrity is provided by our membership in the BYU community, whose Honor Code is one of our distinguishing features. Some people are fond of pointing out, and very correctly so, that some aspects of our Honor Code are founded on principles of fundamental morality and integrity that would apply to any member of the Church and any ethical person regardless of affiliation or nonaffiliation with BYU--or for that matter with the Church. Examples are those principles dealing with observing the criminal laws of the land, academic honesty, and sexual morality. But it does not follow that we have a two-tiered Honor Code, the first tier consisting of those values that are to be taken seriously, and whose violation should be a matter for some kind of official university response, whereas those in the second tier, most notably our Dress and Grooming Standards, fall into a category of admonitions that we might call good ideas if you're into that kind of thing, but since they're not required for a temple recommend, don't sweat it.<br><br>What this two-tiered approach ignores, of course, is that there is another overarching principle at work, not applicable to members of the Church in general. It has to do with keeping the deals we have made, precisely the kind of thing that we have been talking about this morning. Members of the Church at large have not signed a formal commitment in the presence of their bishop to keep all aspects of the Honor Code, with solemn assurances that the applicants are serious about the commitments they have made and will honor them.<br><br>The fact that you and I have made such a commitment should be the end of the matter. Having made such a formal promise, we are bound by it just as Karl G. Maeser was bound by the hypothetical lines of his famous circle. That's what we mean by honor, and that's what we mean by integrity. A different standard does apply to those of us at BYU, a standard that has been determined very consciously by our board of trustees, and which each of us has solemnly agreed to follow. I hope that no one on this campus will ever adopt a two-tiered approach to the Honor Code, observing those provisions that in the individual's view are important and disregarding the others. They are all important precisely because we have agreed to honor them.<br><br>In conclusion, let me tell you about one of our alumni who met the full measure of honesty. He is a retired gentleman, living on a modest pension, who sat in my office a few years ago and told me that in the 1930s he had attended BYU for one quarter. Due to some administrative error, he had never been billed for the $32 that at that time, according to his recollection, was the amount BYU charged for a quarter's tuition. He told me, "For over 50 years that unpaid tuition has weighed heavily on my mind, and I want to make it right. You tell me what I owe, and I will pay." I told him that he owed us absolutely nothing. The statute of limitations on that claim had run a half century ago. He patiently pointed out that he was not talking about a legal obligation but a moral one.<br><br>When I could see that nothing less than satisfaction of my estimate of the present value of that original $32 obligation would calm his soul, I told him that I thought a reasonable present value for the unpaid tuition of years ago would be about $500. He thought about my answer for a minute and then said, "Could I have a little time to pay it off?" We worked out a payment schedule, and that obligation has now been completely satisfied.<br><br>I refer back to Elder McConkie's observation that for a believing, practicing Latter-day Saint, we are honest and ethical not only because it is the best policy but also because it is solidly tied to the principles of restored truth. Everything we do should be guided by restored truth, by our conviction that once again prophets walk upon the earth, and we have the benefit, both through modern scripture and through their teachings, of the will of our Heavenly Father. It's not just another Church. Joseph Smith really did see the Father and the Son, the priesthood is once again on the earth, and the Book of Mormon is exactly what it purports to be, a new witness for Christ received by revelation and translated under the direct inspiration of our Heavenly Father. We must first secure our knowledge of these truths, and they will then become the foundation for everything else we do. That honesty and integrity in all things and with respect to all persons and institutions may be one of the results of that conviction is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Rex E.

<h1>ter God’s Own Heart - Vaughn J. Featherstone - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am delighted to be with all of you here this morning. I appreciate your being here. I would like to speak about having a heart like unto God's own heart, and I want to enlarge on that in a few minutes. However, first I would like to pay a special tribute to a man here at BYU whom I respect greatly--<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/speakers/hugh-nibley/"><span style="color: #33cccc;">Dr. Hugh Nibley</span></a>, a man who quietly, but brilliantly loves, honors, and defends this great Church. He is a man of great integrity, rare wisdom, and unmatched judgment. What a great blessing he has been to the Church over the years. I love, honor, and respect him. I think no one has ever had to ask which side of an issue Dr. Nibley is on. His work with the Book of Mormon and ancient studies is profound. His talk "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/hugh-nibley_leaders-managers/"><span style="color: #33cccc;">Leaders and Managers</span></a>" is one of the great talks ever given at BYU. All are wonderful tributes to the Church. There is a wise saying that states: "Never walk on the message." Dr. Nibley has never done that, not once. There are far, far too many who do.<br><br>BYU has had a profound influence on the Church in many ways. <a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/speakers/henry-b-eyring/"><span style="color: #33cccc;">Dr. Henry B. Eyring</span></a>, who is the commissioner of Church Education, is in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Two of the Quorum of the Twelve are past presidents of BYU--<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/speakers/dallin-h-oaks/"><span style="color: #33cccc;">Dallin Oaks</span></a> and <a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/speakers/jeffrey-r-holland/"><span style="color: #33cccc;">Jeffrey Holland</span></a>. I think that is a marvelous tribute to this university and to the student body here.<br><br>Years ago Russell LeBaron Briggs, a member of the Harvard Law School, gave a speech. He told of a student who came in one day, and the dean asked him why he had not been there the day before to take a test. The student said, "I wasn't feeling very well, sir."<br><br>Dean Briggs said, "I think you will find, my young friend, that in life most of the work in the world is done by people who aren't feeling very well."<br><br>We will never know how much <a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/speakers/rex-e-lee/"><span style="color: #33cccc;">Rex Lee</span></a> has done while he was not feeling very well. He has added greatly to the stature of BYU. He is also a man of great integrity, a man who has been a wonderful president here and has lifted and moved this institution. We should never forget the days of President Rex Lee. He has done it well and as well as it could be done, and he did it when he was not feeling very well. God bless you, President Lee.<br><br>I just want to say a word about <a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/speakers/lavell-edwards/"><span style="color: #33cccc;">LaVell Edwards</span></a>. He is a great coach; I love him. He is a great man. There are divergent opinions about coaching. You can search this whole world over and find excellent coaches, but you will find few men who love youth and have absolute integrity and an uncompromising standard of values as does LaVell. He stands head and shoulders above almost all others in his profession in character--and character does count.<br><br>I imagine sometimes LaVell feels like the man who went into an institution in southern Utah to get a loan. He talked with the banker for about a half an hour, and finally the banker said, "I don't know whether to give you the loan or not. I'll tell you what. I have one glass eye, and if you can tell me which one it is, I will let you have the loan."<br><br>Without any hesitation the man said, "It's your left eye."<br><br>The banker said, "Yes, but how did you know so quickly?"<br><br>"It's the one that showed a little sympathy."<br><br>I imagine LaVell could appreciate a little sympathy about now.<br><br>I mentioned I would come back to this theme of having a heart like unto God's own heart. David is the only man I know who is described as having a heart like unto God's own heart, in 1 Samuel 13:14 and again in Acts 13:22.<br><br>President Harold B. Lee said:<br><br><i>It is my conviction that every man who will be called to a high place in this Church will have to pass</i>[through]<i>tests not devised by human hands, by which our Father numbers them as a united group of leaders willing to follow the prophets of the Living God and be loyal and true as witnesses and exemplars of the truths they teach.</i>[<i>CR,</i>April 1950, p. 101]<br><br>I qualify. I am willing to raise my hand high and go where they want me to go and do what they want me to do and be what they want me to be. I believe with all of my heart that as we measure up, we are going to be tested greatly in this life, more than you will know at this instant. As we think about having a heart like unto God's own heart, let me talk about the Atonement for a few minutes.<br><br>The Atonement was the most exquisite, supernal act of charity ever performed in all eternity. It required the greatest courage and absolute discipline, more than we would ever believe or suppose, and it will have the greatest impact on mankind "so long as time shall last, or the earth shall stand, or there shall be one man upon the face thereof" (Moroni 7:36).<br><br>The Atonement opens the eyes of our understanding as to what God's own heart is like. It must have been difficult not only for Jesus to go through but for his Heavenly Father to go through as well.<br><br>All of my life I have spoken a great deal about charity, about love, and about mercy; and somehow I have left justice undone and thought justice would take care of itself. Isn't it interesting that in Alma 42:24 (emphasis added) it describes mercy and justice, and it states all "<i>his</i>demands" regarding justice. When it refers to mercy, however, it says, "And ... mercy claimeth all which is<i>her</i>own." We name our sons Justin and Justice, and we name our daughters Faith, Hope, Charity, and Mercy.<br><br>When we think about justice, we have to go back to Alma 12:32, where he talks about "justice ... according to the supreme goodness of God." Lately I have decided that I need to talk more about justice. We don't understand justice completely, and there is so much out in the world that seems unjust and unfair that it is probably a good time to discuss this.<br><br>Who suffers most, the guilty or the innocent? The adulterer can go see the bishop. If he or she has truly repented, the bishop can say, on behalf of the Church, "You are forgiven." And they leave the office and that burden is lifted. What about the innocent? Who suffers most, the adulterer or the mother and father with a wayward son or daughter?<br><br><i>Where is my wand'ring boy tonight--<br>The boy of my tend'rest care,<br>The boy that was once my joy and light,<br>The child of my love and prayer?</i><br><br><i>Once he was pure as morning dew,<br>As he knelt at his mother's knee;<br>No face was so bright, no heart more true,<br>And none was so sweet as he.</i><br><br><i>O could I see you now, my boy,<br>As fair as in olden time,<br>When prattle and smile made home a joy,<br>And life was a merry chime!</i><br><br><i>Go for my wand'ring boy tonight;<br>Go, search for him where you will;<br>But bring him to me with all his blight,<br>And tell him I love him still.</i><br><br><i>O where is my boy tonight?<br>O where is my boy tonight?<br>My heart o'erflows, for I love him, he knows;<br>O where is my boy tonight?</i><br>["Where Is My Boy Tonight?" words and music by Reverend Robert Lowry, 1877]<br><br>When will that hurt and suffering go away? It won't--not until the straying son or daughter comes back home. Should the innocent suffer? The parents quite often are innocent; and they hurt and they ache and they pray, and the pain will not go away.<br><br>Who suffers most, the incest perpetrator or the incest victim? Little ones are sometimes violated at a very tender age.<br><br>Who suffers most--the fornicator? the thief? those involved in drugs, homosexuality, and other perversions--or the innocent? Or do sometimes the innocent suffer more--the paraplegic, the quadriplegic, those with debilitating diseases, the "innocent" man or woman who has been involved in divorce, and dozens of others? I believe sometimes the innocent suffer far, far more than the guilty--and that would not be justice, would it? It wouldn't be fair.<br><br>When we think about those who go to the bishop and confess concerns, we often find that lying takes place. Now lying is an interesting thing. A person can lie to a bishop and lie to a stake president--or to a General Authority--but they can't lie to the Spirit. Often people who have been offended have told the truth whereas the offending one tells a lie to the bishop, and the bishop has a difficult time deciding who is telling the truth. Please remember the fault is not in the bishop, and the fault is not in the stake president--for goodness' sake. The fault is in the liar, and that is where we need to put the blame--not with the wonderful bishops and stake presidents.<br><br>If I walked down the street and had $200 in my pocket, and someone walked up to me and stuck a gun in my ribs and said, "Give me your money," and I handed it to him--even if I had deliberately put the money up where everyone could see it and a person had violated me--I don't have to go to see the bishop to see if a disciplinary council needs to be held on me. I feel bad that I have been violated. For a person who has been involved in incest, who has been involved in abuse of any kind against his or her will (and that includes rape), there is no transgression--not as long as time shall last or the earth shall stand, or there shall be one man upon the face thereof.<br><br>I believe in God's great justice, that for those who are consigned into homes where he knows they will be violated, somehow he will reach down and judge them as if that had never happened. That would only be just. It would only be merciful. And those who have perpetrated great frauds and great deceit and abuse on others may get out of this life without ever having confessed. People may believe that they didn't do it, and so the perpetrator may escape punishment. We all think that is not fair--the innocent suffer and the guilty do not. No. Justice is "according to the supreme goodness of God," and by and by, all those who have been guilty will pay the cost. We will either repent or suffer; there isn't any way around that. I am so grateful for justice.<br><br>Now then, if the sinful one can go in and sit down with the bishop and have the burden relieved, then why should not the innocent? There are those who watch a spouse slowly die with cancer--a husband eventually becomes a widower or, if a man dies, a wife will be left alone. There are those who have other kinds of debilitating diseases--for instance, the quadriplegic who goes through a difficult life that way--isn't it only just that somehow the Atonement cover that kind of suffering? The innocent must be able to find the same relief as the guilty; that would only be just.<br><br>In Alma 7 we discover that the Lord suffered not only for the transgressions and sins of the world but for our afflictions and our illnesses and the sicknesses of the world. That is the part of the Atonement that I have missed somehow, and I want to suggest to you it is not left undone. Justice according to the supreme goodness of God will be satisfied. When we have a heart like unto God's own heart, we know justice will take place. Now, the innocent ones must do the same thing that the guilty do; that is, they must go to him who has a right to lift that off of their hearts.<br><br>President Harold B. Lee said, "I came to a night, some years ago, when on my bed, I realized that before I could be worthy of the high place to which I had been called, I must love and forgive every soul that walked the earth" (<i>CR,</i>October 1946, p. 146). If you have been violated, if you have been abused as a child or as an adult, or if you are later on in this life, would you remember that we must forgive the offending one? Justice "according to the supreme goodness of God" means that we do turn it over to him. It will not be left undone. We can have that absolute assurance. That would only be just. We must take it off of our hearts. Some modern psychiatrists might say, "Well, you don't get healed that way," but you do. You do get healed by turning justice over to God and forgiving the offender. We must be merciful if we would obtain mercy. The Lord can lift all burdens from us. Once we turn it over to him and simply say, "It is between that person and God. I forgive," then the burden will be lifted quietly and easily. If you are sitting here today and have had those problems in the past and can in your heart forgive and simply turn justice over to the Savior, then through his Atonement those sicknesses and illnesses and the abuses will be lifted from you. That would only be just.<br><br>We wonder why the Lord permits such things. I was talking with a wonderful lady recently, and we shared this scripture together:<br><br><i>And when Amulek saw the pains of the women and children who were consuming in the fire, he also was pained; and he said unto Alma: How can we witness this awful scene?</i>[Now think here about incest and rape and abuse.]<i>Therefore let us stretch forth our hands, and exercise the power of God which is in us, and save them from the flames.</i><br><br><i>But Alma said unto him: The Spirit constraineth me that I must not stretch forth mine hand; for behold the Lord receiveth them up unto himself, in glory; and he doth suffer that they may do this thing, or that the people may do this thing unto them, according to the hardness of their hearts, that the judgments which he shall exercise upon them in his wrath may be just;</i>[That is justice according to the supreme goodness of God.]<i>and the blood of the innocent shall stand as a witness against them, yea, and cry mightily against them at the last day.</i>[Alma 14:10­p;11]<br><br>The innocent must forgive the perpetrator, then transfer the burden to the Savior; and that is justice. That, again, does not mean that it is left undone; it just means that we have turned it over to the Savior.<br><br>Now, to those who have sinned and have had the experience of having the Atonement wrought in your lives, you are partakers of mercy. I love the Savior for his mercy, and I love mercy with all of my heart and soul. I love justice equally as much.<br><br>There is a verse that all of you have heard:<br><br><i>Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,<br>Humpty Dumpty had a great fall;<br>All the king's horses<br>And all the king's men<br>Couldn't put Humpty Dumpty together again.</i><br><br>But the king could, and the king can, and the king will if we will but come unto him. One of the great things that will draw us to him, if we have a heart like unto God's own heart, is to understand what motivated Christ in the great Atonement. It was the greatest and most significant act ever in eternity, as I stated.<br><br>Would you also take this second bit of counsel from one who would have a heart like unto God's own heart? There is a statement that says:<br><br><i>I believe the first test of a truly great man is his humility. I do not mean, by humility, doubt of his own power. ... All great men ... have a curious ... feeling that the greatness is not</i>in<i>them, but</i>through<i>them. ... And they see something Divine and God-made in every other man they meet, and are endlessly, foolishly, incredibly merciful.</i>[John Ruskin,<i>Modern Painters,</i>vol. 3 (Orpington, Kent: George Allen, 1888), p. 266; emphasis in original]<br><br>I believe we would be incredibly merciful if we had a heart like unto God's own heart.<br><br>Walter Malone is known for a lot of things; he is in the Tennessee State Hall of Fame. If all he did was write the poem that I am going to quote to you, his name ought to be there. It provides a Christlike attitude to many things. Many of you will appreciate it. In it we find hope and absolution. The verse is about opportunity. He said:<br><br><i>They do me wrong who say I come no more<br>When once I knock and fail to find you in,<br>For every day I stand outside your door<br>And bid you wake, and rise to fight and win.</i><br><br><i>Wail not for precious chances passed away,<br>Weep not for golden ages on the wane!<br>Each night I burn records of the day;<br>At sunrise every soul is born again.</i><br><br><i>Laugh like a boy at splendors that have sped,<br>To vanished joys be blind and deaf and dumb;<br>My judgments seal the dead past with its dead,<br>But never bind a moment yet to come.</i><br><br><i>Tho' deep in mire, wring not your hands and weep;<br>I lend my arm to all who say, "I can!"<br>No shamefaced outcast ever sank so deep<br>But yet might arise and be again a man.</i><br><br><i>Dost thou behold thy lost youth all aghast?<br>Dost reel from righteous retribution's blow?<br>Then turn from blotted archives of the past<br>And find the future's pages white as snow.</i><br><br><i>Art thou a mourner? Rouse thee from thy spell;<br>Art thou a sinner? Sins may be forgiven;<br>Each morning gives thee wings to flee from hell,<br>Each night a star to guide thy feet to Heaven.</i><br>["Opportunity," Walter Malone]<br><br>Walter Malone had a heart like unto God's own heart. You can't use that beautiful thought in a great verse without having a heart like unto God's. Anyone who can offer hope is blessed in many ways.<br><br>I told a little story at the Bountiful Temple dedication. Let me share it with you. A young couple gave birth to a son. They named him Amazing, hoping that somehow he would live up to his name and do something great. Actually, he never did. In fact, all that he did was rather mundane. He never really accomplished anything great. He married, lived on the family farm, raised a family, and was the brunt of jokes all his life because of his name.<br><br>Finally, he said to his wife, "When I die, please do not put my name on the grave marker; maybe that will stop all the jokes." Later he died, and she was true to her promise but decided there ought to be something inscribed. She had them put "Here lies a man who loved and was faithful to his wife for sixty years." And now the people read the inscription, then point and say, "That's amazing!"<br><br>I just got a letter today in the office from George Romney's wife, Lenore. I want to read a couple of sentences:<br><br><i>That you, too, loved George was evident, and how I love you for that. Your recognizing his greatness was wonderful to me. Indeed, ours was a fabulous love story. How I adore him. I believe he was the most wonderful husband in the world.</i><br><br>There is a statement that says, "Grow old along with me! The best is yet to be" (Robert Browning,<i>Rabbi Ben Ezra</i>[1864], stanza 1). One day you will understand that and have different feelings about it than you do now.<br><br>Marian Wright Edelman told the story of Jean Thompson, who was a teacher:<br><br><i>On the first day of school, Jean Thompson told her students, "Boys and girls, I love you all the same." Teachers lie. Little Teddy Stollard was a boy Jean Thompson did not like. He slouched in his chair, didn't pay attention, his mouth hung open in a stupor, his eyes were always unfocused, his clothes were mussed, his hair unkempt, and he smelled. He was an unattractive boy and Jean Thompson didn't like him.</i><br><br><i>Teachers have records. And Jean Thompson had Teddy's. First grade: "Teddy's a good boy. He shows promise in his work and attitude. But he has a poor home situation." Second grade: "Teddy is a good boy. He does what he is told. But he is too serious. His mother is terminally ill." Third grade: "Teddy is falling behind in his work; he needs help. His mother died this year. His father shows no interest." Fourth grade: "Teddy is in deep waters; he is in need of psychiatric help. He is totally withdrawn."</i><br><br><i>Christmas came, and the boys and girls brought their presents and piled them on her desk. They were all in brightly colored paper except for Teddy's. His was wrapped in brown paper and held together with scotch tape. And on it, scribbled in crayon, were the words, "For Miss Thompson from Teddy." She tore open the brown paper and out fell a rhinestone bracelet with most of the stones missing and a bottle of cheap perfume that was almost empty. When the other boys and girls began to giggle she had enough sense to put some of the perfume on her wrist, put on the bracelet, hold her wrist up to the children and say, "Doesn't it smell lovely? Isn't the bracelet pretty?" And taking their cue from the teacher, they all agreed.</i><br><br><i>At the end of the day, when all the children had left, Teddy lingered, came over to her desk and said, "Miss Thompson, all day long, you smelled just like my mother. And her bracelet, that's her bracelet, it looks real nice on you, too. I'm really glad you like my presents." And when he left, she got down on her knees and buried her head in her chair and she begged God to forgive her.</i><br><br><i>The next day when the children came, she was a different teacher. She was a teacher with a heart. And she cared for all the children, but especially those who needed help. Especially Teddy. She tutored him and put herself out for him.</i><br><br><i>By the end of the year, Teddy had caught up with a lot of the children and was even ahead of some. Several years later, Jean Thompson got this note:</i><br><br><i>Dear Miss Thompson:</i><br><br><i>I'm graduating and I'm second in my high school class. I wanted you to be the first to know. Love, Teddy.</i><br><br><i>Four years later she got another note:</i><br><br><i>Dear Miss Thompson:</i><br><br><i>I wanted you to be the first to know. The university has not been easy, but I like it. Love, Teddy Stollard.</i><br><br><i>Four years later, there was another note:</i><br><br><i>Dear Miss Thompson:</i><br><br><i>As of today, I am Theodore J. Stollard, M.D. How about that? I wanted you to be the first to know. I'm going to be married in July. I want you to come and sit where my mother would have sat, because you're the only family I have. Dad died last year.</i><br><br><i>And she went and she sat where his mother should have sat because she deserved to be there.</i><br>[Deval L. Patrick, "Struggling for Civil Rights Now,"<i>Vital Speeches of the Day</i>61, no. 3 (November 15 1994):93­p;94]<br><br>I think that is the kind of thing we talk about when we talk about having a heart like unto God's own heart. Otherwise we'll live like the person in this little verse by Henry Drummond:<br><br><i>I lived for myself, I thought for myself,<br>For myself, and none beside--<br>Just as if Jesus had never lived,<br>As if He had never died.</i><br>[<i>The Greatest Thing in the World</i>(New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Company, n.d.), p. 40]<br><br>Van Johnson from Leoma, Tennessee, tells of a personal experience he had in high school:<br><br><i>Mr. Garner Ezell, my high school football coach, insisted on commitment from his players. "I'm committed to you," he said in a booming voice, his bushy eyebrows raised as he paced the locker room. "If you need me, I'm here." I proved myself on the field, winning the best blocker award in sophomore year. Just before junior year, I made a tackle that left me paralyzed from the shoulders down.</i>What can Coach do for me now?<i>I wondered in the hospital.</i><br><br><i>Coach became a regular visitor. He stood by my bedside with my teammates, recreating games they had played. "See you in a few days," he said as the team filed out.</i><br><br><i>Sure enough, Coach came back. And before leaving, he always said, "See you in a few days." Coach Ezell made me feel cared about and important. But I wondered how long his concern would last.</i><br><br><i>Recently, after a good visit, I listened to Mr. Ezell say from my doorway, "See you in a few days." Now he has done that for more than twenty-four years, a coach with a heart like unto God's.</i><br><br>What does one who has a heart like unto God's own heart have? A few years back I was in Canada at a Nathan Eldon Tanner Camp. This training of adult leaders paralleled what we do at Philmont except that we took the training to Canada instead of having them travel all the way to New Mexico. The Church furnished all of our instructors and youth leaders and ran the full-week camp with wonderful members of the Church.<br><br>During that week the staff organized a Polar Bear Club. In order to qualify you had to swim at six a.m. four mornings in a row in the cold Elbow River. It had snowed eight inches at an elevation 1,000 feet higher than our camp. They thought I ought to join. I didn't have a swimming suit, so they drove into Calgary fifty miles away and got me one. The first morning I went down to the river with the group. I have always had a difficult time wading into a lake or river slowly. It is just like cutting your finger off a little bit at a time. I would rather have one giant breathtaking shock than the dozens of painful ones that come from slowly wading into the river. I filled my lungs with all the air they could hold so I could not suck in anything else when the shock of the cold water caused me to catch my breath. I dove in and it was ice cold. I swam out to the middle of the river. It was almost chest deep.<br><br>In a moment a stake president dove in and came up right beside me. After the shock of cold, he said, "Did I have my glasses on?"<br><br>I replied, "I don't know, did you?"<br><br>He said he thought he had.<br><br>I said, "Swim over to the bank and check."<br><br>In a moment he came back, and he said, "I did have them on."<br><br>The Elbow River was flowing about ten to twelve miles an hour, I estimated. I imagined it would have carried his glasses off down the river toward Calgary.<br><br>Here was a stake president who had spent hundreds of dollars to drive from Western Canada to Calgary and had brought his whole family with him in an older wood-paneled station wagon, as I recall. He had all the gasoline, lodging, and meal expenses coming and the training fees. I knew it must have been a terrific financial strain on him. I was certain he could not afford $200 or $300 for a new pair of glasses.<br><br>I walked upstream about twenty or thirty feet. I offered a prayer and asked God to help me find his glasses. Mind you, it was six a.m.; the water was cold and clear but flowing relatively fast. I lay down on my back and floated downstream. I had an impression and stopped. I looked down in the water and thought I could see something glistening on the bottom of the river. I dove down and came up with the stake president's glasses and handed them to this great stake president.<br><br>I think if you have a heart like unto God's own heart, you are interested in little things that may not be important to a lot of other people but would be very important to the person involved.<br><br>Well, God bless you. It has been wonderful to be here with you. I think if the Savior were here today, he would say to you, to all of you who have served missions, "Thanks so much for serving missions, for working hard and sacrificing and doing all you did." I think he would say to all of you, "Thank you for studying, for doing what you are doing here and preparing for the rest of your life. Thanks for being clean and sweet and pure. Thanks for being loyal to the Church and sustaining the apostles and prophets." I think he would say, "I love you and I forgive you and God bless you." And I say that also, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Vaughn J.

<h1>fter the Manner of Happiness - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning, my beloved young brothers and sisters. Thank you for inviting me to be here with you today.<br><br>Nothing reminds me so forcefully of my advancing years as facing an audience of vibrant and wholesome young people like you. For years I gave little credence to the so-called generation gap, but now I'm willing to at least allow that such a social phenomenon exists. Periodic personal encounters with those of your age group reinforce my suspicions that I probably have less and less to say that you may find relevant or interesting. For instance, not many years ago, when our oldest son was a senior in high school, I noticed him one morning in the vicinity of my clothes closet. At breakfast I noted that I had seen him examining my wardrobe and gently inquired whether I really owned something that he would consider worthy of wearing. To my chagrin, but not necessarily to my surprise, he said, "Relax, Dad, we're having nerd day at school tomorrow!"<br><br>I sincerely hope my prayers will be answered today so there will be no gaps between what I feel and say and what you feel and understand. There is an old Jewish saying that words spoken from the heart are carried into the heart. What I wish to say today truly comes from my heart, and I hope it will have meaning and application for you during the wonderful years of your lives that lie ahead.<br><br>There are principles and truths that are unchanging, eternal, and timeless. Such are those that bring happiness to our lives. This has been a subject of interest to me for many years because although I am richly blessed and have every reason to be happy, I sometimes struggle with myself and do not always have the natural inclination toward happiness and a cheerful disposition that some people seem to enjoy.<br><br>For that reason, several years ago a Book of Mormon passage caught my attention. It's in the first part of the Book of Mormon--the part our family specializes in--and concerns the period of time just after Nephi separated from Laman and Lemuel and departed into the wilderness. There Nephi established a society founded on gospel truths; of that society in 2 Nephi 5:27 he says: "And it came to pass that we lived after the manner of happiness." To paraphrase the Prophet Joseph, "Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine" (JS--H 1:12). I pondered what it could mean to live "after the manner of happiness." I knew it had to be related to the gospel and God's plan for our lives. In fact, sometimes his prophets call that plan the "plan of happiness." I remembered, too, that Joseph Smith said that "happiness is the object and design of our existence"<i>(Teachings,</i>p. 255). I wondered, though, what the individual elements of a truly happy society and life might be, and I began to search Nephi's writings for clues. I wish to share with you today my tentative findings, primarily from 2 Nephi, chapter 5, and invite you to conduct your own personal search. It could be a lifelong and worthwhile pursuit.<br><h2><b>Family</b></h2><br>I begin with 2 Nephi 5:6 with Nephi's observation that as he journeyed into the wilderness, "I ... did take my family ... and Sam, mine elder brother and his family, and Jacob and Joseph, my younger brethren, and also my sisters." Here indeed is a significant key to happiness--one's family.<br><br>There was good reason that Nephi took his more righteous siblings with him into the wilderness. He belonged to them and they belonged to him. There is no other organization that can so completely satisfy our need for belonging and provide the resulting happiness that a family can.<br><br>Those of you who are away from home for the first time this fall probably left thinking, "Free at last!" Now that you've been without parental supervision for a few weeks and are getting used to the idea that you can sleep anytime and eat anything you want, I suspect in some of your quiet moments you have a little queasy feeling in the pit of your stomach commonly know as homesickness. I'll bet you've even peeked far enough ahead in your day planners to see how many more days there are until Thanksgiving and Christmas breaks! Why is there this yearning for home and loved ones? I believe it is a universal, God-given instinct that all people in all cultures are blessed with. I also believe that a loving Heavenly Father gives it to us, because within the family we experience most of life's greatest joys. The sights, sounds, and associations of family and home are among our most treasured memories and provide our fondest anticipations.<br><br>Sometimes after an enjoyable family home evening, or during a fervent family prayer, or when our entire family is at the dinner table on Sunday evening eating waffles and engaging in a session of lively, good-natured conversation, I quietly say to myself: "If heaven is nothing more than this, it will be good enough for me!"<br><h2><b>Keeping the Commandments</b></h2><br>For the next ingredient of a happy life, I go to 2 Nephi 5:10. Nephi writes: "And we did observe to keep the judgments, and the statutes, and the commandments of the Lord in all things."<br><br>Here is a simple but powerful truth: living righteously, keeping God's commandments, makes us happy. The very quotable Alma gave us the all-time best one-liner on this topic when he said: "Wickedness never was happiness" (Alma 41:10). That's a sound bite worthy of the six o'clock news! As best as I can tell, based on my own experience and my observations of others, Alma's is as categorical a statement as can be made on the subject, and our chances of proving Alma wrong are about zero.<br><br>In May of 1957, at the invitation of President David O. McKay, Cecil B. DeMille, renowned producer of motion pictures, gave the commencement address here at BYU. His latest production,<i>The Ten Commandments,</i>which has become a classic, had been filmed with some technical advice from President McKay; and in the course of its production a close friendship had formed. Following a tender introduction by President McKay in which he praised the nobility and character of his friend, Cecil B. DeMille stunned the BYU graduates with a masterful and wonderfully brief address on the purpose of God's laws. Drawing on the lesson of the orgy of the golden calf from chapter 32 of the book of Exodus, Mr. DeMille noted that the children of Israel had been freed from the bitter bondage of Egypt and had seen the wonders of God in the desert and in the divided sea. They were free, they thought. Then Moses left them to go up the mountain to receive the law. As Mr. DeMille observed:<br><br><i>No sooner was he gone the short space of forty days and nights, when, in spite of all his teaching, in spite of all the marvels they had seen God work, the children of Israel became slaves again--not this time of a tyrant like Pharaoh, but slaves of their own passions and their own fears.</i>[<i>BYU Speeches of the Year,</i>31 May 1957, p. 6]<br><br>Then, in perhaps the emotional high point of his address, Cecil B. DeMille imparted this powerful insight concerning the keeping of God's laws:<br><br><i>Some, who do not know either the Bible or human nature, may see in the orgy of the Golden Calf only a riot of Hollywood's imaginations--but those who have eyes to see will see in it the awful lesson of how quickly a nation or a man can fall, without God's Law.</i><br><br><i>If man will not be ruled by God, he will certainly be ruled by tyrants--and there is no tyranny more imperious or more devastating than man's own selfishness, without the law.</i><br><br><i>We cannot break the Ten Commandments. We can only break ourselves against them.</i>[p. 6]<br><br>From the depths of my soul today I testify to you, my young friends, that we cannot break God's laws; we can only break ourselves against them. Satan wants us to believe we are an exception to God's rules, that somehow our transgressions are more noble, more justifiable, than anyone's have ever been, but that is a lie. And not only do we offend God by breaking his laws, we also offend ourselves and others and thereby experience heartache, suffering, and misery--the exact opposites of happiness.<br><br>There is no more poignant description of the contrast between the pain of rebellion and the joy of obedience to divine law than the one given by Alma to his son Helaman:<br><br><i>Yea, I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains. Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy.</i>[Alma 36:21]<br><br>One of the keys to a truly happy life is to learn this lesson as early as possible--preferably vicariously--and to never forget it.<br><h2><b>Planting and Harvesting</b></h2><br>Next, in 2 Nephi 5:11, Nephi observes that "we did prosper exceedingly; for we did sow seed, and we did reap again in abundance." Now, before you go accusing me of really living in a little house on the prairie, let me read to you from a general conference address of President Spencer W. Kimball given in April of 1978:<br><br><i>With the arrival of spring we hope all of you will put in your gardens and prepare to enjoy their produce this summer. We hope you are making this a family affair, with everyone, even the little ones, assigned to something. There is so much to learn and harvest from your garden, far more than just a crop itself.</i>["Becoming the Pure in Heart,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1978, p. 79]<br><br>I cannot tell you logically why something as simple as planting a garden, however modest, and harvesting and enjoying the fruits of one's labors is the source of great happiness, but I know it is. In the case of our own family, we've been blessed not only with our own little garden plot, but we've also had grandmothers on both sides who understand these principles and have showered us annually with a stream of fruits and vegetables. There is "far more than just a crop itself" to be gained, and it can come from a flowerpot, a window box, or a single tomato plant, as well as from an entire garden or field.<br><h2><b>Animals</b></h2><br>Also in 2 Nephi 5:11, Nephi records that "we began to raise flocks, and herds, and animals of every kind." I think you will be able to readily relate to this element of a happy life.<br><br>Why is it that animals--be they horses, dogs, cats, hamsters, turtles, or an occasional boa constrictor--touch us so deeply and provide such a rich source of happiness? I can only share with you my own feelings and thoughts, based on a lifelong association with a variety of cats, dogs, horses, and cows.<br><br>As a young boy I experienced the value of pouring out my wounded heart to a loving and understanding collie named Ranger, and of feeling the love and acceptance of a blue-ribbon 4-H calf named Daisy. Neither they, nor a host of their successors, have ever questioned my goodness or scolded me in my weaknesses. Given affection and care, they have returned affection and care generously and consistently. They have taught me much about love, forgiveness, loyalty, and trust. Like little children, they hold no grudges. They are totally honest and forthcoming in all their relationships.<br><br>I don't know how many millions of dollars must be spent every year on psychotherapists to provide humankind with the self-respect and self-esteem that relationships with animals are now increasingly seen as producing. There is a growing body of evidence that pets make a difference in our lives at every age and that they have a measurable effect upon our health and well-being (see Science &amp;amp; Society,<i>U.S. News and World Report,</i>24 February 1992, pp. 64–65). I've sensed this for years in my own life and just last week continued my personal mental health program by acquiring an English shepherd pup to replace our beloved collie, Wanda, who died more than a year ago of cancer. I'm noticeably happier again and know that, for me at least, heaven will not be heaven unless the animal kingdom is part of God's kingdom.<br><h2><b>Scriptures</b></h2><br>Next, in 2 Nephi 5:12, Nephi mentions that he "had also brought the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass." Nephi brought the then-existing scriptures along as he and his family founded their society.<br><br>Why would having access to the scriptures be a consideration in a happy lifestyle? Anyone who reads scripture regularly develops a clearer perspective, purer thoughts, and has more sincere and thoughtful prayers. Our lives are bound to be happier when we use the scriptures to answer our very personal questions and needs.<br><br>There are other uplifting influences the scriptures can have in our lives. They can cleanse us from evil thoughts and fortify our resolve to resist temptation. They can give comfort in times of need, such as when a loved one dies or during other personal tragedies. Reading them can put us in tune with the Spirit of the Lord so that our depression and self-doubts will flee and our confidence will "wax strong in the presence of God" (D&amp;amp;C 121:45).<br><br>A powerful expression of the happiness that can come from immersing ourselves in the scriptures comes from Parley P. Pratt's autobiography, in which he describes his first encounter with the Book of Mormon, which he called "that book of books":<br><br><i>I read all day; eating was a burden, I had no desire for food; sleep was a burden when the night came, for I preferred reading to sleep.</i><br><br><i>As I read, the spirit of the Lord was upon me, and I knew and comprehended that the book was true, as plainly and manifestly as a man comprehends and knows that he exists. My joy was now full, as it were, and I rejoiced sufficiently to more than pay me for all the sorrows, sacrifices and toils of my life.</i>[<i>PPP,</i>1994, p. 20]<br><br>I understand that in some Jewish families when a son starts Torah studies, a drop of honey is placed on the page to indicate this duty is also a great joy. I find that symbolism very appealing and testify that there is great constancy and happiness to be had from a daily study of the Bible and the Restoration scriptures.<br><h2><b>Preparedness</b></h2><br>The next element of a happy life mentioned by Nephi is in verse 14 of 2 Nephi 5. It is the quality of preparedness. Nephi illustrates it by saying that he "did take the sword of Laban, and after the manner of it did make many swords, lest by any means the people who were now called Lamanites should come upon us and destroy us." Nephi was preparing for battle, and in a figurative sense that is what we must do if we are to be ready and qualified for life so that we can be happy with life. My own experience is that if we are prepared, we not only do not fear (see D&amp;amp;C 38:30), but we actually enjoy and derive considerable happiness from the events of our daily lives.<br><br>Those of you who have tests scheduled for this afternoon will relate to this principle on a very practical level. If you have prepared well you will probably do well and will have a feeling of well-being and satisfaction that will be denied those who are at this very moment reviewing their class notes instead of absorbing my very fascinating talk!<br><br>My children and I have been blessed and made very happy by my wife's preparations for marriage and motherhood. She came with the fundamentals of cooking, sewing, gardening, reading, music, game playing, and a college degree all in place. I would probably have loved her just as much without all these credentials, but I doubt that our children and I would have been as happy! Those who have had some savings and a little food storage during a period of unemployment or who had been consistently "treasuring up the words of life" (see D&amp;amp;C 84:85) and were called on to speak extemporaneously in stake conference will know the happiness (and relief) that comes from being prepared. The Boy Scouts and their motto--"Be prepared"--have it right. Someone once asked Baden-Powell, the founder of the Boy Scouts, "Be prepared for what?"<br><br>"Why," said Baden-Powell, "for any old thing." That's just the idea, and Nephi knew it, too.<br><h2><b>Work</b></h2><br>Nephi's next comment on his happy society has to do with the principle of work. In verse 15 of 2 Nephi 5 he says:<br><br><i>And I did teach my people to build buildings, and to work in all manner of wood, and of iron, and of copper, and of brass, and of steel, and of gold, and of silver, and of precious ores, which were in great abundance.</i><br><br>In verse 17 he adds: "And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did cause my people to be industrious, and to labor with their hands."<br><br>Six thousand years ago Father Adam received the commandment "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread" (Genesis 3:19). Today it is more socially acceptable to "perspire" than to "sweat," and we have lost more than just moisture in that transition.<br><br>I realize that work can be mental, spiritual, or physical effort, but Nephi's emphasis is on<i>laboring with our hands</i>or manual labor. No matter what our life's work turns out to be, I know we'll be happier if we regularly labor with our hands. This can take many forms: yard work, sewing, quilting, cooking, baking, auto repair, home repair--the list is endless and so is the happiness and sense of accomplishment such activities produce.<br><br>I think it is a regrettable sign of our times that most family activities today take place in a recreational, rather than a work setting. I'm grateful I was able to work alongside both my grandfather and father and in turn am able to work with our sons and daughters. There is something inspiring to me about Elder Bruce R. McConkie's declaration on this vital element of a happy life: "We are here on earth to work--to work long, hard, arduous hours, to work until our backs ache and our tired muscles knot, to work all our days" ("Stand Independent Above All Other Creatures,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1979, p. 93).<br><h2><b>The Temple</b></h2><br>Nephi's next observation about his society is most interesting. In verse 16 of 2 Nephi 5 he says, "And I, Nephi, did build a temple." Nephi's temple may have differed in some ways from our latter-day temples, but its central purpose was likely the same: to continually teach and orient God's children concerning his plan for their happiness and to provide the ordinances and covenants essential to the attainment of that happiness.<br><br>After living on this good earth for fifty-three years, I can honestly say that the most spiritually mature and happy people I know are ardent temple-goers. There is good reason for that. It is in the temple that the full sweep of God's program for us is told and retold, each telling bringing greater understanding and commitment to living life His way.<br><br>What images does the word<i>temple</i>call to our minds? Listen to Elder Boyd K. Packer's expression of feelings about this:<br><br><i>When we say</i>temple<i>I would list what in essence are Latter-day Saint synonyms for the word: Marriage, family, children, happiness, joy, eternal life, resurrection, redemption, exaltation, inspiration, revelation.</i>[<i>The Holy Temple</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1980), p. 260]<br><br>A good test of how well we are doing in our quest to come unto Christ may be how we personally feel about the temple and our experiences there.<i>Temple</i>can be synonymous with<i>happiness</i>and<i>joy.</i>It was for Nephi and his people.<br><h2><b>Church Service</b></h2><br>The final element of Nephi's society, recorded in 2 Nephi 5, concerns the role our Church callings and service play in a happy life. Nephi notes in verse 26 that he "did consecrate Jacob and Joseph, that they should be priests and teachers over the land of my people." Of course, true Christian service can't be provided exclusively through institutional means. Random acts of personal service motivated by our feelings of charity are necessary for our salvation. But the organized Church as established by God, in which we look after and serve others and are looked after and served by others, provides a wonderful source of happiness for all of us. Nephi himself epitomizes this ethic of caring and service. He wrote: "For I pray continually for [my people] by day, and mine eyes water my pillow by night, because of them" (2 Nephi 33:3).<br><br>In my own case, I can't begin to tell you how grateful I am for the countless opportunities for growth, service, and happiness that activity in the Church has provided. It is not by accident that in God's plan for us we have been given a church that "hath need of every member" (D&amp;amp;C 84:110). Because we are needed and encouraged and enabled to serve, we are much happier.<br><h2><b>Other Elements</b></h2><br>If we go beyond 2 Nephi 5 in Nephi's writings, we discover even more about the patterns of life that enabled Nephi and his people to live so happily. For instance, we learn he was a faithful keeper of a journal--we've been reading this morning from a portion of it! We learn that he was an avid student and teacher of the doctrines of the gospel and a sensitive follower of the Spirit of the Lord.<br><br>We also learn that he looked "forward with steadfastness unto Christ" (2 Nephi 25:24). The Savior and his teachings were the focus of Nephi's energies:<br><br><i>And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.</i>[2 Nephi 25:26]<br><br>Nephi knew and taught, as have all the prophets, that true peace and happiness can only ultimately come through a remission of our sins. The Savior's teachings--in large doses--are the only sure antidote for unhappiness!<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>Since first making my personal discovery about "living after the manner of happiness," I have thought deeply about the principles involved and about how timeless and universal they are. The same patterns and elements of daily life that enabled Nephi and his people to be happy 560 years before Christ work equally well today. And they fit comfortably at every stage during our lives (including our years at a university) and in every culture. In a time when "diversity" is so frequently touted as something desirable, it's interesting to note the uniformity and unchanging nature of these principles. Perhaps every purveyor of "new lamps for old" ought not to be heeded.<br><br>Of interest to struggling university students should be the fact that these principles of happiness can be lived virtually without cost. It's almost as if Nephi's little brother Jacob was speaking to this issue as he extended the invitation: "Come, my brethren, everyone that thirsteth, come ye to the waters; and he that hath no money, come buy and eat; yea, come buy wine and milk without money and without price" (2 Nephi 9:50). This should tell us something about the very minimal role material things play in a happy life. The cost is almost always too high.<br><br>It has been interesting, too, to discover that the principles of happiness Nephi shares are found in all of the scriptures, old and modern. I often wonder why we wrestle over the meaning of obscure passages of scripture when what is really important for our happiness and salvation is stated by the Lord over and over again in very plain terms.<br><br>It is noteworthy, too, that the prophets of the past fifty years or so have had as the hallmarks of their teachings and service some of the exact principles we've touched on today. Presidents McKay and Lee made powerful statements about the sanctity and importance of the family. President Joseph Fielding Smith and President Ezra Taft Benson pleaded with us to make the scriptures a more significant part of our lives. President Kimball spoke movingly and from his own experience on the value of physical work, journals, gardens, and of being kind to animals. More recently, President Hunter lovingly invited us to make the temple the symbol of our Church membership. All of the prophets have continually reminded us of the blessings of obedience to God's laws and of the need to give ever-greater attention to Christ and his teachings. These chosen men understand better than all the world the sources of true happiness.<br><br>Now, as I conclude, I want to make a few final observations. First, I doubt that Nephi intended his list of ingredients in a happy society to be exhaustive. In fact, he probably didn't intend to give us a list at all. I want to make it clear that I'm not a believer in "checklist happiness" either. There is no foolproof formula for guaranteeing a consistently happy life. There is also evidence that God did not intend for every day to be entirely happy. There is eternal design and purpose to be seen in some suffering, sadness, and adversity.<br><br>Second, there will be a tendency, in the complexity of these times, to forget that Nephi gloried "in plainness" and that the principles of happiness he modeled are both plain and simple (2 Nephi 33:6). If we overlook that fact, we may be like the children of Israel at the time of Moses who, when bitten by poisonous serpents, failed to look at the brass serpent Moses held up and thus live. Of these, Nephi says: "And the labor which they had to perform was to look; and because of the simpleness of the way, or the easiness of it, there were many who perished" (1 Nephi 17:41). The way to happiness can be just as simple and just as easily missed.<br><br>Finally, I invite you to look around you and observe people you feel are genuinely happy. I think you will invariably see the principles we have discussed today at work in their lives. I have done this and want to share my findings concerning two wonderfully modest souls who would shrink from being identified before an audience of this size. They are deeply happy and satisfied with their rather simple life together. They are also very kind and caring people. More than once I have sincerely said to them: "If you go before I do, and you aren't in the highest degree of the celestial kingdom, please drop me a note and I'll quit trying!"<br><br>What does a brief inspection of their lives reveal? They love God and each other. Their marriage and family are their priorities. They've had a few heartbreaks with their children, but they keep on laboring and loving. They have a simple but adequate and warm home. I don't think they've ever had a new car. She bakes great bread and cinnamon rolls, and she cans and stores fruits and vegetables every fall that have been grown in their carefully tended garden. Their family scripture reading program was one of the few I know of that actually got Lehi out of the desert! They are always in the kitchen at ward dinners, and the welfare farm would probably go into bankruptcy without his annual contribution of labor and wisdom. Several times each month they arise early and attend a nearby temple. They seem to love being there, and even though there is admittedly much they do not understand, they are growing in their knowledge. He makes his living with his hands as a skilled craftsman of furniture and cabinets. She has learned to sew almost everything from dresses to curtains. They love and have trained horses, have kept a milk cow for many years, and now have a small fish hatchery and trout farm. They have diligently kept the commandments of God, and any little deviation has been followed by honest and immediate repentance. They are prepared for life--now and hereafter.<br><br>If for whatever reasons a life like the one I have just described cannot be duplicated in your circumstances, I know you can have something "like unto it" if you want it. Please think deeply about this subject. Of what use is the gospel, the Church, and its organizations and programs, or the way of life it espouses, if we aren't happy? Moroni stresses the importance of being happy during this phase of our eternal existence by describing the judgment. He says:<br><br><i>And then cometh the judgment of the Holy One upon them; and then cometh the time that he that is filthy shall be filthy still; and he that is righteous shall be righteous still; he that is happy shall be happy still; and he that is unhappy shall be unhappy still.</i>[Mormon 9:14]<br><br>Nephi's society wasn't the only happy one of which the Book of Mormon speaks. There was another time and another people of whom it was written:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that there was no contention in the land, because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people.</i><br><br><i>And there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor whoredoms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor any manner of lasciviousness; and surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God.</i>[4 Nephi 1:15–16]<br><br>That we may all find this same happiness is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Marlin K. Jensen was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 19 September 1995.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>ith New Eyes: An Eternal Perspective - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
When I walk to campus, my route takes me along the front of Heritage Halls. There, underneath some shady trees, the sidewalk runs along an irrigation canal, a relic perhaps of an earlier era when orchards rather than buildings graced the area. One day while walking next to the canal, I was rapt in thought about the pollination of the little aquatic plant<i>Zannichellia palustris.</i>How does the pollen move through water?<br><br>I had been studying populations of the plant at Fish Springs in the west desert, about a three-hour drive from Provo. "Wouldn't it be grand if<i>Zannichellia palustris</i>grew right here in this ditch?" I thought to myself. I glanced toward the canal and there it was<i>--Zannichellia palustris!</i>I couldn't believe it.<br><br>Now imagine the scene. It's early morning. Students are scurrying to class along the sidewalk. A semi-respectable professor is walking with the students in front of Heritage Halls. Suddenly, with an excited look on his face, he rips off his sport coat, rolls up his trouser legs, and jumps into the ditch! He reaches down, pulls up a small water weed, and closely examines it with delight.<br><br>Within an hour I had brought tripods and high-speed cameras to the canal to study pollination. My graduate student Rebecca Sperry and I found that<i>Zannichellia palustris</i>releases its pollen in mucilage that resembles a floating omelette. As the mucilage dissolves, the pollen grains, which are heavier than water, drop like little baseballs onto the waiting female stigmas below. We sent a description of these results to the world's expert on aquatic plants, Professor C. D. K. Cook at the University of Zurich. His group repeated our study in Switzerland, and together with our respective students we published an announcement of our findings (see Guo, Y. H., Sperry, R., Cook, C. D. K., and Cox, P. A., "The Pollination Ecology of<i>Zannichellia palustris</i>L. [Zannichelliaceae],"<i>Aquatic Botany</i>38, no. 4 (December 1990): 341–56).<br><br>Although my discovery of<i>Zannichellia palustris</i>in the Heritage Halls ditch led to some very interesting biology, I still must confess to feeling silly. No, I didn't feel silly about jumping in the ditch--any of my Biology 130 students would have done precisely the same thing. What I felt silly about was that I had not previously noticed<i>Zannichellia palustris</i>in that ditch before, although I had walked hundreds of times along that path. I had viewed the ditch but had never before truly seen it.<br><br>How can we acquire the ability to truly see things as they are, rather than merely an idiosyncratic, partial version? Is there away that we can learn to see the world with new eyes?<br><br>We know that our Heavenly Father is able to see things in a pure and perfect way. He can see the truth of all things because he knows things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come (see D&amp;amp;C 93:24). The Lord has perfect vision of the universe, for all things are present with him and he knows them all (see Moses 1:6). His ability to perceive things perfectly caused the Book of Mormon prophet Jacob to exclaim, "O how great the holiness of our God! For he knoweth all things, and there is not anything save he knows it" (2 Nephi 9:20).<br><br>I believe in the premortal existence our Heavenly Father shared with us selected glimpses of his perfect knowledge. He taught us about the atoning mission of Jesus Christ. The great Council in Heaven was one of his instructional techniques. When the plan of salvation was explained to us, perhaps in an arena like this, we shouted for joy, an expression of gratitude whose echoes were heard throughout the universe. Imagine what we felt toward the Savior as we were told that he would live a perfect life and then voluntarily give it up for us.<br><br>In our first estate we walked in the light of day. In this life, however, we have neither the clarity nor the persistence of vision that we enjoyed in the premortal existence. Through that amnesia-like process we call birth, we have forgotten the image of our Heavenly Father. In this world our vision is clouded, fogged by design to test us and prove us. None of us have access to our full premortal memories. Rather than continually beholding the face of God, in this mortal existence temptations beset us. Isn't it interesting that these temptations in Lehi's dream are symbolized as mists of darkness? (see 1 Nephi 8:23–24, 1 Nephi 12:17.)<br><br>Yet the Lord has not left us bereft of hope. Just as the people in Lehi's dream pressed forward through the mists of darkness by clinging to the iron rod, so we can overcome the temptations that confront us by holding fast to the word of God (see 1 Nephi 11:25). When we wait upon the Lord in an attitude of humility and teachability, we become open to spiritual impressions. These spiritual impressions form a type of peripheral vision that can alert us to unseen dangers. But like airline pilots receiving guidance instructions from air traffic control, to receive this help we must be tuned to the right frequency. Sometimes the Lord speaks to us, but we do not hear or understand his promptings. This apparently was the case with Laman and Lemuel, who "were past feeling, that [they] could not feel his words" (1 Nephi 17:45).<br><br>At other times we are tuned to the right frequency but don't want to hear the instructions from the air traffic controllers. Amulek, reflecting on the time before his conversion, recalled: "I was called many times and I would not hear; therefore I knew concerning these things, yet I would not know" (Alma 10:6). This perhaps is the state of many good people who live without God in the world, who, in the words of Camus, "while unable to be saints but refusing to bow down to pestilences, strive their utmost to be healers" (Albert Camus,<i>The Plague,</i>trans. Stuart Gilbert [New York: Vintage Books, 1991], p. 308).<br><br>Yet though such individuals do many good deeds and bestow all their goods to feed the poor and even give their bodies to be burned (see 1 Corinthians 13:3), they miss "a more excellent way" (1 Corinthians 12:31). Those who have directly experienced the pure love of Christ are opened to a far broader reality. Many who have felt his loving touch can exclaim, as did the man healed by the Savior in the waters of Siloam, "Whereas I was blind, now I see" (John 9:25).<br><br>How can we experience that closeness to God when we are no longer physically in his presence? When Adam and Eve were cast out from the Garden of Eden, they could no longer see God (see Moses 5:4). So it is with us. Yet, like them, we sometimes vaguely sense the sweet smell of the unseen flowers of Eden. Have you ever sensed that fragrance--that closeness of heaven--where you can't see clearly but feel that you are enveloped in a garden of love, a garden planted by our Lord? The longing for return to the unseen garden, and the tentative, halting steps we take toward it, are the beginnings of faith.<br><br>In the previous life we walked by both sight and faith (see Alma 13:3). In this life, however, we must learn to walk by faith alone. Unlike God, we cannot see the end from the beginning, and so we find ourselves in what Elder Maxwell calls "the mortal middle" (<i>We Talk of Christ</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1984], p. 11). We have to make our way based only on a dim and foggy image of reality. President Joseph F. Smith said:<br><br><i>While we are in mortality we are clogged, and we see as through a glass darkly, we see only in part, and it is difficult for us to comprehend the smallest things with which we are associated.</i>[<i>JD</i>19:260; see 1 Corinthians 13:12]<br><br>There are at least two different types of errors possible in our present condition. The most obvious danger is that we will embrace something that is false. However, there is a second danger, one that perhaps is more threatening to those of us engaged in scholarly pursuits. It is that the little piece of truth we see will so fill our horizon that we will assume that our little truth is the entire truth. This error comes in mistaking our largely inchoate and partial vision of reality for "things as they really are" (Jacob 4:13). This second type of error is more difficult to detect because our perception may in fact not be false--it just might not be the whole truth. In the case of the Heritage Hall ditch, my initial perception was not false. I had walked hundreds of times along that path and indeed had seen a ditch flowing with water. But at one moment my vision became opened and I perceived far more: habitat for a rare aquatic plant.<br><br>Perhaps a recent experience will help to make this point clear. After a BYU commencement exercise I was changing out of my academic gown when I looked up and saw President Gordon B. Hinckley. I was partially obscured from view by the coatrack as I watched President Hinckley come face to face with one of our distinguished guests, who was not a member of the Church. Our guest, a kindly scholar, has received the highest academic accolades in this world. Yet when I saw him respond to President Hinckley's greeting, I realized that he perceived only a pleasant older gentleman--he did not see before him a prophet of God.<br><br>"Hello, my name is Gordon B. Hinckley," the prophet said.<br><br>Our guest nonchalantly responded to the introduction.<br><br>Suddenly, from the side, Elder Spencer Condie, a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy, rushed forward. Taking the arm of our distinguished guest, he said, "This is President Gordon B. Hinckley. He is a prophet of the Lord." Elder Condie then bore a brief but powerful testimony of the divinity of President Hinckley's sacred calling.<br><br>No one else saw Elder Condie's courageous act. As I walked out of the Marriott Center, I thought about what I had just witnessed. Elder Condie and the distinguished professor had both viewed Gordon B. Hinckley, but only one of them had seen a prophet of God.<br><br>Our guest's perception of President Hinckley as a pleasant man was not false. President Hinckley<i>is</i>a pleasant man. However, if our guest could have had the veil lifted, he would have seen that Gordon B. Hinckley is one of the "noble and great" (Abraham 3:22–23) spirits who were foreordained to hold all the keys of salvation, to be president of the Church, and to preside over the kingdom of God on this earth.<br><br>Viewing life through mortal eyes is analogous to viewing the world through a soda straw. The little bit we see may be true, but often the vast panorama of reality escapes us.<br><br>Consider the story of the prophet Elisha and his servant, who were in a city under siege. The servant was deeply alarmed when he observed that they were surrounded by the entire Syrian army. "Alas, my master! how shall we do?" he cried.<br><br>Elisha answered, "Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them."<br><br>At face value, Elisha's reply must have seemed like nonsense to the young servant. How could he and his master number more than an entire army? But then Elisha asked God to share his prophetic vision with the young man.<br><br><i>And Elisha prayed, and said, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.</i>[2 Kings 6:15–17]<br><br>Like Elisha's servant, we typically do not have access to a complete view of reality. We know, though, that the Lord can open our eyes to a greater reality. But if we candidly acknowledge our limitations and then humbly seek the Lord's assistance, he can broaden our vision. Let me give four examples where such broadened vision can assist us in our studies.<br><h2><b>1. Submission to Authority</b></h2><br>Authority is a very important issue in scholarly work. As you write term papers, you need to consult books and articles. Soon, however, you learn that not all written materials are of equal authority. An article clipped from a tabloid paper purchased at the grocery store carries far less weight than an article written by a recognized scholar in a peer-reviewed journal. Although we seek to cultivate gifted scholars at BYU, we realize that other virtues should be developed to complement intellectual gifts. As Elder Maxwell warns, "Genius without meekness is not enough to qualify for discipleship" ("The Disciple-Scholar,"<i>On Becoming a Disciple-Scholar,</i>ed. Henry B. Eyring [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1995], p. 14).<br><br>At BYU we have access to a different type of authority. Though we respect renowned scholars because of what they know, we pay even greater respect to the Lord's servants because of who called them. If we predicate our obedience to the Lord's servants on their scholarly qualifications, we misunderstand the essential difference, in Kierkegaard's terms, between a genius and an apostle.<br><br><i>Genius is what it is of itself ... ; an Apostle is what he is by his divine authority. ...</i><br><br><i>... An Apostle is not born; an Apostle is a man called and appointed by God, receiving a mission from him.</i>[Søren Kierkegaard, "Of the Difference Between a Genius and an Apostle,"<i>The Present Age,</i>trans. Alexander Dru (New York: Harper and Row, 1962), pp. 91–92]<br><br>Allow me to illustrate this point through a personal example. When I was younger I heard President Kimball prophesy that the Iron Curtain would be no barrier to our missionary efforts once we were ready to step through. I assumed that his comments must refer to some distant millennial epoch. Surely, I thought, the Iron Curtain would not come down during my lifetime. My views of the permanency of the Soviet empire were reinforced when I visited East Berlin during a botanical congress. During my visit, a jazz-fusion group played a concert at the Brandenburg Gate on the west side of the wall. Several hundred young East Germans congregated on the east side of the wall. They could not see the band but listened quietly to the sounds of the music wafting over the concrete wall. Although these peaceful young people represented no threat to the communist regime, the border guards soon dispersed the crowd with truncheons. If even music wasn't allowed to cross the Iron Curtain, how could the gospel ever be allowed to be preached freely in the Soviet bloc? Although I wanted to believe President Kimball, I fear I was like Elisha's servant. I just couldn't see how our missionaries could ever proselyte in East Germany.<br><br>Then, the miracle of November 1989 occurred. I could scarcely believe the images of the destruction of the Berlin Wall that were broadcast throughout the world. Even more astonishing, young men whom I had taught in the Aaronic Priesthood started receiving mission calls to Russia and the Ukraine. Like Elisha's servant I had viewed the world through a soda straw, but President Kimball, acting as a seer, saw it through a wide-angle lens. It is my testimony that the prophets and apostles are watchmen on the tower who can see afar off (see D&amp;amp;C 101:54). They are seers who can behold things not visible to the natural eye (see Moses 6:36).<br><br>Yet misunderstanding priesthood authority is not a new phenomenon. Even the Savior was misunderstood by many people. When Jesus returned to his hometown during his ministry, some people asked in derision:<br><br><i>Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?</i><br><br><i>And his sisters, are they not all with us?</i>[Matthew 13:55–56]<br><br>Now there was some truth in these statements: Joseph the carpenter and Mary raised Jesus. Jesus had brothers and sisters. But this analysis of Jesus was far from complete. Unlike the people who grew up with Jesus, the disciples earnestly tried to live his teachings. They prayed to know of his divinity. And because of their humility and meekness, they were visited by the Holy Ghost.<br><br><i>When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?</i><br><br><i>And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.</i><br><br><i>He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?</i><br><br><i>And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.</i><br><br><i>And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.</i>[Matthew 16:13–17]<br><br>Aided by the Spirit of the Lord, Peter could see a more complete truth. Looking at Jesus, the people of Nazareth saw someone who could craft a table or a chair, the carpenter's son. Peter saw someone who would craft the Atonement, the Son of the living God.<br><br>This story demonstrates that the Holy Ghost can testify to each of us of the divinity of the Savior. It is my testimony that the Holy Ghost can also witness to us of the divine callings of the prophets and apostles. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught: "Now if they will be wise, they will humble themselves in a peculiar manner that God may open the eyes of their understanding"<i>(Teachings,</i>p. 78). The gates of heaven open when we are humble, allowing us to be led and blessed by priesthood authority.<br><h2><b>2. Waiting upon the Lord</b></h2><br>The second way that spiritual enlightenment can help us in our academic work is by teaching us to wait upon the Lord. In this age of the Internet and the World Wide Web, we might become frustrated when requested inspiration does not come in a single keystroke. In our studies and in our life, we need to learn to humbly wait upon the Lord. We are told in Psalms: "Wait on the Lord: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the Lord" (Psalm 27:14). Moroni teaches the same doctrine in the Book of Mormon: "Dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith" (Ether 12:6).<br><br>I experienced a trial of my faith in Australia when I prayerfully beseeched the Lord to help me understand the pollination biology of a submerged sea grass. Mathematical considerations led me to predict that<i>Amphibolis antarctica</i>should be pollinated on the surface of the sea during the lowest tides of the year. Yet after three stormy days during which nothing happened, I prepared to return home on a Monday morning flight. On Sunday I awoke to find the skies sunny and the tides low: if pollination were to occur, it surely would that day. If it did, I would accept that as evidence that my theory was correct. Yet I did not want to violate the Sabbath by doing research on Sunday. After some inner conflict, I decided to drive into Melbourne, go to church, and spent the entire day there so I wouldn't be tempted. Returning after dark, I packed my bags for the return flight the next morning. Although I had kept the Sabbath, I feared that my entire trip to Australia had been wasted.<br><br>Monday morning I waded one last time in the ocean before driving to the airport. To my astonishment, I found that the plants were on verge of pollination. I raced back to the cottage and grabbed my cameras. At the precise moment of lowest tide, thousands of tiny male flowers floated to the ocean surface, where they explosively released their pollen. The pollen then collided with the floating female stigmas. I have never been happier to miss a flight home, for I returned with a new scientific discovery (see Cox, P. A., and Knox, R. B., 1988, "Pollination postulates and two-dimensional pollination in hydrophilous monocotyledons,"<i>Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden</i>75:811–18). I do not believe that I would have made this observation if I had not waited upon the Lord.<br><br>We must not despair because the Lord's timetable is different from ours: sometimes we just have to wait. The playwright Samuel Beckett has vividly portrayed the human malady of waiting (see<i>Waiting for Godot</i>[New York: Grove Press, 1954]). While confronting depression, discouragement, and a variety of absurdities, his characters Vladimir and Estragon continue to wait for Godot, an unseen character who never appears. And yet small miracles occur along the way: Estragon's shoes, which cause him so much pain in the beginning of the play, miraculously fit later.<br><br>So it is with us: those who wait upon God find small miracles along the way. In my case the miracle was a unique botanical observation. At other times, as in the case of the early Mormon pioneers, such small miracles are far more poignant. Peter McBride, who at the age of six had crossed the plains with the Martin Handcart Company, later wrote:<br><br><i>My mother was sick all the way over, and my sister Jenetta had the worry of us children. ... Her shoes gave out, and she walked through the snow barefoot, actually leaving bloody tracks in the snow. Father was a good singer. He had charge of the singing in our company, and the night he died he sang a song, the first verse that reads "O Zion, when I think of you, I long for pinions like a dove, And mourn to think I should be so distant from the land I love."</i><br><br>His father's dying song remained vivid in Peter McBride's memory for the rest of his life. Miraculously spared from starvation, young Peter McBride lived seventy-six more years, spent in devotion to the cause of Zion (Susan Arrington Madsen,<i>I Walked to Zion</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1994], p. 45).<br><br>Joseph Smith promised that if we "live in strict obedience to the commandments of God, and walk humbly before Him, [then] He will exalt [us] in His own due time" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 27). We need to learn to wait upon the Lord.<br><h2><b>3. Seek for the Beautiful</b></h2><br>My third example, seek for the beautiful, does not refer to the propensity of returned missionaries at BYU to search for a spouse. Instead, I refer to the need for caution when we are confronted by those who claim that truly facing reality requires an intimate acquaintance with evil. Great works from the<i>Bacchae</i>by Euripides to<i>Macbeth</i>by Shakespeare demonstrate the consequences of evil. But I reject arguments that a higher sense of morality can be approached by absorbing an explicit taxonomy of rape and carnage in films and books. Some even argue that we can attain transcendence by plumbing the depths of depravity. I find our popular culture to be increasingly violent, voyeuristic, and misogynistic. So it was in the days of Noah when the "earth was corrupt before God, and it was filled with violence" (Moses 8:28).<br><br>Unfortunately, there is violence and alienation in the world. But I believe that focusing entirely on evil is a form of tunnel vision--a soda-straw view of the universe. The greater reality is that the most powerful force in this universe is love. The truth is that the Creator knows and loves each of us as individuals. Isn't it moving that the first thing Joseph Smith heard from Heavenly Father in the Sacred Grove was his own name? And so it is with each of us: the first words we hear when we are baptized are our own names. But in this life we sometimes forget that God knows us intimately as individuals. This "mortal middle" is the only period in our entire existence in which we can live under the illusion that we are not surrounded by love.<br><br>Like most members of the Church, I believe that "if there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we [should] seek after [those] things" (Articles of Faith 1:13). Rather than confronting depravity, I believe that realism may be better perceived by considering the lilies of the field. As Elder Neal Maxwell wrote:<br><br><i>When those who call themselves realists urge us to yield to the temptations of the flesh, because everybody's doing it or because that's how things are, the living God (through the living prophets, Church, and scriptures) reminds us, not of how things seem to be, but of how things really are.</i><br><br><i>The genuine realist is really able to "consider the lilies in the field" and thereby see a planning and a providing God in marvelous microcosm--or he can consider the heavens and see God moving in majestic and marvelous macrocosm!</i>(<i>D&amp;amp;C 84:82; D&amp;amp;C 88:47)</i>[Neal A. Maxwell,<i>Things As They Really Are</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1978), p. 37]<br><br>As a botanist, I interpret Jesus' instruction to "consider the lilies" not as a suggestion but as an imperative.<br><h2><b>4. Mechanism and the Role of God in the Universe</b></h2><br>This consideration of the "lilies of the field" brings me to the fourth point I would like to address. For some scholars, I fear, limited mortal vision causes them to believe that mechanistic descriptions of the universe leave no room for God. Most people, when they see a beautiful sunset, or a delicate flower, sense the loving hand of the Creator. Sometimes, however, university students who learn the physical mechanisms involved in the colors of the sunset, or the unfolding of a flower, come to believe that the role of God in their lives has been lessened. A panoramic vision would teach us that nothing could be further from the truth.<br><br>My favorite scientific experiment as a child involved the germination of bean seeds in a glass Mason jar. Although as a PhD botanist I know a great deal more about the mechanism of that process, I still find it breathtaking to see the germination of bean seeds or the blossoming of crocus flowers in the spring. Had my sense of wonder disappeared with my degree, my education would have left me impoverished indeed. In his essay<i>Nature</i>(section I, 1836), Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote:<br><br><i>If the stars should appear one night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore; and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of God which had been shown!</i><br><br>Imagine how we would believe and adore if we gazed at the stars and heard the voice of God, as did Moses, saying: "And worlds without number have I created; and I also created them for mine own purpose; and by the Son I created them, which is mine Only Begotten" (Moses 1:33). To a disciple, studies in botany or astrophysics do not weaken faith in the position of God but only increase admiration and love for the Creator.<br><br>I think science is very useful at answering "how" questions: how fast will a rock fall to earth or how quickly will an allele spread through a population? But science has very little to offer on important "why" questions: Why was the world created? Why are we here? Why should we accept Christ as our Redeemer? Deriving morality from mechanism has always been a very dangerous enterprise, and one that we have been warned explicitly against in the Book of Mormon.<br><br>As you recall, Korihor was both nihilistic and militant. He knowingly sought to deceive the people of the Church, "leading away the hearts of many, causing them to lift up their heads in their wickedness" by offering them his flawed, mechanistic view of the world (Alma 30:18). He taunted believers in Christ by saying, "Ye cannot know of things which ye do not see; therefore ye cannot know that there shall be a Christ" (Alma 30:15). Any perceived need for repentance, Korihor argued, was but the effect of a "frenzied mind" (verse 16).<br><br>Alma responded to Korihor's arguments as a quintessential scientist, something we perhaps should expect from a prophet who later compares faith to an experiment. After listening to Korihor, Alma asked in effect, "Okay, Korihor, you claim that there is no God. Where are your data?"<br><br><i>And now what evidence have ye that there is no God, or that Christ cometh not? I say unto you that ye have none, save it be your word only.</i><br><br><i>But, behold, I have all things as a testimony that these things are true; and ye also have all things as a testimony unto you that they are true.</i>[Alma 30:40–41]<br><br>Figuratively speaking, Korihor viewed this universe through a little toy monocular he found in a Cracker Jack box, but his view was no match for Alma's digital satellite imagery. What is the problem of embracing mechanistic explanations of the universe? Exploring mechanisms is useful if we are receptive to the greater truth of the Spirit. However, if our mechanistic view of reality causes us to resist the panoramic views offered by the Lord, ultimately we will fail to understand the things that matter the very most.<br><br>Take, for example, my field of tropical rain forest biology. I know far more about the workings of the tropical rain forest ecosystem now than I knew when I saw my first rain forest many years ago. Yet some of the most important things to me about the rain forest have little to do with scientific exploration.<br><br>When I walk through the Samoan rain forest, strolling through fern and moss, when I hear the gentle song of jungle birds, when I gaze on the shafts of light filtering to the forest floor from the rain forest canopy high above, I feel very deeply the Spirit of the Lord. In the rain forest I feel as though I am completely enveloped in the masterpiece of a kind and loving Creator. My understanding of a few scientific details about that forest does not reduce my admiration for the Creator. Instead, each new thing I learn serves only to increase my awe and my appreciation. When I walk in the rain forest, I feel sometimes as if I am approaching the gates of Eden.<br><br>The rain forest as Eden--that notion brings us back to the question I posed at the beginning of my talk. Why did the Lord send us out of our premortal life to be tested in a world where we would have clouded vision? And what is it here that allows us to see the world with new eyes? Perhaps the story of the disciples on the way to Emmaus can be read as a metaphor for our experience here on earth. While the two disciples walked, a stranger joined them:<br><br><i>And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs. ...</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</i><br><br><i>But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.</i><br><br>The disciples recounted the recent events of the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ but were startled when the stranger began to expound the scriptures to them.<br><br><i>And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.</i><br><br><i>But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.</i><br><br>At this point perhaps it was the marks in his hands or the prayer he uttered or the similarity to the recent accounts of the sacrament of the Lord's supper that jogged the disciples' memories. But in any case, they looked on the stranger with new eyes.<br><br><i>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</i><br><br><i>And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?</i>[Luke 24:13, 15–16, 28–32]<br><br>My young brothers and sisters, Christ has provided the way to open our eyes. He asks us in D&amp;amp;C 19:23 to "learn of me, and listen to my words; walk in the meekness of my Spirit, and you shall have peace in me." Surely it is the peaceful Spirit of the Lord that teaches us of the divinity of the Savior, a Savior that we knew well in the premortal existence but who is initially a stranger to us in this life. We must walk with him on the path to our own Emmaus, listen to him as he opens the scriptures to our understanding, and then have his divinity revealed to us through the ordinances of the priesthood. At that point, if we are truly meek and humble, the Spirit of the Lord can witness to us of his divinity. No wonder that President Brigham Young told Karl G. Maeser: "You ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God" (in Alma P. Burton,<i>Karl G. Maeser: Mormon Educator</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1953], p. 26). I do not believe that Brigham Young feared that mathematics was false, nor did he wish President Maeser to invent a unique set of "Mormon" mathematical functions. I instead believe that Brigham Young knew that, unenlightened by the Spirit of the Lord, our education would be but a mere shadow of what it could otherwise be.<br><br>This coming week, as we prepare on this campus to greet President Gordon B. Hinckley, I pray that the Lord will bless us in the presence of his prophet with the same blessing he gave to the servant of Elisha: "And Elisha prayed, and said, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw" (2 Kings 6:17). That the Lord may open our eyes, and that we may see, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Paul Alan Cox was dean of General and Honors Education at Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 10 October 1995.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>to Rex Lee - Gordon B. Hinckley - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, President Lee, for your gracious and generous introduction. It is wonderful to be with all of you this morning.<br><br>These weekly devotionals are a unique thing for a great university of this kind. I hope you take advantage of them. I do not say this because I am speaking here this morning. I say it because I believe they provide you with a remarkable opportunity for inspiration and the opportunity to share the minds and hearts of General Authorities of the Church and others who have matters of importance to bring to your attention.<br><br>I can assure you that it is a great challenge to speak to a tremendous gathering of this kind. The speakers spend long and worrisome hours in preparation. I am confident that every one of them prays about his or her assignment. Your time at these devotional exercises will not be time wasted. You may pick up something of far greater consequence in your lives than you may get in your academic classes. I do not diminish the importance of your attending your regular classes, but I hold out to you an invitation with strong urging that throughout the year you take advantage of the opportunity to come here on these Tuesday mornings and listen to discourses given in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>Now, at the risk of embarrassing President Lee, I wish to speak of him. His remarkable life has been one worthy of an example for each of you. He was not born nor reared with riches. His achievements have come only through hard work and dedicated service. He grew up in a small town in Arizona. He served a mission for the Church in Mexico, where he learned to speak the language, to love the common people, and to love the Lord and His great work. He came to this university when it was much smaller. He was an excellent student who knew where he wanted to go and what he wanted to do. Notwithstanding his commitment to high scholarship, he was a young man with humor who enjoyed good fun. He won the respect of his peers and was elected student body president. After graduation from BYU, he was accepted at the University of Chicago Law School, where he earned his juris doctorate in 1963. He holds five honorary doctor of law degrees.<br><br>During the 1963 term of the United States Supreme Court, Rex Lee served as law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Byron R. White.<br><br>As a young attorney he won the respect of his peers and superiors. He was appointed assistant U.S. attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's civil division from 1975 to 1976. That was a remarkable achievement for a young man from a remote Arizona cow town. He served as U.S. solicitor general from 1981 to 1985, representing the federal government before the Supreme Court.<br><br>He holds the distinction of having argued the largest number of cases before the Supreme Court in a single term, six in 1986. He has argued fifty-nine cases before the high court.<br><br>He was invited by the trustees to become the first dean of the J. Reuben Clark Law School on this campus. His was the task of assembling a faculty and a library, the two great basic assets of any good school of law.<br><br>Most of us, I am confident, cannot appreciate the enormous work in carrying a load of this kind. His much sought for service represented the tremendous confidence of distinguished clients across the nation. They placed on his shoulders the heavy responsibility of advocating their claims and causes. This speaks volumes for his capacity, for his tenacity, for his scholarship, and for the confidence, respect, and trust in which he is held by lawyers and their clients across the land.<br><br>He is a partner in the widely known and highly respected firm of Siddley &amp;amp; Austin in Chicago. He held the George Sutherland Chair of Law at Brigham Young University since returning to the Law School in 1985.<br><br>It is not an easy thing to find a qualified president for a great university. Every board of trustees or regents can testify to that. Great qualities of leadership are needed. There is a further requirement in the case of Brigham Young University, and that is to find a leader with faith in the Almighty and loyalty to His work. When a new BYU president was needed in 1989, Rex E. Lee was the universal choice of the trustees.<br><br>During these six-plus years he has served with fidelity, with great devotion, with rare ability, and, I may add, with humility.<br><br>Rex Lee is a man not only of strong intellect; he is a man of great faith. He is a man of humble prayer who seeks divine guidance in handling the many responsibilities with which he is constantly faced.<br><br>His beloved companion, Janet, is the quiet pillar of strength who stands at his side, who is his counselor, his comforter, his cheerleader, and his dearest friend. What a wonderful, exemplary picture they present to the members of this faculty and student body.<br><br>During a considerable part of the time that he has served as president, he has carried the terrible burden of cancer. He has fought this dread disease with patience, with prayer, with faith, and with the best medical care available. When many others might have quit long ago, he has gone forward quietly doing his duty. But it is an awesome undertaking to preside over an institution as large and complex as this. He has enjoyed the respect and love of the faculty. I assure you that he has the total confidence of the board of trustees.<br><br>He has presided at a season when there have been many difficult problems to deal with. He has handled them with expertise, understanding, and respect for all involved.<br><br>The university has grown stronger under his leadership. It is the largest Church-owned university in America. It was recently rated by<i>U.S. News and World Report</i>as the number one "best buy" college in America and also received favorable ratings for the quality of its teaching programs among those institutions that have an unusually strong commitment to undergraduate teaching (see<i>U.S. News and World Report,</i>18 September 1995 and 25 September 1995).<br><br>President Lee has laid the foundation and moved forward a great fund-raising drive intended to strengthen the university and its faculty. He has won commitments for many millions of dollars. He is a powerful advocate and a great persuader. He has led this institution with a growing commitment to excellence. He has even brought a smile to the rock-jawed visage of LaVell Edwards, a great accomplishment in and of itself.<br><br>Then, under date of June 12, 1995, recognizing his health problems, he sent to me a letter in which he stated, "I request that you consider releasing me as president of Brigham Young University and that the release occur about the end of this calendar year."<br><br>Speaking in behalf of very many, may I say that we deeply regret the circumstances that prompted this letter. President Lee, I speak for a vast congregation of your friends. We have served with you as trustees, as officers of the university, as friends of the university here and abroad. We love you for the great work you have done. We love you for the tremendous energy you have put into this service. We love you because you have loved this faculty and this student body. This is your alma mater where, in your younger days, you enjoyed life with all that it had to offer. Now in these later years you have nurtured, protected, and guided her. You have served as the tenth president of Brigham Young University with honor and distinction, and with compelling loyalty to the sacred trust imposed in you. You will be so remembered through the years to come. You have left your mark, which will be observed and appreciated through the times that lie ahead.<br><br>Perhaps I speak a little early when you still have service to give. It is two and a half months until the end of the year. But I do so at this time because this hour affords me the opportunity to express in behalf of the trustees and the entire Church our gratitude, our respect, our appreciation, and our love. There will be another occasion for formal release, but it likely will be cluttered with the business of naming a successor. Today I can speak to you and of you without sharing you with any other in the course of my remarks. Thank you for being the man you were when you were invited to assume this high and sacred office. Thank you for your years of preparation, those hard and difficult years when you served as a strong advocate, persuasive and powerful, in behalf of those who conferred upon you the sacred trust given you as attorney and counselor. Thank you for the tremendous work that you did in organizing the J. Reuben Clark Law School. It was a great undertaking fraught with heavy responsibility. You did it so very well that the school was officially recognized from the outset and its graduates honored with the distinction of having been well trained in an excellent school of law. Thank you for your efforts recently made in greatly enlarging the library of the Law School, to make of it an even better place of preparation for those who will serve in the legal profession. Thank you for your dedicated service to the Church you love. You have given unstintingly of your time, your talents, your means, and your heart. You have mingled with the great of the earth, but you have never lost touch with those who walk in humble circumstances. We thank you for the great conviction you have carried in your heart concerning the living reality of God Our Eternal Father and His Beloved Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, and for the persuasiveness with which you have testified concerning these great and sacred matters. Thanks to your beloved Janet, who has stood at your side, who has reared your able family, who has cared for you, inspired you, and loved you. I assure you that we have prayed for both of you and will continue to do so. We hope that you will yet have years in which to teach and practice law without having to carry the heavy burden of administration with which you have been saddled.<br><br>And now to all assembled here this morning, at the risk of bringing further embarrassment to the modest man of whom I have spoken, I wish to hold out to each of you his life as an example by which to guide your own.<br><br>President Lee has become what he is because he has done what this Church expects of each of us. He has walked the path of faith and prayer and obedience. He has walked with faith in the Almighty, with faith in the risen Lord, with faith in the eternal verities that come as the word of God.<br><br>I urge you to do the same. God is our Almighty Father. He is our anchor and our strength. We can look to Him. We must look to Him. We must extend our thanks to Him and seek His direction and guidance and blessing. Not even the most brilliant among us is smart enough to comprehend the majesty and wonder of His ways or to understand the depth of His love for us, His children. He gave His Son, who gave His life for each of us and all of us.<br><br>The Lord Jesus Christ is the Redeemer of the World, who wrought the Atonement in behalf of all, making it possible for us to cross the barrier of death and go forward with our eternal lives to heights undreamed of.<br><br>These great basic truths must become the foundation stones of our lives. Recognition of God and a desire to walk in obedience to His words and ways are essential to every one of us assembled here today. With this knowledge comes the imperative fact of accountability to God for what we do with our lives. We are His sons and daughters, and He will hold us accountable.<br><br>He has established His church, which carries the name of His divine Son, as the conservator and teacher of truth, that truth which will make and keep us free.<br><br>The Father and the Son have spoken in opening this the dispensation of the fulness of times, the most glorious dispensation in all ages of the earth.<br><br>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was established to bring us nearer to God our Father and the risen Lord. It was established as the repository of the keys and authority of the everlasting priesthood, which has come again under the hands of those who received it from the Lord Himself. It is among us. It is real. It is the only power under the heavens that reaches beyond the veil of death. It is eternal and everlasting in its consequences.<br><br>The Church is the great teacher and builder of values. Its precepts are designed to lead men and women along the way of immortality and eternal life, to make their lives more complete, more rich and happy while moving through this vale of tears, and in preparing them for the beauties and wonders of that which lies ahead. Keep faith with the Church. It is true. It is divine. He who stands at its head is the Lord Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of the world. It is the church of the Almighty that carries the name of His divine Son. Its earthly leaders are those who are called of God under a plan that He has put in place.<br><br>What does the Church expect of each of us? It expects the kind of behavior that has been exemplified in the life of the man of whom I have spoken. I am sure that he would be the first to admit that he is far from perfect. So it is with each of us, but we have a mandate to work at it, to keep trying to constantly improve. "We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men" (Articles of Faith 1:13). May I add a few words on this statement as I speak of what this Church expects of us.<br><br>Simple honesty is so remarkable a quality. It is of the very essence of integrity. It demands that we be straightforward, unequivocal, in walking the straight and narrow line of what is right and true. It is so easy to cheat. At times it is so enticing to do so. Better a poor grade than a dishonest act. There has been told and retold on this campus for generations the words of Karl G. Maeser concerning honor. They need to be repeated here and across the world. I suppose all of you have heard them before, but I give them again.<br><br><i>I have been asked what I mean by word of honor. I will tell you. Place me behind prison walls--walls of stone ever so high, ever so thick, reaching ever so far into the ground--there is a possibility that in some way or another I may be able to escape, but stand me on that floor and draw a chalk line around me and have me give my word of honor never to cross it. Can I get out of that circle? No, never! I'd die first!</i>[Alma P. Burton,<i>Karl G. Maeser: Mormon Educator</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1953), p. 71]<br><br>My father was a student of Karl G. Maeser at this institution long ago. He heard those words himself from the lips of Brother Maeser. He repeated them to us again and again. They have become engraved in my mind as if they were words of scripture. They set forth with simplicity and eloquence what this Church expects of me and of you.<br><br>It expects us to be true--true to ourselves, true to our loved ones, true to the best that is within us, true to the faith. President George Albert Smith, on a number of occasions, told of meeting his grandfather, whose name he carried, in a dream. He was asked by his grandfather, "I would like to know what you have done with my name" (George Albert Smith,<i>Sharing the Gospel with Others</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1948], pp. 111–12).<br><br>President Smith said that he never got over the effects of that experience. It was only a dream, but it was real and it was important. There burned within his heart throughout the remainder of his life a compelling mandate to be true to the name that he carried.<br><br>In the language of the article of our faith that I have given you, the Church expects you to be chaste and virtuous. You know what this means. I am satisfied I need not repeat it here. But I do urge you, with all of the capacity of which I am capable, to avoid the corrosive, destructive forces of iniquity found in pornography. Pornography is the literature of the devil. Shun it. Stay away from it. Lift your sights and your minds to the higher and nobler things of life. Enjoy life while you are here at BYU, but do so in ways that are uplifting and wholesome. Remember, "wickedness never was happiness" (Alma 41:10). Sin never brought happiness. Transgression never brought happiness. Disobedience never brought happiness.<br><br>Recognize pornography for what it is--a vicious brew of slime and sleaze, the partaking of which only leads to misery, degradation, and regret. This Church expects you who have taken upon yourselves the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to walk in the sunlight of virtue and enjoy the strength, the freedom, the lift that comes from so doing.<br><br>Drink here from the springs of knowledge that flow with purity in the classrooms of this unique and wonderful institution. Partake of the spirit as well as the knowledge of faithful men and women who constitute the faculty of this school. Learn here the disciplines that will help you as you travel the course of your lives, the most important of which is self-discipline, the power to govern your thoughts, your words, your acts, notwithstanding the temptations that come before you. Learn of things of the heart, the mind, the spirit, and the words and wisdom of the Almighty.<br><br>The Church expects you to reach out with benevolence in doing good to all men. In writing to the Hebrews, Paul admonished, "Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees" (JST, Hebrews 12:12). That admonition is repeated and magnified in modern revelation: "Wherefore, be faithful; stand in the office which I have appointed unto you; succor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees" (D&amp;amp;C 81:5).<br><br>I know that you are engrossed with your studies. This is important, but in a sense it is a selfish pursuit. Take a little time, now and again, to reach out to help others--there are those right around you, students in need of a little kindness, a little attention, a little appreciation. You who are extremely able, you who learn with comparative ease, reach down to those who have greater difficulty in mastering academic material that is relatively easy for you. In so doing you will bless your own life as you bless the lives of those you help. A little tutoring can do wonders for someone who does not quite comprehend. It will do wonders for you as you give of yourself and your knowledge to bless another.<br><br>There are those in nursing homes, hospitals, and those who are shut-ins in their own homes. You can bring sunlight into lives filled with gloom, sadness, and pain. Contradictory as it may sound, the admonition of the Savior is absolutely true as anyone can testify who has put it to the test: "He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it" (Matthew 10:39).<br><br>We were in Boston last April for a regional conference. The stake president invited us to go to the University of Massachusetts Medical Center to visit Robert and Reed Nixon. At the hospital we met with members of the family and proceeded to a special room where two young men were on life-support systems. They were brothers, and they had been injured in a terrible accident. Each was paralyzed from the neck down. We were asked to bless them and did so.<br><br>Months have now passed. They have left the hospital, followed by a term at a rehabilitation center. They are now home and are making some headway. The most severely injured spoke in stake conference two weeks ago. Tears fell from the eyes of that large congregation who listened to a boy say with great effort a few words of gratitude and faith.<br><br>They have been able to come home because of the kindness of others. A handful of contractors in the area contributed time, labor, and materials, as well as their skills, to add to the family home, creating facilities that have made it possible for the boys to be with their loved ones.<br><br>Give expression to the noble desires that lie within your hearts to reach out to comfort, sustain, and build others. As you do so, the cankering poison of selfishness will leave you, and it will be replaced by a sweet and wonderful feeling that seems to come in no other way. Never forget that the Church expects you to be benevolent and to do good to all men.<br><br>I add to this the related thought that you will grow as you look for the good in others. This season of your schooling is a time not only to expand your minds but to enlarge your personalities and strengthen your character as you look for the virtues, the strengths, the goodness, in the lives of those about you.<br><br>Finally, the Church expects you to work while you are here. It is making a tremendous investment in you, an investment that comes from the sacred tithing funds of the Church. Work is the miracle by which talent is brought to the surface and dreams become reality.<br><br>I think President Rex Lee's life is a compendium of these great virtues and expectations of which I have spoken. I commend them to each of you, even at the expense of embarrassing this modest man.<br><br>In conclusion, I speak out of my heart with sincerity with love for each of you. You who are here are so richly blessed with a great and precious opportunity. Do not waste it. Do not regard it lightly. It is sacred and of great consequence. Be thankful every day of your lives while you are here. Pray for guidance. Pray for help. Pray for strength to resist that which is evil. Seek the enlightenment of the spirit of Christ. Cultivate and invite the direction of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>Everyone of you is precious. You are precious in the sight of God. You are precious in the sight of your parents. You are precious to us who count on you to take advantage of this great season of preparation for the world in which you will live.<br><br>President Lee, I salute you and honor you as you serve in these waning months of a great administration. I apologize if I have embarrassed you. I have spoken with sincerity out of great respect and affection. Faculty, students, I compliment each of you on the precious opportunity that is yours to walk with fidelity, devotion, loyalty, hard work, and appreciation for all that is good and uplifting.<br><br>I leave my blessing with you and commend to you every good thing, that your lives may be fruitful in those strengths and virtues that distinguish the noble and the great and the good from those who live beneath their possibilities. May you be blessed of the Lord is my humble prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Gordon B.

<h1>A Proclamation to the World - Henry B. Eyring - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Since the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ through the Prophet Joseph Smith until September 23, 1995, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has issued a proclamation only four times. It has been more than fifteen years since the last one, which described the progress the Church had made in 150 years of its history. Thus you can imagine the importance our Heavenly Father places upon the subject of this most recent proclamation.<br><br>Newspapers and television flood us with words and pictures about issues and events to think about and worry about. One of the great blessings of having faith in living prophets is that we can know what really matters, what is worth our attention in this confusing world and in our crowded lives.<br><br>Because our Father loves his children, he will not leave us to guess about what matters most in this life concerning where our attention could bring happiness or our indifference bring sadness. Sometimes he will tell us directly, by inspiration. But he will, in addition, tell us through his servants. In the words of a prophet named Amos, recorded long ago, "Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets" (Amos 3:7). He does that so that even those who cannot feel inspiration can know, if they will only listen, that they have been told the truth and been warned.<br><br>The title of the proclamation reads: "The Family: A Proclamation to the World--The First Presidency and Council of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints" (see<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, p. 102).<br><br>Three things about the title are worth our careful reflection. First, the subject: the family. Second, the audience, which is the whole world. And third, those who proclaimed are those we sustain as prophets, seers, and revelators. That means that the family must be as important to us as anything we can consider, that what the proclamation says could help anyone in the world, and that the proclamation fits the Lord's promise when he said, "Whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same" (D&amp;amp;C 1:38).<br><br>Before we start to listen to the words of the proclamation together, the title tells us something about how to prepare. We can expect that God won't just tell us a few interesting things about the family; he will tell us what a family ought to be and why. And we know at the outset that we could be easily overwhelmed with such thoughts as "This is so high a standard, and I am so weak that I can never hope for such a family." That feeling can come because what our Heavenly Father and his Son Jesus Christ want for us is to become like them so that we can dwell with them forever, in families. We know that from this simple statement of their intent: "This is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39).<br><br>Eternal life means to become like the Father and to live in families in happiness and joy forever, so of course what he wants for us will require help beyond our powers. That feeling of our inadequacy can make it easier to repent and to be ready to rely on the Lord's help.<br><br>The fact that the proclamation goes to all the world--to every person and government in it--gives us assurance that we need not be overwhelmed. Whoever we are, however difficult our circumstances, we can know that what our Father commands we do to qualify for the blessings of eternal life will not be beyond us. What a young boy said long ago when he faced a seemingly impossible assignment is true:<br><br><i>I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</i>[1 Nephi 3:7]<br><br>We may have to pray with faith to know what we are to do, and we must pray with a determination to obey, but we can know what to do and be sure that the way has been prepared for us by the Lord. As we read of what the proclamation tells us about the family, we can expect, in fact we must expect, impressions to come to our minds as to what we are to do, and we can be confident it is possible.<br><br>The proclamation begins this way:<br><br><i>We, the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, solemnly proclaim that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children.</i><br><br>Try to imagine yourself as a little child, hearing those words for the first time and believing that they are true. This can be a useful attitude whenever we read or hear the word of God because he has told us, "Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein" (Luke 18:17).<br><br>A little child would feel safe hearing the words that marriage between a man and woman is ordained of God. The child would know that the longing to have the love of both a father and a mother, distinct but somehow perfectly complementary, exists because that is the eternal pattern, the pattern of happiness. The child would also feel safer knowing that God would help mother and father resolve differences and love each other, if only they ask for his help and try. Prayers of children across the earth would go up to God, pleading for his help for parents and for families.<br><br>Read in that same way, as if you were a little child, the next words of the proclamation:<br><br><i>All human beings--male and female--are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny. Gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose.</i><br><br><i>In the premortal realm, spirit sons and daughters knew and worshiped God as their Eternal Father and accepted His plan by which His children could obtain a physical body and gain earthly experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize his or her divine destiny as an heir of eternal life. The divine plan of happiness enables family relationships to be perpetuated beyond the grave. Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible for individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally.</i><br><br>Understanding these truths ought to make it easier for us to feel like a little child, not just as we read the proclamation, but throughout our lives, because we are children--but in what a family and of what parents! We can picture ourselves as we were, for longer than we can imagine, sons and daughters associating in our heavenly home with parents who knew and loved us. But now we can see ourselves home again with our heavenly parents in that wonderful place, not only as sons and daughters but as husbands and wives, fathers and mothers, grandfathers and grandmothers, grandsons and granddaughters, bound together forever in loving families. And we know that in the premortal world we were men or women, with unique gifts because of our gender, and that the opportunity to be married and to become one was necessary for us to have eternal happiness.<br><br>With that picture before us, we can never be tempted even to think "Maybe I wouldn't like eternal life. Maybe I would be just as happy in some other place in the life after death. I've heard that even the lowest kingdoms are more beautiful than anything we have ever seen."<br><br>We must have the goal not just in our minds but in our hearts. What we want is eternal life in families. We don't just want it if that is what works out, nor do we want something approaching eternal life. We want eternal life, whatever its cost in effort, pain, and sacrifice. Whenever we are tempted to make eternal life our hope instead of our determination, we might think of a building I took a look at a few weeks ago.<br><br>I was in Boston. For a little nostalgia, my wife and I walked up to the front of the boarding house I was living in when I met Kathleen, who is now my wife. That was a long time ago, so I expected to find the house a little more dilapidated than it was, since I seem to be a little more dilapidated. But to our surprise it was freshly painted and much renovated. A university has purchased it from the Sopers, the people who owned it and ran it as a boarding house.<br><br>The building was locked, so we couldn't get in to see the back room on the top floor, which once was mine. Costs have changed, so this will be hard for you to believe, but this was the deal the Sopers gave me: My own large room and bath, furniture and sheets provided, maid service, six big breakfasts and five wonderful dinners a week--all at the price of twenty-one dollars a week. More than that, the meals were ample and prepared with such skill that we called our landlady with some affection "Ma Soper." Just talking about it with you makes me realize that I didn't thank Mrs. Soper often enough, nor Mr. Soper and their daughter, since it must have been some burden to have twelve single men to dinner every weeknight.<br><br>Now, you aren't tempted by that description of a boarding house, and neither am I. It could have the most spacious rooms, the best service, and the finest eleven men you could ever know as fellow boarders and we wouldn't want to live there more than a short while. If it were beautiful beyond our power to imagine, we wouldn't want to live there forever, single, if we have even the dimmest memory or the faintest vision of a family with beloved parents and children like the one from which we came to this earth and the one that is our destiny to form and to live in forever. There is only one place where there will be families--the highest degree of the celestial kingdom. That is where we will want to be.<br><br>A child hearing and believing those words would begin a lifetime of looking for a holy temple where ordinances and covenants perpetuate family relationships beyond the grave and would begin a striving to become worthy, and to find a potential mate who has become worthy, of such ordinances. The words of the proclamation make it clear that to receive those blessings requires some sort of perfecting experiences. A child might not sense at first, but soon would learn, that all the making of resolutions and trying harder can produce only faltering progress toward perfection. With age will come temptations to acts that create feelings of guilt. Every child will someday feel those pangs of conscience, as we all have. And those who feel that priceless sense of guilt and cannot shake it may despair, sensing that eternal life requires a progress toward perfection that seems increasingly to be beyond them. So you and I will resolve to speak to someone who doesn't yet know what we know about how that perfection is produced. We will do that because we know that someday they will want what we want, and will then realize that we were their brother or sister and that we knew the way to eternal life. Tonight and tomorrow it won't be hard to be a member missionary if you think of that future moment when they and we will see things as they really are.<br><br>Some other words in the proclamation will have special meaning for us, knowing what we know about eternal life. They are in the next two paragraphs:<br><br><i>The first commandment that God gave to Adam and Eve pertained to their potential for parenthood as husband and wife. We declare that God's commandment for His children to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force. We further declare that God has commanded that the sacred powers of procreation are to be employed only between man and woman, lawfully wedded as husband and wife.</i><br><br><i>We declare the means by which mortal life is created to be divinely appointed. We affirm the sanctity of life and of its importance in God's eternal plan.</i><br><br>Believing those words, a child could spot easily the mistakes in reasoning made by adults. For instance, apparently wise and powerful people blame poverty and famine on there being too many people in some parts of the earth or in all the earth. With great passion they argue for limiting births as if that will produce human happiness. A child believing the proclamation will know that cannot be so, even before hearing these words from the Lord through his prophet, Joseph Smith: "For the earth is full, and there is enough and to spare; yea, I prepared all things, and have given unto the children of men to be agents unto themselves" (D&amp;amp;C 104:17).<br><br>A child could see that Heavenly Father would not command men and women to marry and to multiply and replenish the earth if the children they invited into mortality would deplete the earth. Since there is enough and to spare, the enemy of human happiness as well as the cause of poverty and starvation is not the birth of children. It is the failure of people to do with the earth what God could teach them to do, if only they would ask and then obey, for they are agents unto themselves.<br><br>We would also see that the commandment to be chaste, to employ the powers of procreation only as husband and wife, is not limiting but rather expanding and exalting. Children are the inheritance of the Lord to us not only in this life, but also in eternity. Eternal life is not only to have forever our descendants from this life. It is also to have eternal increase. This is the description of what awaits those of us married as husband and wife by a servant of God with authority to offer us the sacred sealing ordinances. Here are the words of the Lord:<br><br><i>It shall be done unto them in all things whatsoever my servant hath put upon them, in time, and through all eternity; and shall be of full force when they are out of the world; and they shall pass by the angels, and the gods, which are set there, to their exaltation and glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon their heads, which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever.</i><br><br><i>Then shall they be gods, because they have no end; therefore shall they be from everlasting to everlasting.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 132:19–20]<br><br>Now you can see why our Father in Heaven puts such a high standard before us in using procreative powers whose continuation is at the heart of eternal life. He told us what that was worth this way: "And, if you keep my commandments and endure to the end you shall have eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God" (D&amp;amp;C 14:7).<br><br>We can understand why our Heavenly Father commands us to reverence life and to cherish the powers that produce it as sacred. If we do not have those feelings in this life, how could our Father give them to us in the eternities? Family life here is the schoolroom in which we prepare for family life there. And to give us the opportunity for family life there was and is the purpose of creation. That is why the coming of Elijah was described this way:<br><br><i>And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers. If it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming.</i>[JS--H 1:39]<br><br>For some of us, the test in the schoolroom of mortality will be to want marriage and children in this life with all our hearts, but to have it delayed or denied. Even such a sorrow can be turned to a blessing by a just and loving Father and his Son, Jesus Christ. No one who strives with full faith and heart for the blessings of eternal life will be denied. And how great will be the joy and how much deeper the appreciation then after enduring in patience and faith now.<br><br>The proclamation describes our schooling here for family life in the presence of our Eternal Father:<br><br><i>Husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other and for their children. "Children are an heritage of the Lord" (Psalms 127:3). Parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness, to provide for their physical and spiritual needs, to teach them to love and serve one another, to observe the commandments of God and to be law-abiding citizens wherever they live. Husbands and wives--mothers and fathers--will be held accountable before God for the discharge of these obligations.</i><br><br><i>The family is ordained of God. Marriage between man and woman is essential to His eternal plan. Children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony, and to be reared by a father and a mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity. Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities. By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families. Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children. In these sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners. Disability, death, or other circumstances may necessitate individual adaptation. Extended families should lend support when needed.</i><br><br>Those two paragraphs are filled with practical implications. There are things we can start to do now. They have to do with providing for the spiritual and the physical needs of a family. There are things we can do now to prepare, long before the need, so that we can be at peace knowing we have done all we can.<br><br>To begin with, we can decide to plan for success, not for failure. Statistics are thrown at us every day to persuade us that a family composed of a loving father and mother with children loved, taught, and cared for in the way the proclamation enjoins is going the way of the dinosaurs, toward extinction. You have enough evidence in your own families that righteous people sometimes have their families ripped apart by circumstances beyond their control. It takes courage and faith to plan for what God holds before you as the ideal rather than what might be forced upon you by circumstances.<br><br>There are important ways in which planning for failure can make failure more likely and the ideal less so. Consider these twin commandments as an example: "Fathers are to ... provide the necessities of life ... for their families" and "mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children." Knowing how hard that might be, a young man might choose a career on the basis of how much money he could make, even if it meant he couldn't be home enough to be an equal partner. By doing that, he has already decided he cannot hope to do what would be best. A young woman might prepare for a career incompatible with being primarily responsible for the nurture of her children because of the possibilities of not marrying, of not having children, or of being left alone to provide for them herself. Or she might fail to focus her education on the gospel and knowledge of the world that nurturing a family would require, not realizing that the highest and best use she could make of her talents and her education would be in her home. Because a young man and woman had planned to take care of the worst, they might make the best less likely.<br><br>They are both wise to worry about the physical needs of that future family. The costs of buying a home, compared to average salaries, seem to be rising, and jobs seem harder to hold. But there are other ways the young man and the young woman could think about preparing to provide for that future family. Income is only one part of it. Have you noticed husbands and wives who feel pinched for lack of money, then choose ways to make their family income keep rising, and then find that the pinch is there whatever the income? There is an old formula you've heard that goes something like this: Income five dollars and expenses six dollars: misery. Income four dollars and expenses three dollars: happiness (see Charles Dickens,<i>David Copperfield,</i>chapter 12).<br><br>Whether the young man can provide and still be in the home and whether the young woman can be there to nurture children can depend as much on how they learn to spend as how they learn to earn. Brigham Young said it this way, speaking to us as much as he did to the people in his day:<br><br><i>If you wish to get rich, save what you get. A fool can earn money; but it takes a wise man to save and dispose of it to his own advantage. Then go to work, and save everything, and make your own bonnets and clothing.</i>[<i>JD</i>11:301]<br><br>In today's world, instead of telling you to make bonnets, he might suggest you think carefully about what you really need in cars and houses and vacations and whatever else you will someday try to provide for your children. And he might point out that the difference in cost between what the world tells you is necessary and what your children really need could allow you the margin in time that a father and a mother might need with their children to bring them home to their Heavenly Father.<br><br>Even the most frugal spending habits and the most careful planning for employment may not be enough to ensure success, but it could be enough to allow you the peace that comes from knowing you did the best you could to provide and to nurture.<br><br>There is another way we could plan to succeed, despite the difficulties that might lie before us. The proclamation sets a high hurdle for us to clear when it describes our obligation to teach our children. We are somehow to teach them so that they love one another and serve one another and keep the commandments and are law-abiding citizens. If we think of good families who have not met that test, and few meet it without some degree of failure over a generation or two, we could lose heart.<br><br>We cannot control what others choose to do, and so we cannot force our children to heaven, but we can determine what we will do. And we can decide that we will do all that we can to bring down the powers of heaven into that family we want so much to have forever.<br><br>A key for us is in the proclamation in this sentence: "Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ."<br><br>What could make it more likely that people in a family would love and serve one another, observe the commandments of God, and obey the law? It is not simply teaching them the gospel. It is in their hearing the word of God and then trying it in faith. If they do, their natures will be changed in a way that produces the happiness we seek. These words from Moroni describe exactly how that change is the natural fruit of living the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br><i>And the first fruits of repentance is baptism; and baptism cometh by faith unto the fulfilling the commandments; and the fulfilling the commandments bringeth remission of sins;</i><br><br><i>And the remission of sins bringeth meekness, and lowliness of heart; and because of meekness and lowliness of heart cometh the visitation of the Holy Ghost, which Comforter filleth with hope and perfect love, which love endureth by diligence unto prayer, until the end shall come, when all the saints shall dwell with God.</i>[Moroni 8:25–26]<br><br>When we prepare a child for baptism, if we do it well, we prepare them for the process that will bring the effects of the Atonement into their lives and the powers of heaven into our home. Think of the change we need. We need the Holy Ghost to fill us with hope and perfect love so that we can endure by diligence unto prayer. And then we can dwell forever with God in families. How can it come? By the simple promise Mormon described to his son Moroni. Faith in Jesus Christ unto repentance and then baptism by those with authority leads to remission of sins. And that produces meekness and lowliness of heart. And that in turn allows us to have the companionship of the Holy Ghost, which fills us with hope and perfect love.<br><br>You know that is true; I know that is true from my own experience and from the experiences of those in my family. We found on our bedspread after a twenty-hour flight across the world a sign written in colors in a childish hand: "You must be<i>so</i>tired! Lie down and relax! You're back home where we'll take care of everything!" And in a phone call made at a stopping place on that flight home the older sister said, "Oh, I'm just vacuuming the house."<br><br>How does an eleven-year-old who has never flown across the sea know the effects of jet lag on her mother and father? How does a fifteen-year-old decide to run a vacuum without being asked? Or how does a husband know the feelings of his wife, or a wife the feelings of her husband, and so understand without being told and then help without being asked? Why does a niece give up her bed to an aunt and a nephew share his house and dinner table? How do a son and a daughter-in-law find it possible to take children into their already busy home and act as if it were a blessing? It takes the powers of heaven brought down by believing these words and acting on them:<br><br><i>And the remission of sins bringeth meekness, and lowliness of heart; and because of meekness and lowliness of heart cometh the visitation of the Holy Ghost, which Comforter filleth with hope and perfect love, which love endureth by diligence unto prayer, until the end shall come, when all the saints shall dwell with God.</i>[Moroni 8:26]<br><br>And may I add the words<i>in families.</i><br><br>The proclamation is careful in what it promises: "Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ." My heart aches a little to know that many who read those words will be surrounded by those who do not know or who deny the teachings of Jesus Christ. They can only do their best. But they can know this: Their placement in a family, however challenging, is known by a loving Heavenly Father. They can know that a way is prepared for them to do all that will be required for them to qualify for eternal life. They may not see how God could give them that gift, nor with whom they will share it. Yet the promise of the gospel of Jesus Christ is sure:<br><br><i>But learn that he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come.</i><br><br><i>I, the Lord, have spoken it, and the Spirit beareth record. Amen.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 59:23–24]<br><br>That peace will come from the assurance that the Atonement has worked in our lives and from the hope of eternal life that springs from it.<br><br>The proclamation warns that for those who fail to respond, the result will be more disastrous than simply lack of peace in this life or absence of happiness. Here is the prophetic warning and the call to action with which the proclamation ends:<br><br><i>We warn that individuals who violate covenants of chastity, who abuse spouse or offspring, or who fail to fulfill family responsibilities will one day stand accountable before God. Further, we warn that the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals, communities, and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets.</i><br><br><i>We call upon responsible citizens and officers of government everywhere to promote those measures designed to maintain and strengthen the family as the fundamental unit of society.</i><br><br>The family unit is not only fundamental to society and to the Church but to our hope for eternal life. We begin to practice in the family, the smaller unit, what will spread to the Church and to the society in which we live in this world and what then will be what we practice in families bound together forever by covenants and faithfulness. We can start now to "promote those measures designed to maintain and strengthen the family." I pray that we will. I pray that you will ask, "Father, how can I prepare?" Tell him how much you want what it is that he wants so much to give you. You will receive impressions, and if you act on them I promise you the help of the powers of heaven.<br><br>I testify that our Heavenly Father lives, that we lived with him as spirits, and that we would be lonely living anywhere but with him in the world to come.<br><br>I testify that Jesus Christ is our Savior, that he made possible the changes in you and me that can give us eternal life by suffering for the sins of all of us, his spirit brothers and sisters, the children of his Heavenly Father and our Heavenly Father.<br><br>I testify that the Holy Ghost can fill us with hope and with perfect love.<br><br>And I testify that the sealing power restored to Joseph Smith and now held by President Gordon B. Hinckley can bind us in families and give us eternal life, if we do all that we can do in faith. And I so testify and express my love to you, in the name of the Lord, Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Henry B. Eyring was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 5 November 1995.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>Forget to Believe - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, this is a great privilege and a frightening one. I would feel much more at home if we were having a zone conference. I pray for the Spirit and trust that the Lord will help me. I am grateful that Heber and I can be here together; that is the wonderful thing about a mission. I believe it was Elder Victor L. Brown's wife who observed that only in the Church can one be married for time and all eternity and separated for life; but that is not so in the mission field.<br><br>A few years ago, during a rather extensive trip to the British Isles, I had the opportunity to speak to many young women, gathered in many different meeting houses. Upon my return I received a letter in the mail from a young woman that began: "Do you remember me? I was the one in the green jumper on the second row!"<br><br>On another occasion following a large gathering of young women at a girls' camp in the Northwest, I received another letter. This young woman had no question that I would remember her, but her letter was one of request. She wrote: "After the meeting we had, I stood in line. You hugged me and said something wonderful to me, but I can't remember what it was. Would you please write and tell me so I can put it in my journal and read it when I feel bad?" I, of course, didn't remember exactly what I had told her; but I answered her letter with the message that I usually tried to whisper in each young woman's ear (along with giving the hug): "Remember, you are a daughter of a Heavenly Father who loves you. Remember always to stand as a witness of God at all times, and in all things, and in all places." (Many of you will recognize that as part of the Young Women theme.) That would be about all there was time to say. Occasionally, one of these young women would go to the end of the line and come through a second time for a hug and a reminder.<br><br>Is there anyone who does not have a need, bone-marrow deep, to be remembered? In our recent general conference, in his closing address, President Gordon B. Hinckley expressed his feelings about this when he said: "I wish I had some way to thank you<i>individually"</i>("Stay the Course--Keep the Faith,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, p. 70). He said he hoped that in the growth of the Church we never forget it is the individual that counts. In a recent surprise visit to a stake conference in Magna, Utah, he told the people, "I did not come here to preach: I just came to tell you I love you." Do you recall the gentle request of one of the thieves who hung on a cross next to Jesus? "Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom." And Jesus' reassuring answer was, "Verily I say unto thee, Today shalt thou be with me in paradise" (Luke 23:42, 43).<br><br>He remembers us. He knows us. He knows our names, our thoughts, our hopes, and our fears. One of our early prophets wrote:<br><br><i>Now, this is the truth. We humble people; we who feel ourselves sometimes so worthless, so good-for-nothing; we are not so worthless as we think. There is not one of us but what God's love has been expended upon. There is not one of us that He has not cared for and caressed.</i>[George Q. Cannon, "Our Pre-Existence and Present Probation,"<i>Collected Discourses,</i>vol. 2, comp. and ed. Brian H. Stuy (Burbank, California: B.H.S. Publishing, 1988), p. 143]<br><br>There may be days when, like the young woman, we may want to ask, "Do you remember me? You hugged me and said something wonderful to me, but I forgot. Can you write and tell me so I can read it when I feel bad?" We might add "because I want to be happy."<br><br>Fortunately we have the scriptures that I have referred to as my "letters from home." The great plan of happiness, of which Alma speaks, calls for a forgetting. Through God's mercy and love for us, He has provided a road map to eternal salvation that will eventually bring lasting happiness; and this plan requires that we be tried and tested along the way.<br><br>There is much to be learned from struggle, pain, and sorrow; however, the plan assures eternal happiness--a happiness far greater than the common definition that most people think of today. Is our Father in Heaven<i>always</i>happy according to our definition? Is Christ always happy? The scriptures are replete with accounts of their sorrow and pain over the actions of disobedient children. And what were the feelings of God the Father when it became necessary to withdraw the support of His immediate presence as His Only Begotten Son was dying on the cross? Not happiness, surely. So what are we to understand about the nature of happiness? Because of the grand plan of salvation that necessitates this mortal period of testing, of freedom to choose, of growth toward eternal goals--<i>if we choose to commit our lives in that direction</i>--our Father in Heaven has provided a way for our return. It is that assurance that brings us peace and happiness and the joy of the journey.<br><br><i>Verily, thus saith the Lord: It shall come to pass that every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face and know that I am.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 93:1]<br><br>Our return to our Father's eternal realms is His ultimate objective--His work and His glory. It was and is also the essential mission of His Son. It was why Jesus Christ, who created our world and our whole universe, took a mortal body, endured temptation, ridicule, and an ignominious death to become our Savior, our Redeemer, and our advocate with the Father.<br><br>Lest we forget, the grand plan is designed for our happiness; but this plan required a period of<i>forgetting,</i>because an essential part of the plan is the exercise of faith--faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. One of the most reassuring thoughts that has comforted me throughout my years has been: "I chose to come here. I sustained Christ's plan rather than Satan's in the premortal existence." We all knew, before we were born, that we were coming to earth and would experience joy<i>and</i>sorrow. We eagerly accepted the plan. My father made this point very clear to me some years ago. I was wrestling with what to me seemed major issues in my life, with prayers not yet answered, or so I thought. Into my mind I heard him speak, although he had been gone for several years: "My dear, don't trouble yourself about the little things, and the big things you already agreed to before you came." We chose this life, with the struggles. We chose to accept the forgetting and to see whether we would walk by faith.<br><br>It is a wonderful reassurance in our day to have the scriptures. They give us evidence of many who, with no recollection of their premortal life, exercised their faith, kept the commandments, and were reassured of their salvation. Whatever pains or sorrows or dislocations we may endure, the ultimate definition of happiness for us must be knowing that we have been faithful and that our salvation is assured. The forgetting may be gradual, but that we learn to walk by faith is essential.<br><br>Consider the tender account told of little four-year-old Sachi.<br><br><i>Soon after her brother was born, little Sachi began to ask her parents to leave her alone with the new baby. They decided to allow it. Elated, she went into the baby's room and shut the door, but it opened a crack--enough for her curious parents to peek in and listen. They saw little Sachi walk quietly up to her baby brother, put her face close to his, and say quietly, "Baby, tell me what God feels like. I'm starting to forget."</i><br><br>Yes, there is a forgetting, but thankfully there is also a remembering crucial to our inner peace and well-being. To remember is to keep in mind, retain the thought; and remembrance is the ability to recall, to retrieve, to bring back. This matter of retaining or retrieving is strengthened with keepsakes, mementoes, tokens, symbols, CTR rings, journals, and so on.<br><br>Young women have colors as reminders of Young Women values. Whenever the color purple is seen, it is to bring to mind the value of integrity: "I will make my actions consistent with my knowledge of right and wrong." Symbols of this kind stimulate our memories, which then affect our attitude and our behavior.<br><br>The "journal-keeping" of Nephi, of Alma, and especially the tremendous efforts of Mormon were motivated by their wish to keep future generations always in remembrance. How often we read of numerous times when God delivered a group of people when they were faithful, when they remembered.<br><br>On a very personal level, remember David's response to Saul, who had told him that he would not be able to fight Goliath because he was "but a youth," and so he was. However, he had some memorable experiences in his life to draw from. With confidence David responded, "The Lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine" (1 Samuel 17:37). How important was it to David and all of Israel that he remembered how the Lord had blessed him in the past?<br><br>How important is it for each of us to remember those times when without the Lord's help we could never have accomplished the mission or the calling, the task or the challenge given to us? When we can draw from the past, we don't have to retest every decision or experience, or burn our hand on the hot stove yet again. We can turn to our storehouse of memory over and over again to recall, replay, or relive precious, important, and sacred moments. These will sustain, comfort, and protect us against uncertainty or a faltering faith. I saw a cartoon recently of a huge slingshot. The caption read: "As you face your Goliaths in life,<i>remember,</i>help is only a stone's throwaway."<br><br>When Oliver Cowdery began his labors as a scribe in the translation of the Book of Mormon, the Lord spoke to Oliver through Joseph Smith as follows:<br><br><i>Behold, thou art Oliver, and I have spoken unto thee because of thy desires; therefore treasure up these words in thy heart. Be faithful and diligent in keeping the commandments of God, and I will encircle thee in the arms of my love. . . .</i><br><br><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, if you desire a further witness, cast your mind upon the night that you cried unto me in your heart, that you might know concerning the truth of these things.</i><br><br><i>Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter? What greater witness can you have than from God?</i>[D&amp;amp;C 6:20, 22–23]<br><br>It is as if the Lord were saying: "Remember, remember, Oliver, what I told you before. Treasure those memories. Draw strength from them, and never ever forget." He could say to each of us: "Remember those times that I spoke peace to your mind."<br><br>When I speak of remembering our Father in Heaven, it is quite a different thing than remembering the face, name, and influence of, say, an important teacher in our life from the past. When we left our Father's presence and were born, a veil was drawn over our eyes. It is similar to what we experience with the wind. We do not<i>see</i>it, but we can, if we observe carefully, see the trees sway and the waves build up and feel its force against us as we walk. We may also feel or see the influence of our Father in Heaven, but we are not allowed (for very sound eternal reasons) to remember our Heavenly Father in the same way I remember my fourth-grade teacher Miss Redd.<br><br>The text of Eliza R. Snow's poem is a glorious statement of our<i>not</i>coming here with a full remembrance from the premortal existence:<br><br><i>For a wise and glorious purpose</i><br><i>Thou hast placed me here on earth</i><br><i>And withheld the recollection</i><br><i>Of my former friends and birth.</i><br>["O My Father,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 292]<br><br>Now if there were a formula, an equation, a prescription that could be easily dispensed that would provide total memory and instant recall of what we are learning daily, I would suppose that on the day before final exams, or for some, maybe the morning of the day, there would be a lineup that would make the BYU lineups seem short. When we have spent a great deal of time and effort with our studies, we ought to remember, we want to remember, but often times we don't. We know that the information is in our mind somewhere, like on a marvelous computer chip, but the retrieval is not always readily available or dependable. I've heard of people who claim to have a photographic memory but not same-day delivery! (You will better understand that in years to come.) Someone has said it is hard to be nostalgic when you can't remember anything.<br><br>This matter of forgetting and remembering seems to play tricks on us as we get older. But I'm not talking about such things as remembering where you put your wallet or the keys to the car or your checkbook--or even the information you need to pass your exams. I am talking about remembering the experiences that keep us ever mindful of the precious gift of life and its meaning and purpose and all that it offers--our covenants, our family relationships, and our homeward journey.<br><br>Where is this home I am referring to? Let's say that as I came here today, I saw one of you that I recognized as a former student and said, "Julie, how are you?"<br><br>And Julie replied, "I feel wonderful today. I just bought my ticket to fly home for Christ-mas." I would not experience any confusion about where Julie is going, no ambiguity about her sense of joy in knowing she would be with her family; and, because I knew that she came from a place halfway around the world, I would also know what the costs were for her to travel home--how she had worked and saved and denied herself many luxuries and maybe some necessities. Today, in a different sense, Julie could also say, "I feel wonderful. I'm on my way home." So where is this home that is our ultimate journey?<br><br>This life is the time to work and to save and to prepare and, yes, deny ourselves some things, many things that we may at the time even consider a sacrifice. The gospel principles help give us a vision of that home, tell us what to do, how to save, where to buy the ticket, and the price we must pay. A current temple recommend is symbolic of that ticket. I urge you to remember the essential nature of the journey we are each on and the<i>home</i>that our journey leads us to. I testify that if we are devotedly intent on "being home for Christmas," we will be guided in every major decision we have to make throughout our lives, and we will enjoy the journey. Oh, let us remember, lest we forget to believe in that eternal home.<br><br>I am convinced that we do not enter this life without strong promptings, that there was for each of us a significant<i>before,</i>and there will be a significant<i>after.</i>W. H. Auden, the contemporary English poet, expressed this thought as follows:<br><br><i>I am sure it is everyone's experience, as it has been mine, that any "discovery" we make about ourselves or the meaning of life, is never, like a scientific discovery, a coming upon something entirely new and unsuspected; it is rather, the coming to conscious recognition of something which we really knew all the time, but, because we were unwilling or unable to formulate it correctly, we did not hitherto know we knew.</i><br><br>Eliza R. Snow expressed the same thought:<br><br><i>Yet ofttimes a secret something</i><br><i>Whispered, "You're a stranger here,"</i><br><i>And I felt that I had wandered</i><br><i>From a more exalted sphere.</i><br>["O My Father,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 292]<br><br>Because of the biblical accounts of Christ's death and resurrection, all those who accept Christian doctrines believe in an afterlife. By comparison, however, very few, if any, understand that we were born first as spirit children, that we had to make choices there, and that this mortal life is a<i>second</i>stage in a grand three-step plan. Through revelations given to prophets, we Latter-day Saints can put into concrete form what W. H. Auden referred to as "coming to conscious recognition of something which we really knew all the time."<br><br>We knew that a veil would be drawn over our eyes and our memories. Alma tells us: "God gave unto them commandments, after having made known unto them the plan of redemption" (Alma 12:32). The lessons we were taught in the premortal existence included the plan for our salvation. The small promptings or inklings of memory we carry into this life are like a lighthouse in the harbor that beckons us home through stormy seas. Faith in the eternal plan helps fill the cavity of emptiness when we may feel alone or homesick. It can help create a bond with those who have gone before when, for a time, the veil still separates us.<br><br>To the young woman who asked the question "Do you remember me?" perhaps I might have responded with the question "Do you remember you? Do you remember who you are and whose you are? Do you remember Him who bought you with a price?" President George Q. Cannon gives us this insight:<br><br><i>There is no doubt in my mind that we were familiar with the principles of the Gospel; and though they had faded from our memories, yet when we heard them again the recollection was revived. I believe that when we see our Father in heaven we shall know Him; and the recollection that we were once with Him, and that He was our father, will come back to us, and we will fall upon His neck, and He will fall upon us, and we will kiss each other. We will know our Mother, also. We will know those who have begotten us in the spirit world just as much as we will know each other after we pass from this state of existence into another sphere.</i>[George Q. Cannon, "Blessings of the Latter-day Saints,"<i>Collected Discourses,</i>vol. 1, comp. and ed. Brian H. Stuy (Burbank, California: B.H.S. Publishing, 1987), p. 235]<br><br>While we live in this sphere away from "home," our Father has equipped us with a remarkable capacity to experience the beauty of life, the joy of life, and the abundance of it. Alma tells us "awak[en] and arouse your faculties" (Alma 32:27). This requires some work and attention on our part. It is not always easy. We may look but not see with an eye of faith; we may listen but not hear the whisperings of the Spirit; we may touch but be "past feeling"; we may live, but without sensitivity--and thus our arsenal of memory is not filled with experiences that can be used to fight against doubt, fear, discouragement, or despair and even faltering faith.<br><br>Do we see and hear and feel the hand of God all around us daily? Korihor seemed to be suffering some form of amnesia when he said to Alma, "Show me a sign, that I may be convinced that there is a God." Then Alma pointed out that<br><br><i>all things denote there is a God; yea, even the earth, and all things that are upon the face of it, yea, and its motion, yea, and also all the planets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a Supreme Creator.</i><br><br>Korihor received the sign and was struck dumb. Then he put forth his hand and wrote, "I always knew that there was a God" (Alma 30:43, 44, 52). He remembered too late.<br><br>When we are so busily engaged and consumed that our minds are clogged, saturated, or preoccupied, and we are distracted in our thoughts with no time to ponder--we may see the evidence of God's hand but forget the Creator.<br><br>In the poem<i>Renascence</i>by Edna St. Vincent Millay (1912), we see the effects of one who looks without seeing, touches without feeling, listens without hearing. The poem begins:<br><br><i>All I could see from where I stood</i><br><i>Was three long mountains and a wood;</i><br><i>I turned and looked another way,</i><br><i>And saw three islands in a bay.</i><br>She surveys her surroundings and observes:<br><br><i>The sky, I thought, is not so grand;</i><br><i>I 'most could touch it with my hand!</i><br><br>With senses deadened, she finds herself in her grave away from all of God's beautiful creations. There she begins to<i>remember.</i>The majesty of it all begins to return, and she pleads for another chance:<br><br><i>O God, I cried, give me new birth,</i><br><i>And put me back upon the earth!</i><br><br>In time a heavy rain comes and washes her grave away. It is as if there were an instant recall. She sees things as they really are. She expresses her thoughts in prayer:<br><br><i>I know not how such things can be;</i><br><i>I only know there came to me</i><br><i>A fragrance such as never clings</i><br><i>To aught save happy living things;</i><br><i>A sound as of some joyous elf</i><br><i>Singing sweet songs to please himself,</i><br><i>And, through and over everything,</i><br><i>A sense of glad awakening.</i><br><br><i>The grass, a-tiptoe at my ear,</i><br><i>Whispering to me I could hear;</i><br><i>I felt the rain's cool finger-tips</i><br><i>Brushed tenderly across my lips,</i><br><i>Laid gently on my sealed sight,</i><br><i>And all at once the heavy night</i><br><i>Fell from my eyes and I could see!--</i><br><i>A drenched and dripping apple-tree,</i><br><i>A last long line of silver rain,</i><br><i>A sky grown clear and blue again.</i><br><br><i>And as I looked a quickening gust</i><br><i>Of wind blew up to me and thrust</i><br><i>Into my face a miracle</i><br><i>Of orchard-breath, and with the smell,--</i><br><i>I know not how such things can be!--</i><br><i>I breathed my soul back into me.</i><br><br><i>Ah! Up then from the ground sprang I</i><br><i>And hailed the earth with such a cry</i><br><i>As is not heard save from a man</i><br><i>Who has been dead, and lives again.</i><br><br><i>About the trees my arms I wound;</i><br><i>Like one gone mad I hugged the ground;</i><br><i>I raised my quivering arms on high;</i><br><i>I laughed and laughed into the sky;</i><br><i>Till at my throat a strangling sob</i><br><i>Caught fiercely, and a great heart-throb</i><br><i>Sent instant tears into my eyes:</i><br><br><i>O God, I cried, no dark disguise</i><br><i>Can e'er hereafter hide from me</i><br><i>Thy radiant identity!</i><br><i>Thou canst not move across the grass</i><br><i>But my quick eyes will see Thee pass,</i><br><i>Nor speak, however silently,</i><br><i>But my hushed voice will answer Thee.</i><br><br><i>I know the path that tells Thy way</i><br><i>Through the cool eve of every day;</i><br><i>God, I can push the grass apart</i><br><i>And lay my finger on Thy heart!</i><br><br><i>The world stands out on either side</i><br><i>No wider than the heart is wide;</i><br><i>Above the world is stretched the sky,--</i><br><i>No higher than the soul is high.</i><br><br><i>The heart can push the sea and land</i><br><i>Farther away on either hand;</i><br><i>The soul can split the sky in two,</i><br><i>And let the face of God shine through.</i><br><br><i>But East and West will pinch the heart</i><br><i>That can not keep them pushed apart;</i><br><i>And he whose soul is flat--the sky</i><br><i>Will cave in on him by and by.</i><br><br>It is possible to be dead spiritually while we are still alive physically.<br><br>Sin will dull the memories of rich spiritual experiences, but with faculties awakened and aroused, we can "experiment" upon the word and "feast upon this fruit" (see Alma 32:27, 42). In faith a woman reached out,<i>touched</i>the hem of the Savior's garment, and was healed. Do you think she remembered for all time and eternity that touch?<br><br>Lehi<i>tasted</i>the fruit of the tree of life and declared "that it was most sweet, above all that [he] ever before tasted" (1 Nephi 8:11). Have you tasted that fruit?<br><br>Samuel<i>heard</i>the voice of the Lord, and the Lord told Samuel: "Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of everyone that heareth it shall tingle" (1 Samuel 3:11). Do your ears "tingle" when you hear the voice of the Lord through our living prophets?<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith testified, "I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air" (JS--H 1:17). Do you see with an eye of faith what the prophet saw? The crucial words I use here are<i>see with an eye of faith.</i><br><br>When the Lord God "breathed into [man's] nostrils the breath of life; . . . man became a living soul" (Moses 3:7). Should we be surprised that Satan's strategy would include any and every means by which our senses may be dulled, deadened, and nonfunctioning so that what is<i>seen</i>at first as alarming in time becomes acceptable? And what is<i>heard</i>that at first is offensive and then becomes common place? The addicting habits destroy sensitivity.<br><br>Will we be weakened by such attacks or<i>will we remember</i>to draw near unto Him, knowing that He will draw near unto us? Will we remember to seek Him diligently, knowing that when we do we shall surely find Him? Of this we can be sure.<br><br>If there is any wavering in our trust in the Lord, closer examination may reveal that the lack of trust is not in the Lord but rather in ourselves. When we follow the direction of the great plan of happiness, we receive confirmation upon confirmation that Christ's mission was and is exactly what He claimed it to be. It is "to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). It is our<i>mortal memory</i>of these confirmations that allows you and me to say, "I believe in Christ." I believe, as surely as I am standing before you, that the Church is true, that Joseph Smith was and is a prophet of God, and that Jesus Christ is accomplishing the purpose of the divine plan through our modern-day prophet President Gordon B. Hinckley.<br><br>It was thirty years even prior to Christ's birth that Helaman counseled his sons, wanting them to be prepared for the challenges they would face.<br><br><i>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.</i>[Helaman 5:12]<br><br>Do you feel the love and concern with which this father spoke to his sons? I don't doubt many of you have heard a similar tone of love and concern in your mother's or your father's voice, maybe before you left home to come to school. Perhaps, if you listen, you can recall it even now.<br><br>At the close of Christ's mortal ministry, knowing what was ahead, Jesus was preparing the apostles for the challenges He knew would come. Now, as they were assembled in that upper room, He promised, "I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you." He then further explained:<br><br><i>But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.</i><br><br><i>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.</i>[John 14:18, 26]<br><br><i>Jesus took bread and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them. . . .</i><br><br><i>And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them; and they all drank of it.</i><br><br><i>And he said unto them, . . .</i><br><br><i>And as oft as ye do this ordinance, ye will remember me in this hour that I was with you and drank with you of this cup, even the last time in my ministry.</i>[JST, Mark 14:20–24]<br><br>Would you have been absent from that upper room if you had been invited to be there with the Savior on that occasion just prior to His crucifixion? Will we ever be absent from those occasions each week when we are invited, even as the apostles, to eat and drink and remember the Savior, the Son of God, and keep His commandments so we can have His spirit to be with us? Think of how we would feel if these sacred emblems were not available to us because there was no authorized authority to administer them or because of our lack of worthiness to partake of them. Would we be more ready, more reverent, more thoughtful and grateful when the opportunity was restored for us? How would you feel if you wanted with all your heart and soul to partake of those emblems and to witness anew that you were willing to take upon you the name of Christ; that you wanted to show that you would always remember Him and you would keep His commandments so that you might have His spirit to be with you always--but because of wrong choices in your life you were deprived from that blessing for a time?<br><br>I know someone in this situation. He tells me that each week he hears the words of that prayer with a clarity, a fervor, a commitment that he never felt before. But as the emblems of the bread and water are offered him, he must pass them on to others who often seem not to feel the full impact of what they are doing and his heart cries out,<i>Do you realize the blessing that is yours?</i><br><br>Maybe we too often underestimate the significance of baptism. That event turns the key and opens the door to eternal life and eternal happiness. With the gift of the Holy Ghost bestowed after our baptism, we are entitled to a special kind of direction and guidance that will create the sustaining memories I have been talking about.<br><br>Baptism does not guarantee happiness as we tend to define happiness; it does not guarantee that we will not suffer physically or emotionally; it does not assure that bills will be paid; or that all of our relationships with others will be easy. What baptism does guarantee is that we need never lack for clarity about a major decision. The covenant of baptism and the renewal of that covenant through the ordinance of the sacrament admits us to a very select environment in this mortal world. Whatever your loneliness and isolation, you can know that our Heavenly Father knows you personally and loves you and that His spirit can and will attend you.<br><br>I am deeply impressed by the last twenty years of Moroni's life. He was alone. All of his friends and family had been killed. He had to hide himself from his enemies. He was always on the move, trying to find his own shelter, trying to sustain himself physically, and all the while keeping secure the sacred records his father had entrusted to him. He was a mortal like you and me, but during all of those long years of trial and loneliness he was sustained by what we hear each week in the sacramental prayer: he always<i>remembered</i>Christ, he kept His commandments, and he had His spirit to be with him.<br><br>Finally, Moroni was able to express his remarkable testimony and warning. He was able to figuratively look each of us in the eye and say: "I exhort you to remember" (see Moroni 10:3).<br><br>My urgent plea to each of us today is to remember, lest we forget to believe! We may not remember all of the equations, the formulas, the histories, the prescriptions that become a part of our formal education--but let us remember and never forget: "God loved us, so he sent his Son, Christ Jesus, the atoning One" ("God Loved Us, So He Sent His Son,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 187).<br><br>To this I testify and pray that we may so live in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Ardeth G. Kapp was president of the Young Women of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 7 November 1995.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>t Have Been” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I deem it an honor to be in your presence this morning. I say this not only because of who you are, but because of who you may become. Some thirty-six years ago, a promising young man served as the student body president of this university. Today he stands tall as the president of BYU after distinguishing himself as a man of the law, a man of faith, and a man of courage. I speak of President Rex Lee, one who is an inspiration to all of us. As I look into your faces, I wonder how many future presidents of this choice institution of higher learning sit in the audience this morning.<br><br>In a meeting of the seventies held on November 17, 1844, President Joseph Young told a congregation that he would preach to them at some convenient time provided they would<i>draw it out of him</i>by the prayer of faith (see General Record of the Seventies; Book B, 1844–1847, Sunday Evening, November 17, 1844; emphasis added). President Young had in mind some important truths that he felt should be shared; however, he knew that the Holy Spirit had to be present if the preacher and listeners were to understand each other, be edified, and rejoice together (see D&amp;amp;C 50:13, 14, 22, 23). Though I have a prepared text, I invite you to exercise your faith and prayers in my behalf so that something meaningful will be "drawn" out of me and communicated to you during the next few minutes.<br><br>Several years ago I presided over a mission in Texas. During those precious years I was privileged to serve with more than 500 missionaries (515, to be exact), most of whom were young men and women of college age. As each missionary completed his or her mission, I would hold an exit interview and ask questions such as:<br><br>• What have you learned these past two years?<br><br>• Do you have plans for the future? What are they?<br><br>• What do you hope to become?<br><br>• How will you retain your "missionary character?"<br><br>Most of the missionaries acknowledged the virtues of a full-time mission. The majority indicated that they had plans to attend BYU or Ricks College. Almost all returned home with desires for temple marriage, a family, some honorable vocation or profession, and visions of health, wealth, and happiness. But a few interviews made me wonder whether I had succeeded as a mission leader.<br><br>A conversation with one elder included this exchange:<br><br>"Do you plan to return to BYU?"<br><br>"Yes, I want to become a physician."<br><br>"Why do you want to become a physician?"<br><br>"So that I can make a lot of money, live on the right side of the tracks, and retire early."<br><br>I was disappointed by this selfish and materialistic response. I wondered where the missionary&#39;s mind and heart had been during his term of service. As my wife&#39;s grandfather would say, the young man was like the guy who fell out of the tree. He just wasn&#39;t in it (nor had he<i>been</i>in it).<br><br>Over the years I have tried very hard to track our missionary associates, without intruding upon the prerogatives of local Church officers. I know where most of them live. I know what most of them are doing. I know about their families, their approach to religion, and what they&#39;re doing in the world of work. I know how some pursued and realized professed goals. I know why some forsook dreams and acquiesced to lesser challenges. And I know of a few who helped me understand the<i>pathos</i>(suffering) in these lines: "For of all sad words of tongue or pen, The saddest are these:<i>&#39;It might have been!&#39;"</i>(John Greenleaf Whittier,<i>Maude Muller</i>[1856], st. 53; emphasis added).<br><br>I do not have the power to turn the clock back and improve upon the counsel I gave the missionaries a generation ago, "For the arrow is flown and the moments are gone" ("Come, Let Us Anew,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 217). I do, however, have this and other opportunities to advise members of the rising generation, including the sons and daughters of those who served with me in Texas. I believe that God will hold me accountable if I fail to help young men and women recognize their potential and capitalize upon the once-in-a-lifetime privileges extended them not only while serving missions but also while attending school.<br><br>It is said that advice is the one thing that is more "blessed to give than to receive" (Acts 20:35). This fact is illustrated in John Erskine&#39;s story about Dr. George Harris, who was serving as president of Amherst College.<br><br><i>One autumn he</i>[addressed]<i>the students at the first assembly of the year, but after a sentence or two he got tired and broke into a happy smile--"I intended to give you some advice, but now I remember how much is left over from last year unused." With that he took his hat and walked out.</i>[John Erskine,<i>The Memory of Certain Persons</i>(Philadelphia, New York: J. B. Lippincott Company, 1947), p. 142]<br><br>Perhaps you, too, have a little unused advice left over from last year--advice received from President Lee and others. It would be presumptive of me to walk out as Dr. Harris did--and since I have no hat, I shall plow ahead trusting that my counsel will prove beneficial to some.<br><br>"The [stated] mission of Brigham Young University . . . is to assist individuals in their<i>quest</i>for perfection and eternal life" (from the pamphlet entitled<i>The Mission of Brigham Young University and The Aims of a BYU Education</i>[Provo: BYU, 1995], p. 1; emphasis added). I emphasize<i>quest</i>because it implies an exciting search for truth and a journey involving high adventure. It also suggests purposeful living and progress toward a worthy destination.<br><br>Some of you will pursue your goals with an eye to the sciences. Some will show interest in fields of communication. Others may move forward with a flair for the humanities, and so forth. It is hoped, however, that all of you, regardless of discipline interests, will conduct your search in a manner that will enable you to recognize and embrace "things as they really are, and . . . things as they really will be" (Jacob 4:13). Such will be the case, I believe, if you heed the following counsel: (1) "Seek [God] daily;" (2) "Seek learning, even by study and also by faith;" (3) "Seek earnestly the best gifts;" (4) "Seek not the things of this world but seek first to build up the kingdom of God;" and (5) Seek "the interest of [associates], and [do] all things with an eye single to the glory of God."<br><br>I shall address these five "seeks" in more detail.<br><br><i>1. "Seek [God] daily, and delight to know [his] ways,</i>. . .<i>and [forsake] not [his] ordinance[s]" (Isaiah 58:2).</i>These words of the prophet Isaiah remind us that our spiritual batteries must be recharged each day through prayer, meditation, scripture reading, and righteous living. Like Israel, we must gather our spiritual manna daily and allow it to nourish our souls. If personal worship ever becomes burdensome and your soul loathes the "light bread" of prayer, scriptures, or church, look out! (See Numbers 21:5–9.) A kind Heavenly Father may not send fiery flying serpents to correct your behavior, but he may withdraw his spirit and leave you to go it alone.<br><br>It is possible that some returned missionaries resume their studies at BYU thinking that they have placed God in their debt and that he owes them something in return for their two years of service. Hence, they take sabbatical leave from God and religious practices while in pursuit of educational goals. Such students, if they don&#39;t repent, will have a "whale" of a time similar to Jonah&#39;s. They, too, if there isn&#39;t a course correction, will painfully reach the point when their souls will faint within them as did Jonah&#39;s, and they will cry:<br><br><i>I remembered the Lord: and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple. . . .</i><br><br><i>But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the Lord.</i>[Jonah 2:7, 9]<br><br>There is a dangerous error circulating among some Latter-day Saints, taking its toll among the young. It is that a "balanced man" or woman is one who deliberately guards against becoming too righteous. This misconception would have you believe that it is possible to live successfully and happily as a "double minded [person]" (see James 1:8).<br><br>I love the story of two young men who had been schooled in a monastery. One morning as they sought adventure, they passed a cathedral. The more righteous of the two remembered that they had not prayed that morning and said, "How can [we] hope for [God&#39;s] blessing upon the day?"<br><br>The less righteous one responded: "My friend, I have prayed so much during the last [few] months . . . that I feel that I have somewhat over-prayed myself."<br><br>"How can a man have too much religion?" asked the first.<br><br><i>It is the one thing that availeth. A man is but a beast as he lives from day to day, eating and drinking, breathing and sleeping. It is only when he raises himself, and concerns himself with the immortal spirit within him, that he becomes in very truth a man. Bethink ye how sad a thing it would be that the blood of the Redeemer should be spilled to no purpose.</i>[A. Conan Doyle,<i>The White Company</i>(New York: Dodd, Mead, 1962), pp. 58–59]<br><br>In a recent issue of the<i>Daily Universe,</i>a staff writer reported a trend of "religious perfectionism." Religious perfectionism was defined as "placing unrealistic expectations on oneself as a result of literal and rigid interpretations of directives given by scriptures and church leaders" (Amy Mueller, "Grad Student Offers Religious Perfectionists Help,"<i>Daily Universe,</i>vol. 49, issue 48, November 1995, p. 1). I suppose that there are a few super-conscientious, impatient, young people who establish high expectations for themselves and suffer excessive guilt when they fall short of the mark. These fine people need to be reminded that perfection will not be obtained overnight or in one fell swoop. It is a gradual process of becoming finished and complete in Christian living.<br><br>At the same time, however, it is important that in the search for "balance" one does not abandon standards, compromise principles, or rationalize mediocre religious performance. We who call ourselves Christians never cease essaying to be saints (see D&amp;amp;C 125:2). We do our best day by day and trust in the Lord.<br><br>You must yield to the enticings of the Holy Spirit and seek to acquire Christlike virtues as you conduct your studies. You must allow the Spirit to call the cadence of your life in and out of the classroom. "Remember, to be carnally-minded is death, and to be spiritually-minded is life eternal" (2 Nephi 9:39).<br><br>Someone has said: "If your aim in life is merely to satisfy your appetites you might as well go graze with the cattle" (photo and text, David Bly, "The Mind&#39;s Eye,"<i>Deseret News,</i>Sunday, November 5, 1995, p. V3). You are not cattle, and your appetites go well beyond the gratification of physical appetites. So, trust in God and seek him daily, remembering that "where one succeeds because of his smartness, ten succeed because of their faithfulness" (author unknown).<br><br>No one is more lonely, even on a crowded campus, than the person who turns his back to deity and attempts to go it alone. He is often the one who cries "It might have been." Contrariwise, no one feels more supported than he who courts the Spirit and walks with God.<br><br><i>2. "Seek learning, even by study and also by faith"</i>(<i>D&amp;amp;C 88:118).</i>I resonate with what President Rex Lee has said about the "bilingual nature" of BYU, indicating that it is dedicated to excellence in both mind and spirit. While on this campus, every student is expected to learn the language of the mind--a language that centers in honest inquiry. At the same time, each must learn to distinguish the voice of the Spirit--that still small voice--as they pursue their studies. It must never be forgotten that it was the Holy Ghost or spirit of revelation "by which Moses brought the children of Israel through the Red Sea on dry ground" (D&amp;amp;C 8:2–3). You, too, may struggle through the maze of facts and figures in your several courses of study and even walk out of dry classes unharmed if you seek learning, even by study and also by faith.<br><br>I know of one or two returned missionaries who sought learning by study and forgot all about faith. Somewhere in their quest for knowledge they turned up the volume of the voice of the mind and drowned out the voice of the Spirit. They turned a deaf ear to this old but ageless warning:<br><br><i>O that cunning plan of the evil one! O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish.</i><br><br>But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God. [2 Nephi 9:28–29; emphasis added]<br><br>I also know of some returned missionaries who sought learning by faith alone, hoping that the Spirit would do the needed library research while the body was playing elsewhere. Just as faith without works is dead, so is faith without study somewhat lifeless. Don&#39;t forget, the scripture reads, "Seek learning,<i>even by study</i>and also by faith."<br><br>The dust jacket of a publication of the writings of Dr. Hugh Nibley, a man who is universally known and admired by Church leaders and scholars, contains this interesting statement:<br><br><i>As a young man he memorized vast portions of Shakespeare and studied Old English, Latin, Greek, and other languages. As a student at Berkeley, he began reading at the southwest corner of the ninth level of the library and worked his way down to the northeast corner of the first level, studying every significant book that caught his eye.</i>[<i>Old Testament and Related Studies</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1986), dust jacket, inside front cover; also see<i>Ensign,</i>May 1986, p. 48]<br><br>According to my sources, the shelf distance from the southwest corner of the ninth level of the old Berkeley Library down the eight floors to the northeast corner of the first level covers a distance of approximately two hundred thousand linear feet--the length of six and one-half football fields.<br><br>In reference to this report of Dr. Nibley&#39;s unquenchable thirst for knowledge, President Hinckley commented:<br><br><i>His encyclopedic knowledge has given him tremendous and well-deserved status among his academic peers. It also has made him a powerful advocate of the work of the Lord. His appetite for learning has been whetted by the gospel he loves.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley, "Come and Partake,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1986, p. 48]<br><br>Oh, how fortunate you are to sit at the feet of knowledgeable professors who share with you information about great men and great ideas of the past and of the present within the context of faith. Unlike scholars in other places, each teacher in this institution has a mandate to "keep his subject matter bathed in the light and color of the restored gospel" (Spencer W. Kimball, "Education for Eternity," Preschool Address to BYU Faculty and Staff, 12 September 1967, p. 11).<br><br>I am convinced that when a teacher keeps his subject matter bathed in the light and color of the restored gospel, the student&#39;s appetite for learning is whetted, just as Dr. Nibley&#39;s appetite for learning was whetted by the gospel he loves. How could it be otherwise when "the glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36). But how unfortunate it is when a student suffers blindness of mind and hardness of heart and fails to see the light or distinguish the color of the gospel in subjects studied. No one, whether he be teacher or student, ever progresses significantly by looking for shadows rather than for light. Time is precious and must not be squandered looking into the gutter when the upward view is filled with the beauties and wonders of the universe--the beauties and wonders of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>So, as someone else has counseled, I would urge you students not to let a day pass without contact with the best literature of the world. Worm yourselves into the minds of the great thinkers, walk in the footsteps of the intellectual giants who have gone before, and mark well the behavior of those who have invented, discovered, and mined the streams of knowledge. However, "as the soul is dyed by the thoughts, let no day pass without contact with [the scriptures]. In forming character and in shaping conduct, [they still have their] ancient power" (William Osler,<i>A Way of Life</i>[New York: Paul B. Hoeber, Medical Book Department of Harper &amp;amp; Brothers, 1937], pp. 37–38).<br><br>Very few complete their formal educations and lament "it might have been" when they have sought words of wisdom out of the best books and learning by study and also by faith. You must remember that faith brings a spirit to your study--a spirit that serves as a tutor and abets learning. We call that spirit the Holy Ghost, he who teaches all things and brings them to your remembrance (see John 14:26).<br><br><i>3. "Seek ye earnestly the best gifts, always remembering for what they are given."</i>The scripture continues, "For . . . they are given for the benefit of those who love me and keep all my commandments, and him that seeketh so to do" (D&amp;amp;C 46:8–9).<br><br>There is wisdom in the story that Dr. Robert K. Thomas, the former academic vice president of Brigham Young University, tells about his struggle to find his place in life. Early on, he decided that he would become a professional boxer. He was large in stature and seemed to possess all the qualities needed to become a world champion. Fortunately, however, he heard the "wake-up" bell through a retired pugilist who taught him a painful but impressive lesson. After suffering a humiliating beating at the hands of the old fighter, Robert returned home defeated in both body and spirit and complained to his mother about his lack of talent. His wise and loving mother comforted him by saying, "Oh, Bobby, what you<i>have</i>is enough!" ("Things They&#39;re Saying,"<i>New Era,</i>October 1972, p. 42).<br><br>What a pity it would have been if Robert Thomas had not been forced to forsake his boxing dream! It was through defeat that he gained victory because he wouldn&#39;t give up. One door was closed abruptly in his face, but he sought another door for the release of his special talents. In time, he was moved in the direction of writing, teaching, and other academic pursuits where greater gifts were discovered and used to bless the lives of thousands.<br><br>The same can be said about you. Whatever you have is enough, providing you buckle down and use to full advantage that which God has given you. When the wind of adversity strikes your ship, tighten your sails and attend your course, as Bob Thomas did. Your reward will be the discovery of true direction in your life.<br><br>Once in a while we meet a young person who becomes discouraged and complains that he was absent when the gifts were distributed at that great distribution center in the sky. Such a complaint is contradicted by the word of the Lord. We read statements such as these: "And all these gifts come by the Spirit of Christ; and they come unto<i>every man severally,</i>according as he will" (Moroni 10:17; emphasis added); "For there are many gifts, and<i>to every man is given</i>a gift by the Spirit of God" (D&amp;amp;C 46:11; emphasis added); "But the manifestation of the Spirit is<i>given to every man</i>to profit withal" (1 Corinthians 12:7; emphasis added).<br><br>President Boyd K. Packer said:<br><br><i>Go to, then, you who are gifted; cultivate your gift. . . . If you have the ability and the desire, seek a career or employ your talent as an avocation or cultivate it as a hobby. But in all ways bless others with it. Set a standard of excellence. Employ it in the secular sense to every worthy advantage, but never use it profanely. Never express your gift unworthily.</i>["The Arts and the Spirit of the Lord ,"<i>Ensign,</i>August 1976, p. 65]<br><br>Here at this school undergraduates are educated in broad areas of human knowledge. This provides you with many golden opportunities to investigate interests, find flairs, and generate gifts that will lead you in proper directions. It is hoped you will chase the star that is exciting and challenging rather than one easily reached. And I would pray that you may find a professor who takes more than a passing interest in you and helps you to recognize the impossible dreams that lie dormant within you.<br><br>I contend that "precious time and energy" can be wasted if, in the probing for gifts, a person is not perfectly honest with himself. I have heard it said: "You can&#39;t lead a cavalry charge if you think you look funny on a horse. If you<i>do</i>think you look funny on a horse, then postpone the charge." I would add, sell the darn horse, forget the charge, and seek to lead out in some other way.<br><br>I fear that many--too many--men and women look back upon their educational careers with feelings of "it might have been" all because they failed to seek earnestly and cultivate adequately God-given spiritual endowments. Don&#39;t let it happen to you.<br><br><i>4. "Seek not the things of this world but seek ye first to build up the kingdom of God, and to establish his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you"</i>(<i>JST, Matthew 6:38</i>). Notice the priority and promise in this inspired statement. You are told that the kingdom of God comes first; things of the world should be secondary. So if you keep your priorities straight and follow this admonition of the Lord, there is the promise that other things shall be given to you.<br><br>Further light is shed upon this subject by Jacob, the son of Lehi. Said he:<br><br><i>But before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God.</i><br><br><i>And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to do good--to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted.</i>[Jacob 2:18–19; see also verse 17]<br><br>Once again the priority is established--the kingdom of God first, other things afterwards. Note also that two conditions are placed upon the quest for riches. They are: (1) "if ye seek them," and (2) if "ye will seek them for the intent to do good."<br><br>We live in a very materialistic world. The love of money and the trinkets it can buy seem to occupy the thoughts and efforts of many. Too many chase the "almighty dollar" at the expense of all the better things that money cannot buy.<br><br>Recently I interviewed a priesthood leader whose tithing in the past year was a six-figure amount. He owned many businesses, and everything he touched seemed to turn a profit. Nevertheless, he was one of the saddest men I have ever met. At the conclusion of our conversation, he wept and said, "I would give up all that I possess for a little love and harmony at home." I returned home feeling that I was indeed a very rich man.<br><br>Alma taught his wayward son, "Seek not after riches nor the vain things of this world; for behold, you cannot carry them with you" (Alma 39:14). One misguided soul who had amassed a fortune and was dying declared, "If I can&#39;t take it with me, I&#39;ll come back for it." To him and to others like him, I say: Try it!<br><br>Most of us know of a young man who was given some precious records and cautioned that Satan would tempt him with the thought of getting rich. He was told by a heavenly messenger that he "must have no other object in view in getting the plates but to glorify God, and must not be influenced by any other motive than that of building [the] kingdom [of God]" (JS--H 1:46). If purity of motive was essential to the success of Joseph Smith, surely it is essential to your future success and happiness.<br><br>Unfortunately, the words<i>it might have been</i>fall from the lips of those who scramble for riches and push aside God. Many never learn the principle of serendipity nor the promise that "the upright shall have good things in possession" (Proverbs 28:10).<br><br>The scramble for riches without principle or feeling leads always to the dream of the night vision wherein the hungry man dreameth, "and behold he eateth but he awaketh and his soul is empty" (2 Nephi 27:3).<br><br><i>5. "Every man [and woman] seeking the interest of his [or her] neighbor, and doing all things with an eye single to the glory of God" (D&amp;amp;C 82:19).</i>There is a companion scripture that reads, "And let us not be weary in well doing. . . . As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith" (Galatians 6:9–10).<br><br>The printed aims of BYU include reference to a service ethic. Among other things, it states:<br><br><i>Hence, BYU should nurture in its students the desire to use their knowledge and skills not only to enrich their own lives but also to bless their families, their communities, the Church, and the larger society. Students should learn, then demonstrate, that their ultimate allegiance is to higher values, principles, and human commitments rather than to mere self-interest.</i>[<i>The Mission of BYU,</i>p. 13]<br><br>I have no idea who penned these lines, but they are inspired. The cultivation of "mere self-interest" is a contradiction to this university as is the teaching of false doctrine. The opposite elements of truth and selfless service are at its very heart.<br><br>Joseph Smith, the prophet of the Restoration, likened the quest for truth to climbing a ladder. Said he:<br><br><i>When you climb up a ladder, you must begin at the bottom, and ascend step by step, until you arrive at the top; and so it is with the principles of the Gospel--you must begin with the first, and go on until you learn all the principles of exaltation.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 348]<br><br>Each rung on the educational ladder is some portion of knowledge acquired through serious study. Each ladder has two rails that the learner must grasp to steady his climb out of the pit of ignorance. One rail is the "iron rod" or word of God. Those who cling to this steadying influence ascend the ladder with an eye upward. The other rail is the community of Saints among whom you live and serve. So long as your hand is in the hands of others, including classmates and caring teachers, your chances of falling are diminished.<br><br>I hope you realize the merits of living in a university community that is organized into wards and stakes. This Church organization extends to all of you the two railings so essential to your progress. You must, therefore, cling to the Church, cling to the scriptures, and serve with your peers so that you will not be tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine or theory that would block your climb toward worthy educational goals.<br><br>You should regard the Church organization as a kind of laboratory--a place where classroom teachings may be applied. Experiences within that laboratory will help you share teachings and render services that will clinch your learning. Moreover, such experiences will smooth the transition from school to society upon graduation.<br><br>Recently, President Gordon B. Hinckley counseled some college students to love the Lord, cling to the Church, and live the gospel. He emphasized:<br><br><i>Do not ever lose sight of the fact that the Church must ever remain preeminent in your lives if you are going to be happy as the years pass. . . .</i><br><br><i>Never let yourselves be found in the position of fighting The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. You cling to it and be faithful to it. You uphold and sustain it. You teach its doctrine and live by it. And I do not hesitate to say that your lives will be the richer and the happier because of that. You cannot find happiness fighting the work of God.</i>["Prophet Admonishes,"<i>Church News,</i>4 November 1995, p. 4]<br><br>Most everyone is familiar with the BYU motto: "Enter to learn; go forth to serve."<br><br>I appreciate the pure intent of these words, but if I had my way, they would read: "Enter to learn and serve; go forth to serve and learn more." Have we really learned something unless we have shared it and applied it?<br><br>Earlier I made reference to a young man whose avowed goal was to return to BYU, become a physician, make a lot of money, and retire. I also stated that I know a few returned missionaries who had forsaken dreams and whose disappointments had helped me understand the meaning of these soul-wrenching words: "For of all sad words of tongue or pen, The saddest are these: 'It might have been!'"<br><br>I realize that those who fail and disappoint are relatively few at this university. Studies have shown that the majority of the BYU graduates become faithful Latter-day Saints and leaders in the communities in which they choose to live. Notwithstanding all of this, there are the few who look back upon their educational careers with regret, and a few are too many, especially when that few includes people we know personally.<br><br>I do, therefore, with all the energy of my soul counsel you<br><br>•<i>Seek God daily:</i>Don't walk or study alone when divine companionship is available--or when divine tutorial assistance is available.<br><br>•<i>Seek learning, even by study and also by faith:</i>Don't feed the mind and starve the spirit. Look at all subject matter through gospel lenses.<br><br>•<i>Seek earnestly the best gifts:</i>Don't neglect the gifts that are in you nor allow anyone to despise your youthful ambitions (see 1 Timothy 4:12–16).<br><br>•<i>Seek not the things of this world but seek first to build up the kingdom of God:</i>Don't allow the chase of the "almighty dollar" to lead you away from Almighty God.<br><br>•<i>Seek the interest of your classmates or neighbors and keep your eye single to the glory of God:</i>As I have said, enter to learn and to serve; go forth to serve and learn even more.<br><br>These five bits of advice are simple, obvious, and very important. Do not take them for granted--for, if heeded, they will push aside all of the heartache in the lament "It might have been" and replace it with the jubilant shout "We did it! and we are so very blessed!"<br><br>The prophet Alma taught that men are called as high priests because of their exceeding faith and good works, and according to the foreknowledge of God. He also made mention of others who have not been called to this holy calling because they "reject the Spirit of God on account of the hardness of their hearts and blindness of their minds, while, if it had not been for this<i>they might have had as great privilege</i>as their brethren" (Alma 13:4; emphasis added). I emphasize the words<i>they might have had--</i>or,<i>it might have been.</i>So it is with the privileges of a higher education. Exercise faith; engage in good study and works; court the Holy Spirit; and become all that you want to become and more.<br><br>Upon my release as a mission president twenty-two years ago, I returned to BYU and resumed teaching responsibilities. A well-meaning associate counseled me against becoming too "preachy" in my classroom. He reminded me that I had been eating, drinking, and breathing religion for three years and that, if I were not careful, I would become overbearing to my students. I did, therefore, exercise extreme caution in mingling subject and spirit.<br><br>At the close of that first year back on the job, I received one negative comment on the student evaluation papers. It related to my reluctance to openly share my faith with those I taught. I was sorely offended by that criticism and the one who caused it to happen. And I have carried that burden of neglect with me ever since.<br><br>It might have been different, and it should have been different, for I knew then as I know now that God lives, Jesus is the Christ, our Redeemer, and our Savior, and Joseph Smith was the prophet of the Restoration.<br><br>I also know now as I knew then that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the true and living church referred to in the scriptures. It is led by the one after whom it is named through a prophet--even Gordon B. Hinckley. Of this I testify--erasing the guilt of "it might have been" related to years ago when I hesitated to share that which is more precious to me than life itself. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Carlos E.

<h1>s with Contentment - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I pray that the Holy Ghost will help us receive what we need this morning--that both<i>your</i>prayers and<i>mine</i>will be answered. I want to begin by sharing a little story I first read many years ago:<br><br><i>Two little children were put early to bed on a winter's night, for the fire had gone out, and the cold was pouring in at the many cracks of their frail shanty.</i><br><br><i>The mother strove to eke out the scantiness of the bed-covering by placing clean boards over the children. A pair of bright eyes shone out from under a board, and just before it was hushed in slumber, a sweet voice said, "Mother, how nice this is! How I pity the poor people who don't have any boards to cover their children with this cold night."</i><br><br>I suppose one reason this story struck me so deeply is because I want to be more like that: content, aware of my blessings. I can hear myself complaining: "Mom! Charlotte's board is bigger than mine!" Or "Hey! I'm going to get slivers!" This little girl was able to look at everything from the perspective of what she<i>had--not</i>what she<i>didn't have.</i>And she was concerned about those who didn't have as much as she did rather than upset and crabby because some had so much more than she did. She probably knew that some people had electric blankets or buffalo robes or quilts or heated bricks to keep them warm--but still she was content with what she had.<br><br>Why is it so hard for me to be that way? Is it ever hard for you? I spend too much time thinking and worrying about what I<i>don't</i>have instead of being grateful and content with what I<i>do</i>have.<br><br>I remember seeing an organizational chart once that had someone listed as a "content specialist." I know it meant<i>"con</i>tent<i>,"</i>but wouldn't it be great if some of us could volunteer to serve as<i>"</i>con<i>tent</i>specialists"? We could organize a "Content Club," and the little girl with clean boards could be our club president (or "chairman of the<i>board</i>")!<br><br>In the New Testament there is a letter from the apostle Paul to his beloved young disciple Timothy about contentment. I encourage you to read all of 1 Timothy, chapter 6, because I don't have time to do that this morning. Here are just a few verses:<br><br><i>But godliness with contentment is great gain.</i><br><br><i>For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.</i><br><br><i>And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.</i>[1 Timothy 6:6–8]<br><br>The phrase in verse 6 is the title of my message today: Godliness with Contentment. One definition of contentment I especially like is "tranquil happiness." I want to explore some of the ways in which godliness and contentment go together.<br><br>As Moroni was finishing the Book of Mormon, he extended a powerful invitation in our quest for godliness: "Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness" (Moroni 10:32). I'm sure you do the same thing I do--you examine yourself. Perhaps you, like I, find that some aspects of your life and your soul are not yet as godly as you would like. Are there some things in your life, as there are in mine, that don't seem to bring increased contentment, peace, enjoyment, and happiness?<br><br>President David O. McKay often quoted William George Jordan:<br><br><i>Happiness consists not of having, but of being; not of possessing, but of enjoying. It is the warm glow of a heart at peace with itself.</i>["The Royal Road to Happiness,"<i>The Majesty of Calmness</i>(Old Tappan, New Jersey: Fleming H. Revell Company, 1900), p. 54; see David O. McKay,<i>CR,</i>October 1955, p. 8]<br><br>Happiness is a state of being contented or satisfied. But sometimes it's hard to be content and satisfied--to have enough. There will always be a newer watch, a more powerful computer, a fancier car or closet organizer. But you can never get enough of what you don't need, because what you don't need never satisfies. We spend money we don't have to buy things we don't need to impress people we don't like who don't come over and get impressed anyway.<br><br>President McKay further said that<br><br><i>to seek happiness or even contentment in the acquisition of ... worldly things alone is to lose sight of the higher purpose of life. And that is one reason why there is discouragement and why there is despair generally in the world.</i>[<i>CR,</i>October 1934, p. 93]<br><br>Before we set our hearts too much on anything, maybe we ought to carefully observe how happy those people are who seem to have everything. We may neglect to thank our Heavenly Father for five pennies if we're constantly complaining because we don't have ten--and they<i>all</i>belong to him anyway!<br><br>William S. Ogden said that "happiness cannot be bought; indeed, money has very little to do with it." Much of our happiness might be overlooked because<i>it doesn't cost anything.</i>What if all of a sudden we found out that sunrises and sunsets had been made pay-per-view? I saw a bumper sticker that said, "Good news: Sunsets are free." Someone has said that it's good to have money and the things that money can buy--but it's good, too, to check up once in a while and make sure we haven't lost the things that money<i>can't</i>buy.<br><br>I think of how many times I've heard both my parents, who grew up in humble circumstances, say, "We didn't know we were poor." My father speaks of the Christmas when they had an orange to share among the brothers and sisters and how happy they were. Now my dad is ninety-three and doesn't hear or walk as well as he used to, and my mother has had a couple of strokes that have affected her speech and slowed her down a little. And they are two of the most content and happy people I know. They frequently say, "We have all we need." I want to follow their example!<br><br>I like something George Albert Smith said about what he learned as a little boy:<br><br><i>I was impressed with the idea that our Heavenly Father loves us and that his commandments were not intended to deprive us of true pleasure,</i>[but rather,]<i>if observed, would add to our peace and contentment here and prepare us for eternal happiness.</i>[<i>Sharing the Gospel with Others</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1948), p. 50]<br><br>Contentment comes from<i>within</i>much more than it comes from without.<br><br>When I first saw the movie<i>The Miracle Worker</i>many years ago, I became so interested in the life of Helen Keller. If ever anyone had reason to complain, I thought, it was Helen. For all but a few months of her life she had no sight and no hearing. And yet as I've studied her life I've found that she was one of the happiest, busiest, most influential women who ever lived.<br><br>And here are just three of the many things she shared that have helped me understand contentment and gratitude better:<br><br><i>Your success and happiness lie in you. External conditions are the accidents of life, its outer trappings.</i>[<i>The Faith of Helen Keller,</i>ed. Jack Belck (Kansas City, Missouri: Hallmark Editions, 1967), p. 25]<br><br><i>Keep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see the shadow.</i>[p. 42]<br><br><i>When one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us.</i>[p. 24]<br><br>I have come to feel that no material success and no amount of possessions or pleasures can make us happy and peaceful if we're not happy and peaceful inside.<br><br>Brigham Young said:<br><br><i>Thrust a man into prison and bind him with chains, and then let him be filled with the comfort and with the glory of eternity, and that prison is a palace to him. Again, let a man be seated upon a throne with power and dominion in this world, ruling his millions and millions, and without that peace which flows from the Lord of Hosts--without that contentment and joy that comes from heaven, his palace is a prison.</i>[<i>JD</i>5:1–2]<br><br>George Albert Smith said:<br><br><i>Now I do not care how much wealth you pour into the laps of men, unless there is in their bosoms the Spirit of God they are unhappy. ... It is so with all of us; unless we have the spirit of contentment in our hearts we are miserable. ... If a man has all the wealth in creation, and has heaped upon him all the honours and powers that the world can give, his soul is discontented and miserable, unless he possesses the Spirit of Christ.</i>[<i>JD</i>9:349]<br><br>Wanting less is probably a better blessing than having more. It's a change in the desires of our heart, and we can thereby be content sooner and more often. Listen to the apostle Paul's comments from the book of Philippians:<br><br><i>For I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.</i><br><br><i>I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.</i>[Philippians 4:11–12]<br><br>Paul speaks of being both full and hungry and yet seems to have found a way to be content no matter what state he is in because of his closeness to Jesus and the joy he found in doing the Savior's work.<br><br>While serving as a missionary, I thought many times of Alma's yearning and have desired the same thing he did:<br><br><i>O that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart, that I might go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake the earth, and cry repentance unto every people!</i><br><br><i>Yea, I would declare unto every soul, as with the voice of thunder, repentance and the plan of redemption, that they should repent and come unto our God, that there might not be more sorrow upon all the face of the earth.</i><br><br>And then I remembered what he learned and how he expressed it:<br><br><i>But behold, I am a man, and do sin in my wish; for I ought to be content with the things which the Lord hath allotted unto me....</i><br><br><i>... Why should I desire more than to perform the work to which I have been called?</i>[Alma 29:1–3,6]<br><br>What has God asked of you at this point in your life? Are you finding joy and contentment in being a child of God, a home teacher, a friend, an aunt, a brother, a neighbor, a member of Relief Society, a Good Samaritan? I'm convinced that our Heavenly Father will never ask us to do anything that doesn't matter. Each calling, each chance to serve, is part of the whole effort of building his kingdom and helping his children return home.<br><br>In 1 Corinthians, chapter 12, we are taught a great lesson about the importance of each of us doing our part well, no matter what that part might be. You're familiar with this. Paul teaches:<br><br><i>For the body is not one member, but many.</i><br><br><i>If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</i><br><br><i>And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</i><br><br><i>If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling? ...</i><br><br><i>And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</i>[1 Corinthians 12:14–17, 21]<br><br>Eyes need hands, and heads need feet. We all need each other very, very much. So if you're a hand, be a<i>good</i>hand, reaching out to others! If you're an eye, be an eye single to God's glory--to doing what's right! Be an ear willing to hear and feel the whisperings of God's Holy Spirit! Be a fantastic foot. Be a wise head. Be a happy heart!<br><br>One day while on a mission in Scotland, David O. McKay was walking around Stirling Castle with his companion, Peter G. Johnson. He said it was at the beginning of his mission, and on that day he had been snubbed while tracting. He was discouraged and homesick. He noticed a building that was half-finished. There was an inscription above the front door, carved in stone, that became a motto for his life: "What E'er Thou Art, Act Well Thy Part" (see<i>CR,</i>October 1954, p. 83).<br><br>And so let us find godliness and contentment in what we have and who and where we are at this time in our eternity. Let us add our part the best we can. Some say it this way: Bloom where you are planted. Don't be complacent as a noxious weed or poison oak--and don't be discontent because you're not the biggest rose in the valley. Bloom! Be pretty!<br><br>From Aesop comes this truth: "Be content with your lot--one cannot be first in everything." Not everyone can be the star of the play, the captain of the ship, the soloist with the symphony, the president of the company, the quarterback (and not everyone wants to be)--and without the cast, the crew, the orchestra, the staff, the team, not much would happen. It's a great feeling when we can find both a thrill and a sense of contentment when others are successful.<br><br>There is a verse from the Lord's Prayer that has taught me a good lesson about being content with what I have: "Give us this day our daily bread" (Matthew 6:11). Enough for today. And Psalm 23 also invites me to experience contentment:<br><br><i>The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.</i><br><i>He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.</i><br><i>He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.</i><br><i>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.</i><br><i>Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.</i><br><i>Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.</i><br><br>How thankful I am that Jesus<i>is</i>our Good Shepherd.<br><br>I've always been moved and instructed by the stories of the pioneers, who had very few possessions and yet had such comments<br><br>as these:<br><br><i>Our health and our lives were preserved--we outlived the trying scenes--we felt contented and happy--the songs of Zion resounded from wagon to wagon--from tent to tent; the sound reverberated through the woods, and its echo was returned from the distant hills; peace, harmony, and contentment reigned in the habitations of the saints....</i><br><br><i>It is true that in our sojourning we do not possess all the luxuries and delicacies of ... established countries and cities, but we have an abundance of the staple commodities. ... We feel contented and happy in the wilderness.</i>[B. H. Roberts,<i>A Comprehensive History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,</i>vol. 3 (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1930), p. 49]<br><br>Elder Adam S. Bennion remarked that:<br><br><i>As you read the history of the pioneers, it becomes increasingly clear with every page that you read, that they endured</i>adversity<i>and</i>hardship.<i>They could stand persecution; they could bear up under abuse; they could recover from the infliction of all kinds of harmful hatreds. That record is clear. The question before our generation is: Can we and our children endure</i>prosperity<i>and</i>ease?<br><br><i>I have not the time ... to compare the two struggles. I sometimes wonder which is the harder.</i>[<i>CR,</i>April 1954, p. 97; emphasis in original]<br><br>Perhaps one of our great challenges today is to find contentment and godliness amidst our abundance, remembering Jacob's caution in the Book of Mormon:<br><br><i>But wo unto the rich, who are rich as to the things of the world. For because they are rich they despise the poor, and they persecute the meek, and their hearts are upon their treasures; wherefore, their treasure is their god. And behold, their treasure shall perish with them also....</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, do not spend money for that which is of no worth, nor your labor for that which cannot satisfy. Hearken diligently unto me, and remember the words which I have spoken; and come unto the Holy One of Israel, and feast upon that which perisheth not, neither can be corrupted, and let your soul delight in fatness.</i>[2 Nephi 9:30,51]<br><br>I have seen so much godliness with contentment in little homes made of bamboo and sticks, of mud and clay, of cardboard and tin. And I've experienced it, too, in palaces with running water and electricity and a way to make the home warm in the winter and cool in the summer. No one, no matter where they live, no matter how little or how much they have, can experience more genuine happiness, more godly contentment, and more peace of heart than those who are closest to their Heavenly Father--who know that he lives, that Jesus Christ died for everyone and for them personally.<br><br>I've had some concerns that I might be misunderstood this morning--that someone might hear "godliness with complacency" instead of "godliness with contentment." I would like to compare the two, perhaps narrowing the definitions more than I should. Much of the talk thus far is about contentment. Now I want to share just a few things about complacency.<br><br>President Ezra Taft Benson said: "We do not like to be disturbed as we enjoy our comfortable complacency" (<i>An Enemy Hath Done This</i>[Salt Lake City: Parliament Publishers, 1969], p. 90). Here is where complacency is so much different for me than godliness with contentment--we<i>are</i>disturbed! We cannot be complacent because we are striving to deny ourselves of all ungodliness!<br><br>President Hugh B. Brown put it this way:<br><br><i>Complacency is a very grave danger in the Church as well as in the world. We need to be aroused to the fact that there is much yet to do in this matter of gaining our salvation. ... We need to study more, to think more, to pray more fervently....</i><br><br><i>Some have thought that upon joining the Church and being faithful all trials would end, all difficulties disappear, and all temptations cease.</i>[Not so you'd notice!] [<i>The Abundant Life</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1965), p. 169]<br><br>Nephi warned against complacency, reminding us of one of the devil's tactics:<br><br><i>And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well--and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell.</i>[2 Nephi 28:21]<br><br>President Benson commented on this once, saying that Satan was still alert and that "he is probably using the method of encouraging complacency. He is probably making an effort to lull us away into a false security because things seem well in Zion" (<i>CR,</i>April 1955, p. 47). Contentment is<i>not</i>complacency, and it's not apathy, particularly not when it's used in Paul's phrase the way it is: "But godliness with contentment is great gain."<br><br>In a letter to the editor of<i>BYU Studies,</i>Stanley B. Kimball suggested that "perhaps if the number<i>seven</i>had not held such mystic significance to earlier minds there would have been eight deadly sins--the eighth being that of complacency." He said it conditions us to "demand and expect little" ("Mormon Culture: A Letter to the Editor,"<i>BYU Studies</i>5, no. 2 [Winter 1964]: 127; emphasis in original). So I'm not in any way advocating complacency or apathy or doing nothing. We must<i>row,</i>not<i>drift.</i>I'm not speaking of<i>coast on</i>but of<i>carry on!</i><br><br>The summers I was sixteen and seventeen I worked at Zion National Park. That was quite a few years ago. Lewis and Clark hadn't been gone that long. I used to like to say to the park rangers, "Zion prospereth--all is well." I earned something like thirty-three cents an hour plus room and board, and when I finished cleaning cabins I could hike and explore<i>to my heart's content</i>(interesting phrase).<br><br>As groups of visitors would prepare to leave on the bus, we'd gather around in our lovely uniforms and perform something we called "Singaway." Among the songs we sang was one that goes: "Pack up your troubles in your old kit-bag, And smile, smile, smile" (George Asaf [George H. Powell], 1915).<br><br>Studies have shown that people who are content smile more. Can a smile be as contagious as a yawn? I think so! I've been experimenting with both. I wonder what a difference it would make in here--in our hearts (and in here, in this big room)--if we smiled more often. Like even just a couple of more times a day. Could we do that? It's such a little thing, really--and yet it can make a difference for us and others. Just two or three more times each day. How about it? Why not?<br><br>Could we say more often things like "Hello," "Thank you," "I'm sorry," "Can I help?" "Are you OK?" The power is in<i>here</i>(in this big room), and the power is in<i>here</i>(in my heart) to make the world a better place. Double your smiles today. Do good and be good. A living prophet has asked that we try a little harder to be a little better--that's do-able!<br><br>I'm suggesting that we seek to experience contentment while we work toward godliness--that we remember and appreciate all that God and Christ have done for us. Look inward--at what you have, and at what you need. You will find God waiting to bless you. He keeps<i>all</i>his promises. I'm convinced he wants to bless us with comfort and peace and joy and contentment. He wants to visit us in our sorrow and join us in our happiness. Let him do that for you during this Thanksgiving season, will you?<br><br>I am further convinced that contentment leads to gratitude and thanksgiving more than any amount of money or possessions. Try this before Christmas--before Thanksgiving if you have time: Go outside where you live or work and "look in." Look in at you. (Let people think what they will.) Consider all the blessings with which God has surrounded you in abundance. "Count your many blessings; name them one by one, And it will surprise you what the Lord has done" ("Count Your Blessings,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 241). It will surprise you over and over and over again. Can you think of one blessing that you haven't thanked him for specifically in a long, long time?<br><br>I want to share a few of the things that recently I have named one by one: the Savior, my parents and my family, the gospel, water, the scriptures and the ability to read, temples, neighbors and friends, light and truth, prayer, music, the great plan of happiness, hope, the Missionary Training Center, opportunities, rain, Relief Society, agency, the Atonement, my Mom's chocolates, the still small voice, and a complete lack of boredom in my life.<br><br>Could we add just one minute of thanks to each prayer we offer? Just<i>one minute?</i>God gives us the gift of 1,440 minutes every single day. Have we used any of those minutes on this beautiful day to say "Thank you" to him? Has it been a while since you've offered a prayer with only expressions of gratitude? Has it been a while since you've fasted to express thanks to Heavenly Father? Has it been a while since you felt<i>happy</i>and<i>content</i>through and through? I hope you can feel that way today and during the coming days of Thanksgiving and Christmas.<br><br>In the book of Alma, Amulek invites us to "live in thanksgiving daily, for the many mercies and blessings which [God] doth bestow upon you" (Alma 34:38). God seems to continually give me what I have not yet earned.<br><br>David O. McKay said that the gospel of Jesus Christ "invites the world to peace, to rest, to contentment" (<i>GI,</i>p. 111). But not necessarily to an absence of sorrow and challenges. Contentment doesn't come only when the lights are always green, the parking places right in front, the lines short and fast. It doesn't come only because the car will always start or the furnace will always work or the baby will always sleep through the night. Contentment is here--inside of us.<br><br>Was Jesus ever content? When he was with the people in the new world he said that his joy was full (see 3 Nephi 17:20). And yet he suffered so much and was treated with such cruelty--for us, for you and for me, in a very personal way. He could have stopped it. At any moment he or his Father could have stopped what was happening. They could have stopped it when he went into the Garden of Gethsemane and experienced agony he neither deserved nor perhaps fully expected. At one point he asked his Father if the cup might be taken from him. But then he continued doing his Father's will.<br><br>He could have stopped it when they were spitting on him and mocking him. He could have stopped it when they started to drive nails into his hands and feet. At any moment he could have stopped it. But he didn't--oh, thank goodness he didn't. He and our Father carried out the great plan that was meant to save and rescue us.<br><br>And he who could have had great revenge asked his Father to forgive those who tortured and crucified him because they didn't know what they were doing. Can<i>we</i>do that, too? Can<i>we</i>let go of our anger, our bitterness, our desire for "getting even"? Can<i>we</i>forgive others because they don't know what they''re doing?<br><br>Let us be thankful that God never gives up on us, never deserts nor ignores us--and so let<i>us,</i>in a godlike and Christlike way, never give up on one another. Don't cast people out of your synagogue, and don't cast them out of your heart.<br><br>Let us be thankful that it is still today--that we can still make some changes, make some visits, make some friends, make some peace, find contentment.<br><br>O that I were an angel and had the ability to express to you beautifully and adequately how much this means to me--how much I need and appreciate God's love for us and the incredible gift of his Beloved Son so that we can go home again. They have blessed me far beyond my ability to "count" and "name."<br><br><i>The Lord bless thee, and keep thee:</i><br><i>The Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee:</i><br><i>The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.</i>[Numbers 6:24–26]<br><br>I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Mary Ellen Edmunds was a member of the Relief Society General Board of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 21 November 1995.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1> Questions: Seeking for and Being Found by Truth - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Today I want to consider with you how asking questions with faith can improve our learning by helping us not only to find truth, but to be found and changed by truth. I want to begin by showing you some home movies. Let me show you a wonderful little episode in my five-year-old Richard's first experience with the beach and the ocean. We were just north of San Diego and had been playing on the beach for some forty or fifty minutes. I had been taking a video shot of several sailboats and just happened to catch little Richard on<i>Candid Camera.</i>He had been watching and trying to follow the example of his older brother A. J., who is eleven and was bodysurfing. Notice the way Richard questions and how he learns from asking and hearing answers to these questions. (A video clip was shown.)<br><br>I love the straightforwardness, the honesty, of Richard's questions. It's no wonder that children, at least those who approach their learning so openly, with such direct questions, learn so rapidly. I am also overwhelmed by Richard's faith in my answers. "Will I die?" he asks. All it takes is a simple "no" from me and he is on to the next question. However, it isn't that he takes everything I say without question. When I start to talk about boogie boards he corrects my misunderstanding quickly and then asks his question again about how A. J. does bodysurfing. Richard, of course, experiments on my words according to his ability, which is not great, but he learns quickly and is filled with joy by his learning.<br><br>No wonder children learn so quickly an entire language, sometimes more than one, and a world full of basic information, including how to operate the practical aspects of an entire life. What we learn thereafter is relatively meager in comparison. A major reason, I would argue, has much to do with the openness and faith of the child's search for learning--with the humble willingness to admit ignorance and ask "dumb" questions.<br><br>This season of the year--which I love so much, with its time for family, its surprises under the tree, the end of the semester, and (most important) the gift of the Savior--reminds me of two questions from the Christmas story. I refer to the questions Zacharias and Mary ask of the angel Gabriel. You will remember that Gabriel appeared to Zacharias in the temple, where he was officiating in the priest's office. Apparently Zacharias and his wife, Elizabeth, had been praying for many years for a child. They were now quite old, but the angel announced that their prayers were heard and that they would have a son and call his name John. Zacharias responded with a question: "Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years" (Luke 1:18). As you will remember, Zacharias was struck dumb because, as the angel said, "thou believest not my words" (Luke 1:20).<br><br>Not long thereafter, the same angel Gabriel appeared to Mary, a young virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph. The angel announced yet another birth: the birth of the Savior to Mary. She also responded to this miraculous announcement with a question: "How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?" (Luke 1:34). Mary's question was apparently asked with faith, because the angel answered her question and told her that she would become the mother of the Son of God. Mary's response was, "Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word" (Luke 1:38).<br><br>I am intrigued by the difference in the response of the angel to these two questions. On the surface, the questions do not look so different. Both Mary and Zacharias ask how the miraculous, promised events will occur. Yet Zacharias' question must have been uttered in a spirit of doubt. In addition, some have argued that Zacharias is asking for a sign when he says "whereby shall I know this?" If that is true, Gabriel probably took that as further evidence of unbelief.<br><br>By contrast, Mary's question appears almost paradoxical. It appears to question the announcement and yet believe it simultaneously. Of course, Mary's question isn't paradoxical at all. She simply is asking for the understanding that she lacks, all the while believing that the event will occur. Her question is, however, remarkable, because it is so fresh and honest. Would<i>you</i>dare ask such a question to a shiny angel, probably with a big, deep voice, who just appeared to you out of nowhere and told you something so surprising? I imagine I would lack the presence of mind to form such a question, let alone the honesty and faith to do so the way Mary did. Perhaps that is the reason that the first words of angelic visitors are often "fear not" or "thy sins are forgiven thee." How is it possible to combine such honest inquisitiveness with such great faith? What can we learn from such childlike honesty? (Indeed, many biblical scholars suggest that Mary may have been a girl of fourteen to sixteen when Gabriel visited her.) What happens to us as we grow older? Why do many of us get to be more like Zacharias--more skeptical, jaded, or doubting?<br><br>One of my colleagues recently confessed that contrary to many of his peers who preferred to teach specialized, advanced courses, he really enjoyed the introductory classes, because students still asked honest questions and found excitement and challenge in their learning. "By the time they are seniors or graduate students," he said, "we have pretty much beaten the fun out of them."<br><br>Another of my colleagues, talking about a different group of seniors and graduate students, lamented that they seemed to have overlearned the importance of questioning. He said they seemed to have taken to heart the imperative of bumper stickers that read "Question Authority!" or, even more basic, "Question Reality!" The students my colleague worried about were skeptical, irreverent, and questioned everyone and everything.<br><br>If you will permit me to paint with a broad brush in order to make my point, I would observe that these two groups of students represent two quite false, yet appealing, perspectives about learning. The first perspective focuses on having the right answers, whereas the second perspective emphasizes having ready questions. I want to consider each perspective briefly.<br><br>From the first perspective, whether in the Church or at the university, learning means picking up the right answers to the test, to the gospel doctrine question, or to life. Asking questions makes you look dumb or disloyal. You are dumb if you don't know the answer, or, if your question appears critical of popular views, you look disloyal. In our setting, some returned missionaries get pretty good at implementing this perspective. They have all the answers and often can cite scriptures to justify their views. What is appealing about this perspective is that the gospel does provide answers to life's most important questions. However, the gospel teaches that in this life we walk by faith, and the Lord therefore leaves many things for us to decide and expects not to command in all things but to have us be anxiously engaged in good causes of our own free will (see D&amp;amp;C 58:27). Students who want the answers shun teachers who encourage them to develop and pursue interesting questions of their own and, in this way, to learn how to learn. Such students become robotlike "answer machines" who memorize for the test (and often forget what they learned after the test). They, and the teachers who approach learning from this perspective, have "assassinated wonder" and thus have taken all of the fun out of learning.<br><br>The second perspective is a caricature of learning through questions. There are actually many versions of this perspective, but to save time I have chosen to focus on an ever-more popular approach that assumes that reality is not objective but rather consists of whatever society agrees it is. There is no absolute truth that transcends societies, and what is taken for truth is different depending on the society or even on one's place in society. What becomes accepted as true, from this perspective, is influenced by who has power, so that truth not only varies by society, but it is political. Thus, those in power and the perspectives they enforce must be questioned. Those with such a perspective are critical of the smugness and narrow-mindedness of the first group, who think they have the answers. These are the modern skeptics who don't believe anything except that there are no universally stable answers. And they are therefore closed to truth because they know it doesn't exist. Perhaps this is one of the perspectives Paul had in mind when he said people would be "ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth" (2 Timothy 3:7). The most insidious form of this perspective suggests that the Church is just another organization with its own unique, but biased, version of the truth and that prophets are political just like everyone else. Therefore the doctrine and the authorities must be questioned rigorously.<br><br>Both perspectives inhibit learning. The focus on answers severely limits learning because it doesn't encourage us to form good questions about what we don't yet know and to see with fresh eyes new problems to solve. The focus on questioning authority and reality denies learning by faith and the confirmation of absolute truth even though we may not fully understand the truth.<br><br>Both perspectives are also too self-conscious. Both Richard and Mary have something to teach those with such perspectives. They would teach the answer-oriented folks to feel awe and wonder in the face of a vast world of possible things to learn and would encourage them to overcome their pride and ask honest and unself-conscious questions. They would teach the question-oriented folks to trust in prophets and truth, to have faith in feeling and in faith itself. This will require overcoming their pride, which won't allow anyone to have the truth. No wonder children and humble people learn faster and perform better than they would otherwise. Although they may lack sophisticated thinking and learning skills, they are willing to admit ignorance freely and ask honest questions that may not be so dumb after all.<br><h2><b>Lessons About Learning from Zeezrom</b></h2><br>I want to try to flesh out some of the elements of a learning perspective drawn from the scriptures and modern prophets about how to learn with faithful questions. As a way to develop this perspective, let's consider the case of Zeezrom, who, as you will remember, was a learned man who lived in Ammonihah and was a chief antagonist of Alma and Amulek as they sought to teach the gospel to people in his community. Zeezrom was an expert in using questions to confuse or to trick others. For example, he asks Amulek: "Is there more than one God?" When Amulek answers that there is not, he asks: "Who is he that shall come? Is it the Son of God?" Amulek says, "Yea." Zeezrom's next question is: "Shall he save his people in their sins?" Of course Amulek says he won't save people<i>in</i>their sins. Then Zeezrom springs the trap. He turns to the people and says: "See that ye remember these things; for he said there is but one God; yet he saith that the Son of God shall come, but he shall not save his people--as though he had authority to command God" (see Alma 11:28–35).<br><br>Obviously, Zeezrom isn't seeking the truth through his questions. He thinks he knows the answers already. Nor does he have faith in God. His questions are calculated to trap Amulek, to discredit him, so that he, Zeezrom, can gain notoriety and thus get more business from the people. (Bruce Hafen read an earlier draft of my talk and thanked me for not mentioning that Zeezrom was a lawyer, so I'm not going to say what his business was.)<br><br>Now Zeezrom had clearly gone to school and learned how to look smart. The problem is that school can teach us the wrong lessons if we aren't careful. It can teach us that learning is about excelling--that is, looking better than others so we can get good jobs, make more money, and thus seem more successful than others. But no matter whether we subscribe to an answer-oriented or a question-oriented perspective, if we are motivated by a desire to look better than others, our questions and our answers will be false. Although we may learn some things, and even do very well professionally, as did Zeezrom, we will fail the real tests of life.<br><br>Certainly "to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God," as Jacob taught (2 Nephi 9:29). The increased sophistication that a university education makes possible can develop our ability to think and to understand and help us make wiser choices and have greater ability to carry out these choices. But the most important test in life is not<i>how much</i>truth we know but whether we are<i>true</i>to the truth we know. Learning that ignores this test leads to failure that is infinitely worse than failing a class.<br><br>Now notice what happens to Zeezrom when he begins to open his heart to the light that comes from the Spirit through Alma and Amulek. He first begins to tremble as he feels the truth of what they are saying. He becomes convinced that there are things he does not know, and he is willing to learn these things and change himself accordingly. He then begins "to inquire of them diligently, that he might know more concerning the kingdom of God" (Alma 12:8). As Alma sees that his questions are honest and faithful, he says:<br><br><i>It is given unto many to know the mysteries of God; nevertheless they are laid under a strict command that they shall not impart only according to the portion of his word which he doth grant unto the children of men, according to the heed and diligence which they give unto him.</i><br><br><i>And therefore, he that will harden his heart, the same receiveth the lesser portion of the word; and he that will not harden his heart, to him is given the greater portion of the word, until it is given unto him to know the mysteries of God until he know them in full.</i>[Alma 12:9–10]<br><br>The change in Zeezrom and Alma's response to him provide some suggestions about the elements of a perspective that encourages faithful questions. First, Zeezrom had to open his heart to the enticings of the Holy Ghost that bore witness to the truth of what Alma and Amulek were teaching. Previously, he had been hardened, past feeling and responding to these impressions. Second, Zeezrom was willing to admit ignorance in front of the very people he had been trying to impress with his intelligence just moments before. I suppose that his questions were now more direct, sincere, and full of interest. Third, Zeezrom was willing to give heed and diligence to what he was taught. As Alma taught him, his now-softened heart and willingness to become true to God's direction would finally lead him to all truth.<br><br>As our hearts are thus changed by listening to and following the guidance of the Lord's Spirit and of his servants, I believe we learn something about the attitude we should have as we approach Heavenly Father with questions. I want to add this attitude as a fourth element of a "faithful questions" perspective. The idea is beautifully expressed in the Bible dictionary description of prayer. It says:<br><br><i>Prayer is the act by which the will of the Father and the will of the child are brought into correspondence with each other. The object of prayer is not to change the will of God, but to secure for ourselves and for others blessings that God is already willing to grant, but that are made conditional on our asking for them.</i><br><br>As I have gained more perspective about prayer, it has seemed to me that some of my prayers in the past have been to an extent misguided. I hear myself praying in the past, pleading with the Lord to move about the world doing good from my perspective, without a clear sense of "thy will be done" in my orientation. I have too often sought to persuade the Lord to adopt my agenda rather than trying to discover his agenda and make it mine. So the fourth element is to ask with a spirit of "thy will be done," trying to learn his will as we ask.<br><br>Perhaps my growing realization about a more productive learning relationship with Heavenly Father is what made me so impressed with President Marion G. Romney's biography written by F. Burton Howard. President Romney, who served as a counselor to President Spencer W. Kimball, is a wonderful example of someone who asks faithful questions. I particularly want to share an account of how President Romney responded when his wife, Ida, suffered a stroke in early 1967. She lay in the hospital for weeks, giving no sign that she recognized President Romney when he visited.<br><br>During this period, following priesthood blessings, fasting, prayer, and, nevertheless, a continued worsening of Ida's condition, President Romney's response was one of great reticence to counsel the Lord. If his will was to take her, President Romney did not want to pray for something else. And yet he had said on numerous occasions about his wife, "She is the best part of me. I could never carry on alone" (F. Burton Howard,<i>Marion</i>G.<i>Romney, His Life and Faith</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1988], p. 140).<br><br>He searched the scriptures and fasted to develop his faith and learn how to demonstrate it to the Lord. He didn't directly ask the Lord to heal his wife, though this was never far from his heart. Rather, he worried whether he had the right to ask for this blessing. He observed that the Lord hadn't healed President McKay, who was very ill. "He hasn't healed others who are in as great a need as I," he said. "Who am I to ask for a blessing? Why should the Lord answer my prayers?"<br><br>He struggled with this internal conflict for some time, continuing to read, to pray, and to fast. One evening, shortly after returning from a visit to Ida in the hospital, where he had found her unchanged, he went to the Book of Mormon and began to read. He read in the book of Helaman about the prophet Nephi, who had been falsely condemned as he sought to teach the people. A particular passage in this account touched his heart more than he had ever felt before. The scripture read:<br><br><i>Blessed art thou, Nephi, for those things which thou hast done; for I have beheld how thou hast with unwearyingness declared the word, which I have given unto thee, unto this people. And thou hast not feared them, and hast not sought thine own life, but hast sought my will, and to keep my commandments.</i><br><br><i>And now, because thou hast done this with such unwearyingness, behold, I will bless thee forever; and I will make thee mighty in word and in deed, in faith and in works; yea, even that all things shall be done unto thee according to thy word, for thou shalt not ask that which is contrary to my will.</i>[Helaman 10:4–5]<br><br>President Romney felt personal confirmation that the Lord accepted him. He<br><br><i>knew that by refusing to ask a special favor without first ascertaining the will of the Lord, he had unknowingly demonstrated the quality of his faith. . . .</i><br><br><i>With awe,</i>[President Romney]<i>fell to his knees. The scripture was the direct answer to many prayers. More than anything else he wanted to know the Lord's will for Ida. He was willing to let her go; or, if need be, he would care for her in whatever condition the Lord wanted her to be in. As he concluded his prayer with the phrase "Thy will be done," he seemed to feel or hear a voice which said, "It is not contrary to my will that Ida be healed."</i>[Howard,<i>Romney,</i>pp. 141–142]<br><br>Quickly he put on his coat and tie and went to the hospital. Arriving there at 3:00 a.m., he entered her room and placed his hands upon her head. She didn't move or give any sign of recognition. He then invoked the power of the priesthood and pronounced a simple blessing upon her, uttering the<br><br><i>incredible promise that she would recover her health and mental powers and yet perform a great mission upon the earth.</i><br><br><i>Even though he did not doubt,</i>[President Romney]<i>was astonished to see Ida's eyes open as he concluded the blessing. He sat down on the bed and listened to her frail voice ask, "For goodness' sakes, Marion, what are you doing here?" In total surprise he responded, "Ida, how are you?" With a flash of humor which showed that she was not totally unaware of her circumstances, Ida Romney replied, "Compared to what, Marion? Compared to what?"</i>[p. 142]<br><br>Thereafter, Ida recovered fully and miraculously.<br><br>I am deeply impressed with the self-restraint and the faith of this humble man. He struggled with his own heart to make sure that his question was a faithful one. Notice the presence of the four elements of faithful questions: First, he fasted and prayed to open his heart to God's Spirit and yield himself to its enticings. Second, he acknowledged his need to learn from the Lord by searching the scriptures and asking himself whether a petition to restore Ida's health would be righteous. Third, he gave diligence and heed to the Lord's word, wondering whether there was anything else he could do to develop his faith and demonstrate it to the Lord. And finally, his entire effort focused on harmonizing his will with the Lord's rather than trying to persuade the Lord. When we have so schooled our hearts and consulted the scriptures, and then receive the Lord's Spirit, we ask "according to the will of God; wherefore it is done even as [we] asketh" (D&amp;amp;C 46:30). Such questions can lead to remarkable answers, as President Romney discovered.<br><br>Now we may understand better why President Harold B. Lee said, "Learning by faith is no task for a lazy man." Such learning "requires the bending of the whole soul. . . . Then only comes â€˜knowledge by faith'" (<i>Ye Are the Light of the World</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1974], p. 119). Such a bending of the whole soul prepares us to hear the word of the Lord and helps us to open our hearts to do what might be very difficult. Indeed, this process of learning changes us. We enter into the spirit of faithful questions demonstrated by the childlike approach of Richard and Mary and President Romney. Indeed, as our eye becomes single to the glory of God rather than our own glory, our "whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in [us]; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things" (D&amp;amp;C 88:67).<br><br>This kind of learning is not often taught in universities. But it is taught at BYU, and it can lead to all truth, both sacred and secular. As I noted earlier, if we are not careful we can learn the wrong things in school. As a matter of fact, getting our hearts right is much more important than getting the questions right. If our hearts are right, the Lord will help us to form the right questions. And even when we can't form the right questions, he will still bless us if we have faith and pure hearts (see Romans 8:26–27 and 3 Nephi 17:2–8). For example, when the Savior appeared to the Nephites, he taught them many things but then said: "I perceive that ye are weak, that ye cannot understand all my words" (3 Nephi 17:2). He told them to ponder and prepare their minds for his teaching on the following day. However, he saw the people in tears and read in their hearts a desire that he would stay longer. He then invited them to bring forward their sick, lame, blind, and otherwise afflicted members of their group so he could heal them. "For," he said, "I perceive that ye desire that I should show unto you what I have done unto your brethren at Jerusalem, for I see that your faith is sufficient that I should heal you" (3 Nephi 17:8). I believe that in a similar manner the Savior hears and responds to our unspoken, even unformed, questions when our faith and hearts are right. A university education is, in this sense, not critical to our salvation or our eventual eternal education. But a BYU education can help us be educated for eternity if we learn to ask faithful questions.<br><br>There is yet something lacking in this perspective on learning through faithful questions. The problem is that the perspective I have been developing focuses on<i>our</i>questions of God. However, since his ways and thoughts are higher than our own (see Isaiah 55:8–9), we must learn to hear and respond to his questions of us. Our questions to him are limited by our finite perspective.<br><br>I recall an experience I had as I was completing my doctorate that has taught me something about listening to God's questions rather than aggressively pursuing my own, no matter how righteous my questions seem to be. I was just beginning my final year at Stanford, and I was not sure how I would be able to accomplish all that needed to be done.<br><br>One day the elders quorum president in the ward engaged me in casual conversation. He said that they were looking for an early-morning seminary teacher to teach the youth in the ward and offhandedly suggested that maybe I should do it. My response was that I didn't see how I could possibly do it during the coming year, given all that I had to do, and the conversation ended harmlessly enough. However, for several weeks I couldn't seem to get the thought out of my mind: "But what if they call you, Alan?" I had never turned down a calling in my life. I had always said to myself that I would accept callings, but I resisted the thought of this calling.<br><br>About three weeks later, as I sat in the temple renewing sacred covenants with the Lord, promising him that I would do whatever he asked, a thought from the Lord came into my mind: "Would you even teach early-morning seminary for me?" Well, there he had me. I realized that I had been asking the wrong question. My question had been, "How can I finish the dissertation and move on to a university assignment?" The Lord was asking me: "Are you interested in doing my will more than your own?" In my heart I responded first with real embarrassment that I had been unrepentant and closed to what I now realized had been his question of me, a question that I thought had come from an unthoughtful and casual elders quorum president. I then promised the Lord that I would do whatever he wanted, even if I never finished the dissertation.<br><br>I was called to teach seminary the next Sunday. It was one of the most difficult assignments I have ever had. I struggled to prepare for those early-morning lessons. The students were often not appreciative of the sacrifice that I felt I was making, and the dissertation took an additional semester to finish.<br><br>I realize now that this experience led me to remarkable opportunities to serve individuals who needed my particular approach. I also see how the Lord taught me about teaching, about the gospel, and about myself through this experience. As I look back, however, the most important lesson for me from this experience is that if I am not careful I may become so involved in pursuing my own questions that I may miss God's questions to me. They come in many forms, and I must school my heart to be open to them.<br><br>As Dennis Rasmussen of our philosophy faculty has written, if we focus only on our questions and our seeking for information, we will fail to meet our deepest need. "Will man be happy when he has split the last atom and searched all the sands of the sea?" he asks. No, for "man's fundamental need is not to ask a question but to respond to one" (Dennis Rasmussen,<i>The Lord's Question</i>[Provo, Utah: Keter Foundation, 1985], p. 4).<br><br>The Lord through the ages has asked us questions, not because he needs to know the answer but because we need to question ourselves and learn. The Lord clothed us with a question as he sent us into mortality. It is the first recorded question in the scriptures: "Adam . . . , Where art thou?" (Genesis 3:9). Professor Rasmussen continues:<br><br><i>Does God not know? On the contrary, only he knows. In my weakness I lose my bearings. Like a child wandering in a forest I follow the whims of the moment and forget the way. I am too caught up by my surroundings to follow the path. Not until a Father's voice calls do I wonder where I am. How shall I answer? I am here? But where is here? So helpless am I that I cannot say. But deep within I hear his voice and tremble, for finally there are just two places, with him or without him, and just two ways, toward him or not toward him.</i>[Rasmussen,<i>Lord's Question,</i>p. 4]<br><br>Ultimately, learning to ask faithful questions and respond to the Lord's answers and his questions will save us--that is, to the extent that we see we are not only about gaining information but about gaining salvation and sanctification and we learn that all of our questions have eternal import. This idea is clearly reinforced by the experience that Alma the Elder had as he became head of the Church in the kingdom of King Mosiah. When people who had disobeyed laws of the Church were brought before Alma, he attempted to have King Mosiah judge them, but King Mosiah said they were Alma's responsibility. From Mosiah we read:<br><br><i>And now the spirit of Alma was again troubled; and he went and inquired of the Lord what he should do concerning this matter,</i>for he feared that he should do wrong in the sight of God.<br><br><i>And it came to pass that after he had poured out his whole soul to God, the voice of the Lord came to him, saying:</i><br><br><i>Blessed art thou, Alma. . . . Thou art blessed because of thy exceeding faith in the words alone of my servant Abinadi.</i>[Mosiah 26:13–15; emphasis added]<br><br>And so, we see Alma, like Marion G. Romney, inquiring of the Lord, asking a question, fearing to do wrong in his sight, wanting to have his heart right, asking that he be informed and blessed with an answer. And now, listen to the Lord's response, which is not an answer to his specific question (that comes later) but rather an answer to the Lord's question of "Adam . . . , Where art thou?" and to Alma's standing before the Lord.<br><br><i>And because thou hast inquired of me concerning the transgressor, thou art blessed.</i><br><br><i>Thou art my servant; and I covenant with thee that thou shalt have eternal life; and thou shalt serve me and go forth in my name, and shalt gather together my sheep.</i>[Mosiah 26:19–20]<br><br>And thus we see that servants of the Lord who seek to do his will, who inquire with faith, and who open themselves to the Lord's inquiries and allow him to change them and bless them can finally receive the ultimate blessing.<br><br>May we, too, learn to ask faithful questions, and may we become true as we seek truth is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Alan L.

<h1>Thine Eyes: Miracles Large and Small - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<b>Janet:</b> A couple of weeks ago our family watched a Christmas movie together, after which our four-year-old grand son Alex turned wide-eyed to his mother and asked, "Do I believe in Santa Claus?"<br><br>I had two reactions to his honest question. One was a realization of the dependency a young child has on his parents for the establishment of his beliefs. The other reaction was to the vast difference between the miraculous in fantasy and the miraculous in reality. On the one hand, the more information a child gathers, the more preposterous fantasy becomes (except to take its proper place in entertainment and imaginative play). On the other hand, the more informed we become and the more experiences with the Spirit we have in this life, the more we understand the realities of eternal truth. Time and knowledge work to dispute fantasy, but the test of time only enhances what is real.<br><br><b>Rex:</b> Reason is not, of course, the only avenue by which we gain understanding. Our tool kit of learning is half empty unless it also includes faith. Paul reminds us that faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. As President Benson instructed us, "Our inability to explain a thing . . . does not disprove its reality" (<i>So Shall Ye Reap </i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1960], p. 149). Those things that we cannot fully comprehend through our rational processes we call miracles. As we go through life, gaining maturity, the reality of these miracles is often supported by reason--but never completely. Throughout this existence, faith and miracles and faith in miracles must play an important part of our development and progress toward eternal life and also in our happiness in this life.<br><br><b>Janet:</b> The greatest miracles are, most appropriately, associated with the Savior of the world. They include the creation of the world, the Savior's miraculous birth that we celebrate at this season, the Atonement, and the restoration of the gospel. Reason and faith are the companion learning processes that, if exercised consistently throughout our lives, can lead us to a greater understanding of these most profound of all miracles. As Elder Neal A. Maxwell reminds us:<br><br><i>Like the wise men from the east, we too must travel a great distance in order to come unto Christ, the Light of the World. . . .</i><br><br><i>We should be like </i>[the] <i>star </i>[in the east]--<i>in our proper orbit and place, on time, putting our talents to work, doing what we have been asked to do.</i> [<i>The Christmas Scene </i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1994), pp. 9–10]<br><br><b>Rex: </b>At this magical time of year, when we turn our minds and our spirits even more to what the First Presidency in their 1995 Christmas message so beautifully referred to as "that night of nights so many years ago," we would like to discuss miracles with you. Sometimes we tend to think of miracles in terms of history-making, dramatic events for which there is no mortal explanation, such as instantaneous healings, raising the dead, turning water to wine, or feeding the multitudes with five loaves and two fishes, miracles all performed by our Savior. But miracles come in all sizes and to all people.<br><br><b>Janet: </b>As I ponder my own mission in the midst of the Savior's wondrous miracles, it occurs to me that a whole myriad of miracles is set in motion to maintain our constant progression and to remind us of our purpose here. God didn't create miracles as single, solitary extravaganzas to dazzle us. Each has a purpose and is given to perpetuate our progression. As we look at miracles, we must be more than astonished. We must be motivated to mold our lives in a Christlike manner. In so doing, we must see not only the obvious miracles but the many everyday miracles that give our life meaning and majesty as we see ourselves and others as literal sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father. Almost always, in one way or another, these seemingly smaller miracles tie back to the grander miracles, such as the Atonement or the Restoration, and on occasion to other miracles of the more personal kind.<br><br>Just how difficult it sometimes is to see and understand this linkage when faced with the realities of everyday life was recently brought to my attention by America's beloved artist Norman Rockwell. Hanging on a wall in the Springville Art Museum right now is a picture of the beautiful St. Thomas Cathedral. In the center of the picture is a young boy on a ladder, changing the lettering for the upcoming sermon. Below him, on the sidewalk, are the people of New York City. And in typical city fashion--as only Rockwell could portray--all have their heads buried against their chests and all are apparently late for some important meeting. No one, including the young man changing the letters or the priest at his feet, seem to be paying any attention to the message going up, which reads, "Lift Up Thine Eyes."<br><br><b>Rex: </b>It is this thought, to "Lift Up Thine Eyes"--to the miracles both great and small that surround us--that we would like to develop today. We particularly want to explore the idea that the quieter, more individualized, more personalized miracles can and should play a central part in our lives, in the development of our testimonies, and in our progress toward eternal life.<br><br><b>Janet: </b>And very often these more individually focused miracles come in ways that we may not recognize as miracles at the time, unless our spirits are particularly attuned to recognize them. As Willa Cather said so beautifully, "Miracles rest on our perceptions being made finer so we can see what was with us all the while."<br><br>At times when I have been really discouraged, I take a few moments to appreciate the miracle of each day and all that is in this beautiful world. To smell a flower, walk over crunching leaves, make a snowball, or visit with a friend--all these actions center me and bring me back to the reality that life itself is a miracle and that if Heavenly Father created this world for us with all of its miracles, he wants us to see them, appreciate them, and learn from them. The big miracles show us the way and make eternal life a reality. The little miracles--the everyday miracles--motivate us and keep us going in the right direction: on the path to eternal life.<br><br><b>Rex: </b>As children of our Heavenly Father, we are allowed to participate in some of the everyday miracles, and we need to lift up our eyes and be aware of them as they occur in our lives. We plant seeds, nourish them, and thrill at their growth; we bear children and marvel at the beginning of a new life; we observe kindnesses and service and are glad to be part of humanity. All this we do in recognition of the divinity of our heritage.<br><br><b>Janet: </b>Just as the blossom follows the planted and nourished seed, kindness grows and blooms into small miracles through our simple acts of service. Let me illustrate with one of my favorite stories.<br><br>More than sixty years ago, a little girl named Millie and a boy named Billie were in elementary school together. Every day each student stood at the front of the class by Millie's desk to read from a primer. Whenever it was Billie's turn, the children laughed at his constant stuttering. Millie was a tenderhearted girl who disliked seeing anyone ridiculed; one day, when she could stand the snickering no longer, she reached up and took Billie's hand. A miracle happened! Billie quit stuttering, and from that day on, every time it was Billie's turn to read, Millie repeated the therapy and the stuttering stopped. The two children did not play together after school or even on the playground, but there was magic in the moments when he read.<br><br>The children grew up, married others, and raised families. Bill moved to a different state, became the CEO of one of America's largest corporations, and was called by President Kimball to be a regional representative. Millie excelled in various Church callings, was equally efficient at home and in the bank where she worked, and delighted the world with her winning smile, acts of compassion, and love for humanity.<br><br>Years went by, and they were both left widowed, separated from their eternal companions. One day after Bill had written his life history, detailing an episode of a "little blonde girl" who years ago had changed his life by holding his hand, a mutual friend told him, "I know your little blonde girl." After a time Bill phoned Millie, they talked, he flew to see her, they had lunch, followed by another lunch, more phone calls, lunches, meeting each other's families--eventually they became engaged. Last December the little blonde girl, now a beautiful woman, and the little boy with the stutter, now a confident man in his seventies, were married. They devote each day to making each other happy.<br><br><b>Rex: </b>What would have happened if the mature Bill had neglected to make that first phone call to Millie or, upon meeting her again, had not recognized her for the wonderful woman she was and how she would bless his life? Sometimes a miracle occurs, and it is hardly noticed. Elder Maxwell points out that the special star that signaled Christ's birth was recognized by only a few shepherds and wise men. Obviously, the effects of a miracle depend in substantial part on the faith of each individual beneficiary.<br><br>Time and time again we see how important our own individual faith is in receiving and recognizing a miracle. Think about the restoration of the gospel and the Book of Mormon--the coming forth of that book, including a five-year continuous involvement by Moroni himself; its translation through direct revelation; and the fact that it has withstood 165 years of relentless criticism and is today accepted by millions as a new witness for Christ. Surely this constitutes, in the purest sense, one of the great miracles of all time.<br><br><b>Janet: </b>But consider the case of Oliver Cowdery. He actually saw the angel Moroni, who in turn permitted him to see and handle the plates. He was the Prophet Joseph Smith's companion in the translation of the Book of Mormon, he sat with him through that historic process, and he was the man, the only man, who recorded Joseph's actual words. It was Oliver Cowdery who was Joseph Smith's companion on the banks of the Susquehanna River when John the Baptist returned to earth and restored the Aaronic Priesthood through these two men. And even during his apostate days he never denied any of these things. Yet apostatize he did; even these grand-scale miracles that he personally witnessed and in which he personally participated did not prevent his leaving the Church for a time. Contrast that with the more intimate miracle that occurs within the lives of each of us when we come to know the Book of Mormon in a far less dramatic, but equally effective way as we put to the test Moroni's promise and receive our own divine witness of its truth. Our experience with the Book of Mormon also demonstrates that sometimes the quiet, intimate, and more personalized miracles tie back to bigger ones and often have even greater lasting effects on the individual than those that may be recorded in the history books.<br><br><b>Rex: </b>Let me tell you of one such miracle involving Moroni's promise that happened to me when I was a missionary. After I had been serving for several weeks, bearing my testimony many times daily that I knew Joseph Smith had seen the Father and the Son, I began to ask myself such things as "How do you know? Do you really know, or are you just deceiving these people and yourself as well? You didn't see it happen, and you don't know anyone who did."<br><br>As the days went on, these misgivings bored into my soul more and more until they reached the point of an overwhelming obsession. I remembered Moroni's great promise contained in chapter 10, verses 4 and 5. I had been urging other people to put that promise to the test; now I felt a great need to do the same for myself. And so I began reading the Book of Mormon once again, this time with more intensity, accompanied by prayers that always included a plea to know for a surety of the book's veracity. The answer came within about a month and a half--not through a vision, nor a voice from the heavens, nor handwriting that suddenly appeared on the wall of our apartment. But for me it was just as surely a direct revelation, and therefore a miracle, as if it had taken one of these more dramatic forms.<br><br>It occurred one hot dusty afternoon in a suburb of Mexico City, Colonia Moctezuma. We had returned for the third visit--which in those days was devoted exclusively to the events of the Restoration--and our investigators were a widow and her fifteen-year-old daughter. Neither of them had shown any visible interest during our first two visits, and, quite frankly, I was surprised that they let us in the third time. About halfway through the visit, as I began to tell the story of the restoration of the Aaronic Priesthood by John the Baptist, an unmistakable divine presence came over me, literally consuming my entire being. It said to me, not exactly in words, but with a surety that I will never forget: "You know, this really happened. This same man, John the Baptist, who had baptized the Savior of the world, actually came down to this earth in the spring of 1829 and conferred upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery the same authority by which he personally, eighteen centuries before, had baptized the Savior of the world."<br><br>It was one of the few times in my life when I know I received a direct message from my Heavenly Father. And it affected not only me; it also affected the way that I spoke to such an extent that our two investigators felt the same spirit that I felt. It reminded me of what Nephi tells us in verse 1 of his great valedictory chapter 33 in 2 Nephi: When a man speaks by the power of the Holy Ghost, the power of the Holy Ghost carries the truth of his message to those who hear him. I can tell you that on that afternoon in that home three conversions occurred--mine and those of the widow and her daughter. At the end of our discussion they both asked for baptism, which is something we had not yet suggested. And as for my own conversion, I knew that I had been given the assurance I had been seeking.<br><br><b>Janet: </b>Such miracles, for the most part, do not come without asking, without much prayer, fasting, and soul-searching. The miracle of the good grade is not likely to occur in the Testing Center unless it has been preceded by some extraordinary effort in the library or other place of study. Wisely, our Father in Heaven is prudent in dispensing miracles. When Satan taunted Jesus in the desert to turn stones into bread, he refused. Yet on another occasion he fed a multitude of people with two loaves and five fishes. In commenting on this contrast, C. S. Lewis has observed that perhaps one may surmise that the direct change from stone to bread appeared to the Son not to follow a natural order. "Little bread," he said, "into much bread is quite a different matter. Every year God makes a little corn into much corn; the seed is sown and there is increase." Likewise, when we plant the seed of knowledge by thoughtful study, our mortal minds can increase in knowledge. The miracle in learning exists because God gives us our intelligence, but it is brought to pass through our individual effort.<br><br><b>Rex: </b>To this observation I would add that God himself does not sow the seeds in the fields; we must do that. And so it is with our own personal miracles. We must do our part so that he is not working with stones.<br><br><b>Janet: </b>While we dislike thinking of ourselves as stones, there are moments in our lives when we feel our hearts growing cold and hard. Usually this happens when we feel we have been unfairly treated or misunderstood. And it is at these times that we need to rely on the miracle of prayer to heal our broken hearts or our angry, ailing spirits. Let me illustrate with a personal example.<br><br>Several years ago, as a Young Women president, I took a group of girls to stake camp. On our first night there, without my knowledge, a few of my girls played a harmless prank on some campers from another ward. In the morning, when the girls confessed to the stake camp director--someone new in the stake whom I had never met--they were dealt a harsh punishment. One of the girls was taken out of our cabin for the entire week, and others were given additional cleanup duties.<br><br>But the director did not stop there. She then turned to me and suggested that if we could not comply with the rules we should be sent home. I had to swallow a great deal of pride, and I found myself biting my tongue at various times throughout that week, particularly since the camp seemed to be run far more like a military boot camp than a young women's outing. But I tried to be positive for the sake of my girls. In fact, together we started looking for the good in that year's camp, such as the fact that every activity was organized the best it had ever been.<br><br>On the last night of camp, we gathered in an amphitheater around a fire for a testimony meeting. True to the order of camp that year, we marched in single file, ward by ward. I was with our Laurel group, and we were one of the last to enter. When I finally sat down, there was only one small space left, and it was next to me. On this we piled our jackets. But, just as we were ready to begin, the camp director--or the "gestapo lady," as the girls called her--walked in. I could feel my girls cringe as her eyes searched for a place to sit. Slowly I lifted our jackets and motioned to her, trying hard not to look at the disapproving faces of my girls.<br><br>I knew all too well that this testimony meeting was supposed to be the spiritual culmination of the entire week. The spirit at this meeting could change lives for the better and often did. And now I could feel my own resentment and that of my girls toward this woman crowding out the Spirit. How I needed my heart to be softened. And so I began to pray fervently for help in understanding her and to let me know of her goodness. I prayed off and on for thirty minutes or so. And then, as we were singing "I Am a Child of God," a miracle happened. Suddenly I knew her spirit. I understood and knew of her love for her Father in Heaven and of his love for her.<br><br>That testimony meeting was one I will never forget, and when it was over I took a moment to tell the camp director all the good things I had experienced at camp that week. I was not, however, prepared for her reaction. There were tears in her eyes as she said, "Thank you so much. No one else has thanked me. I have been afraid that no one liked me because I have been so strict. But I am a convert and have never run a camp before. I have just tried to do my best." And then she hugged me.<br><br>Had a miracle just occurred? I think so. My heart had been softened just as night turns to day.<br><br><b>Rex: </b>As long as we can pray, there will be miracles in our lives. Personally, I have been the beneficiary of these miracles on several occasions. Let me tell you about two of them, involving two separate people. A few of you have heard me talk about each of them. Fewer of you have heard both, and none has heard the connection between the two of them that occurred to me in a very powerful way as we were preparing this talk.<br><br>As some of you know, in late June of 1987, we made a sudden and emotionally devastating discovery that I had a very fast-acting form of lymphoma that was in its final stage at the time we discovered it. The day before I left to take my treatments at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, I asked for a blessing from my home teacher, Rodger Galland, and my next-door neighbor and stake president, our new BYU president, Merrill Bateman. A couple of sentences that President Bateman pronounced during the course of his sealing the anointing will remain with me through this life and the next. His words were unequivocal. He said, "This disease will not take your life at this time. The Lord yet has other things for you to do in this life in the Church and in government, and you will recover and do them." It must have affected him as profoundly as it did me, because at a stake conference, while I was still at NIH and things were looking somewhat bleak, he told our entire stake how convinced he was that that blessing had come from the Lord and that I would live.<br><br>I want you to know that I had that same conviction. During my darkest hours at that hospital, when it seemed that nothing was going right, I would fall back on the words of that blessing and the surety with which my friend, my brother, and my ecclesiastical leader had pronounced them. This blessing by President Bateman, which I would put in the category of a miracle as we are discussing miracles today, also had another follow-up miracle in which the central figure was neither of my race nor of my religion. Her name is Juildeen Ford, one of my nurses at NIH<b>, </b>and she was as spiritually committed as she was professionally competent.<br><br>The most serious episode that I faced with infections during my stay at NIH occurred one night in the latter part of August, during the second cycle of chemotherapy, when Ms. Ford was on duty as the night nurse. I have very little recollection of that awful night, except for how terrible I felt and the fact that Ms. Ford seemed to be taking my temperature at unusually short intervals. Then I remember the great relief I felt when my fever broke and Ms. Ford, after having taken my temperature for the umpteenth time, said to me, "It's okay now, Mr. Lee. You're going to be all right." It wasn't until later that Janet told me what transpired that night from her perspective.<br><br><b>Janet: </b>After I left the hospital to be with our young daughter Christie, I continued to call back and check on Rex's condition, as I frequently did. As the night dragged on, his fever rose. But when I called Ms. Ford at four in the morning, she spoke with cheerful confidence. "He's all right now, Mrs. Lee. His fever has subsided. In fact, his temperature is almost normal. Let me tell you what happened. I knew that if his fever kept rising in his condition, his life would be in danger. And I also knew that we had done everything medically that could be done. So I went next door to the nurses' station, bowed my head, and prayed, 'Lord, this is too good a man to let die. Make his fever go down, and let him live.' Then I went back and took his temperature again. It had started to subside, and within an hour he was out of danger."<br><br><b>Rex: </b>And so, just as the miracle of the Atonement is followed years, centuries, and even millennia later by miraculous events in individual lives as a direct consequence of the Atonement; just as the miracle of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon continues to work other miracles through its effect on testimonies; so it was in my life that the miraculous pronouncement in June of 1987 by my dear friend and fellow priesthood holder was followed by another miracle in which the central character was completely unaware of what had happened 2,000 miles to the west three months previously. If it had not been for those two miracles, I might never have had the opportunity to know you and to serve as your president.<br><br><b>Janet: </b>As most of you are aware, however, Rex's story did not end in 1987. It is truly a miracle that he is alive today, and for that I cannot begin to express my appreciation. But since that first diagnosis and miraculous recovery, Rex and our family have received other disheartening news about his health. At times, I admit, I have wanted nothing more than to wake up in the morning and find that all of this has been a dream--and that Rex has been completely healed. That miracle has not been granted, but perhaps an even greater one has. Rex's life has been extended eight marvelous years, almost all of which have been spent on this campus with you. While we have been here, we have experienced miracles within miracles. I have learned from your example and your kindness to us as we have shared together in each other's joys and sorrows. I used to think that faith in God came in the form of feeling certain that life would be as I wanted it to be. I have grown to understand that to have ultimate faith in God is to know that he is with us and will give us unfailing strength to help us through life's challenges. Thank you for being part of our blessing and helping us learn this lesson.<br><br><b>Rex: </b>Being able to come back to BYU, first to the law school and then as your president, has been a miracle in my life. Many times I have written in my journal "My work at BYU is my salvation." So many times Janet and I have returned from a doctor's visit and plunged ourselves into a direct involvement with BYU that has provided a dimension and a perspective that we could not possibly have obtained from any other source. But even beyond any specific examples, the whole of our BYU presidency experience has been larger than the sum of its parts.<br><br>I have learned so many things from you--the students, the faculty, and the staff. I have learned from and been strengthened by great examples of courage and steadfast and determined devotion to eternal principles. I have learned how miracles, grand and small, occurring in one person's life can have profound, oftentimes unintended effects in other lives. Indeed, what we are steadily building here is itself a miracle: a place where we are committed to the concept of learning by study and learning by faith. And this in turn can work and has worked more individualized miracles for each of us.<br><br>Because of BYU I am today a better person than I was six and one-half years ago. I have a better appreciation of the things in life that are really important and of what I should do because of that understanding.<br><br>I look forward to continuing relationships with you and our university, though in a different context.<br><br><b>Janet: </b>Rex and I together with our family have benefited greatly from the lessons we have learned at BYU. It has been a time of unbelievable happiness, a happiness that will be with us always. Truly the world is our campus, and our experiences here have opened up new vistas of understanding for all of us. While here, we have become intimately acquainted with students and faculty, including those from other countries and cultures, giving our lives a richness we would not otherwise have known. Our appreciation of the arts and other disciplines has been fine-tuned as we have been blessed with your talents and knowledge. We have cheered with you at athletic events and enjoyed escape from worries. Along with you we have listened to prophets, seers, and revelators and other General Authorities as well as faculty members who have stood behind this podium, in the classroom, and in other places on this campus to inspire, lift, and teach us. Like you, we stand in awe as we enjoy the beautiful grounds and facilities maintained by those who dedicate their time and effort for the comfort and enjoyment of us all. We have benefited firsthand and have watched the behind-the-scenes dedication of efficient secretaries and other staff members who work tirelessly to make this great university run effectively. We have dealt with our own challenges with greater calm and acceptance as we have mingled with you and watched others with greater challenges than ours lift up their eyes to the miracles in our midst and carry on.<br><br>As we walk across campus, with Rex holding my arm for balance and support, we see others who struggle with more difficulty than we will ever know, and it heartens us to see your smiles and perseverance. Thank you all for everything you have given us.<br><br>I am thankful also to be a daughter of my Heavenly Father, for the miracle of life itself, for lessons learned through challenges, and for the love I know our Father in Heaven has for each of us individually. I bear testimony that he has sent his Only Begotten Son to redeem the world. I testify of the reality of the restored gospel and of its great miracle in our lives as we prepare ourselves for the eternities. I humbly pray to live more worthily of these many blessings. We leave with you an outpouring of our love and take with us your love.<br><br>Nearly seven years ago we saw our forthcoming time at BYU as a gift we could give for the miracle of life we had been given. Now, looking back, we have been the recipients of the gift and you at BYU the givers.<br><br><b>Rex: </b>And now, as the final words that you will hear me speak as your president, I want to leave with you my testimony of the restored gospel. I have not seen the angel Moroni nor the plates of which he was the custodian, nor was I a personal witness to other dramatic events of the Restoration, such as the First Vision or the restoration of the Aaronic and Melchizedek priesthoods. But I testify to you with just as much surety as if I had been there and personally had those experiences, they are real. This is not just another church. Joseph Smith was not just another great philosopher and wise man. He is literally a prophet of God, chosen by our Heavenly Father to be the instrument through whom the Lord has once again restored his gospel and ushered in this dispensation of the fullness of times. These, my brothers and sisters, are eternal truths that have eternal and enormous importance for us in our individual lives--a great miracle affecting everyone who ever lived, tied to more personalized miracles that I hope will play out in the lives of each of us.<br><br>Nearly 2,000 years ago, great miracles transpired with the birth of our Savior and the Atonement. Yet even today we bask in the blessings of those miracles with the promise of eternal life as they continue to work quieter miracles in the lives of all of us. Let us always remember the star shining so brightly above Jesus' birthplace--a star so very few ever saw. Let us not forget that to see a miracle, we must "Lift Up Our Eyes." That we may do so is my prayer and my testimony, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Rex E.
