<h1>ration of the Restored Church - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
This is an inspiring sight indeed, and especially when one realizes who you are. I think I have said before to audiences in this building that you are the most blessed people in the world because you are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and you are citizens of a country where you enjoy liberty and freedom and can choose as you wish. Most of you have been raised in homes where you have been able to gain a testimony of the gospel; and you are attending the greatest university in the world, where the teachings of Jesus Christ are taught to you.<br><br>As we just mentioned, I should have been here last month, but I had laryngitis and was not able to speak. I appreciated very much Elder Ashton's substituting for me. He is a much younger man and a better speaker, and he is certainly liked by the youth throughout the Church. He chose a very difficult subject, but by research and exaggeration he did much better than the subject deserves. It seems that though one does not feel worthy of compliments he enjoys them.<br><br>I am very glad to be here with you this evening, and do hope and pray that the Spirit and blessings of the Lord will attend us while I discuss the subject I have chosen. Before doing so, however, I am very happy, and always honored, to bring to you the greetings and blessings of President Kimball, the prophet of God. He loves the Lord's children and loses no opportunity to do what he can to help them, to bless them, and to assist them in preparing themselves for eternal life. It is a great privilege, opportunity, and blessing for me to be so closely associated with a prophet of God, and I join with him in wishing you the very best, and every success and happiness throughout the new year and always. Seeking first the kingdom of God and his righteousness will be of great help to you and assist you as you go forward in this program of working to gain eternal life.<br><br>What I hope to accomplish tonight is to help you understand and know that you belong to the church of Jesus Christ, which was founded on revelation and which still is directed by Jesus Christ through a prophet of God; and to let you see how the Church operates. Since this is a subject of great magnitude it will be necessary for me to deal with it rather sketchily and briefly.<br><br>I would remind you that, through revelation, we know that this earth was created for no other purpose than for you. For Eldon Tanner, for Dallin Oaks, for Mary Smith--and for each of you. Let us think of this in terms of individuals: the earth was created for<i>you</i>, that you might come to dwell here and prepare yourself through obedience to go back into the presence of our Heavenly Father. Jesus Christ, in the council in heaven, was chosen as the Savior of the world; and he came and gave his life willingly for us that we might enjoy eternal life. The Church as we have it today was established as a result of God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ appearing to that young boy, Joseph Smith; and from then on he was continually guided by revelation. We have the Book of Mormon--you know the story and I cannot take time to tell you about it--which was translated by revelation. The Aaronic Priesthood was restored by John the Baptist, and the Melchizedek Priesthood was restored by Peter, James, and John.<br><br>Regarding the establishment of the Church we read this:<br><br><i>The rise of the Church of</i>[Jesus]<i>Christ in these last days . . . by the will and commandments of God. . . .</i><br><br><i>Which commandments were given to Joseph Smith, Jun., who was called of God, and ordained an apostle of Jesus Christ, to be the first elder of this church.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 20:1–2]<br><br>We read further:<br><br><i>Behold, there shall be a record kept among you; and in it thou shalt be called a seer, a translator, a prophet, an apostle of Jesus Christ, an elder of the church through the will of God the Father, and the grace of your Lord Jesus Christ.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 21:1]<br><br>We often hear the Church referred to as a democracy when, in reality, instead of being a church where the body is governed by people elected as representatives, the Church is a theocracy where God directs his church through representatives chosen by him, as one of our Articles of Faith says: "We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy and by the laying on of hands, by those who are in authority to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof" (Article of Faith 5). That is the way in which Joseph Smith was chosen by the Lord as president of his church and set apart by those authorized by the Lord to do so.<br><br>It has always been a testimony to me, as I read the 107th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, to see how all offices of the priesthood were listed and the duties of each given to us. I should like to read a little more:<br><br><i>Of the Melchizedek Priesthood, three Presiding High Priests, chosen by the body, appointed and ordained to that office, and upheld by the confidence, faith, and prayer of the church, form a quorum of the</i>[First]<i>Presidency of the Church. . . .</i><br><br><i>And again, the duty of the President of the office of the High Priesthood is to preside over the whole church, and to be like unto Moses--</i><br><br><i>. . . Yea, to be a seer, a revelator, a translator, and a prophet, having all the gifts of God which he bestows upon the head of the church . . .</i>[D&amp;amp;C 107:22, 91–92]<br><br>And again:<br><br><i>The twelve traveling councilors are called to be the Twelve Apostles, or special witnesses of the name of Christ in all the world. . . .</i><br><br><i>And they form a quorum</i>[this is important]<i>equal in authority and power to the three presidents</i>[D&amp;amp;C 107:23–24]<br><br>The following is recorded in Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>President Smith next proceeded to explain the duty of the Twelve, and their authorities, which is next to the present Presidency . . . ; also the Twelve are not subject to any other than the First Presidency, viz., "myself," said the Prophet, "Sidney Rigdon, and Frederick G. Williams, who are now my Counselors, and where I am not</i>[meaning the President of the Church],<i>there is no First Presidency over the Twelve."</i>[Joseph Fielding Smith, compiler,<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</i>pp. 105–6]<br><br>At the death of Joseph Smith the Twelve became the presiding authority of the Church, with Brigham Young as president of the Twelve, and administered the affairs of the Church for three and a half years. Then Brigham Young was chosen as President of the Church, and he chose and ordained and set apart his counselors. Then there were three years and two months between his death and the installation of John Taylor as President of the Church. Following John Taylor's death it was one year and nine months before Wilford Woodruff was chosen, set apart, and ordained as President of the Church. Since then, just a few days have passed between the death of the President and the setting apart of the next President.<br><br>I would like to explain to you exactly what took place following the unexpected death of President Harold B. Lee on December 26, 1973. I was in Phoenix, Arizona, to spend Christmas with my daughter and her family when a call came to me from Arthur Haycock, secretary to President Lee. He said that President Lee was seriously ill, and he thought that I should plan to return home as soon as possible. A half-hour later he called and said: "The Lord has spoken. President Lee has been called home."<br><br>President Romney, who in my absence was directing the affairs of the Church, was at the hospital with President Spencer W. Kimball of the Council of the Twelve. Immediately upon President Lee's death President Romney turned to President Kimball and said, "You are in charge." Not one minute passed between the time President Lee died and the Twelve took over to preside over the Church.<br><br>Following President Lee's funeral, President Kimball called a meeting of the Apostles for Sunday, December 30, at 3 p.m. in the Salt Lake Temple council room. President Romney and I had taken our respective places of seniority in the Council, so there were fourteen of us present. Following a song, a prayer by President Romney, President Kimball, in deep humility, expressed his feelings to us. He said that he had spent Friday in the temple talking to the Lord, and had shed many tears as he prayed for guidance in assuming his new responsibilities and in choosing his counselors.<br><br>Dressed in our temple robes, we held a prayer circle; President Kimball asked me to conduct it and Elder Thomas S. Monson to offer the prayer. Following this, President Kimball explained the purpose of the meeting and called on each member of the Quorum in order of seniority, starting with Elder Ezra Taft Benson, to express his feelings as to whether the First Presidency should be organized that day or whether we should carry on as the Council of the Twelve. Each said, "We should organize now," and many complimentary things were spoken about President Kimball and his work with the Twelve.<br><br>Then Elder Ezra Taft Benson nominated Spencer W. Kimball to be the President of the Church. This was seconded by Elder Mark E. Petersen and unanimously approved. President Kimball then nominated his counselors: N. Eldon Tanner as first counselor, and Marion G. Romney as second, each of whom expressed willingness to accept the position and devote his whole time and energy in serving in that capacity. They were unanimously approved. Then Elder Mark E. Petersen, second in seniority in the Twelve, nominated Ezra Taft Benson as President of the Quorum of the Twelve. This was unanimously approved.<br><br>At this point all the members present laid their hands upon the head of Spencer W. Kimball, and President Ezra Taft Benson was voice in blessing, ordaining, and setting apart Spencer W. Kimball as the twelfth President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Then, with President Kimball as voice, N. Eldon Tanner was set apart as first counselor and Marion G. Romney as second counselor in the First Presidency of the Church. Following the same procedure, he pronounced the blessing and setting apart of Ezra Taft Benson as President of the Quorum of the Twelve.<br><br>There were then eleven members of the Twelve, and this would necessitate calling a new man to fill the vacancy in the Quorum. You may be interested to learn how the General Authorities are called. They are chosen by the President through inspiration and revelation as he considers the names of those who, at his invitation, have been recommended by members of the Twelve, together with those whom he might have been considering. Because of the inspiration and revelation involved, a General Authority is actually divinely appointed and is approved by the Council of the Twelve before being called and set apart.<br><br>I give you an example of how this works. Let me share with you an experience of President Heber J. Grant. While he was a member of the Council of the Twelve, when asked by the President of the Church to submit names, he repeatedly submitted that of a very good friend of his for consideration to fill existing vacancies among the Twelve. The man was never chosen, and President Grant is reported to have said at one time that if he ever became President of the Church and there was a vacancy to fill, he would call that man because he was so well qualified.<br><br>After he became President and it was necessary to fill a vacancy, he told the Lord that he knew whom<i>he</i>wanted, but that he wanted to select that man the Lord wanted and would like to have. The name of Melvin J. Ballard, whom President Grant knew slightly, but not too well, came into his mind and kept recurring to let him know that he was the man who should be called; and he was nominated by President Grant and approved by the Twelve.<br><br>So let me give you my own experience. While serving as president of the Calgary Stake in Alberta, Canada, I was attending the general conference in Salt Lake City in October, 1960. On Friday evening I received a call at the Hotel Utah, where I was staying, advising me that President McKay wanted to see me Saturday morning--the next morning. Naturally, not knowing what he wanted, I slept very little that night. I met him in his office at the appointed hour. As I sat in a chair facing him, he looked me in the eye, put his hand on my knee, and said, "President Tanner, the Lord would like you to accept a call as a General Authority, as an Assistant to the Twelve." Then he asked how I felt about it.<br><br>I do not know exactly what I said. I tried to assure him that I felt highly honored and very inadequate, but ready and willing to accept a call and to give my whole time and effort in the service of the Lord.<br><br>That morning my name was read, along with the names of Elders Franklin D. Richards and Theodore M. Burton, to be sustained as Assistants to the Twelve, with the other general officers of the Church. We were approved by the conference. Officers throughout the Church are selected in much the same way at their particular level.<br><br>At this point I might answer the question of how we deal with a dissenting vote. We had one at the October 1977 conference; some of you heard the proceedings and will remember that the dissenter wanted his vote recorded. This is the way we deal with a dissenting vote: all the people other than this one voted to sustain those who were presented, so I asked him to see Brother Hinckley. The purpose of asking him to see somebody is so that he can report why he was not prepared to support the slate of officers. That give him an opportunity, if he knows some good reasons why a person should not be or is not qualified to be sustained, to tell the person assigned to see him; this person can then advise the First Presidency.<br><br>I should like to tell you of an experience I had when I was called to go to New Zealand to reorganize a stake. I had never met anybody living in New Zealand other than the president of the stake at the time. I asked for a list of the bishops and high council in that New Zealand stake, and as I read over the list I saw one name that just seemed to stand out. The name was Campbell. Each time I read the list I noticed it. Bishop Vandenberg was with me, and we interviewed all these people, after having prayed that we might be guided.<br><br>After all the interviews I said to Brother Vandenberg, "Let us call upon the Lord for direction." We did, and as we stood up I asked, "If you had the responsibility, whom would you choose as president of this stake?"<br><br>He said, "Bill Campbell." I had never mentioned his name to Bishop Vandenberg. This was another evidence that the Lord does direct these appointments.<br><br>Now let me outline briefly some of the activities of the Twelve. The Council of the Twelve is responsible for all the ecclesiastical matters of the Church under the direction of the First Presidency. It has the responsibility of overseeing all the administration of the ecclesiastical affairs of the Church carried on by members of the First Quorum of the Seventy. It has the responsibility of scheduling stake conferences throughout the Church and making assignments of the General Authorities to attend these different conferences, which are held weekly throughout the year except in July.<br><br>All of the General Authorities strive diligently to prepare themselves and to use the programs provided for the Saturday evening meeting as well as the general session on Sunday so as to motivated the people throughout the Church to better living. They meet with the stake presidencies and the stake officers and discuss with them the progress they have made and ways and means of doing better. General Authorities are required to leave their families for at least two and sometimes three or four days to two weeks in order to fill conference assignments, tour missions, and so forth.<br><br>The Council of the Twelve also has the responsibility of planning seminars for new mission presidents and seminars once a year for the Regional Representatives. They are responsible for overseeing the work throughout the whole Church as it pertains to the ecclesiastical program. (As you will note, I later describe the work of the First Presidency does with the Twelve at their Thursday and other meetings.) The Twelve also meet regularly to hear the reports of the other General Authorities who have been out to stake conferences, and ways of improving the administration are discussed.<br><br>Before saying anything about the Seventy I should just like to repeat this to you. As the Church grew it was necessary to have assistance, and so it was decided to appoint some men as Assistants to the Twelve. Later, Regional Representatives of the Twelve were called who would be closer to the stake officers and could assist them directly.<br><br>It is interesting to note that it was in the 1970s that the Church had grown to a point where it was decided by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve to organize the First Quorum of the<i>Seventy.</i>At that time those who had been appointed as Assistants to the Twelve were ordained as Seventies and became members of the First Quorum of the Seventy.<br><br>More Regional Representatives were appointed, making it possible for the far-flung missions and stakes to have closer contact with those who had been chosen to assist in the administration of Church affairs. These Regional Representatives were men who had great experiences in administering the affairs of stakes, wards, and missions.<br><br>Now, regarding the Seventy we read: "The Seventy are to act in the name of the Lord, under the direction of the Twelve . . . , in building up the church and regulating all the affairs of the same in all nations" (D&amp;amp;C 107:34). May I read that again: "In building up the church and regulating<i>all</i>the affairs of the same in<i>all</i>nations." I shall say more about their responsibilities later.<br><br>The Patriarch to the Church gives blessings to members of the Church who may approach him for a blessing. As assigned from time to time, he also travels throughout the Church to give blessings in missions and areas where there are no patriarchs.<br><br>The members of the Presiding Bishopric of the Church are called, ordained, and set apart as any other General Authority except the President of the Church. Each member of the Presiding Bishopric may be called from any stake or mission in the Church. It is the duty of the Presiding Bishopric to preside over the temporal affairs of the Church as directed by the First Presidency.<br><br>I should like to explain to you how the Church is administered from headquarters. All matters pertaining to the administration of the Church come under the direction of the First Presidency, and the affairs are generally divided into three categories: First, those administered directly by the First Presidency; second, ecclesiastical matters administered by the Twelve under the direction of the First Presidency; and third, temporal affairs, as assigned to them, administered by the Presiding Bishopric under the direction of the First Presidency.<br><br>Let me list some of the things administered directly by the First Presidency: Area Conferences; Solemn Assemblies; Budgeting, Educational, Historical, and Personnel departments; temples; auditing; the Coordinating Council; and the Welfare Services.<br><br>Under the Twelve there are at present five departments. Each department is administered by two or three Seventies, under the direction of the Twelve, with their staffs. They are, namely: Priesthood, Missionary, Genealogical, Leadership Training, and the Correlation departments. I shall endeavor to deal very briefly with only two or three of the departments. The Priesthood Department determines policies and procedures and provides training materials, manuals, and handbooks for the Melchizedek Priesthood, the Aaronic Priesthood, and the auxiliaries; supervises activity programs; and is responsible for Church magazines.<br><br>The Correlation Department, with its staff, checks all materials for study courses and magazines as to doctrine, coding, and so forth, and reports to the Correlation Committee, made up of the executive directors of each of these four departments plus the executive director of Correlation, together with the Presiding Bishop and the Commissioner of Education. Here all teaching and training materials are correlated with the idea of preparing the individual for temple work, missionary work, and responsibilities in different organizations of the Church, and preparing him for eternal life. This is the whole purpose of the Church, to prepare the individual for eternal life.<br><br>The Missionary Department provides missionary proselyting materials for preparing prospective missionaries and for use in the field, makes missionary assignments, and oversees the operation of visitors centers and other matters pertaining to the missionary program.<br><br>You may be interested in knowing how a missionary is called. A bishop should interview the prospective missionary before he talks to the parents about it so that he can determine the attitude and worthiness of the individual before anyone knows he or she is being considered. If he finds the person worthy and desirous of filling a mission, he discusses it with the parents; and then, if everything is in order, the bishop recommends him or her to the stake president, who also interviews the individual as to worthiness and attitude. If found worthy and willing, he or she is recommended to the First Presidency.<br><br>In determining where he or she should be called to fill a mission, several factors are taken into consideration, such as the person's aptitudes as shown on the recommendation form and the missions which need missionaries at that time; and then, through inspiration, the person is called to the mission where he or she can best serve the Lord. He or she then receives a call from the President of the Church, and on receipt of the call each missionary is required to send a letter of response to the President.<br><br>I am reminded of a story about a missionary call which you may find of interest and which shows how the inspiration of the Lord directs this work. I could give you a dozen. But on one occasion, after the letters of call had been sent to a group of missionaries, the executive secretary of the Missionary Department received a telephone call from the mother of a boy who had received an assignment to a mission in the eastern part of the United States. The mother said that she and the father of the boy were extremely disappointed because the boy's father and grandfather had served missions in Germany, and they had expressed their desires that the boy also be called to a German mission.<br><br>The secretary asked the mother how the boy felt about it, and she replied that he was at school and that she had opened the letter in his absence. He did not yet know where he was to be called. The secretary expressed his surprise that the mother would open the only letter the boy might ever receive from the President of the Church and suggested that she call him back after the boy had read the letter.<br><br>The following day the mother called back most apologetically and said that the boy's reaction was one of complete satisfaction with the call. He had secretly been praying that he would<i>not</i>be called to a foreign mission.<br><br>Now regarding what we call decentralization: The great growth and expansion of the Church throughout the world has necessitated decentralization of administration, especially for the organizing and training of the members of the Church in developing areas--that is, where the Church is going forward in new areas. There are new branches, districts, wards, and stakes, comprised mostly of members who have had little if any experience in the administration of Church affairs. For example, in Caracas, Venezuela, which I visited about two years ago, the mission president called a meeting of the members. There were three of four hundred in attendance, none of whom had been in the Church longer than five years. Last year we organized a stake in Caracas, with the oldest member being in the Church only seven years. I am sure it is evident to everyone that much training and assistance must be given to this kind of organization in these developing areas.<br><br>To give you an idea of the growth in the Church from 1960 to 1976--that is, in the time that I have been a General Authority--the population more than doubled in those years. Outside the United States and Canada our membership has increased by 397 percent. In the last six years ward organizations outside the United States and Canada have increased from 278 to 892, and stake organizations from 48 to 143. Statistics as of September 1977 show the following totals: we have 862 stakes; 5,648 wards; 1,495 independent branches in stakes; 158 missions; and over 24,000 missionaries.<br><br>In order to meet and cope with our responsibilities, the world has been divided into zones and areas, presided over by Zone Advisers and Area Supervisors. Five of these zones and twelve areas are outside of the United States. All Zone Advisers and Area Supervisors, both in the United States and outside, are members of the First Quorum of the Seventy. The Zone Advisers of all zones throughout the world remain in headquarters. Each Area Supervisor outside of the United States and Canada is assigned to live within his area.<br><br>Area Supervisors are over the Regional Representatives, who are made up, as I said, of experienced, qualified men chosen, where possible, from and living as near to the region as possible. Each Regional Representative works with several stakes and missions. This makes it possible for the leaders in the stakes and missions to be in close contact regularly with the Area Supervisors through the Regional Representatives, rather than to have to deal directly with headquarters in Salt Lake City; and the Area Supervisor is able to respond to and deal with many of the problems that need immediate attention. By this means much training and assistance can be given on the local level. The Area Supervisors report to the Zone Advisers, who in turn report to the Council of the Twelve.<br><br>Now, let us deal with the administration of the Presiding Bishopric. As I pointed out before, they are responsible for the administration of all the temporal affairs assigned to them by the First Presidency. This includes physical facilities, where they act as a service department to acquire land and to build and maintain buildings as required by the Ecclesiastical Division. They also supervise matters pertaining to finance, membership records, fast offerings, tithing, central purchasing, translation, and distribution. Then they have the heavy responsibility of directing the Welfare Services Department, whose vital program and policies are determined by the Welfare Services Committee comprise of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, the Presiding Bishopric, and the Relief Society Presidency. Included in the Welfare Services program are the Deseret Industries operations throughout the world; stake, ward, and mission welfare programs; bishops storehouses; and so on.<br><br>In order to administer these things outside the United States and Canada there are Presiding Bishopric Area Supervisors, who supervise these matters in the areas where they are assigned to live and over which they are responsible for the administration of the temporal affairs. Again, this makes it possible for the local people to get immediate attention for their problems, and provides proper training in all areas of administration. General Authority and Presiding Bishopric area supervisors cooperate fully in all matters.<br><br>We come now to the First Presidency, who meet every Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday at 8 a.m. with a secretary who makes a complete record of all procedures. Their discussions include the correspondence which has been addressed to the First Presidency--which contains almost everything from questions about pierced ears to appeals from decisions of excommunication by the stake presidency and high council. There are questions about dress and grooming standards, hypnotism, Sabbath observance, scripture interpretation, sensitivity training, sealings, complaints against the local officers, reincarnation, donation of body parts to science or to others, cremation, transplants, legal matters, ad infinitum.<br><br>Besides these there are many other matters that need attention, such as the selection of new temple presidencies and decisions regarding when and where new temples should be built, and other matters to be discussed when meeting with the Council of the Twelve or the Presiding Bishopric. They also plan for the area conferences held throughout the world, and also solemn assemblies.<br><br>Tuesday morning at 10 a.m. they meet with the Expenditures Committee, which is made up of the First Presidency, four members of the Twelve, and the Presiding Bishopric, where heads of different departments present their expenditure requirements for consideration, and allocations are made. Examples include requests by the Physical Facilities Department for acquisition of lands and of buildings such as stake or ward houses, mission homes, visitors centers, and so on, and discussion of costs of maintenance. Also, the Presiding Bishopric presents requests for expenditures involving welfare projects.<br><br>Wednesday First Presidency meetings are used for hearing reports from heads of different departments that come directly under the First Presidency, such as the Historical, Personnel, and Public Communications departments. Appointments for important visitors are also scheduled for Wednesday mornings where possible. I am always impressed by the influence of the President of the Church has on these visitors as we receive direct and indirect feedback through correspondence or verbal reports.<br><br>Once a month on Wednesdays the First Presidency meets with the Combined Church Board of Education and Board of Trustees to deal with all matters affecting universities and colleges, institutes and seminaries, and other Church schools. Also on one Wednesday each month they meet with the Coordinating Council, which is composed of the First Presidency, Quorum of the Twelve, and Presiding Bishopric. There they discuss and decide on policies, procedures, and questions of administration to see that all divisions of responsibility are properly clarified and coordinated. Following this, they meet with the Welfare Services Committee, as mentioned previously.<br><br>On Thursday mornings at 10 a.m. they join with the Council of the Twelve in the upper room of the temple, where the Twelve have been convened since 8 a.m. It is in this room that the leadership of the Church has been directed by the Lord since the temple was completed. Here one experiences a special spiritual feeling, and at times senses the presence of some of these great leaders who have gone on before. Portraits of the twelve Presidents of the Church, and also of Hyrum, the Patriarch, hang on the walls. There are also paintings of the Savior at the Sea of Galilee where he called some of his apostles, and others portraying his crucifixion and his ascension. Here we are reminded of the many great leaders who have sat in this council room, and under the direction of the Lord great decisions were made.<br><br>As the First Presidency enters this room at ten o'clock on Thursday mornings, we shake hands with all members of the Twelve, then change to our temple robes. We sing, kneel in prayer, and then join in a prayer circle at the altar, after which we change to our street clothes.<br><br>After discussing the minutes of the previous meeting, we consider such matters as the following: approval of changes in bishoprics as recommended by stake presidents--previously discussed in the meeting of the Twelve (you might be interested in knowing that during 1977 we approved an average of twenty-five to thirty new bishops every week); changes in stake, ward, mission, and temple organizations throughout the Church, including boundaries and officers; officers and administration of auxiliary organizations; matters brought in by the heads of different departments and our reports of stake conferences and other activities during the week, such as funerals, speaking engagements, and so forth. It is in this body that any change in administration or policy is considered and approved, and it then becomes the official policy of the Church. Let me relate an experience regarding these discussions.<br><br>I remember so well when a matter was being discussed where different members of the Twelve had differing views and expressed them freely. When President McKay summed up the discussion and said, "This is what I think we should do," I turned to the brother next to me and said:<br><br>"Isn't it wonderful to see how he always comes up with the right answer, and we all seem to feel that it is the right answer?"<br><br>My colleague turned to me and said, "You are listening to a prophet of God." This is how we know that any decision that is made becomes the unanimous decision of the group, regardless of the feeling of any member prior to the decision.<br><br>On the first Thursday of every month the First Presidency meets with all the General Authorities--the members of the Twelve, the Patriarch to the Church, the Seventy, and the Presiding Bishopric. In this meeting all are advised of any changes in programs or procedures and instructed in their duties or responsibilities. The President calls on members to bear their testimony, after which we all dress in our temple clothes, partake of the sacrament, and have a prayer circle with all members present participating. At the conclusion of the prayer all, other than the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve, are dismissed, and those remaining change to their street clothes and carry on with the regular business of the Thursday meetings. A recording secretary makes a report of all that is said and done.<br><br>Following each Thursday meeting the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve have lunch in a room assigned for that purpose. In this room we have a lovely picture of the Last Supper. This is a period of relaxation, and in conversation we exchange experiences and discuss matters of common interest. I could tell you some interesting discussions if I had time.<br><br>Friday at 9 a.m. the Presiding Bishopric meets with the First Presidency to give reports and discuss matters affecting the administration.<br><br>As you know, the Church has business corporations such as the Bonneville International Corporation, Beneficial Life Insurance Company, Hotel Utah, Zion Securities Corporation,<i>Deseret News</i>, and Deseret Mutual Benefit Association, operating in the interest of the Church and giving service to the public. Some have the erroneous idea that the Church pays no taxes. I would like to correct that impression and say that all Church-owned corporations pay taxes at the same rate as any other comparable corporation.<br><br>We hope and pray always--every day--that the Church is being administered as the Lord would have it administered by those who are placed in their responsible positions--the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, the Patriarch to the Church, the First Quorum of the Seventy, and the Presiding Bishopric--and that the local officers may also be so blessed and directed. I bear testimony that the Church is directed by the Lord himself through a prophet of God and pray humbly that we may all appreciate that, appreciate our membership in the Church, and strive diligently to prepare ourselves for eternal life. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>N.

<h1>of Christmas - Marion D. Hanks - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am very honored to be traveling today with Elder Kikuchi, who is at Church headquarters, becoming better acquainted with his work across the world before he returns to his home and family in Tokyo and to whatever assignment he will then receive. He is a wonderful, choice, special servant of the Lord, and it will be a happy day when you get to know him a little better and feel the warmth and strength of his spirit. We are honored that he would come with us today as part of his introduction to the big frightening world of being a General Authority.<br><br>I had you in mind a week ago today as I spoke to a group of professional Scouters in New Orleans. I repeated for them a conversation I had read between an interviewer and one of the professional hockey players for the Detroit Red Wings. The interviewer's question was, "Are those hockey fights we see fake?"<br><br>The answer was, "If they were fake, you would see me in a lot more of them."<br><br>I thought of you in this way: If a lot of the meetings we held were fake, or if the purposes for them were fake, you would see me in a lot<i>fewer</i>of them. I just returned a few hours ago from Guatemala, where I spent the last four days, and I bring you greetings. You may have come from there or have been there or may be on your way there. The people there are waiting for you. The Church is growing, the spirit of the people is wonderful, and the leadership excellent--all portends a marvelous future for many of the choice children of God.<br><br>Some things haven't changed. The airplane left three hours late. There is still a little bit of a quiet attitude toward time in Latin America, but there is no lack of spirit or lack of love or lack of fine work going on.<br><br>The magnificent music introducing this devotional today is a proper setting for the theme I want to talk about. It would seem to some that such music might be seasonally confined. I'm grateful it's not, because my theme may be thought similarly incapacitated. But Idon't think so.<br><br>Let me begin by quoting some lines from Shakespeare's<i>Julius Caesar.</i>Brutus and Cassius and associates have killed Caesar. Mark Antony's oration has been completed and his concluding remark made: "Now let it work" (act 3, scene 2, line 260). He had set the mischief afoot that in his mind would avenge Caesar's death.<br><br>You know well, I suppose, the sequence of events: The battle is waged between Octavius, Caesar, and Antony on one side and Cassius and Brutus and their armies on the other. Cassius is misled into thinking that the battle is lost and takes his own life. Brutus, coming on the scene from the battle, where he had actually been prevailing over the armies of Octavius, sees Cassius dead and says:<br><br><i>Friends, I owe more tears</i><br><i>To this dead man than you shall see me pay.</i><br><i>I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.</i><br>[Act 5, scene 3, lines 101–3]<br><br>We've just been through a season celebrating the birth, the life, and the mission of another more important King who was also slain by conspirators. Have we ourselves found the time to shed tears in contemplation of Him andHis life and love and gift?<br><br>I've been wondering what the season may have brought to you, what happened to you, and if anything very special occurred. I wonder what you may have learned or renewed or intensified of conviction.<br><br>I thought I might share the experience I had this past Christmas because, while it involved much that was old and warm and wonderful and comfortable and traditional, it also brought some new and real and lovely and tearful and wonderful times.<br><br>I was reminded this Christmas of the three basic relationships that have to be right for life to be good and for our contributions to be adequate for what the Lord expects of us. Those three relationships were specifically taught by the Lord Himself. His first commandment was to love God with everything we have--heart, might, mind, and strength. The second commandment like unto it invites us to love our neighbor as ourselves. On these two laws--these two commandments, these two principles of eternal validity--all else rests, all else hangs (see Matthew 22:37–40).<br><br>Paul knew that. Paul was trying to teach these principles of love to Timothy, his young brother--just as I testify to you young brethren and sisters today--when he wrote these words: "The end of the commandment [as I understand it, the consequence of obeying God's commandments] is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned" (1 Timothy 1:5). Rearrange those just a little and you'll see that he is saying exactly what the Lord taught us: faith in God and charity out of a pure heart for our fellowmen and out of a good conscience will produce the pure heart or spring from it. These are the basics, these are the relationships, these are the indispensables of love. Let me talk a little of this if I may.<br><br>What of the first relationship of love, our responsibility and the possibility of loving ourselves? We know ourselves so well, you and I, that we find that commandment difficult to really comprehend and accept as it is invited to our attention. Love God and love your neighbor as you love yourself. Well, to begin to love ourselves, we must know that God loves us and that we are His. There are mentioned in the 26th chapter of 2 Nephi the basic commandments taught to Moses on Mount Sinai and the account of their having been broken bythe people. Then there are these words:<br><br><i>For none of these iniquities come of the Lord; for he doeth that which is good among the children of men; and he doeth nothing save it be plain unto the children of men; and he inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile.</i>[2 Nephi 26:33]<br><br>The meaning seems plain. God really does love His children, even His disobedient children.<br><br>I once sat across the desk from a beautiful young lady whose story I do not wish to repeat here in any detail. I will simply say that her life had been very seriously damaged by sin and sorrow of a major kind. She had given up, surrendered, cut herself off from her future, and thought there was nothing at all left for her here or hereafter; and yet, she was living. Again, the details of the story would enhance the impression of her despair, but I will give you only the end. We had talked for a long time. I had tried the best I could by referring to the Bible, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Book of Mormon to teach her the principle of repentance and to talk of God's love for her. I had read the verse I have just read to you and knew that I was not reaching her, that the interview was about over, and that she would pass on to the same terror and tragedy she then had in her heart. She had no hope, no future, no real belief that God would ever have anything more to do with her. Then I read some words from 2 Nephi, chapter 10, to which I invite your prayerful attention:<br><br><i>Seeing that our merciful God has given us so great knowledge concerning these things, let us remember him, and lay aside our sins, and not hang down our heads, for we are not cast off.</i>[2 Nephi 10:20]<br><br>We read another line from this marvelous book, which we are learning over the years to begin to appreciate. This excerpt from the last communication between a great father and a choice son expresses the father's deepest, sweetest, and warmest convictions about Christ:<br><br><i>My son, be faithful in Christ; and may not the things which I have written grieve thee, to weigh thee down unto death; but may Christ lift thee up, and may his sufferings and death, and the showing his body unto our fathers, and his mercy and long-suffering, and the hope of his glory and of eternal life, rest in your mind forever.</i>[Moroni 9:25]<br><br>Let not the things, the message, the mission, the gift of Christ weigh you down and grieve you, but may He lift you up and make you aware of all the warm, wonderful blessings available to you. Let them rest in your mind.<br><br>After reading this scripture to the young woman, I saw curtains part that had been closed tight. Tears came to her eyes, her heart opened, conviction entered, and repentance poured out as she began to understand the power of forgiveness. I wish every person in the world could have heard her words, because at some point everyone needs to hear them. She said, "I know I will still be lonely sometimes, but I will never feel alone again." Sure, you'll be lonely too sometimes, but you need never feel alone. God does love His children.<br><br>Just this weekend I read in a book--to which I hope to make brief reference before I'm through--a statement about life's injustices. Ithought of the Apostle Paul, a very brilliant man, who knew quite a lot of this world's injustices. He knew its imponderables, he knew its miseries and inequities, and he knew its inhumanity. Yet it was Paul, with that background and knowledge and experience, who said to the Romans:<br><br><i>The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:</i><br><br><i>And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ.</i>[Romans 8:16–17]<br><br>He also said we are the offspring of God, and he said much more. Well, Paul knew problems enough and ultimately lost his own life in the cause of the Lord. But Paul knew what each of us must know: that God is our Father and really loves us. And so, because we know who we are and care about what happens to us, we can love ourselves. The love we are commanded to have for ourselves, the self-esteem we must have to be happy, is not and cannot be based on perfection. It comes as we realize who we are and to whom we belong as we recognize our limitations, our sins, our ignorance, and our need for His love and mercy; as we learn His word and feel His spirit and understand His fatherhood and His loving-kindness; and as we keep His commandments. Then we may make the transition. Then we can love ourselves--not in the arrogance God could not brook or in the pride He commands against, but in a sense of self-reverence and self-knowledge, because we know to whom we belong. With that esteem for ourselves, that love, then we can reach out to our neighbor. Only then can we really love our neighbor, I believe. There will be no confusion, and we will not condition our love for him on his perfection. We will love him because we know who he is and care about the quality of his eternal experience. We'll strip off the facade, the veneer--that "muddy vesture of decay" the bard spoke of--and see each other at heart level and do what we can to qualify as a neighbor to our neighbor (Shakespeare,<i>The Merchant of Venice,</i>act 5, scene 1, line 64).<br><br>The Lord knew our need to have an attitude toward and relationships with others that are good and wholesome. I love what He said to the scribes and Pharisees, and I suspect you are acquainted with His words. We know that we must keep all, even the smallest commandment, but He Himself qualified some things as weightier than others:<br><br><i>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin</i>[herbs and plants of the time],<i>and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith.</i>[Matthew 23:23]<br><br>These he interpreted at a length to which I cannot go today, but I call your attention to something Christmas reinforced for me. I have thought over the years that<i>judgment</i>may have meant<i>justice,</i>that we must be just and merciful and confident in God and just and merciful and confident with each other. But I began to think during Christmastime about the way we live, the thoughts we invite or make welcome, our personal choices, our priorities, our loyalties, our loves, and the use of our time. And it occurred to me that He is talking about judgment--good judgment, quiet judgment, slow judgment, compassionate judgment, righteous judgment, fair judgment, merciful judgment. The scriptures give us many examples. But I offer this suggestion: He expects us not to judge each other--for we are told with what judgment we judge so shall we be judged--butin our judgments to be all those things He would wish us to be to our brother.<br><br>What of mercy? This is the subject of a wonderful consideration. I offer you only the great example that has touched my heart and my mind all my life: the example of the man left at the wayside beaten by robbers. This man was passed by some who might be thought willing to help and was helped by one who was not ethnically acceptable to the Jews. The Samaritan stopped to help, did all that could ever be expected, and much more. And the Savior ended that marvelous story by asking which of these travelers you would say was neighbor to that man. The answer: "He that shewed mercy on him" (Luke 10:37). Mercy was interpreted by the Lord to mean a sense of relationship, response, compassion, benevolence, graciousness, and neighborliness to our brother, whoever he is, whatever his need.<br><br>Oh, we love at our house at Christmas that marvelous 25th chapter of Matthew, which talks about the hungry and the thirsty and the naked, about he who is homeless and they who may be in prison or ill, and about the blessings given to those who help such people. The Lord interpreted mercy as He interpreted love. Well, to finish this brief discussion of our relationship with others, note that the apostle and the Lord talked of faith, that confidence that we have in our Father and in His Son.<br><br>I have the feeling that I have mentioned this story here before, and there may be some of you who remember it. If so, it will be better for you. This is another story of which I may share only the headline. It is the story of a beautiful soul in a misshapen body. Her children may be here; conceivably she may be as well. She lives in this vicinity. I will only tell you that my wife and I came across her as she received an award for helping the handicapped. She who from the moment of her birth had suffered such a serious lack of normal blessings physically, she with the great heart, the great spirit, the great soul--she received the award given to one who had helped the handicapped.<br><br>In accepting the award, she recalled the day when she'd run home from school crying because thoughtless, careless children had called her hunchback, froggy, and other names. Her great father had held her in his arms and then rocked her on his knee and wept with her. He told her the importance of this day in her whole life, saying to her, "Elaine, today you decide: your life can be all that God intends it to be. The boys and girls, when they called you those names, were in a sense telling the truth. You do have a hump on your back, and you have other problems that have made your life miserable physically. But Elaine, Heavenly Father knew that as you were forming in your mother, and He sent a beautiful, special spirit, one that could handle the problems this little body would have to handle. What was said about you is in a sense true, but it wasn't fair; it wasn't kind. If all your life you will be more fair and more kind to others than a few of them will sometimes be to you, then you'll have a happy, warm, full, fruitful life like God intended."<br><br>And at that awards ceremony, that beautiful little soul who stood there with an oxygen tank behind her attached to her nostrils, who had to be helped to the platform from the hospital where she had been, bore her testimony of humanity and of her love for God and her fellowman. She said, "The only real justification I have for receiving this award is that I can say to you in honesty that all my life I have tried to be more fair and more kind to others than a few of them have sometimes been to me."<br><br>Well, I want to spend a few minutes bearing testimony of this third relationship I thought about at Christmas: this relationship we have with God.<br><br>Christ started with the commandment to love God and then added that you should love your neighbor as yourself. But we get a feeling that the sequence isn't all that clear. If we cannot regard ourselves with esteem and respect, lacking the perfections we do but knowing who we are and that we really care and are making an effort, then the chances of our reaching out to a neighbor, who is also imperfect, seem small, and then the chances of our reaching out to the God who made us all and loves us all may be small. They all go together.<br><br>I read this week on the airplane a book, which I have in my hands, by Loren Eiseley. It's his autobiography. I could use words like<i>eminent</i>and<i>brilliant</i>and<i>great</i>and all the rest to describe him, but I'll only say that he is an anthropologist, a naturalist, and a writer. He is also an evolutionist, one who believes sincerely in the theories of organic evolution that men have developed. And as one of the most wise and sensitive among men in his profession, he is a good and strong witness.<br><br>I've come today not to discuss theories of evolution but to share just one theme that runs throughout Loren Eiseley's book and then concludes it. I plead with you to listen. It may save your life to listen.<br><br><i>I have come to believe that in the world there is nothing to explain the world. Nothing in nature that can separate the existent from the potential. ... Biological scientists, however, are involved by necessity in the explanation of life. In the end many are forced into metaphysical positions which reflect their own temperamental bent.</i>[Loren Eiseley,<i>All the Strange Hours: The Excavation of a Life</i>(New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1975), 245–46]<br><br>I read only a few sentences and intend only to extract from those few sentences their implication and meaning. I neither defend nor question what he is saying--I just read it. Talking a little of scientific dilemma, he says:<br><br><i>Between these extremes we all flounder, choosing to close our eyes to ultimate questions and proceeding, instead, with classification and experiment.</i>[Eiseley,<i>Strange Hours,</i>246]<br><br>And then he talks about the great sphex wasps, which have an incredible--literally incredible--capacity to do things they have never seen done in a way that is so magnificently complex that they must learn how to do it in some way that we don't understand. And Eiseley traces the marvelous way in which an adult sphex wasp, a mother, finds the quarry and stuns it without killing it, knowing the way to do that with her own weapon. She then puts that quarry in the nest it has dug under the ground and lays her egg in the quarry, which remains alive but insensate, and the newborn wasp eats the food that has been provided without killing the host until its own strength is adequate. The newborn wasp then exits its tomb and begins its life, possessed somehow with the specific capacity to do what its predecessor has done.<br><br>Eiseley quotes Henri Fabre:<br><br><i>"It is not in chance that we will find the key to such harmonies." "The man grappling with reality," he concludes, "fails to find a serious explanation of anything whatsoever that he sees."</i>[In Eiseley,<i>Strange Hours,</i>248]<br><br>There is so much here that is marvelous. What it really is, is a testimony of humility. Eiseley finishes with a line that I'll share:<br><br><i>I had spent a lifetime exploring questions for which I no longer pretended to have answers, or to fully accept the answers of others. I was slowly growing as insubstantial as the sunlight on this hillside. I could not account for myself any more than I could validate in material terms the strange anatomical charts that slept, for now inactivated, in the tombs beneath my feet.</i>[Eiseley,<i>Strange Hours,</i>253]<br><br>Now that obviously required some rereading and thought. Loren Eiseley says that having spent a lifetime doing wonderful scholarship, he has discovered that many of the answers are beyond the finiteness of this earth--not that he has turned against scholarship, not that he discounts all that he and others have tried to discover, but simply that the answers are not all there.<br><br>Let me conclude in these few moments with one of those answers that I am so prayerfully anxious to share with you. This letter came at Christmastime. I would not for anything betray a confidence this letter so warmly shares. I will simply tell you that the person who wrote it is a graduate of this institution. He writes from prison, where he is in the ward for very serious consequential crime--sin also. He has lost it all. He is brilliant and lettered, and his name can be read here and there. He has done very well in the world. He is very young. Everything was ahead of him, and then this act or series of acts took away his own conscience and his freedom. His sins alienated him then from others and ultimately from God, from the Church, and from the things so dear and precious. Now he writes from a prison, and I share some of what he writes with you. I plead with you to listen with your hearts and your heads to these few sentences. He talks of a happy situation inside this unbelievably tragic place. He himself has been given an assignment that permits him to help others. What all this represents is a miracle. I can put no other label on it.<br><br><i>I've had a job that has allowed me to keep my mind active. I have won the respect of people who trust me. The tears come frequently, but in my setting I can let them. I have a room not unlike a college dormitory. It is private. There I can let the emotions vent, can pray, study, write, and weep. The time is tortuous nonetheless, but not beyond my capacities because compensatory blessings were granted. I do not understand all of this, but I am grateful.</i><br><br>He mentions a person who has helped him. I can only pick out a line or two of this marvelous paragraph: "She knows me and accepts me. I feel better about myself than in all my life. She has helped to heal me. For the first time my spirit feels free to be itself." She has had a difficult life, too. He tells of a position she has which permits her to express her great heart to those who are seriously handicapped. And this is his final paragraph--again, it might save your life. "She has made adversity turn to advantage," he writes. He then goes on:<br><br><i>Perhaps it is this last thought that expresses the most forceful image I have of Christ. He took the curse of adversity and made it the blessing of advantage. I see Him on the cross, blessing the thief, forgiving the murderers of His own life. I read over and over about the difficulties and the costs of His associating with the poor and the outcasts and of His love for them. Peter was right. Christ did go and preach to the spirits in prison. What else might we expect Him to do?</i><br><br>Then he refers to Paul's descriptions in the first chapter of Romans of the absolute decadence of that time and says, "That's how it is in this prison. It's an exact picture of my surroundings and the nature of man openly fallen." So much of what he then goes on to say about the fallen state of all men, even those not condemned under the law, is so appropriate. He is quoting scripture and interlarding it with his own comments:<br><br><i>There is none righteous--no, not one. There is none that understand it, and the operation of the law is so that all the world may become guilty before God. And that is the crux of my problem. Righteousness and relief from guilt cannot come from my punishment or the functioning of the law. By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in His sight. But while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</i>[See Romans 3]<br><br>Don't misunderstand his last words. They are a testimony of the highest quality of the truthfulness of what we have been taught in these days through the prophets of God. They need to be carefully considered.<br><br><i>When I understood the grace of Christ, I experienced that grace, that great sense of forgiveness. So much remains to be done--so much restitution that I hope I will be allowed to make. But I won't have to buy into any more guilt trips. There will always be sorrow for my mistakes. There will always be heartbreak. There may never be forgiveness by others I have hurt. But I don't have to beat myself into mental illness. "Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound"</i>[Romans 5:20],<i>and I am humbled by the grace which He has given me. I who was so full of insecurities and false pride--I who felt superior to others--now know my true worth and am no longer afraid. I have lost my life but found it.</i><br><br>God bless you as I earnestly pray He will bless me and mine. I pray that we may have a sense of the mission and meaning, the measure of the gift, and the beauty of the love of the Lord. I pray that we may use this knowledge to fulfill the expectations the Lord has clearly put before us: to love God with everything we have, to love our neighbor as ourselves. We can only do that by obeying His law, having confidence in Him, repenting of our sins, obeying His commandments, walking by the Spirit, and enduring the injustices of this world and its iniquities with faith.<br><br>I bear witness to you that I learned a few things during the holidays, more deeply than I ever learned them before, and they are the simple things that I have thought I understood all my life. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i><i>Marion D.

<br>
<br>
My dear fellow students, it is always a pleasant occasion to come to Brigham Young University. But it is likewise an awesome responsibility. For that reason I am grateful for that beautiful prayer by Brother Turner and pray with you that it will be fulfilled in our behalf.<br><br>Some of you may remember the 1970 space flight of Apollo 13. It was to be man's third landing on the moon. The launching was perfect, the first 205,000 miles of flight flawless. Then, on the evening of the third day, Jack Swigert's voice suddenly crackled into the mission spacecraft center in Houston: "Hey, we've got a problem here." What had been an almost boring trip was instantly transformed into a frantic struggle to rescue the three astronauts from the prospect of a death no man had experienced before--death while drifting endlessly in space.<br><br>As the tense drama unfolded, it was learned that one of the two essential oxygen tanks in the service module had exploded. A leak from the other tank showed on the spaceship's dials. Clearly they were in trouble. These tanks supplied not only the critical oxygen but power and water as well. And now they had only a limited supply.<br><br>As soon as mission control in Houston was advised, everyone went into action. They mounted a massive rescue operation involving at least 10,000 people. The landing on the moon was aborted; the total effort now was to return the crew safely to the earth. You probably recall the rest of the story. You may even have been part of the largest television audience in history as it watched Apollo 13's final descent. Out of the scores of evaluations made on the whole experience, there was agreement on one point: The crew was rescued because they<i>received</i>constant direction from mission control at Houston and<i>followed</i>that direction.<br><br>In many respects, their experience is like your journey through life. A wise Father has launched you on your earthly journey. He has provided most of the essentials for the trip, though some of them are in limited supply. Like those astronauts, your ultimate goal is to get back where you came from, and in the process you have a mission to perform. You face some challenging times, all right. Sometimes you get yourselves into trouble. When that happens, you have to change your course and get back on the right track; we call that process repentance. Repentance simply means changing your course and getting back on the path.<br><br>Signals from your "mission control headquarters" are always coming through. Whether or not you are able to receive them depends on the condition of your "receiving sets." As you students take your journey on your own, keep your "receiving sets" in good condition. There are laws that govern your ability to receive the signals. You need to understand the operation of law in your life.<br><br>There are many laws; for example, there is Murphy's Law. I am sure you are all acquainted with that: "If anything can go wrong, it will." Then there is O'Toole's Commentary on Murphy's Law; he said, "Murphy was an optimist." There is also the law of gravity. You understand that, but perhaps you are not aware of Murgatroyd's Observation on the law of gravity--that "any object will fall so as to cause the most damage." Jenning's Commentary on Murgatroyd's Observation is that "the chance of bread falling with the buttered side down is directly proportional to the cost of the carpet."<br><br>While I do not deny the operation of such "laws," I want to put into better perspective some of God's laws.<br><br>For your journey through life, one of the first things you need to know is:<br><br><i>There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated--</i><br><br><i>And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:20–21]<br><br>I want to repeat that. "There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of the world, upon which all blessings are predicated--and when we obtain any blessings from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated."<br><br>Ponder that thought. This great revelation did not evolve from man's reason; it was revealed from heaven. It sets forth unmistakably the fact that there are principles upon which promises are predicated, and that obedience is the key to receiving blessings. This revelation gives you "knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come" (D&amp;amp;C 93:24). In other words, it is truth. Perhaps the operation of this law can best be seen in the account of God's relationship with the people of the Book of Mormon. Numerous verses in the Book of Mormon emphasize the truth of this law. One may illustrate the many: "Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land; but inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my presence (2 Nephi 1:20). There are many others (see 2 Nephi 1:19, 20, 26; 4:4; 26:32–33; Omni 6; Mosiah 1:7; 2:23–24; 2:31; Alma 9:13–14; 36:1, 30; 37:13; 38:1; 3 Nephi 5:22).<br><br>In conjunction with laws, principles, or truth (and I will use them interchangeably, though technically they differ somewhat), there is generally a condition and a promise, either stated or implied. Note:<br><br><i>Unto every kingdom is given a law; and unto every law there are certain bounds also and conditions.</i><br><br><i>All beings who abide not in those conditions are not justified.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:38–39]<br><br>And another, "For all who will have a blessing at my hands shall abide the law which was appointed for that blessing, and the conditions thereof, as were instituted from before the foundation of the world" (D&amp;amp;C 132:5).<br><br>Concerning law Elder McConkie has written:<br><br><i>All things are governed by law; nothing is exempt. In the eternal perspective there is no such thing as chance; in the divine economy the same in varying result always flows from the same cause. These principles are immutable, eternal, everlasting; they apply to all things both temporal and spiritual. . . .</i><br><br><i>There is no whim, chance, or caprice in the operation of gospel law. Divine blessings always result from obedience to the law upon which their receipt is predicated. . . .</i><br><br>[In this same discussion Elder McConkie said,]<i>Once a law has been ordained, it thereafter operates automatically; that is, whenever there is compliance with its terms and conditions, the promised</i>[blessings]<i>accrue. . . .</i>[Bruce R. McConkie,<i>Mormon Doctrine,</i>p. 395]<br><br>Usually when we consider laws we are inclined to think of them as being something very restrictive, something that holds us down. We frequently think of law as the opposite of liberty. That is not so; law is the basis of freedom. It can be likened to the situation of the astronauts. When they were advised to move into the lunar module and stay there in order to save precious oxygen for the return trip in the command module, it was not only cold but cramped. Commander Lovell described their condition to mission control: "Fred [Haise]'s sleeping place is now in the tunnel, upside down with his head resting on the ascent engine cover. . . .Jack [Swigert] is on the floor . . . with a restraint harness wrapped around his arm to keep him there" (<i>Newsweek,</i>April 27, 1970, p. 25). The result of their obedience, however, eventually freed them from certain death in space.<br><br>I suppose you too have felt a bit shackled by some of God's laws. On occasion any one of you may have wanted to physically express some natural feelings toward another but were restricted from improper actions by obedience to the law of chastity. At the time you may have felt resentment against the restraints of law. Obedience, however, frees you from remorse. Obedience brings inner peace. In quieter moments, are you not grateful for such restraint?<br><br>Another illustration may help. A father was out with his son flying a kite. He had let nearly all the string go out. As the little boy watched the kite go higher and higher, he said, "Daddy, let all the string out. Let go of it. Let it fly clear up to the sky!"<br><br>The wise father, seeing an opportunity to teach a lesson, replied, "Oh, no, my son. If we were to let go of the string the kite would come down. We have to keep a hold on it to keep the kite up. You see, ofttimes the things that hold you down are really the things that keep you up."<br><br>Some people look at fences as though they were there to keep them out, when in reality they mark paths to guide them in.<br><br>I would like to cite several illustrations of the principles and promises our Heavenly Father has given to guide you along your journey. The first one is sometimes called "the law of the harvest."<br><br><i>Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</i><br><br><i>For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.</i>[Galatians 6:7]<br><br>If you sow seeds that are lustful and sensuous, you shall reap regret; and the labor of that season is lost. Ultimately corruption shall follow just as surely as one season follows another. On the other hand, the promise is equally true that the seeds of honor and virtue will one day bring the crowning gift of life everlasting.<br><br>Most of you have seen the film<i>The Ten Commandments.</i>You may recall Cecil B. DeMille's introduction to this epic, in which he recites the great lesson taught by history and the experience of the ages: "We cannot break [God's laws]. We can only "break ourselves against them." Ponder that thought. This principle applies to physical, moral, or spiritual laws.<br><br>You may be thinking of someone you know who is misbehaving yet seems to be happy and to have no problems. You wonder how this principle can possibly be true. Does it apply to everyone? Remember, God does not balance his books in October, but balance them he will. We look at things with limited vision; he judges things in eternal perspective. The decisions between the way of the flesh and the way of the spirit have eternal implications. They become the most crucial decisions you will ever make. You will not only reap what you sow in kind; you will reap what you sow abundantly. Nature provides bountiful blossoms from only a few seeds. The law of the harvest is unfailing. Plant only what you will be willing to harvest abundantly.<br><br>The Word of Wisdom was<br><br><i>Given for a principle with promise, adapted to the capacity of the weak and the weakest of all saints. . . .</i><br><br><i>In consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days, I have warned you, and forewarn you, by giving unto you this word of wisdom by revelation--</i><br><br><i>That inasmuch as any man drinketh wine or strong drink among you, behold it is not good. . . .</i><br><br><i>Tobacco is not for the body. . . .</i><br><br><i>And . . . hot drinks</i>[meaning tea and coffee]<i>are not for the body. . . .</i>[D&amp;amp;C 89:3–5, 8–9]<br><br>Then comes the marvelous promise of health, wisdom, strength, and life.<br><br><i>And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments,</i>shall receive health<i>in their navel and marrow to their bones;</i><br><br><i>And</i>shall find wisdom<i>and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures;</i><br><br><i>And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint.</i><br><br><i>And I, the Lord,</i>give unto them a promise,<i>that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them. Amen.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 89:19–21; emphasis added]<br><br>During the last world war I served in the Marine Corps. We were required to undergo extreme physical hardships, not only in training but in combat at Iwo Jima. I had never been especially robust in my youth, and when these occasions had to be met I needed extra strength. I had faithfully observed the Word of Wisdom all my life. During times of stress I asked the Lord to fulfill the promises he had made in the Word of Wisdom. From my own personal experience, I know this principle is true.<br><br>Another principle with promise is the law of tithing. I am selecting those principles that illustrate the unerring operation of divine law. I select those also that help to keep your "receiving sets" in good condition.<br><br><i>Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in my house; and prove me now herewith . . .</i>[The Lord is emphasizing a principle with a promise--in fact, three promises]<i>if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it.</i><br><br><i>And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the fields. . .</i>. [What is the devourer? It is anything that devours your substance and keeps you from prospering.]<br><br><i>And all nations shall call you blessed, for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the Lord of hosts.</i>[3 Nephi 24:10–12]<br><br>In the present dispensation the Lord has promised an added blessing for its faithful observance: "For he that is tithed shall not be burned . . ." (D&amp;amp;C 64:23). (You can understand why some have facetiously spoken of obedience to this law as "fire insurance.")<br><br>If any of you think that you do not have enough money to pay tithing, let me share with you an observation. People pay tithing not because they have money, but because they have faith. When they comply with the law, the promise then becomes operative and can be fulfilled.<br><br>As I have traveled about the Church, it has been my privilege to mingle with those who have much and with those who have very little. Those who have complied with the law of tithing have received the promised blessings. Blessings have not always come in material ways, but blessings have truly come. The principle always works. I have heard testimonies to this truth, and I know of myself the principle is true. Do you think that I would teach you those principles if I did not know that they were true? They will be fulfilled in your behalf. I want to see your lives blessed by observance of these principles.<br><br>The law of the Sabbath also illustrates this principle.<br><br>[Note the purpose of the Sabbath day:]<i>And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world,</i>[is there anyone who does not want to do that?]<i>thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day</i>[a sacrament is a spiritual covenant];<br><br><i>For verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors, and to pay thy devotions unto the Most High.</i><br><br>To "rest from your labors," you stop the regular weekly routine in order to have time to do the work of the Lord and to worship the Lord on the Sabbath day. Note the promise if we do so.<br><br><i>Verily I say, that inasmuch as ye do this,</i>the fullness of the earth is yours . . .<br><br><i>And it pleaseth God that he hath given all these things unto man; . . .</i><br><br><i>But learn that he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 59:9–10, 16, 20, 23; emphasis added]<br><br>Do you want to miss this promise? All mankind is seeking for peace. Yet peace--inner peace--and eternal life are within your grasp if you will but reach out and claim them by doing the works of righteousness.<br><br>(I hope that sometime your great president will share with you his university experience--the pressures to study on the Sabbath day, his refusal to do it, and his testimony of how the Lord fulfills His promises.)<br><br>Finally, I would suggest an additional dimension to your relationship to law. The Lord expects you to pursue righteousness.<br><br><i>For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant; wherefore he receiveth no reward.</i><br><br><i>Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;</i><br><br><i>For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward.</i><br><br><i>But he that doeth not anything until he is commanded and receiveth a commandment with doubtful heart, and keepeth it with slothfulness, the same is damned.</i><br><br><i>Who am I that made man, saith the Lord, that will hold him guiltless that obeys not my commandments?</i><br><br><i>Who am I, saith the Lord, that have promised and have not fulfilled.</i><br><br><i>I command and men obey not; I revoke and they receive not the blessing.</i><br><br><i>Then they say in their hearts: This is not the work of the Lord, for his promises are not fulfilled. But, wo unto such, for their reward lurketh beneath, and not from above.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 58:26–33]<br><br>The Lord has given you this earthly experience. He has established laws to guide you. He has promised blessings for obedience. He wants you to return to live with him. Like the crew of Apollo 13, you cannot get "home" without direction from heaven. Like them, you may be oblivious to a hurricane boiling toward your splash-down area. Were you not guided by revelation from God, you could easily lose contact, wander off your course, and find yourself in outer darkness where you must drift eternally. If, however, you will listen to and follow divine direction, you can gain eternal life.<br><br>I testify that our Heavenly Father lives, and that Jesus is the Christ, our Savior, and our Redeemer. President Kimball is his living prophet. Your safeguard on your journey through life is the constant direction from a wise and loving Heavenly Father. With all my heart I plead with you to listen, to obey, and to live. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>A.

<br>
It is an honor and a responsibility, brothers and sisters, to stand before an audience like this, even though I am still in my youth. I hope the Lord will be with us and that our minds will be able to understand what I have in my heart and what I would like to say, though I am sure I do not have the words to say it. And so I ask him, and ask you to ask him, to help us that we may have joyous spirits as we consider a few principles of the gospel that are vital for all of us to know.<br><br>During the recent Christmas season our thoughts were naturally directed to the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ. In harmony with these thoughts, I shall in these remarks emphasize the manner in which he became and is our Savior and Redeemer. I was happy with that first song and also with the second--the first one, "Redeemer of Israel," because I want to talk about how and in what manner he is our Savior and Redeemer.<br><br>First I shall call attention to a few fundamentals which are essential to an understanding of him and his ministry. The most important of these fundamentals is a knowledge of God the Father, man, and their relationship to each other. Without such knowledge it is impossible to realize the manner in which Jesus is our Savior and Redeemer.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith said: "It is the first principle of the Gospel to know for a certainty the Character of God, and to know that we may converse with him as one man converses with another . . ." (Joseph Fielding Smith, comp.,<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</i>p. 345; hereinafter referred to as<i>TPJS</i>). In reporting his first vision, the Prophet wrote concerning God as follows:<br><br><i>. . . I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me. . . .</i><br><br>. . . [In it] I saw two personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name, and said--pointing to the other--"THIS IS MY BELOVED SON, HEAR HIM." [Joseph Smith,<i>History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</i>1:5; hereinafter referred to as<i>HC;</i>see also Joseph Smith 2:16–17]<br><br>Later the Prophet said that "the Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's" (D&amp;amp;C 130:22). He also declared that "if . . . God . . . was to make himself visible, . . . you would see him like a man in form--like yourselves in all the person, image, and very form as a man . . ." (<i>TPJS,</i>p. 345).<br><br>Such teachings seemed blasphemous in the days of Joseph Smith. It will help us to appreciate their impact if we remember that the Athanasian Creed was then, and so far as I know still is, the generally accepted concept of God held by the so-called Christian world. It reads:<br><br><i>We worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity, neither confounding the persons nor dividing the substance. For there is one person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Ghost. But the Godhead of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost is all one; the glory equal, the majesty co-eternal. Such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the Holy Ghost. The father</i>[sic]<i>uncreate, the Son uncreate, and the Holy Ghost uncreate. The Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible, and the Holy Ghost incomprehensible. The Father eternal, the Son eternal, and the Holy Ghost eternal. And yet there are not three eternals, but one eternal. As also there are not three incomprehensibles, nor three uncreate, but one uncreate and one incomprehensible.</i>[Are you following the description?]<i>So likewise the Father is almighty, the Son almighty, and the Holy Ghost almighty, but one almighty. So the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God; and yet there are not three Gods, but one God.</i>[HC 1:LXXXV]<br><br>The clear and simple truth concerning God revealed through and taught by the Prophet was certainly a great contrast to this mystifying confusion.<br><br>A knowledge of the Prophet's teachings concerning God and a personal testimony that they are true is a prerequisite to an understanding of the way in which Jesus is our Savior and Redeemer. Next in importance to an understanding of Jesus and his mission is an understanding of what and who men are. On this subject the Lord has revealed the truth that men are souls and he has revealed the fact that a soul is a dual being, a spirit and a body combined--that each of us is a spirit clothed in a physical body. The Lord has further revealed the truth that God, who is an immortal, exalted, glorified, eternal soul, is the Father of our spirits. Paul was referring to our spirits when, in his great speech on Mars' hill he said: ". . . In him we live, and move, and have our being; . . . For we are . . . his offspring" (Acts 17:28).<br><br>The scriptures repeatedly confirm this truth. God the Father himself declared that we are his children.<br><br><i>At a time when Moses was caught up into an exceedingly high mountain,</i><br><br><i>. . . He saw God face to face, and he talked with him, . . .</i><br><br><i>And God spake unto Moses, saying: Behold, I am the Lord God Almighty. . . .</i><br><br><i>And behold, thou art my son.</i>[Moses 1:1–4]<br><br>Another truth we should keep in mind as we consider how Jesus is our Savior is the universal law that the offspring of all reproducing life has the capability to become, in full maturity, like unto its parents. In harmony with this law, we, the spirit offspring of God, have the capability of becoming like him. To bring us to that likeness is what the gospel is all about.<br><br>The gospel, frequently called the plan of salvation, is so called because it is the program by and pursuant to which we, spirit children of God, come to the earth, receive corporeal bodies, are placed between the forces of good and evil, are given our free agency, and by the choices we make here on earth prove ourselves worthy--or unworthy--to return to God's presence and receive eternal life, which is the type of life God the Father and Jesus enjoy and which they have made it possible for us to enjoy. The gospel is called the gospel of Jesus Christ because he, Jesus Christ, was the firstborn spirit son of God, and volunteered, in the great pre-earth council of spirits, to come to earth and implement--that is, put into operation--the gospel plan.<br><br>We learn of that great heavenly council and something about what took place in it in Abraham's account of it as reported in the Pearl of Great Price, from which I now quote.<br><br><i>Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones;</i><br><br><i>And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born.</i><br><br><i>And there stood one among them that was like unto God</i>[that, of course, was Jesus Christ--the spirit Jesus Christ]<i>, and he</i>[Jesus Christ, understanding at that time the gospel plan]<i>said unto those who were with him: We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell</i>[we were all there, and he was talking about a dwelling place for us as spirits];<br><br><i>And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them;</i><br><br><i>And they who keep their first estate</i>[referring to those who would be faithful there in the spirit world]<i>shall be added upon</i>[that is, given bodies];<i>and they who keep not their first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate</i>[of course, this referred to those who would and did reject the gospel plan there in the spirit world and who followed Satan. They are not to have glory in the same kingdom with those who there followed Christ];<i>and they who keep their second estate</i>[that is, those mortals who prove faithful in this estate]<i>shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever.</i><br><br>This refers, of course, to those who accept and live the gospel here in mortality. They are the ones who will "have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever."<br><br>With reference to a Redeemer, which the gospel plan required, the Father said, in that great council,<br><br><i>Whom shall I send?</i>[That was to be the Redeemer.]<i>And one answered like unto the Son of Man: Here am I, send me. And another answered and said: Here am I, send me. And the Lord said: I will send the first.</i><br><br><i>And the second was angry and kept not his first estate; and, at that day, many followed after him.</i>[Abraham 3:22–28]<br><br>There is a followup on this account in the book of Moses in the fourth chapter, the first to fourth verses, in which the Lord said to Moses--Moses was on the mount and had an interview with the devil and they did not agree; so Moses told him where to go, [laughter] and he went. [laughter] And so--don't laugh about this; this is a serious Church meeting [smiling; more laughter]--and so the Lord appeared to Moses and said,<br><br><i>That Satan, whom thou hast commanded in the name of mine Only Begotten, is the same which was from the beginning, and he came before me</i>[referring to the spirit council in heaven]<i>saying--Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor.</i><br><br><i>But, behold,</i>[said the Father to Moses,]<i>my Beloved Son, which was my Beloved and Chosen from the beginning, said unto me--Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore,</i>[continued the Father,]<i>because that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him, and also, that I should give unto him mine own power; by the power of mine Only Begotten, I caused that he should be cast down;</i><br><br><i>And he became Satan, yea, even the devil, the father of all lies, to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will, even as many as would not hearken unto my voice.</i>[Moses 4:1–4]<br><br>Speaking of this event, John the Revelator wrote:<br><br><i>And there was a war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,</i><br><br><i>And prevailed not; neither was</i>their<i>place found any more in heaven.</i><br><br><i>And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world; he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.</i>[Revelation 12:7–9; emphasis added]<br><br>These scriptures make it clear that in the great council Jesus volunteered and was accepted and appointed to be our Savior and Redeemer; and that Satan with the spirits who followed him was cast out.<br><br>The earth was created according to plan and prepared to be man's dwelling place during his mortal probation. Adam, who was<i>Michael</i>referred to by John and who stood with Christ in the great council, and his companion Eve were placed in the "Garden of Eden, to dress it, and to keep it" (Moses 3:15). In their coming to earth, as has been true of all their posterity, the memories of Adam and Eve were suspended. They had to be taught the gospel after they came to earth.<br><br>The Lord, there in the Garden of Eden, commanded them, saying:<br><br><i>Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat,</i><br><br><i>But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat . . ., nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee; but, remember that I forbid it, for in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</i>[Moses 3:16–17]<br><br>As everyone knows, Adam and Eve partook of the forbidden fruit. As a consequence, pursuant to the Lord's statement, death passed upon them and all their posterity.<br><br>Death--which is the separation of body and spirit--unless it could be overcome, would make it impossible for men ever to obtain the exaltation and eternal life which God the Father enjoys. This is so because he, God, has a body of flesh and bones. If we ever attain unto his likeness we must have bodies of flesh and bones, which we would not have unless death is overcome and we are resurrected. Jacob, the brother of Nephi, recognized this and emphasized it in these beautiful words:<br><br><i>For as death hath passed upon all men, to fulfill the merciful plan of the great Creator, there must needs be a power of resurrection, and the resurrection must needs come unto man by reason of the fall; and the fall came by reason of transgression; and because man became fallen they were cut off from the presence of the Lord.</i><br><br>Jacob also knew that the transgression--that was the partaking of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil--which brought death must be atoned for in order to bring about the resurrection, and he added:<br><br><i>It must needs be an infinite atonement--save it should be an infinite atonement this corruption could not put on incorruption. Wherefore, the first judgment which came upon man</i>[which is death and banishment from the presence of God]<i>must needs have remained to an endless duration. And if so, this flesh</i>[this, as I read it for the hundredth time, went deeper into my understanding than it ever did before]<i>must have laid down to rot and to crumble to its mother earth, to rise no more.</i><br><br>[And then Jacob declares,]<i>O the wisdom of God, his mercy and grace! For behold, if the flesh should rise no more our spirits must become subject to that angel who fell from before the presence of the Eternal God, and became the devil, to rise no more.</i><br><br><i>And our spirits must have become like unto him, and we become devils, angels to a devil, to be shut out from the presence of our God, and to remain with the father of lies, in misery, like unto himself.</i>[2 Nephi 9:6–9]<br><br>That would have been our condition without the Resurrection. The required "infinite atonement" could not be made by any man nor by all men together because all men, being descendants of Adam, inherited by nature the death penalty. Atonement for disobeying the Father's command not to partake of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which brought death, could not be made by one who was subject to the penalty. It had to be one who was not subject to death. That someone was Jesus Christ, whose Father in the flesh as well as in the spirit was Elohim.<br><br>Jesus was and is our Savior because he brought about our resurrection, through which our bodies and spirits will be united again. We shall be raised from the grave as immortal souls never again to be separated. This Jesus accomplished by voluntarily giving his life to satisfy the demands of justice for the broken law which brought death. This he was qualified to do because he was not subject to death. He was not a descendant of Adam in the same sense as are other men. He was the literal Son of God in the flesh as well as in the spirit. He thus inherited from the Father life in himself. He could have lived on indefinitely. Being the Son of God in the flesh, death had no claim upon him.<br><br>By voluntarily giving his life, he won the victory over the grave. Paul put it in these terms:<br><br><i>For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.</i><br><br><i>For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.</i>[1 Corinthians 15:21–22]<br><br>Adam and Eve were responsible for death. Jesus brought about universal resurrection. In this respect, he was and is our Savior.<br><br>The fact that all men are to be resurrected, regardless of their conduct, does not, however, mean that all men shall obtain eternal life in the celestial kingdom. There are many kingdoms to which resurrected beings will be assigned--some of glory and some of less than glory. The kingdoms to which they will go will be determined by how well they, while in mortality, do the things the Lord their God commands them. Resurrected souls will have to be clean and pure to dwell with God. As the resurrected Jesus taught the Nephites, "no unclean thing can enter into his kingdom," regardless of the fact that they are resurrected. (Somebody wanted me to quote from the Book of Mormon; that's from the Book of Mormon that I just read to you: 3 Nephi 27:19.)<br><br>Since all men become unclean by sinning, it follows that there must be--if men are to reenter the kingdom of God--in addition to resurrection, a means provided whereby they can be cleansed from the stain of their sins. This means Jesus also provided. In the great heavenly council he voluntarily undertook to, and later came to earth and did, atone for the sins of all men by suffering on the cross and in Gethsemane sufficiently to satisfy the demands of justice for the sins of all men.<br><br>Men do not, however, get the benefit of Christ's atonement for their sins unconditionally. They obtain the benefit of Christ's victory over the grave unconditionally because they were not in any way responsible for the transgression which brought death. On the other hand, they are responsible for their own sins and are, therefore, required to do all they can do by way of atoning for them. This is so because, while they are in mortality, men--being endowed with free agency--are placed between influences for good, led by Christ, and influences for evil, led by Satan. They will be held responsible for the choices they make because they are endowed with the means to distinguish between good and evil. As Mormon says, "the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil" (Moroni 7:16). Every man has that power; he is endowed with it at birth and will be responsible for his choices. The Lord confirmed this truth when he said to the Prophet Joseph Smith that<br><br><i>the Spirit</i>[of Christ]<i>giveth light to every man that cometh into the world; and</i>[that]<i>the Spirit enlighteneth every man through the world, that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:46]<br><br>On the other hand, Satan and his minions tempt everyone to do evil.<br><br>From the days of Adam until today, Satan has fought against Christ for the souls of men. Every person who has reached the age of accountability, except Jesus, has yielded in some degree to sin, some more and some less, but all save Jesus only have yielded sufficiently to be barred from the presence of God. This means that every person must be cleansed through the atonement of Jesus Christ in order to reenter the society of God. Jesus stated the situation to the Nephites in these words:<br><br><i>Nothing</i>[a term which, as Jesus used it, included no person]<i>entereth into his</i>[God's]<i>rest save it be those who have washed their garments in my blood, because of their faith, and the repentance of all their sins, and their faithfulness unto the end.</i>[3 Nephi 27:19]<br><br>As has already been said, Jesus provided the means whereby men can be cleansed from the stain of their sins through his suffering in Gethsemane and on the cross. This he was able to do because he himself never sinned; he therefore never was banished from God's presence. By voluntarily taking upon himself to suffer as he did, he satisfied the demands of justice so that men, if they will repent, may be cleansed from the stain of their sins by the spilt blood of Christ.<br><br>He explained the purpose of his mortality to the Nephites when he visited them following his resurrection, as follows--this is Christ's own statement as to why he came into the world:<br><br><i>I came into the world to do the will of my Father, because my Father sent me.</i><br><br><i>And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; and after that I had been lifted up upon the cross, that I might draw all men unto me</i>[that is, by the resurrection],<i>that as I have been lifted up by men</i>[when he was making this statement he was a resurrected being, having been crucified and "lifted up upon the cross" by men, and he was talking to the Nephites following his resurrection]<i>even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil</i>[we have all got that experience coming in the future, because we will all die, be resurrected, and stand before the judgment bar of Christ to see whether we are worthy of exaltation]--<br><br><i>And for this cause</i>[he said]<i>have I been lifted up</i>[speaking of his crucifixion];<i>therefore, according to the power of the Father I will draw all men unto me, that they may be judged according to their works.</i><br><br><i>And it shall come to pass, that whoso repenteth and is baptized in my name shall be filled</i>[he means filled with the Holy Ghost];<i>and if he endureth to the end, behold, him will I hold guiltless before my Father at that day when I shall . . . judge the world.</i><br><br><i>And he that endureth not unto the end, the same is he that is also hewn down and cast into the fire, from whence they can no more return, because of the justice of the Father.</i><br><br><i>And this is the word which he hath given unto the children of men. And for this cause he fulfilleth the words which he hath</i>[spoken],<i>and he lieth not, but fulfilleth all his words.</i><br><br><i>And no unclean thing can enter into his kingdom; therefore nothing entereth into his rest save it be those who have washed their garments in my blood, because of their faith, and the repentance of all their sins, and their faithfulness unto the end.</i>[Those are the words, my beloved brothers and sisters, of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer.]<br><br><i>Now this is the commandment</i>[the Savior is still talking]:<i>Repent, all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and be baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day.</i><br><br><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, this is my gospel. . . .</i>[3 Nephi 27:13–21]<br><br>In the 19th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord declared that suffering is the inevitable result of unrepented sin, and that he had redeemed men from sin upon condition of repentance. Speaking to Martin Harris, he said, giving the revelation through the Prophet Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>I command you to repent . . . lest I smite you by the rod of my mouth, and by my wrath, and by my anger, and your sufferings be sore--how sore you know not, how exquisite you know not, yea, how hard to bear you know not.</i><br><br><i>For behold, I, God,</i>[the Savior is speaking],<i>have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent;</i><br><br><i>But if they would not repent they must suffer even as I;</i><br><br><i>Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pour</i>[can you imagine the suffering that Christ went through in Gethsemane, where he sweat blood from every pore? I have been in the hospital and seen people suffering what the doctor said was the severest pain that man can suffer, but I never saw one sweat a drop of blood],<i>and to suffer both body and spirit--and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink--</i><br><br><i>Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 19:15–19]<br><br>He made the atonement for our sins on the condition that we repent. If we can remember and keep in mind these great basic truths, along with what Alma says about what happens to the soul between death and resurrection (read that in Alma 40:11–14), we will be able to more fully understand and appreciate Jacob's great discourse on the mission of Jesus as our Savior and Redeemer, recorded in 2 Nephi 9:10–14, and the sermon of Amulek and Alma as recorded in Alma 11:40–45 and Alma the twelfth chapter. We will know with certainty that Jesus Christ is our Savior because he brought about our resurrection and because he atoned for our sins on condition that we have faith in him and comply with the principles and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Now, my young brothers and sisters, I bear you my personal witness that I know that these things are true. I know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God; he walked the earth as the Son of God in the flesh and in the spirit, he brought about the resurrection unconditionally, and he has opened the way for you, for me, and for all mankind to have our sins forgiven through acceptance of his gospel, repentance, and living of the commandments. Oh, how glorious it would be if every person here tonight would qualify that we might someday meet around the throne of God, cleansed and purified and admitted into his celestial presence! I pray that it may be so, and leave you my blessing that you may have the strength you desire to bring that about, and I do it in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, our Redeemer, and our Savior. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Marion G.

<h1>d Wings - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, Sister Hodge, for that introduction, and thank you for those beautiful musical numbers; they could not have been more fitting for what I have to say today. And, President Oaks, Sister Arnold, Sister Bybee, thank you for allowing me to address the student body of Brigham Young University this morning. I have long loved this institution for its influence in my life--and that influence goes back a very long way. My grandmother was a member of the first graduating class of the Brigham Young Academy. Her achievements as a student of Dr. Karl G. Maeser have blessed the lives of many people, including me. You heard that she was the physician and surgeon who delivered me and cared for my health needs during the first, early years of my life.<br><br>I am grateful for the influence that BYU has had on the lives of three of our daughters, who have been students here; and I see the influence of the school now, as we have the husband of our other daughter attending here. It is a privilege for me to serve as a member of the Board of Trustees. In this capacity I am made aware of the progressive plans being made for the University and I am happy to have a part in supporting the growth and the achievements of this great and unique institution.<br><br>One more thing I would like to mention. As the general president of the Relief Society I am proud of the achievements of the Relief Society organizations on this campus. They do many outstanding things with the attitude of doing more than they are commanded, and I know that from here Relief Society members "go forth to serve" and influence other units of Relief Society worldwide.<br><br>I appreciate the students, the faculty, and the friends of Brigham Young University who are here this morning to begin the 1978 Women's Conference, and I would like to say at the outset that I feel this is the most wonderful time in the history of the world for a woman to be alive! She has more opportunities, more advantages, more options, better health possibilities, more knowledge, and more spiritual strength available than she has ever had before.<br><br>I suppose there has never been a time when there has been more discussion about women more widely heard through public media, nor has there been a time when women everywhere have been more actively involved in searching for direction and in seeking to change traditional attitudes and practices concerning women. With the power of the media, law, and government, major societal changes are now possible. Your generation will be more affected by these changes than mine has been. You young men and women will find it increasingly imperative to make choices and meet challenges that have never even been articulated before.<br><br>Change should not be viewed with undue anxiety; it is a necessary part of the ongoing human experience. The great challenge today is to meet the ever-changing conditions with purpose and direction born of faith in God and knowledge of his eternal principles. With this foundation, changes in our own lives and in society can be influenced to move in the direction of heaven.<br><br>In May of 1975 I attended the American Mothers Convention in New York City as the new general president of the Relief Society. You are probably aware that each year each state of the Union selects a woman who has been an outstanding mother to represent the state. (Stella Oaks, the mother of President Dallin Oaks, was once our Utah state mother.) These mothers compete and one is honored with the name "American Mother of the Year." In order to help make that selection, each mother is given three minutes to describe her achievements and her philosophy of life.<br><br>I will never forget one mother who stepped into the beautiful gold frame. She was in the late years of her life. She spoke with love as she looked at us quietly and declared, "My children are my greatest accomplishments. My success has come, I feel, because I gave them roots and wings--roots because I helped them to have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and wings because I gave them faith in themselves."<br><br>I would like to take her thoughtful summation as the theme of my remarks today; for in a world which is complicated, confusing, and harsh at times and unacceptable at others, with the struggle for equality for women and with many problems of personal responsibility demanding our attention, I find myself thinking that one of our greatest needs is to know that the good from the past should be preserved and protected and that the good from the present should be embraced and encouraged.<br><br>The problem seems to be this: What can you and I do to bring others to a commonality of this understanding with us, that we all might gain the strength of purpose that can only come from a firm foundation of faith coupled with the endless potential inherited by the sons and daughters of God?<br><br>One way seemed to open up when we were given approval by the First Presidency to ask the women of the Church to contribute funds to build a monument in Nauvoo as a memorial to the place where Relief Society was organized under the direction and the inspiration of the Prophet Joseph Smith. Here such a statement about faith in God and faith in self could be made. We sought earnestly for an artist's conception that would convey this important message, and we accepted the plan of Dennis Smith. In his plan he suggested thirteen sensitively sculpted figures, representing the gospel concept of women and their relationship to the world, to be placed in a lovely garden setting. People could come not only to enjoy the beauty of these statues but hopefully to take a few moments to contemplate the truths being expressed in artistic form. There the centuries-old contributions which women have always made as individuals, wives, and mothers could be told. The magnitude of their responsibility throughout the years to give birth to and nurture new life could be recognized as a contribution to be honored, not to be tossed away in the name of progress when indeed no meaningful progress is possible without it.<br><br>The roots of faith we seek are necessarily those of the eternal principles of righteousness which govern both heaven and earth. The wings will come as we master ourselves and discipline our talents and seek to become like our Father.<br><br>Consider some of the eternal truths appropriate to a discussion about a woman's destiny that we must see as we step into that garden setting in Nauvoo. Think first of the central figure in the first circle of the monument. It is an heroic-sized statue of a woman. She represents the central, fundamental teaching of the gospel concerning women. Let me illustrate.<br><br>Some years ago when one of my daughters was a small, exuberant child we were all sitting around the fireplace as families do at the happy Christmas season. It had been a good, satisfying, full holiday, and the stress of the hustle and the bustle of the day was behind us, leaving the warm after-glow of this happy day. Fathers, mothers, cousins, aunts, and uncles all chatted quietly by the fire, and into this large group of people who loved each other bounded my child with the exclamation, "Look who's here, everybody!"<br><br>Our curiosity was piqued by this enthusiastic announcement. We looked beyond her with interest and inquired, "Who is it?"<br><br>And she returned our questioning glances with sparkling eyes and a face wreathed in smiles and announced, "Me!"<br><br>It was not what we had expected, somehow, but I shall never forget that moment. This little bit of a girl taught her older kinfolk an important lesson. In a sense she was saying what the central figure represents: "There is no one more important than the individual." The individual human being is the most important entity on the face of the earth. The child of God is the one thing in mortality that was coexistent as an intelligence with God himself. As intelligences we chose mortal experience with all its hazards, and once we pass the portals of death we will have the opportunity for continuing our progress eternally.<br><br>C.S. Lewis once said that we would never meet a mere mortal, that every day we meet gods-to-be or devils-to-be and we will not know until it is an accomplished fact which is which (see C.S. Lewis,<i>The Weight of Glory and Other Addresses,</i>pp. 14–15). That is true, but the simple and magnificent message of the restored gospel is that godhood is the birthright of every child born into this world.<br><br>The scriptures say that God made us "a little lower than the angels" (Psalm 8:5) and that he made it possible for us to become like him by doing the things we could not do for ourselves in mortality. He has, first, guaranteed us the right of agency; and, second, through the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ, he has provided the way to salvation and exaltation, that we may indeed be gods-to-be. To accomplish that noble goal, we must love the truth--love it enough to seek for it, love it enough to understand it, love it enough to live it. The truths of the gospel will make us free from doubt, from ignorance, from sin. They will give us hope for the future, faith in ourselves, strength to meet adversity, and a direction that will lead us to do much good.<br><br>I hope all of these points will be seen and understood in that garden in Nauvoo. I hope each woman will realize that she is a child of God sent here to act as an individual, born with all the potential of unlimited growth and achievement. I once heard a woman say that a woman is her Father's daughter about her Father's business. This implies an essential beautiful relationship between the individual woman and her Creator. God values his daughters. He places an infinite value on his children, with no arbitrary inferior or superior comparative labels. He wants us to be about his business, just as he wanted Jesus Christ to be about his business, and his business is eternal, life-giving work. God's dealings with us are not capricious. He loves us too much for that. His dealings with us are predicated upon eternal principles of righteousness.<br><br>I hope every woman that looks at that central figure sculpted in bronze will see herself stepping forward into the future, confidently, with her head held high, knowing that there is within her the capacity for eternal progression, the strength to meet whatever situations life has to offer, and the right to choose the direction of her life. The four supporting statues in this first circle represent four great root systems upon which a woman's life should grow if it is to have a place in the plan of the Lord. One is to develop her talents; a second, to gain knowledge and with it wisdom; a third, to learn to pray; and a fourth, to give compassionate service.<br><br>Let us consider the life-giving potential of each root system. The Lord has commanded us to develop our talents. Remember the parable of the talents? The Lord was well pleased with the two who doubled their talents, but he was not pleased with the one who was afraid and hid his talent, and he took it from him.<br><br>One time I was to give a lesson on talents. I talked with one of our outstanding musicians and asked him how he felt having been given such a marvelous talent from the Lord. His reply surprised me; he said, "Most people feel a musician is automatically given that talent. I admit that a musician must have a mental capacity to comprehend and retain musical composition and that he must have hands that are whole and nimble and workable and that he must have a sensitive nature; but any musician of worth will have to work hard, day after day, year in and year out, to develop his talent."<br><br>Traditionally we have acknowledged talents in the performing arts as gifts from the Lord, and they are. Those who study and write about the whole person point out that there are many other talents to be acknowledged. Gifted people in many areas have the power to enrich lives. Perhaps your developed talents will be used in volunteer work--full-time, part-time, or occasionally. Perhaps your talents will be needed in improving the quality of Church service given in the name of the Lord. Perhaps your talents will be most useful in enriching the lives of your family, either your brothers, sisters, mother, and father, or the husband you choose and the children who will come into the home you establish.<br><br>That is where you are now: you are learning, developing talents, and having experiences that may never come your way again; and hopefully you will understand that the more you partake of life's enrichment, the greater will be the enrichment in the home you create. I see the gospel urging us to develop every talent we have, seeking the virtuous, the lovely, and those things of good report and praiseworthy (see Article of Faith 13).<br><br>The root system based on learning is a fundamental part of our faith. When the Lord placed Adam and Eve on earth he gave them two commandments: one was to multiply and replenish the earth, and the other was to subdue it. And the subduing was the learning. We should learn all we can learn about the earth and how it functions, and learn the laws of mortality so that we might have sufficient knowledge upon which to based our life's decisions, removing ignorance from our path.<br><br>You now have access to the best learning in all the world. The men and the women who devote their lives to teaching and counseling you are constantly engaged in sifting through ideas and in giving you helpful direction in your academic pursuits. You can continue to build upon this foundation, starting where they leave off and seeking answers to the remaining unknowns in the universe.<br><br>We will never know everything; that is one of the glories of the eternities. But the pursuit of knowledge, the learning little by little--one step at a time--and the setting of the mind to the ongoing excitement of learning is a part of what we should all do with our lives. It is an exciting adventure. I have seen this love of learning in my doctor grandmother and in my teacher mother, and I hope I can pass it on to my children and they to theirs; for when true learning takes place, we realize how much there is yet unknown and feel the thrill of accepting the challenge to pit ourselves against the unknown.<br><br>The root system concerning prayer puts us in touch with the power and the light of heaven. Prayer is the way that each human being may be in touch with heaven personally. The Lord has told us that he will send each of us knowledge to guide our lives if we will but ask. Again and again he says, "Seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you" (Matthew 7:7; see also 3 Nephi 14:7; D&amp;amp;C 4:7). He is the source of the knowledge we need most, and his invitation should be accepted daily. Just as we can no more afford to shut the door on the fine opportunities of education that exist in our day, neither can we afford to refuse to kneel in prayer and seek the guidance of our Heavenly Father. Both systems are essential to that quality of learning which will bring us one day to the threshold of God.<br><br>Can you see why I feel that this is such a glorious time to be born a woman? For centuries the world did not provide an opportunity for women to learn or to use their talents or to feel that they had a significant part in the great drama of life. For many centuries ignorance darkened the world and made it difficult, if not impossible, for most of the human race to grow intellectually. The wonders of the written word were scarcely available, and the truths of the scriptures were not accessible to most common people. But now they are, along with an increasing and almost overwhelming flow of knowledge. Women today are freed from many of the time-consuming household tasks of years gone by; their challenge today is to choose wisely from the multitude of offerings to discover through prayer what blessings the Lord wishes them to have.<br><br>The fourth root system that our bronze figures explain is compassionate service. Some of our greatest learning experiences will come as we give compassionately of ourselves. We may forget to be compassionate, but God never will. It is important for us to remember that this is a significant part of our human experience. In fact, it seems to be that, of all our learning, that which we obtain by way of giving compassionately is the most significant learning we ever do.<br><br>When it was time for Jesus to leave this world, he gave his last great sermon to his disciples and said that their eternal lives would be judged upon that which they had done to alleviate suffering (see Matthew 25:31–46). Suffering is the great common denominator for all mortals. When we suffer we often feel that no one else suffers as we do--and yet I think back to a time when I took a little granddaughter to the hospital to have some foot braces checked. I was pained that she had to wear those heavy braces. As I waited for the doctor, many women with crippled children came to empathize and sympathize with me over her condition. Then my heart really ached, because while I knew that her correction would be full and complete soon, I could see that their children might never know full health or activity. Standing by and watching them suffer made me suffer and realize how helpless I was; but I know now of the great compassion of those women. They had developed this great compassion for others who have problems, and perhaps it is possible for me now to share more deeply in others' sorrows.<br><br>The perception the Lord has given us in this gospel is that in giving compassionate service we can become more like him. It was in order to further the work of compassion among his people that the Relief Society was organized. The compassionate work given to the Relief Society over the years was not imposed upon the women. Good women in Nauvoo in 1842 looked around and saw the suffering that existed there among the poor, and they knew that they could do more and better work if they were organized and if they would help one another go about the business of finding and succoring those in need. The proposal was taken to the Prophet Joseph Smith, and he told them that it was the will of the Lord that they be organized after a pattern of the priesthood, which would allow them to partake of the inspiration of heaven in their dealings with His children. And this they did.<br><br>The work of compassion in Relief Society has been both consistent and adaptable over the years. As new needs arise among our people, the work of the Relief Society is modified to meet those needs. So today, as a worldwide organization, our purpose exists as it always has: to encourage us as women in the compassionate work characterized by the Prophet Joseph Smith as "according to your natures" (Joseph Smith<i>, History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</i>4:605). Instead of a small group of women in Nauvoo, there are now more than 1,200,000 women around the globe teaching and fostering this idea.<br><br>Interlacing these four root systems is another essential backup system. We might call it responsibility. Responsibility is a key word as we try to understand and relate to any idea in the world today. We have many options as to how to spend our lives, but we must not forget that option and agency do not mean license. The fundamental concept of agency is that one who makes choices must also accept the responsibility for whatever comes of that choice.<br><br>If we choose not to study during a semester, then we must take the responsibility for failing those classes; we cannot blame the teacher. If we are sullen in our conversations, we must accept the responsibility for the likely result that nobody will enjoy being with us. If we waste our paycheck, the result is that we will lack the money we need for our schooling or supplies or food or clothing. If we do not read good books, we are poorer in ideas than we would have been.<br><br>If we come to school and never attend cultural events, we have denied ourselves the enrichment that can come to our souls. If we have heard the gospel from our youth and never knelt to ask if it is true, we have rejected the opportunity for the motivating power of testimony in our lives. If we have heard about compassionate service and yet never have given any, we have lost the greatness of this opportunity.<br><br>If we marry and have children, we have a responsibility to those children. Some of society's most difficult problems have come because of the lack of acceptance by parents of responsibility for their children and, in later years, by children for their parents.<br><br>The second circle of the monument is designed to bring to our attention relationships with others. Central to all relationships is the relationship between the man and the woman in the marriage covenant and the relationships which ensue in the family. The Lord intended man and woman to be together. He said, "Neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord" (1 Corinthians 11:11), and in accord with that statement it is our understanding that exaltation and ultimately godhood is not possible unless a man and a woman be united and come together as one before the Lord. It is understandable, because the great creative work for exaltation requires both the man and the woman.<br><br>I understand that there are many in this life who may never marry. But I feel confident there are many people who may not need that particular schooling during mortality and that they will be judged, as we all will be, according to their worthiness. They will be given all that they have earned, even a celestial mate if they have not found one in mortality. One of the great single women on the Relief Society general board has said: "For all we see confirms our knowledge that to be born female and a daughter of God is a privilege, wonderful and encompassing; becoming a woman our ultimate and creative responsibility."<br><br>Marriage, in our understanding, is not for time--it is not for convenience--it is not for expediency. Marriage is a sacrament entered into by two people and it is designed by the Lord to be eternal in nature. It requires the best efforts of the man and the woman if it is to be a successful venture, one sufficiently sound in comradery, in mutual support and trust, and in love to last beyond mortality.<br><br>A good marriage requires mutual agreement on major decisions. A good marriage requires that each gives to the other the best of what both are and the best of what both may become. This is not the kind of a marriage that comes because of an infatuation; it is the kind of a marriage based on love--not selfish love that is immature or purely romantic, but the selfless love described in the scriptures. With that kind of a marriage foundation, the family unit is born; and into the family come the spirit children of God, clothed in mortality by earthly parents, with every right to assume that they will have a loving place in which to grow to maturity.<br><br>There is perhaps no greater laboratory in the world for the expression of Christlike love than exists in the family. In the close day-to-day contact, we come to know more about giving love than in most situations. If our family situation is incomplete in this life, we have to search for those opportunities which will school our spirits in the practice of giving love. In either case, the primary responsibility of learning how to give love in its fullest, most life-giving sense lies with the individual. We must seek after those opportunities.<br><br>In the center of the second circle is the delightful sculpture of a woman playing with children. This woman could be a mother with her children, or she could be a woman enjoying someone else's children--a teacher, an aunt, a friend, or anyone who shares some joyful moments of life with children and makes it possible for their beginning years to be filled with remembrance of love. Children need loving, caring adult companionship during those early years; they need to know that there are adults who care for them on a one-to-one basis. Traditionally, such love and sustenance has been provided primarily by the mother and the father.<br><br>There is no question in my mind that the woman who gives birth to a child is by that very act assuming responsibility for that child. Of course, in the ideal situation, both the father and the mother share in the responsibility for that child, and each fills an important need. When we choose to have a child, we assume an awesome responsibility. We should nurture that child and give it the warmest, richest, most rewarding environment of which we are capable. Children are not an encumbrance; they are a great and noble challenge. They will teach you more about yourself than you ever thought possible.<br><br>No training you will ever receive will be as revealing to you as your parenthood. In connection with your creative experiences, it will be the most significant training you receive for the eternities. Those who pass it by or give it to someone else will never know the power of that life-giving, life-training opportunity. There cannot be a greater work, for those who have the opportunity, than to bring forth the sons and daughters of God and teach them right principles in order that they may choose happiness and learning rather than dead ends and sorrows. The second circle of this monument draws that sacred duty to our minds.<br><br>The challenge of being a wife and a mother in today's world is great. All of you should look forward to that opportunity when it presents itself. But, like everyone else that speaks to you, I too warn, "Be sure you marry the right person, in the right way, and at the right time." Marriage is not an outlet nor an escape from the realities of life. Marriage is a schooling of oneself and a giving of loving service<br><br>A beautiful young mother, a graduate of a prestigious women's college and mother of five, expressed these thoughts to me recently in a letter:<br><br><i>The bearing and nurturing of children in a home filled with love and with the spirit of the Lord is a great and glorious privilege of women. . . . As women we can ignore that calling by seeking personal pleasure or power to the exclusion of home-building and motherhood. We can defile that calling by misusing those sacred powers of procreation. We can abort that calling by abandoning the responsibility of mothering to others. We can belittle that calling by feeling shame before the world for begetting life. We can misunderstand that calling by allowing devotion to children to exclude the development of the whole woman. We can diminish that calling by failing strenuously to engage our time and to recognize our opportunities as mothers. We can obscure that calling by becoming independent of the home and its responsibilities. We can subordinate that calling by yielding to the pressures to postpone childbearing in favor of that which could wait for a later time or for eternity. We can cripple that calling by failing to prepare well for marriage and motherhood, failing to build the confidence and the faith to wait (even throughout time) for a worthy companion, or failing actively and continually to build a strong marriage.</i><br><br>And at last, in the maturing years of a woman's life, she will find herself with new perspectives, perhaps with new opportunities, as her family responsibilities decrease. No two women will face the same problems; but as you continue to pursue your education here and as you look forward to your life after you leave this campus, know that you are capable, with the help of your Heavenly Father, of meeting all the challenges that will come to you. If you have the roots of faith in God and the wings of faith in yourself that will carry you forth into the unknowns, upward toward the eternities, they will let you soar beyond the disciplines necessary in day-to-day living.<br><br>Go forward into the events of this conference on women and find yourselves challenged by what you see and hear. But never forget that the individual is the most important creation of God. Value yourself and be about your Father's business for your personal exaltation, and then love your fellowmen so much that you will help them do the same. Let this garden in Nauvoo, which is a reality because of you and women like you, be a constant reminder of the roots and the wings of your joyful living now and forever, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Barbara B.

<h1>d the Greatest of These Is Love&quot; - Gordon B. Hinckley - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I so greatly appreciated that music. I have never heard a rendering of "I Need Thee Every Hour" quite like that, nor one that has touched me more deeply. I did not know that it was Indian Week at BYU, or I might have spoken of these wonderful people. As it is, I shall speak to them, and to you also wonderful people.<br><br>It is so refreshing to stand before you. You give life, vitality, and beauty to the present, and assurance to the future. I always come here with a feeling of inadequacy. But today I feel a little more confident. At the close of a recent stake conference a teenage girl handed me a sealed envelope which I opened on the plane on the way home. It contained a letter that read in part:<br><br><i>Dear Brother Hinckley:</i><br><br><i>I just wanted to thank you for coming to our stake for this conference. That was really a neat message. ... I wanted to know if you know <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a style="color: #33cccc;" href="https://speeches.byu.edu/speakers/paul-h-dunn/" target="_blank">Paul Dunn</a></span>. He's my favorite speaker, and he's the one that dedicated our building. I haven't heard from him for a while, but you are every bit as good a speaker as he is.</i><br><br>Now, having established my credentials, and having sought the direction of the Holy Spirit, I wish to talk about something in which all of you are interested--something for which all of you long, which you need, and without which the world can indeed be a lonely and a dreary place. I do so because this is Valentine's Day.<br><br>On this day, when I was a little boy, we traded paper hearts at school, and at night we dropped them at the doors of our friends, stamping on the porch and then running in the dark to hide. Sometimes we would tie a fishing line to a valentine, and when the would-be receiver would go to pick it up we would pull the string. That happens in life with some of us.<br><br>Almost without exception these valentines had printed on their face the words, "I love you." I have since come to know that love is more than a paper heart. It is the very essence of life. It is the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. But it is not at the end of a rainbow; it is at the beginning, and from it springs the beauty that arches across the sky on a stormy day. It is the security for which children weep, the meat and drink of youth, the adhesive that binds marriage and the lubricant that prevents devastating friction in the home; it is the peace of old age, the sunlight of hope shining through death. How impoverished are those who lack it, and how rich those who have it!<br><br>For most of you here today, it is one of the reasons for your presence on campus. You are here because of the love of your parents, whose interest is your present and future happiness. You say you are here to gain an education, and I hope that is true. But in your hearts you know you are also here to find a companion, that someone with whom you hope you can fall in love, later marry, and then live happily with forever after. This is not an idle, idyllic dream. It happens. I know it happens; I have experienced it. And you know it happens and you hope and pray it will happen to you.<br><br>I am one who believes that love, like faith, is a gift of God. I agree with Pearl Buck, who said: "Love cannot be forced, love cannot be coaxed and teased. It comes out of heaven, unasked and unsought" (<i>The Treasure Chest,</i>p. 165).<br><br>Some of you have taken classes to prepare you the better for that hoped-for time. They may help qualify you, and each of us needs all the help he can get. But I am inclined to agree with Sydney Harris, the columnist, who wrote:<br><br><i>One of the grand errors we tend to make when we are young is supposing that a person is a bundle of qualities, and we add up the individual's good and bad qualities, like a bookkeeper working on debits and credits.</i><br><br><i>If the balance is favorable, we may decide to take the jump</i>[into marriage].<i>... The world is full of unhappy men and women who married their mates because ... it seemed to be a good investment.</i><br><br><i>Love, however, is not an investment; it is an adventure. And when the marriage turns out to be as dull and comfortable as a sound investment, the disgruntled party soon turns elsewhere for adventure, ...</i><br><br><i>Ignorant people are always saying, "I wonder what he sees in her," not realizing that what he sees in her (and what no one else can see in her) is the secret essence of love.</i><br><br><i>Entering a marriage calmly and rationally is like dancing a bacchanal calmly and rationally; it is a contradiction in terms. It takes into account everything except what is important--the spirit.</i>["Love and Marriage,"<i>Deseret News,</i>18 October 1977]<br><br>I had a friend who decided that his would be a scientific marriage--one built on the qualities of his wife, rather than his feelings for her. He lived in California in a large ward and a large stake where there were many attractive girls his own age. In the pursuit of his quest he made a chart. At the top of each column he set down some worthwhile quality such as beauty, education, ambition, a wealthy father, and so forth. Then down the side of his chart he wrote the names of all the girls he knew. He then graded each, and rated them in numerical order--1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. He proceeded to make his conquest.<br><br>Expectantly, he called Number 1; she refused to go out with him. Number 2 also had an excuse. Number 3 gambled on one date, the last; and he ended up marrying Number 4. A year later someone sent me a copy of the local paper in which my friend gave notice that he no longer would be responsible for debts incurred by his wife. Divorce followed shortly after that. Forty years have passed and my once-burned and loveless friend has never remarried.<br><br>I think of two other friends of about the same vintage, a boy and a girl. I knew them in the years of high school and university. He was a boy from a country town, plain in appearance, without money or apparent promise. He had grown up on a farm, and if he had any quality that was attractive it was the capacity to work. He carried bologna sandwiches in a brown paper bag for his lunch and swept the school floors to pay his tuition. But with all of his rustic appearance, he had a smile and a personality that seemed to sing of goodness. She was a city girl who had come out of a comfortable home, but she would never have qualified for a beauty contest. Her face was freckled, but she made the most of what she had in the quiet but attractive manner of her dressing and in the way she fixed her hair.<br><br>Something of magic took place between them. They fell in love. No one could understand why. There were far more promising boys for her and far more beautiful girls who might have interested him. But these two laughed and danced and studied together through those years. They married when people wondered how they could ever earn enough to stay alive. He struggled through his professional school and came out near the top of his class. She scrimped and saved and worked and prayed. She encouraged and sustained and when things were really tough she said quietly, "Somehow we'll make it." Buoyed by her faith in him, he kept going through those difficult years. Their children came, and together they loved them and nourished them and gave them the security that came of their own example of love for and loyalty to one another. Now forty-five years and more have passed. Their children are grown and are a credit to them, to the Church, and to the communities in which they live.<br><br>Recently, while riding a plane from New York, I walked down the aisle in the semi-darkness of the cabin and saw a woman, white-haired, her head on her husband's shoulder as she dozed and his hand clasped warmly about hers. He was awake and recognized me. She awakened when we began to talk. They, too, were returning from New York, where he had delivered a paper before one of the great learned societies of the nation. He said little about it, but she proudly spoke of the honors accorded him. Forty-five years ago people without understanding had asked what he saw in her and what she saw in him.<br><br>I thought of that as I returned to my seat on the plane. And I said to myself, their friends of those days saw only a farm boy from the country and a smiling girl with freckles on her nose. But these two saw in each other love, loyalty, peace, faith, and the future. Call it chemistry if you will; maybe there was a little of that, but there was much more. There was rather a flowering of something divine, planted there by that Father who is our God. In their school days they had lived worthy of that flowering. They had lived with virtue and faith, with appreciation and respect for self and one another. In the years of their difficult professional and economic struggles, they had found their greatest earthly strength in their companionship. Now in age they were finding their peace, their quiet satisfaction together. And beyond that they were assured of an eternity of joyful association under covenants long since made and promises long since given in the house of the Lord.<br><br>Reflecting on the picture I had just seen of these two happy people, there came into my mind these lines read long ago from Robert Louis Stevenson:<br><br><i>Trusty, dusky, vivid, true,</i><br><i>With eyes of gold and bramble-dew,</i><br><i>Steel true and blade straight</i><br><i>The great Artificer made my mate.</i><br><br><i>Honor, anger, valor, fire,</i><br><i>A love that life could never tire,</i><br><i>Death quench, or evil stir,</i><br><i>The mighty Master gave to her.</i><br><br><i>Teacher, tender comrade, wife,</i><br><i>A fellow-farer true through life,</i><br><i>Heart-whole and soul-free,</i><br><i>The August Father gave to me.</i><br>[<i>Elbert Hubbard's Scrapbook,</i>p. 69]<br><br>I could wish nothing better for each of you, my dear young friends, than love--the companionship of one dearer than any friend; someone to be deliriously excited over and to be happy with; someone to stir within you the very best that is there; someone to grow more appreciative of, more tender toward, more grateful for, more a part of as one year becomes another and life moves toward eternity. May the Lord answer your prayers with love, the kind that will always express itself in concern not for self but for your beloved companion.<br><br>And now I should like to step quickly beyond that boy-and-girl, husband-and-wife, father-and-mother relationship to a greater love for God and others. I quote:<br><br><i>Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,</i><br><br><i>Master, which is the great commandment in the law?</i><br><br><i>Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</i><br><br><i>This is the first and great commandment.</i><br><br><i>And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</i><br><br><i>On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</i>[Matthew 22:35–40]<br><br>This is the basic essence of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Listen to these great words of Paul:<br><br><i>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not</i>[love],<i>I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.</i><br><br><i>And though I have the gift of prophesy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not</i>[love],<i>I am nothing....</i><br><br>[Love]<i>never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.</i>[1 Corinthians 13:1–2, 8]<br><br>First, a word on love of neighbor. Who is my neighbor? Read again--read periodically, my brethren and sisters--the parable of the Good Samaritan. And also read again the words of the Lord concerning that day of judgment when the King shall<br><br><i>say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye, blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</i><br><br><i>For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink, I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</i><br><br><i>Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</i><br><br><i>Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</i><br><br><i>When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?</i><br><br><i>Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</i><br><br>[And he shall reply,]<i>... Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</i>[Matthew 25:34–40]<br><br>I heard a man of prominence say the other day, "I have amended the language of my prayers. Instead of saying, 'Bless the poor and the sick and the needy,' I now say, 'Father, show me how to help the poor and the sick and the needy, and give me resolution to do so.'"<br><br>In this, my brethren and sisters, lies the great challenge we face in our hurried, self-centered lives. Years ago I read the story of a young woman who went into a rural area as a schoolteacher. Among those in her class was a girl who had failed before and who was failing again. She could not read. She came from a family without means to take her to a larger city for examination to determine her problem. Sensing that the difficulty might lie with the girl's eyes, the young teacher arranged to take her at her own expense to have her eyes tested. A deficiency was discovered that could be corrected with glasses, and these the teacher purchased from her own purse. An entire new world opened to that girl as for the first time in her life she saw clearly the words before her. The salary of that country teacher was meager, but out of the little she had she made an investment that completely changed the life of a failing student; and in so doing she found a new dimension in her own life, an investment from which dividends came constantly as the years passed.<br><br>Every returned missionary in this hall could recount experiences of losing self in the service of others, and while doing so could add that it was the most rewarding time of his or her life. How is it that when we come home we have so much difficulty holding on to that spirit of love of neighbor?<br><br>Love is the only force that can compose the differences between people that can bridge the chasms of bitterness and animosity that so frequently and violently separate us. I call to mind these telling lines of Edwin Markham:<br><br><i>He drew a circle that shuts me out--</i><br><i>Heretic, rebel, a thing to flout.</i><br><i>But love and I had the wit to win:</i><br><i>We drew a circle that took him in.</i><br>[<i>The Book of American Poetry,</i>p. 265]<br><br>In St. Martin's Place in the city of London, across from the National Gallery, is a beautiful statue of a woman in a nurse's uniform. It is erected to the memory of Edith Cavell, the English nurse who shielded wounded Allied soldiers from the enemy. She was caught and summarily executed. The inscription on her monument reads: "Brussels Dawn, October 12, 1915. Patriotism is not enough. I must have no hatred or bitterness toward anyone."<br><br>He who most beautifully taught this everlasting truth was the Son of God, the one perfect example and teacher of love. His very coming to earth was an expression of his Father's love. "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life" (John 3:16).<br><br>I listened recently to the <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a style="color: #33cccc;" href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/marion-g-romney_jesus-savior-redeemer/" target="_blank">masterful address on the Atonement delivered at this pulpit by President Marion G. Romney</a></span> in which he spoke of the manifestation of love by the Son of God who gave his life that all men might live. The Savior spoke prophetically of his sacrifice and of the love that induced it when he declared: "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends" (John 15:13).<br><br>And so, on this day when we think of love in a secular sense, I wish also to remind you of its greater import in a sacred sense. If the world in which we live is to improve, that process must begin with a change in the hearts of men, with an upward looking beyond self to love for God, given with all of one's heart, with all of one's soul, with all of one's mind.<br><br>The Lord has declared in modern revelation, "If your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you" (D&amp;amp;C 88:67). As we look with love to him, as we serve with an eye single to his glory, there will go from us the darkness of sin, the darkness of selfishness, the darkness of pride. There will come an increased love for our Eternal Father and for his Beloved Son, our Savior and our Redeemer. There will come a greater sense of service toward our fellowmen--a little less of thinking of our own selfish pursuits, a little more of reaching out to others. And in our own individual lives as we seek for love and marriage, there will be a higher power on whom we can call for help and direction, a stronger resolution to live more worthy of a choice and wonderful companion with whom we may walk the way of immortality and eternal life. For this I humbly pray in behalf of each of you, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Gordon B.

<h1>sings of Adversity - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is always a special thrill and blessing to come upon this campus. My message today is simple, but one which you may not wish to hear. I have chosen to speak concerning the blessings of adversity. The theme was best expressed by the Lord when he said, "Be patient in afflictions, for thou shalt have many; but endure them, for, lo, I am with thee, even unto the end of thy days" (D&amp;amp;C 24:8).<br><br>During the past two years, and indeed for about five years of my life, I have lived in countries where most of the people are far below the poverty level of the United States. During this last period of time, as President Oaks indicated, we made our home in São Paulo, Brazil. During most of that time our neighbor to the north was constructing a new home. The carpenters, the tile setters, the plumbers, and the cabinet workers on that house received far below what we know as the minimum wage. In fact, some lived in a shack on the site. There was cold running water available from the end of a hose, but no warm or hot water. Their work day was from 6:00 a.m. till about 5:30 p.m. This meant that at about 5:00 in the morning they would begin to prepare their meals and get ready for work.<br><br>My college-age daughter, Lisa, could not help complaining that she was awakened almost every morning by their clarion-voiced singing. They sang, they laughed, they chattered--only occasionally unpleasantly--the whole day through. When I explained to Lisa how little money they made and how little they had she made an interesting observation, "But Dad, they seem so happy." And happy they were. Not one owned an automobile, nor even a bicycle--just the clothes on their backs--but they found life pleasant and fulfilling. We were reminded again how little it takes to make some people happy.<br><br>Many years ago when I was practicing law, I organized a company for one of the new car dealers in this area. I served as his legal counsel and a corporate officer for many years, and one of my sons has taken over my responsibilities as legal counsel. Recently we were both at his place of business. I noticed the rows and rows of beautiful, shiny, gleaming expensive new cars. Out of concern I mentioned to the proprietor that if he did not get those cars sold, the finance charges would be exorbitant and eat up the profits. My son said, "Dad, don't look at it that way. Look at all the profit those cars will bring."<br><br>While I think he was more right than I, it suddenly occurred to me that my son had never been through a depression. We looked at the problem through different eyes because I am a child of the Great Depression. I cannot forget what a merciless taskmaster debt is.<br><br>For some years we lived by a very skilled mechanic and his choice family. He was a specialist. He and his wife resolved never again to go into debt. This resolution was born of a bitter memory: when they were newly married and had their small family the depression came along, and skilled as he was he could not find a job. His home, along with the homes of many others, was foreclosed; and they lived through the depression in a chicken coop made reasonably comfortable through his mechanical skills.<br><br>We now have a generation many of whom perhaps have not fully known nor appreciated the refining blessings of adversity. Many have never been hungry because of want. Few have been forced not to do things because they did not have the money. Yet I am persuaded that there can be a necessary refining process in adversity which increases our understanding, enhances our sensitivity, and makes us more Christlike. Lord Byron said, "Adversity is the first path to truth" (<i>The International Dictionary of Thoughts,</i>p. 11). The lives of the Savior and his prophets clearly and simply teach how necessary adversity is to achieve a measure of greatness.<br><br>Edmund Burke defined it well when he said:<br><br><i>Adversity is a severe instructor, set over us by one who knows us better than we do ourselves, as He loves us better, too. He that wrestles with us, strengthens our nerves and sharpens our skill. Our antagonist is our helper. This conflict with difficulty makes us acquainted with our object and compels us to consider it in all its relations. It will not suffer us to be superficial.</i>[<i>The International Dictionary of Thoughts,</i>p. 11]<br><br>I would suppose that many of you students are having a difficult time making ends meet. Indeed, it may be very painful. It would, from your standpoint, be unkind to say that this experience may be good for you and may be remembered in more affluent times warmly and even with some fondness. One of my more successful cousins went through law school using much candlelight because he and his bride could not afford electricity to light the rooms.<br><br>The present general counsel of General Motors is a black. Without question he holds one of the most lucrative and prestigious positions for lawyers in all of the world. He was a poor boy and was required to obtain his education through heroic efforts and under circumstances that were difficult in the extreme. He was required to work one and two jobs regularly and, if I am not mistaken, occasionally three. He was asked if he felt uncomfortable among the highest-paid executives of the world; his answer was no. He said that most of them had been poor boys like him who had worked their way up, being tested, challenged, threatened, and discouraged. Adversity is the refiner's fire that bends iron but tempers steel.<br><br>It would appear that the shortage of energy will change our life styles. The president of Texaco, Mr. John McKinley, some time ago explained to a group in which I was present that in the United States, and even in the world, there are abundant sources of energy. But it will require that these be harnessed, and it will be more expensive because of the capital it takes to convert that energy into usable forms. This means that we will not be able in the future to be so profligate and wasteful of energy.<br><br>Hopefully, the quality of life will improve. It may mean that to be happy we are not going to be able to rely upon physical comforts and to satisfy our whims, but must learn to draw upon inner strengths and inner resources. It will likely mean that we will find our entertainment and pleasure in simpler things that do not cost money and are closer to home. Hopefully, it will mean the development of untapped inner strengths and resources that will bring an inner peace and a self-understanding so articulately explained by Anwar Sadat in a recent essay which no doubt many of you read in<i>Time</i>magazine. He related his experience of being confined in a British jail. Like Sadat, hopefully we will find ourselves and like ourselves better, be more at peace with our surroundings, and appreciate more our fellowmen. We will become less sated with the material and the mechanical and learn to cultivate a taste for bread and milk.<br><br>President David O. McKay said:<br><br><i>Today there are those who have met disaster which almost seems defeat, who have become somewhat soured in their natures; but if they stop to think, even the adversity which has come to them may prove a means of spiritual uplift. Adversity itself may lead toward and not away from God and spiritual enlightenment; and privation may prove a source of strength if we can but keep the sweetness of mind and spirit.</i>[David O. McKay,<i>Treasures of Life,</i>pp. 107–8]<br><br>May I suggest a few things which might be done to prepare us for a time when we are less affluent and possibly happier.<br><br>1. Wean ourselves away from dependence for our happiness upon mere material and physical things. This could mean a bicycle instead of a car, and walking instead of a bicycle. It may mean skim milk instead of cream.<br><br>2. Learn to do without many things and have some reserve to fall back on. A recent article in Indiana concerning the present coal crisis and telling of a member of the Church there, a coal miner with a year's supply, brought much publicity and attention in the newspapers.<br><br>3. Develop an appreciation for the great gifts of God as found in nature, in the beauty of the seasons; the eloquent testimony of God in the sunrise and the sunsets, the leaves, the flowers, the birds and the animals.<br><br>4. Engage in more physical activity that does not employ the use of hydrocarbons, including walking, jogging, swimming, and bicycling.<br><br>5. Have a hobby that involves your mind and your heart and can be done at home.<br><br>6. Pay your tithes and offerings. The keeping of this commandment will not insure riches--indeed, there is no assurance of being free from economic problems--but it will smooth out the rough spots, give the resolution and faith to understand and accept, and create a communion with the Savior which will enhance the inner core of strength and stability. "Who hath not known ill fortune never knew himself or his own virtue," said David Mallett (<i>The International Dictionary of Thoughts,</i>p. 12).<br><br>7. Develop the habit of singing or, if this is not pleasant, whistling. Singing to oneself will bring less comment and question than talking to oneself. My father one time came home from a deer hunt empty-handed, but his heart was renewed and his spirit lifted. He recounted with great appreciation that one of his companions had frightened the deer away because he was always singing trumpet-voiced to himself as he walked through the pines and the quaking aspen. Father was more enriched by the mirth of the song than by the meat of the venison.<br><br>In life we all have our Gethsemanes. A Gethsemane is a necessary experience, a growth experience. A Gethsemane is a time to draw near to God, a time of deep anguish and suffering. The Gethsemane of the Savior was without question the greatest suffering that has ever come to mankind, yet out of it came the greatest good in the promise of eternal life. One of the lessons learned by the Savior in his Gethsemane was declared by Paul to the Hebrews:<br><br><i>Though he were a Son, yet learned in obedience by the things which he suffered:</i><br><br><i>And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;</i><br><br><i>Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchizedek.</i>[Hebrews 5:8–10]<br><br>The image of the Savior to many from a public relations standpoint was described by Isaiah: "He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not" (Isaiah 53:30).<br><br>Perhaps in all literature, sacred or profane, there is none more eloquent than the 121st, 122nd, and 123rd sections of the Doctrine and Covenants received and written by Joseph Smith the Prophet while in the Liberty Jail in the spring of 1839.<br><br><i>O God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place?</i><br><br><i>How long shall thy hand be stayed, and thine eye, yea thy pure eye, behold from the eternal heavens the wrongs of thy people and of thy servants, and thine ear be penetrated with their cries?</i><br><br><i>Yeah, O Lord, how long shall they suffer these wrongs and unlawful oppressions, before thine heart shall be softened toward them, and thy bowels be moved with compassion toward them?</i><br><br>[Then comes the promised relief:]<i>My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;</i><br><br><i>And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.</i><br><br><i>Thy friends do stand by thee, and they shall hail thee again with warm hearts and friendly hands.</i><br><br><i>Thou art not yet as Job; thy friends do not contend against thee, neither charge thee with transgression, as they did Job.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:1–3, 7–10]<br><br>Out of these circumstances also came the great promise of verse 26 in this same section: "God shall give unto you knowledge by his Holy Spirit, yeah, by the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost, that has not been revealed since the world was until now."<br><br>But the Prophet Joseph Smith was warned:<br><br><i>The ends of the earth shall inquire after thy name, and fools shall have thee in derision, and hell shall rage against thee;</i><br><br><i>While the pure in heart, and the wise, and the noble, and the virtuous, shall seek counsel and authority, and blessings constantly from under thy hand.</i><br><br><i>And the people shall never be turned against thee by the testimony of traitors.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 122:1–3]<br><br>In this adversity also came these great truths recorded in the 121st section:<br><br><i>Hence many are called, but few are chosen.</i><br><br><i>No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned;</i><br><br><i>By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guile--</i><br><br><i>Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost</i>[I am not always able to determine when I am "moved upon by the Holy Ghost"];<i>and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy;</i><br><br><i>That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords of death.</i><br><br><i>Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.</i><br><br><i>The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and the scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:40–46]<br><br>Why is adversity often such a good schoolmaster? Is it because adversity teaches so many things? Through difficult circumstances we are often forced to learn discipline and how to work. In often unpleasant circumstances we may also be subjected to a buffeting, honing, and polishing that can come in no other way. Most of your leaders in the General Authorities are familiar with adversity. They have not been and are not exempt. Allow me to illustrate by telling you something of three that I have selected only because of their great familiarity with difficulty.<br><br>Early in life, President Kimball learned the necessity of work. He had many painful experiences in his early years preparatory to his great ministry. As a young boy he nearly drowned once, suffered Bells Palsy, lost his mother through death, while still a young man lost his beloved sister Ruth, and shortly after marriage contracted smallpox, at which time Sister Kimball counted 125 pustules on his face.<br><br>He learned early about financial reverses and lost some investments. Like Job, he suffered from boils which continued for many years, and on one occasion came onto his nose and lips. Once he suffered 24 boils at one time; and not long thereafter he began to suffer the excruciating pain of heart attacks that recurred for many years and finally resulted in open-heart surgery. He became bothered by a hoarseness in his voice; it was relieved through a blessing of the Brethren, but it later returned along with the boils. A serious cancer in the vocal cords, it required surgery and thereafter voice training and cobalt treatments. Also, the Bells Palsy returned temporarily and skin cancers had to be removed.<br><br>The result of his refiner's fire was that he came forward with a refined spirit, a sensitive and understanding heart, and a kindness and humility that are unparalleled. President Kimball can be described in the words which the Lord spoke concerning Job. May I read in the book of Job, substituting the name Spencer for Job: "Hast thou considered my servant [Spencer], that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? And still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedest me against him, to destroy him without cause" (Job 2:3).<br><br>I have always been interested in the background of President Eldon Tanner. At this University some years ago, President Tanner recalled his humble and difficult beginnings. Speaking of his parents, he said,<br><br><i>When they arrived in Southern Alberta, Father had no money, and he had to sell his team in order to finance. But the thing I have always been pleased about was that Father never thought of calling on the government. He went and worked for his neighbor, and he broke horses so they would have horses to use. He lived in a dugout on a homestead where I lived the first part of my life. He often said, "I bet ten dollars against a quarter section of land of the Dominion Government that I could make a go of it. I nearly succeeded." He also said, "You know, when I came to this country</i>[referring to Canada]<i>I didn't have a rag on my back; now I am all rags."</i><br><br>[President Tanner continues,]<i>We lived after that in a little hamlet. I don't suppose this would be of interest to you, but in that little hamlet we didn't even have a telephone. We didn't have a daily paper; we didn't have a weekly paper--regularly. We had no running water--hot or cold water. So you can imagine other things we didn't have! We had no central heating, you can be sure of that. In fact, I often wondered if we had any heating in the house.</i>[President Nathan Eldon Tanner, "My Experiences and Observations," speech given at Brigham Young University, May 17, 1966]<br><br>From these difficult beginnings came the giant we know as Nathan Eldon Tanner. He was a speaker of the Alberta Legislature, Minister of Mines and Lands in the province, president of the Trans-Canadian Pipeline, branch president, bishop, stake president, Assistant to the Council of the Twelve, apostle, and counselor to four Presidents of the Church.<br><br>I should like to share with you an incident or two in the early life of President Marion G. Romney, best told in his own words:<br><br><i>I'm a Mexican by birth. I was born in Colonia Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico. My parents happened to be down there at the time. I was raised there until I was about fifteen years old. During the last two or three of those years, the Madero Revolution was in progress. The rebels and the federalists were chasing each other through the country; each taking everything we colonists had, by way of arms and ammunition and by way of supplies. Finally we were forced to leave. I came out of Mexico with the Mormon refugees in 1912.</i><br><br><i>I remember I had a very thrilling experience on the way from where we lived to the railroad station about eight miles south of Colonia Juarez. We went in a wagon. ... I was riding with my mother and her seven children and my uncle (her brother) and his family of about five or six children. ... We had one trunk--that was all we were able to bring. I was seated on the trunk in the back of the wagon. ... The Mexican rebel army was coming up the valley from the railroad station toward our town. They were not in formation. They were riding their saddle horses. Their guns were in the scabbards. Two of them stopped us and searched us. They said they were looking for guns. We didn't have any guns or ammunition. They did find $20 on my uncle--pesos, not dollars. ... They took that and waved us on. They went up the road about as far as from here to the back of this room, stopped, turned around, drew their guns from their scabbards, and pointed them down the road at me. As I looked up the barrels of those guns, they looked like cannons to me. They didn't pull their triggers, however, as evidenced by the fact that I am here to tell the story. That was a very thrilling experience! One of my maturing experiences.</i><br><br>[President Romney continues,]<i>The rebels blew up the railroad track after the train we were on passed over it. Later, Father and the rest of the men came out to El Paso, Texas, on horseback. We never returned nor did we recover any of our property while my father lived.</i><br><br><i>Father and I went to work to earn a living for his large family. There were no welfare programs then. We had a difficult time making a living. We had to "root hot" or die.</i>[Marion G. Romney, speech at Salt Lake Institute of Religion, October 18, 1974]<br><br>I had the opportunity to see how well President Romney handles a trowel when he laid the cornerstone for the São Paulo Temple. President Romney said, "Going to school but part time, it took me from 1918 to 1932 to get through college."<br><br>After he was married and his family was started, he worked full time at the post office in order to provide for his family while he went through law school. In these difficult conditions his marks were so high and his scholarship so excellent that he was later admitted to the Order of the Coif. The Order of the Coif admits only the most distinguished law scholars. I was never invited to join that organization.<br><br>Someone has said that among the law students the "A" students make the professors, the "B" students make the judges, and the "C" students make the money. President Romney and I both proved that adage wrong because President Romney did not become a law professor and I did not make a fortune. He practiced law and became a bishop, stake president, one of the first Assistants to the Twelve, a member of the Council of the Twelve, and, as we know, has given great service as a counselor in the First Presidency to two Presidents. He has demonstrated his great love and compassion for people through his many years of guidance in the welfare program of the Church.<br><br>Indeed, the difficult and adverse experiences of these three Brethren are comparable to experiences in the lives of many others of your leaders, and I have mentioned only these three because it seemed to me that their familiarity with adversity was more than ample.<br><br>Thomas Paine wrote:<br><br><i>I love the man who can smile in trouble, who can gather strength in distress and grow brave by reaction. 'Tis the business of little minds to shrink, but he whose heart is firm, and whose conscience approves his conduct, will pursue his principles to the death.</i><br><br>I wish to invoke the blessings of the Almighty God upon you choice and chosen young people who are held in such high esteem. Much is expected of you. Do not presume, because the way is at times difficult and challenging, that our Heavenly Father is not mindful of you. He is rubbing off the rough edges and sensitizing you for your great responsibilities ahead. I ask his blessings to be upon you spiritually, and pray that your footsteps might be guided along the paths of truth and righteousness. I promise you the rich and rewarding blessings of selfless service, and wish you to know that by the personal gift of the Holy Ghost I have come to know that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that he was crucified for the sins of the world.<br><br>I wish to conclude as I began, "Be patient in afflictions, for thou shalt have many; but endure them, for, lo, I am with thee, even unto the end of thy days." In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>James E. Faust was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 21 February 1978.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>st of the Book of Mormon - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
President Oaks and fellow students, I am honored by the invitation to be here today. If the Lord will give me utterance and grant his spirit to help me and all of us, in the spirit of Brother Hickman's prayer, I would like to address a few words to you about the Christ of the Book of Mormon.<br><br>The word "Christ" is the past participle of a Greek verb and "Jesus" is a Hebrew-Jewish proper name. Both mean "the anointed one." Together they represent the greatest name in earthly human history. Critics and partially informed, well-meaning humanists may criticize the Christian movement--pointing out, for example, that despite the descriptions in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke there is no peace nor goodwill on earth; and that despite "two thousand years" of Christianity, things are in a mess. Why, they say, if he was such an all-powerful God, have he and his Almighty Father not made things better? The answers lie in two considerations. Both are made more clear in the Book of Mormon than in any other scripture.<br><br>The first consideration is that the Father's plan, executed by the Son, is based on the free agency of man. As Lehi explained to his son Jacob in that great passage of 2 Nephi 2:25–27--which to my way of thinking puts in small compass the essence of the gospel as well as any phrases we have--<br><br><i>Adam fell that men might be; and men are that they might have joy.</i><br><br><i>And the Messiah cometh in the fullness of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall. And because that they are redeemed from the fall they have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon, save it be by the punishment of the law at the great and last day, according to the commandments which God hath given.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man.</i>And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great mediation of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil;<i>for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.</i>[emphasis added]<br><br>The wars, contentions, and social miseries of mankind are a consequence of man's freedom, God-guaranteed, to choose for themselves their conduct and their use of power and influence. Only by freedom of choice can man enjoy life and improve himself by self-help and service to others.<br><br>The second consideration is that the critics of Christ and Christianity overlook such facts as this: that the influence of Jesus' teachings, especially since the Advent, have penetrated the globe--not completely, to be sure; yet Christmas is noted, if not celebrated, nearly everywhere. The calendar and airline schedules in world use are reckoned in terms of Anno Domini--A.D.--the year of our Lord, wherever one goes. Even communism, according to Arnold J. Toynbee, is a page torn from the pages of Christianity, inverted, and misread (see D. C. Somerville's abridgment of Toynbee's<i>A Study of History</i>1:203–5, 399–400, 446–47; 2:148, 184, 216, 315, 339–40).<br><br>The Book of Mormon promotes the fuller and clearer meaning in history of Jesus Christ. As the title page declares, "it is an abridgment of the record" of the people of the American continent, "of the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that JESUS is the CHRIST, the ETERNAL GOD, manifesting himself unto all nations."<br><h2><b>Why So Much Mention of Christ in the Book?</b></h2><br>Many may ask, despite the title page's express purpose, how and why there is so much explicit mention of Christ's coming and his redeeming role in the Book of Mormon. Why, specifically, is there so much recorded about his birth, life, and mission before his actual birth in Bethlehem of Judea took place? Are these repeated references made six, five, four, and other centuries B.C. not clear evidence that Joseph Smith, between 1823 and 1829, invented the book, inserting his biblical understanding and the prevailing Christian thought of the early nineteenth-century American frontier? Let us consider.<br><br>Joseph Smith brought forth the Book of Mormon before Edgar Allan Poe invented the detective story, before Sir Arthur Conan Doyle created the complicated schemes which Sherlock Holmes unraveled, long before Agatha Christie. To presume that Joseph Smith invented the character Mormon as an editor, compiler, and abridger nearly 400 years after Christ who could then refer to records kept from the preceding thousand years is a great compliment! Then to have this Mormon produce a digest or abridgment of these thousand years of records, written by more than a score of official historians, would represent one of the most complicated literary inventions ever seen at that time. H. G. Wells'<i>War of the Worlds</i>or Jules Verne's invention of Captain Nemo appears to me to be much less complicated. And Wells and Verne were stimulated by a much more complicated generation than western New York was for the Prophet Joseph Smith in the 1820s. The correct answer, of course, is given on the title page:<br><p align="CENTER"><i>THE</i><br><i>BOOK OF MORMON</i><br><i>An Account Written by</i><br><i>THE HAND OF MORMON</i><br><i>UPON PLATES</i><br><i>TAKEN FROM THE PLATES OF NEPHI</i></p><br><i>Wherefore, it is an abridgment of the record of the people of Nephi, and also of the Lamanites ... to come forth in due time by way of the Gentile--The interpretation thereof by the gift of God. ...</i><br><h2><b>The Role Explained</b></h2><br>How explain, then, the role of Christ as so widely portrayed in the Book of Mormon even before the Advent? I believe that there are three simple,<i>prima facie</i>reasons: (1) the influence of the brass plates of Laban; (2) the historical impact of Christ's personal ministry in the Americas, and (3) the consequent perspective from which Mormon made his abridgment.<br><br>Of course we realize that the expedition led by Lehi had with it the brass plates of Laban (see 1 Nephi 3, 4, and 5). This record contained (1) the five books of Moses; (2) "a record of the Jews from the beginning, even down to the commencement of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah;" (3) "the prophecies of the holy prophets, from the beginning, even down to the commencement of the reign of Zedekiah;" (4) "many prophecies ... by ... Jeremiah;" and finally, (5) a genealogy of Lehi's father, through Joseph "who was the son of Jacob" (see 1 Nephi 5:11–16).<br><br>Nephi recorded that "it was wisdom in the Lord that we should carry them with us, as we journeyed in the wilderness towards the land of promise" (1 Nephi 5:22). Later, showing the influence of this record, Lehi and his son Nephi taught continually from the brass plates; especially wrote Nephi, "that I might more fully persuade them to believe in the Lord their Redeemer I did read unto them that which was written by the prophet Isaiah" (1 Nephi 19:23). Some fifteen chapters of Nephi are reproductions of the prophecies of Isaiah (1 Nephi 20, 21; 2 Nephi 12–24).<br><br>It should be recalled that Isaiah's prophecies are very potent and very influential. For example, they constitute much of George Frederick Handel's masterpiece,<i>Messiah.</i>Isaiah certainly from the brass plates influenced Book of Mormon religious thought and practice. The Essenes, as the Dead Sea Scrolls revealed, practiced baptism by immersion before Christ; Book of Mormon peoples, guided by the brass plates and revelation (which their religious leaders earnestly sought), did likewise. This Mormon's abridgment clearly portrays.<br><br>The people of Lehi had the prophetic words of Isaiah, chapter 7, for example: "Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and shall bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel" (2 Nephi 17:14). Another one, from Isaiah, chapter 9: "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called, Wonderful, Counselor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace" (2 Nephi 19:6).<br><br>Nephi thought it important to include in his small plates these prophecies, and Mormon chose not to disturb the small plates of Nephi, but to include them in the legacy of his abridgment. As Nephi himself wrote: "And now I write some of the words of Isaiah, that whoso of my people shall see these words may lift up their hearts and rejoice for all men" (2 Nephi 11:8). So the brass plates had their impact, as reflected in the Book of Mormon before Christ.<br><br>Then we have to consider the tremendous impact of the personal ministry of the resurrected Lord in the Americas. Mormon, we believe, lived from about A.D. 311 to 385. He had before him the records made by "Third Nephi," the son of Nephi, who was the son of Helaman; also the records by this man's son and grandsons whose names were Amos, Amos, (see 4 Nephi 19, 21) and Ammaron (see 4 Nephi 47). And these records, abridged by Mormon and organized as 3 and 4 Nephi, report: (1) the signs of the Savior's birth (3 Nephi 1:19); (2) his appearance (following his resurrection) in the land Bountiful (3 Nephi 11:3–11); (3) an extensive account of Christ's ministry in America (3 Nephi 11–28), including the establishment of his church, something that we do not find clearly in the four Gospels; and finally, (4) the record of marvelous results and effects which followed, particularly the nearly two centuries when "there was no contention in the land, because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people" (4 Nephi 15). For Mormon, the reluctant chief captain in the wars that destroyed his people, in the midst of their wickedness ("and," he wrote, "there never had been so great wickedness among all the children of Lehi" [Mormon 4:12]), this period of Christian love and peace must have struck him with unusual force. This factor alone would have influenced his selection of gospel influence or neglect, in his abridgment, and explains why we hear so much of the pre-existent Christ, the antemortal Christ, in the early records, before his appearance in the land Bountiful.<br><br>Finally, Mormon made his abridgment with clear perspective of the influence of the brass plates. He had knowledge of Christ's coming because he lived after the fact, and he had knowledge of the awful consequences of the carelessness and evil into which the Nephites had drifted thereafter. He wrote in his own book, "<i>I write a small abridgment ...</i>" (Mormon 5:9; emphasis added). That he would include in his "small abridgment" all that he could possibly glean of the Messianic hope, influence and doctrine, even before Christ, is natural. He was keenly aware of the stark contrasts that exist between human choices based on Christian doctrine and the choices made in ignorance of, or contrary to, Christ's teachings. In the explanatory Words of Mormon, that little book inserted between the books of Omni and Mosiah, he engraved this:<br><br><i>And now I, Mormon, being about to deliver up the record which I have been making into the hands of my son Moroni, behold I have witnessed almost all the destruction of my people, the Nephites.</i><br><br><i>And it is many hundred years after the coming of Christ that I deliver these records into the hands of my son; and it supposeth me that he will witness the entire destruction of my people.</i>But may God grant that he may survive, that he may write somewhat concerning them, and somewhat concerning Christ, that perhaps some day it may profit them. [Words of Mormon 1–2; emphasis added]<br><br>He also stated in verse 4 that he placed the small plates of Nephi with his abridgment "because of the prophecies of the coming of Christ" contained therein, "knowing that many of them have been fulfilled"; he knew them as facts when he wrote centuries later. Said he, "Wherefore, I chose these things, to finish my record upon them ...; and I cannot write the hundredth part of the things of my people" (Words of Mormon 5).<br><br>Thus Mormon's purpose was clear in abridging what came to us through Joseph Smith as the Book of Mormon. He chose and selected these portions of the accumulated record that testified of the Christ who was to come. Significant portions of Christ's teachings that he was unable to include in 3 Nephi--which he abridged himself--his son Moroni, inspired by his father's example and instruction, included in his final book, the book of Moroni.<br><br>What emerges, then, from Mormon's abridgment--the Book of Mormon--of the Lord Jesus Christ?<br><br>First, he is seen as the Son of the Father, the Only Begotten of the Father, and--a point not made clear in the Bible--the Organizer and Creator of the Earth which rejoiced (at least in the Americas) with radiant light at his mortal birth and was rent in travail at his death.<br><br>Second, the premortal Christ is revealed as Jehovah, the Creator, the Lord, the directing intelligence, under the Father, of his world.<br><br>Third--and I got this from Edgar Goodspeed's book<i>How to Read the Bible,</i>which impressed me--Goodspeed says that Mark records the doer, Matthew the teacher, Luke the compassionate Savior; and John, who wrote forty or fifty years after the others and had time to reflect on the significance of his association with Christ, reveals him as the universal Lord--not just someone for Judea or the Middle East, but the<i>universal</i>Lord. The Book of Mormon extends that description and portrays Christ as the living head and organizer of his church, as well as being the universal Lord of light, life, and salvation for all mankind. The first principles, ordinances, and spirit of the Church are clearly specified: how to baptize, how to confer the priesthood, how to confer the gift of the Holy Ghost, how to administer the sacred emblems--the bread and wine--all of which are mentioned in the four Gospels but not specified. Thanks to Mormon and Moroni, we have in the Book of Mormon specific help on how the church of Christ should be organized as he organized it himself, and a description of the spirit which should characterize it. There should be no contention in it--a very difficult standard to attain. But these great principles and ordinances and spirit are clearly specified. In addition, some guidelines for the Church are clearly recorded, against which future Church practices might be measured.<br><br>And finally, from beginning to end, the Book of Mormon provides for the glorious doctrine that the gospel of Jesus Christ is for all mankind, in all nations, extending the injunction that we find in Matthew, Mark, and Luke.<br><br>It is a privilege to come to this University, this community of intellect and faith, where you have the marvelous privilege and opportunity to reflect upon spiritual things in connection with your mathematics, your physics, your sociology, or whatever field you may be entering. I would like to give you my testimony that the privilege you are enjoying on this campus is one of the great privileges of your life. President Oaks was kind enough to say that I know something about universities, and I believe I do, having spent my life in universities and colleges for more years than I am willing to admit. But I would like to say that you are unusually privileged to be at this particular university at this particular time. Make the most of it! Demonstrate in your lives the vitality of that system of truth, the gospel of Jesus. May it be so, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>This devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 7 March 1978.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i>
<h1>essage: Because I Live, Ye Shall Live Also - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
This has been a glorious Easter for us. For three and one-half hours the Council of the Twelve met in the temple this morning in our semiannual testimony meeting. Following that my wife and I went to our ward fast and testimony meeting, then visited Elder Stapley in the hospital. I am happy to report that he looks better and is better. Now we have come here tonight to conclude this glorious Easter day we shall long remember.<br><br>It is always a personal thrill and honor for me to be in the presence of you, the youth of Zion--"the rising generation," as the Book of Mormon calls you (see Mosiah 26:1; Alma 5:49). As the ancient apostle declared on the Mount of Transfiguration, "It is good for us to be here" (Matthew 17:4). I have been uplifted and inspired by the fitting, lovely music provided this Easter evening. Tonight I want to share my love, appreciation, and testimony concerning our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. I love the Master, our divine Redeemer.<br><br>It is a sacred honor to bear witness to the divine mission of Jesus Christ; to represent His great Church; to be an ambassador of truth to our Father's children; and to be called by a prophet of the Lord to go into the world and proclaim the glad tidings that God has again spoken from the heavens, that He still communicates with men on the earth, and that the pure gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored to the earth in its fullness for the last time. I rejoice in this glorious privilege, thank the Lord for this rich opportunity and blessing, and bear solemn witness to the truth of the message we carry to the world.<br><br>We meet here at this great University with a prayer of gratitude in our hearts and on our lips for the privilege of living in this choice period when the light of truth has burst forth. We meet in a great Christian nation--a nation with a solid spiritual foundation--but a nation which has departed in great measure from the basic principles of its founders. May God help us, as His covenant people, "to arise and shine forth" and be a standard for the nations and a light to the world, as the Lord has commanded us (see D&amp;amp;C 115:5).<br><br>As a people we have just joined with others of the Christian world in the celebration of Easter. It is therefore most fitting that we consider together that most glorious event, the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>There has been considerable publicity and media coverage recently on the reporting of experiences which seemingly verify that "life after life" is a reality. The ancient prophet's question, asked centuries ago, has been revived. Job asked, "If a man die, shall he live again?" (Job 14:14). In other words, what happens to a person once he dies? A definite answer to that question is provided by the Savior's ministry in the spirit world following his crucifixion, death, and burial.<br><br>Even before the fall of Adam, which ushered death into the world, our Heavenly Father had prepared a place for the spirits who would eventually depart this mortal life. At the time of Jesus' death, the spirit world was occupied by hosts of our Father's children who had died--Adam's posterity down to the death of Jesus, both the righteous and the wicked. There were two grand divisions in the world of spirits. Spirits of the righteous (the just) had gone to paradise, a state of happiness and a place of peace and restful work. The spirits of the wicked (the unjust) had gone to prison, a state of darkness and misery (see Alma 40:12–15). Jesus went only to the righteous--to paradise.<br><br>What I read to you now is a portion of a glorious vision of the redemption of the dead, given to President Joseph F. Smith and sustained and accepted by the Church as holy scripture in April of 1976.<br><br><i>Gathered together in one place</i>[was]<i>an innumerable company of the spirits of the just, who had been faithful in the testimony of Jesus while they lived in mortality;</i><br><br><i>. . . Who had . . . suffered tribulation in their Redeemer's name.</i><br><br><i>All these had departed the mortal life, firm in the hope of a glorious resurrection.</i><br><br><i>. . . They were filled with joy and gladness, and were rejoicing together because the day of their deliverance was at hand.</i><br><br><i>They were assembled awaiting the advent of the Son of God into the spirit world, to declare their redemption from the bands of death.</i><br><br><i>. . . While this vast multitude waited and conversed, rejoicing in the hour of their deliverance from the chains of death, the Son of God appeared, declaring liberty to the captives who had been faithful;</i><br><br><i>And there he preached to them the everlasting gospel, the doctrine of the resurrection and the redemption of mankind from the fall, and from individual sins on conditions of repentance.</i><br><br><i>. . . The saints rejoiced in the redemption, and bowed the knee and acknowledged the Son of God as their Redeemer and Deliverer from death and the chains of hell.</i><br><br><i>Their countenances shone, and the radiance from the presence of the Lord rested upon them, and they sang praises unto his holy name.</i>[JFS Vision 12–16, 18–19, 23–24]<br><br>Jesus did not go to the wicked, nor to prison. They were those who were unrepentant and "who had defiled themselves while in the flesh." Again I quote:<br><br><i>From among the righteous,</i>[the Lord]<i>organized his forces and appointed messengers, clothed with power and authority, and commissioned them to go forth and carry the light of the gospel to them that were in darkness. . . .</i><br><br><i>These were taught faith in God, repentance from sin, vicarious baptism for the remission of sins, the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands,</i><br><br><i>And all other principles of the gospel that were necessary for them to know in order to qualify themselves that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.</i>[JFS Vision 20, 30, 33–34]<br><br>The spirit world is not far away. Our work is all one great program on both sides of the veil. Sometimes the veil between this life and the life beyond becomes very thin. This I know! Our loved ones who have passed on are not far from us. One Church president asked the question, "But where is the spirit world?" and then answered his own question. "It is right here. . . . Do [spirits] go beyond the boundaries of this organized earth? No, they do not. They are brought forth upon this earth, for the express purpose of inhabiting it to all eternity" (Brigham Young et al.,<i>Journal of Discourses</i>3:369; hereinafter cited as<i>JD</i>). He said also,<br><br><i>When the spirits leave their bodies they are in the presence of our Father and God, they are prepared then to see, hear and understand spiritual things. . . . If the Lord would permit it, and it was His will that it should be done, you could see the spirits that have departed from this world, as plainly as you now see bodies with your natural eyes.</i>[<i>JD</i>3:368]<br><br>What, then, is death like? Here is a simple incident as told by my friend, Dr. Peter Marshall, the late chaplain of the United States Senate:<br><br><i>In a certain home, a little boy, the only son, was ill with an incurable disease. Month after month the mother had tenderly nursed him, but as the weeks went by and he grew no better, the little fellow gradually began to understand the meaning of death and he, too, realized that soon he was to die. One day his mother had been reading the story of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, and as she closed the book the boy lay silent for a moment, then asked the question that had been laying on his heart. "Mother, what is it like to die? Mother, does it hurt?" Quick tears filled her eyes. She sprang to her feet and fled to the kitchen, supposedly to go get something. She prayed on the way a silent prayer that the Lord would tell her what to say, and the Lord did tell her. Immediately she knew how to explain it to him. She said, as she returned from the kitchen, "Kenneth, you will remember when you were a little boy, you would play so hard you were too tired to undress and you tumbled into your mother's bed and fell asleep. In the morning you would wake up and much to your surprise, you would find yourself in your own bed. In the night your father would pick you up in his big, strong arms and carry you to your own bedroom. Kenneth, death is like that; we just wake up one morning to find ourselves in the room where we belong because the Lord Jesus loves us." The lad's shining face looked up and told her there would be no more fear, only love and trust in his heart as he went to meet the Father in heaven. He never questioned again and several weeks later he fell asleep, just as she had said. This is what death is like.</i>[Catherine Marshall,<i>A Man Called Peter,</i>pp. 260–61]<br><br>Yes, indisputably there is life after death. Mortality is a place of temporary duration--and so is the spirit world. As inevitable as death is to mortals, so also is an eventual resurrection to those in the spirit world.<br><br>On the third day following Jesus' crucifixion, there was a great earthquake. The stone was rolled back from the door of the tomb. Some of the women among the most devoted of his followers came to the place with spices "and found not the body of the Lord Jesus." Luke said that angels appeared and said simply, "Why seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen"(Luke 24:5, 6).<br><br>There is nothing in history to equal that dramatic announcement: "He is not here, but is risen."<br><br>The greatest events of history are those which affect the greatest number for the longest periods. By this standard, no event could be more important to individuals or nations than the resurrection of the Master. The eventual resurrection of every soul who has lived and died on earth is a scriptural certainty, and surely there is no event for which one should make more careful preparation. A glorious resurrection should be the goal of every man and woman, for it is a reality; nothing is more absolutely universal than the resurrection. Every living being will be resurrected. "As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive" (1 Corinthians 15:22). Almost immediately after the glorious resurrection of the Lord, Matthew records:<br><br><i>And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,</i><br><br><i>And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.</i>[Matthew 27:52–53]<br><br>Yes, the resurrection of Jesus Christ was and is a glorious reality. He became "the firstfruits of them that slept" (1 Corinthians 15:20). He truly rose from the tomb the third day, as he and his prophets foretold, and became in very deed "the resurrection, and the life" (John 11:25). He broke the bands of death for all of us. We, too, will be resurrected. Our spirits will be reunited with our bodies, never to be separated.<br><br>There is abundant testimony and verification to the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Few principles of the gospel, if any, have greater scriptural support, than the resurrection. The witnesses are many. The risen Lord appeared to several women, to the two disciples on the road to Emmaus, to Peter, to the Apostles, and "after that," as reported by Paul, "he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once. . . . And last of all," continued Paul, "he was seen of me also" (1 Corinthians 15:6, 8).<br><br>Throughout the forty days following his resurrection the Lord manifested himself at intervals and gave instructions in things pertaining to the kingdom of God. Much that he said and did is not written, but such things as are recorded, John assures us, "are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name" (John 20:31).<br><br>He had told his followers that he must soon ascend to his Father in heaven. And as the time of his ascension drew nigh, the Lord in that last solemn interview gave his parting instructions to his disciples. And when Christ and the disciples had gone "as far as to Bethany," where Mary, Martha, and Lazarus lived, the Lord "lifted up his hands, and blessed them." And while he yet spoke he rose from their midst until "a cloud received him out of their sight." As the apostles stood gazing steadfastly upward, two personages clothed in white apparel appeared by them. They spoke unto the eleven saying, "Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven" (see Luke 24:50–51; Acts 1:9–11).<br><br>Worshipfully and with great joy the apostles returned to Jerusalem. The Lord's ascension was accomplished. It was truly a literal departure of a material being, as his resurrection had been an actual return of his spirit to his own physical body. Now the disciples began to comprehend more fully some of his last words: "Be of good cheer; I have overcome the world" (John 16:33). Because of Christ, the grave has no permanent victory. Death has been overcome.<br><br>He lives today; of that I bear solemn witness. This same Jesus has already come to earth in our day. The resurrected Christ--glorified, exalted, the God of this world under the Father--appeared to the boy Joseph Smith in 1820. This same Jesus--the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of Moses, the Creator of this earth--has come in our day. He was introduced by the Father to Joseph Smith with these words: "This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!" (Joseph Smith 2:17). There are some in our midst who sponsor the sophistry that this appearance of God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, was not literal, that it was probably a product of the Prophet's imaginings. That is an absolute falsehood. It is not only an attempt to discredit the testimony of Joseph Smith; it would discredit the testimony of Jesus himself who literally appeared to the Prophet as a witness of His own resurrection.<br><br>The appearance of God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ to the boy prophet is the greatest event that has occurred in this world since the resurrection of the Master. As the restored Church of Jesus Christ, we humbly and gratefully bear witness to all men. This message is a world message. It is the truth, intended for all our Father's children. Hear now the further testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon, who received this glorious vision in February 1832:<br><br><i>And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives!</i><br><br><i>For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father--</i><br><br><i>That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 76:22–24]<br><br>Yes, my friends, beloved youth, and faithful teachers. Jesus is the Christ! He broke the bands of death. He is our Savior and Redeemer, the very Son of God. He will come again, as the scriptures proclaim. And that day is not far distant.<br><br>It is evident to all who accept the Savior's literal resurrection that life does not end in death. Our Lord promised, "Because I live, ye shall live also" (John 14:19). But there is additional significance of his resurrection to those of us who believe and accept latter-day revelation. I quote from the Prophet Joseph Smith, who describes in vision how the resurrection affects the family unit.<br><br><i>Would you think it strange if I relate what I have seen in vision in relation to this interesting theme</i>[the resurrection]?<i>Those who have died in Jesus Christ may expect to enter into all that fruition of joy when they come forth, which they possessed or anticipated here.</i><br><br><i>So plain was the vision,</i>[he continues,]<i>that I actually saw men, before they had ascended from the tomb, as though they were getting up slowly. They took each other by the hand and said to each other, "My father, my son, my mother, my daughter, my brother, my sister." And when the voice calls for the dead to arise, suppose I am laid by the side of my father, what would be the first joy of my heart? To meet my father, my mother, my brother, my sister; and when they are by my side, I embrace them and they me.. . . .</i><br><br><i>God has revealed His Son from the heavens and the doctrine of the resurrection also; and have a knowledge that those we bury here God will bring up again, clothed upon and quickened by the Spirit of the great God; and what mattereth it whether we lay them down, or we lay down with them when we can keep them no longer? Let these truths sink down in our hearts, that we may even here begin to enjoy that which shall be in full hereafter.</i>[Joseph Fielding Smith, comp.,<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</i>pp. 295–96]<br><br>Yes, it was through the Prophet Joseph Smith that the God of heaven revealed the truth that the family may endure beyond the grave--that our sympathies, affections, and love for each other may exist forever. One of the early apostles of this dispensation, Elder Parley P. Pratt, wrote of this as follows:<br><br><i>It was Joseph Smith who taught me how to prize the endearing relationships of father and mother, husband and wife; of brother and sister, son and daughter.</i><br><br><i>It was from him that I learned that the wife of my bosom might be secured to me for time and all eternity; and that the refined sympathies and affections which endeared us to each other emanated from the foundation of divine eternal love. It was from him that I learned that we might cultivate these affections, and grow and increase in the same to all eternity. . . .</i><br><br><i>It was from him that I learned the true dignity and destiny of a son of God, clothed with an eternal priesthood, as the patriarch and sovereign of his</i>[family]<i>. It was from him that I learned that the highest dignity of womanhood was, to stand as a queen and priestess to her husband. . . .</i><br><br><i>I had loved before, but I knew not why. But now I loved--with a pureness--an intensity of elevated, exalted feeling, which would lift my soul from the transitory things of this groveling sphere and expand it as the ocean. I felt that God was my heavenly Father indeed; that Jesus was my brother, and that the wife of my bosom was an immortal, eternal companion; a kind ministering angel, given to me as a comfort, and a crown of glory for ever and ever. In short, I could now love with the spirit and with the understanding also.</i>[Parley P. Pratt,<i>Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt,</i>pp. 297–98]<br><br>You, my beloved young people, qualify for these blessings as you go with a companion to the house of the Lord and receive the sealing ordinances which bind the family unit beyond the grave. These blessings are received in no other way; for, as the Lord has decreed, "Except ye abide my law ye cannot attain to this glory" (D&amp;amp;C 132:19).<br><br>But there is another responsibility you have in binding your family unit together; this, too, revealed through the Prophet of this dispensation. Jesus had said to his apostles, "The works I do shall [ye] do also; and greater works than these shall [ye] do; because I go unto my Father" (John 14:12). One of the works he has commissioned in these latter days is that we, who have renewed the covenants of exaltation, do the ordinance and sealing work for our progenitors who have not had the opportunity to receive the gospel while in mortality. Ours is the privilege of opening the doors of salvation to these souls who may be imprisoned in darkness in the world of spirits, that they may receive the light of the gospel and be judged the same as us.<br><br>"The works I do [proffering the saving ordinances of the gospel to others] shall [ye] do also." How many thousands of your kindred yet await these sealing ordinances? Have you done all you can as a family on this side of the veil? Will you be a savior to them--your own progenitors? Without them, you cannot be made perfect; exaltation is a family affair. May God bless you, the youth of Israel, to go forward in this great work of your Heavenly Father's kingdom.<br><br>Tonight I gratefully bear my testimony to our risen Redeemer. I assure you that he lives--today--and is governing the affairs of his Church. Because he lives, we shall also. Because he lives, the love and family association we cherish on this side of the veil may be perpetuated into the eternities. Because he lives, we may share in the glory which is enjoyed by the holiest of all: our Father in heaven. May God bless us to do all that he has required so that we may merit all the blessings that come through his resurrection and atonement--even that of exaltation and eternal lives--in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Ezra Taft Benson was President of the Council of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 26 March 1978.</i></i><br><br><i>©Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1> About the Things to Be Done” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, I am thankful for this opportunity this morning. I am also humbled by this awesome responsibility of occupying your time. Considering who you are and how precious time is, I feel like the man who prayed, "Please, dear God, make my words today sweet and tender, for tomorrow I may have to eat them" (Richard L. Evans, comp.,<i>Richard Evans' Quote Book,</i>p. 194; hereinafter cited as<i>Quote Book</i>).<br><br>I have entitled my remarks today, "Serious About the Things to be Done," and I certainly intend to be serious, but I might share something with you before we get too serious. I want you to know how great and magnanimous President Dallin Oaks is. Under any circumstances this great soul is willing to lend a helping hand. With the recent storms and the construction going on at the MTC, we had some damage to one of the buildings. President Oaks, as usual, responded to our plea for help and I later received this note from him--or at least it was attributed to him:<br><br><i>Dear Brother Pinegar:</i><br><br><i>When I got to the MTC, I found that the storm had knocked some bricks off the top of the building. So I rigged up a beam with a pulley at the top of the building and hoisted up a couple of barrels full of bricks. When I had repaired the building, there were a lot of bricks left over. I hoisted the barrel back up again and secured the line at the bottom, and then went up and filled the barrel with the extra bricks. Then I went to the ground and cast off the line.</i><br><br><i>Unfortunately, the barrel of bricks was heavier than I was and before I realized what was happening the barrel started down, jerking me off the ground. I decided to hang on and halfway up I met the barrel coming down and received a severe blow on the shoulder. I then continued to the top, banging my head against the beam and getting my fingers jammed in the pulley. When the barrel hit the ground it shattered its bottom, allowing all the bricks to spill out.</i><br><br><i>I was now heavier than the barrel and so started down again at a high rate of speed. Halfway down, I met the barrel coming up and received severe injury to my shins. When I hit the ground I landed on the bricks, getting several painful cuts from the sharp edges.</i><br><br><i>At this point I must have lost my presence of mind, because I let go of the line. The barrel then came down, giving me another heavy blow on the head and putting me in the hospital. The next time you need this kind of help at the LTM, please call Ben Lewis and Fred Schwendiman, who are better qualified to handle such matters.</i>[Adapted; author unknown]<br><br>Now, to more serious matters.<br><br>I would like to quote from an address entitled "The Perfect Executive," given by President Spencer W. Kimball to the Young Presidents Organization which had convened at Sun Valley, Idaho, on January 17, 1977. To quote:<br><br><i>Jesus was a patient, pleading, loving leader who didn't grow impatient with those he led.</i><br><br><i>And when Peter drew his sword and smote the high priest's servant and cut off his right ear, Jesus said, "Put up thy sword into the sheath."</i>(John 18:11<i>) Without anger or being perturbed, the incident passed.</i><br><br><i>You will recall his saying several times, "Come, follow me." His was a program of "Do what I do", rather than "Do what I say." His innate brilliance would have permitted him to put on a dazzling display, but that would have left his followers far behind. He walked and worked with those he was to serve. His was not a long-distance leadership. He was not afraid of close friends or that proximity to him would disappoint his followers. The leaven of true leadership cannot lift others until we are with and serve those to be led.</i><br><br><i>Jesus kept himself virtuous and thus, when his closeness to the people permitted them to touch the hem of his garment, virtue could flow from him. The woman in the large press of people touched his garment: "For she said, if I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole. . . . And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?"</i>(Mark 5:8, 30)<br><br><i>We are not perfect as Jesus was, but unless those about us can see us striving and improving, they will not be able to look to us for example and they will see us as less than fully serious about the things to be done.</i>[Spencer W. Kimball, "The Perfect Executive,"<i>Insights and Perspectives</i>(a publication for employees of the Corporation of the President) 1 (May 1977): 4]<br><br>Are we serious about the things to be done? What needs to be done? And how do we do it?<br><br>Sir Charles Morell said, "The first great gift we can bestow on others is a good example" (<i>Quote Book,</i>p. 190). Can the world, in fact, look to us for example? Or will those about us see us as less than fully serious about our religious convictions? What needs to be done? And how do we do it?<br><br>Michelangelo chiseled away at a block of stone for months; eventually Moses resulted. When a man asked him how he had done it, he simply replied, "I just chiseled away until everything that wasn't Moses wasn't there."<br><br>What needs to be done? It is a wise man who follows the counsel of the living prophet. And what has he counseled? Some of the more urgent matters about which you and I should be fully serious were carefully outlined in the recent general conference. To mention only three:<br><br><i>What needs to be done?</i>President Kimball: "Grow all the food that you possibly can on your own property. . . . Grow vegetables and eat those grown in your own yard. Even those residing in apartments or condominiums can generally grow a little food in pots and planters."<br><br><i>How do we do it?</i>We simply chisel away at everything that stands in the way until that garden is there.<br><br><i>What needs to be done?</i>President Kimball: "I urge all [members] to give serious attention to their histories. . . . Let no family go into eternity without having left their memories for . . . posterity."<br><br><i>How do we do it?</i>We simply chisel away at everything that stands in the way until eventually the history results. Begin we must.<br><br><i>What needs to be done?</i>President Kimball: "We want to emphasize again and place squarely upon the . . . individuals and their families the obligation to complete the four-generation program."<br><br><i>How do we do it?</i>We simply chisel away at everything that stands in the way until eventually the four-generation program is completed.<br><br>There is an urgency in these tasks, my brothers an sisters; careful planning with the establishment of goals is a must. We may have to sacrifice some of the things we now enjoy in order to accomplish what we have been asked to do by a prophet of the Lord. Perhaps less TV? Perhaps less sleep? I think of the reference in Proverbs 20:13, the first part of the verse, that says, "Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty." Love not sleep, lest the garden is not planted; love not sleep, lest the history is not written; love not sleep, lest the four-generation program is not completed.<br><br>In talking to missionaries at the Missionary Training Center on one occasion, Dr. Robert K. Thomas said, "If you're almost worthy, you almost get the blessings." If we almost plant our garden, then we almost get to eat the vegetables grown in our own yard. If we almost write our personal history, then we almost leave our memoirs for our posterity. If we almost complete the four-generation program, then we almost do as President Kimball has asked us to do.<br><br>Many of you will graduate this spring. Are you serious about the things to be done? Many of you will go home and work there or elsewhere this summer. Do you understand what needs to be done as you work for your employer? Are you serious about doing it? Many of you will remain at BYU for spring and summer terms. Are you serious about the things to be done?<br><br>Many young men in the Church have not yet committed to serve full-time missions, although President Kimball continues to make the appeal that every young man prepare himself to serve on a mission. When, young men, when are you going to become serious about the things to be done?<br><br>We have in attendance this morning approximately 1,000 full-time missionaries in training at the Missionary Training Center. You missionaries will depart very shortly for the mission field. Are you fully serious about the things to be done? Do you understand the magnitude of your responsibility?<br><br>In closing, let me illustrate, with two examples, how precisely and sometimes how directly the blessings of heaven are brought forth through sacrifice when one is fully serious about the things to be done.<br><br>During the semester I have been teaching a missionary preparation class, the Religion 130 course, on campus. Three or four weeks ago, I assigned the class members a project involving sacrifice and obedience, and I asked them to identify in their own lives areas needing improvement. I asked that they define what they would sacrifice to improve, how they would sacrifice, and when, specifically, they would sacrifice; and yesterday in our class we had a report. I just want to give you the results of an experience as presented by one of the young men. He said, "I work at a grocery store and I realized that I hadn't been as diligent as I should be; I hadn't been quite the employee that I ought to have been. I decided to sacrifice and come a little early, work more quickly, get my shelves stocked, and get things cleaned up." He said, "Within two weeks I had a raise and a promotion. Perhaps the raise and the promotion would have come anyway, but I think not."<br><br>This same young man had decided in regard to his classes that he needed to do something about his assignment of three term papers. He decided that he would spend four extra hours a week working on those term papers and watch television just a little less. He said yesterday, "I submitted two of those reports two weeks early and received A's on both of them." The other report he will submit this week. I would suggest, brothers and sisters, that those results were not accidental. He did indeed sacrifice, in what seems to be a very mundane or simple way, yet almost immediately blessings came to him.<br><br>I am thinking of a young man at the Missionary Training Center a year and a half ago, preparing to serve in Japan. We had arranged with the BYU ticket office for all of the missionaries to attend the final home football game. They had tickets all arranged for us in the north end zone (hopefully, we can do a little better than that this next year--that seating is great if you do not want to see anything), and we announced to the missionaries that they would all be permitted to go to the ball game the next afternoon. This young man came in to see me and asked, "President Pinegar, do I have to go to the football game tomorrow?"<br><br>I thought he was ill. I said, "Don't you want to see this ball game?"<br><br>He said, "Oh, if you only knew how badly I want to see this game! I played college football for two years. But when I came to the MTC I made a commitment to myself and to the Lord that I would learn all eight of the missionary discussions in Japanese. If I go to that ball game tomorrow, I will not achieve my goal."<br><br>Well, of course, permission was granted him to stay and study.<br><br>I saw him some weeks later. In fact, it was about five days before he departed for the field. He came up to me in the cafeteria and said, "President Pinegar, remember me? I am the elder who did not go to the ball game because I wanted to study the discussions. Today I pass off the eighth discussion." He continued, "You ought to hear what happened to me the day I stayed here and did not go to the ball game. Up to that point in time I had been able to memorize twenty lines a day in Japanese; that day, the day that I sacrificed--and I felt it was a sacrifice--I memorized 120 lines. From that point on, I continued to move up and today I will pass off my eighth discussion." His recall was approximately eighty-five percent.<br><br>Quoting President Kimball, "Unless those about us can see us striving and improving, they will not be able to look to us for example and they will see us as less than fully serious about the things to be done." I humbly pray that all of us will be fully serious about the things to be done as members of God's kingdom here on the earth. I bear witness of the reality of his kingdom and the fact that Jesus Christ himself directs the affairs of this Kingdom on the earth through his living prophet, Spencer W. Kimball. In the name of Jesus Christ.<br><br><i><i>Max L.

<h1> Wilt Be Perfect, . . . Come and Follow Me” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My brothers and sisters, one of the things that Dallin forgot to mention in that obituary was the fact that I was a cheerleader at BYU and as such was asked to be one of the Montana Queens. Brothers Mose Flake, Gene Jensen, and myself had the opportunity to dress up, complete with our Dracula false teeth, and ride on the float to represent the Montana Queens several years ago--a very creditable job, I might add.<br><br>It is wonderful to be back at BYU. I grew up in Provo, looked forward to attending the University, and was grateful to come here and be an associate of Dallin Oaks at that time. When I was in the mission field, I used to encourage the missionaries to come to BYU if they had that opportunity. I remember one missionary who said once, "Look, I don't want to go to BYU." He had a scholarship to one of the Ivy League colleges in the East, a basketball scholarship; and every time I offered my encouragement to him, he told me again about the discipline and all that would be required here.<br><br>About three months after he returned home, and I was in Brussels, I got a telephone call from him in the East. He said, "President, do you think you could help me to go to BYU? I am tired of smoke-filled rooms, and I am tired of constantly having the principles of everlasting life challenged and threatened. Do you think you could help me to get in?" Well, he came and fulfilled his two purposes here; he got his degree and he got married. He later went on to get a Ph.D. and is now a very productive member of his community and his Church in California.<br><br>My brothers and sisters, I am basically a practitioner of the gospel. As Dallin has indicated, I have had many great and choice experiences in my life through working in the Church. It has been a thrill on every occasion. I have thought for weeks now what I might possibly say today that might be of help to you, and I have taken a thought out of Matthew, chapter 19, verse 21, where the Savior said, "If thou wilt be perfect, . . . come and follow me." I believe that this is the Master's invitation for all members of the Church to become knowledgeable about the gospel--to become gospel scholars, if you will--in the course of time.<br><br>One of the most spiritual experiences to come out of our mission occurred near the European supreme headquarters of the Allied powers, located in Belgium, during 1968. One evening one of our expectant American sisters became desperately ill and had to be rushed by an ambulance to a military hospital. Upon arriving, she was given diagnostic and x-ray examinations revealing a very serious obstruction that would have to be removed by surgery. Following the priesthood administration by her husband and another member of the branch presidency, she underwent the operation--only to have the same doctor who had examined her moments before find that there was no obstruction, in fact nothing wrong whatever.<br><br>While in the hospital convalescing for a few days she studied the scriptures and some other commentaries, and this attracted the attention of a medical orderly who was there on assignment as an American serviceman--a former alcoholic, incidentally. He wondered what this book with the strange title really meant. One week later he attended a Church activity with the husband of the woman in the hospital and committed himself to study the gospel. He and his family quickly went through the Book of Mormon and the discussions with the missionaries and were baptized into the Church. He has since read the standard works many times as well as all of the commentaries that he has been able to secure; and, in addition, he has been responsible for bringing many people into the church of Christ.<br><br>This experience, my brothers and sisters, along with hundreds--literally hundreds--of other experiences, has given a witness to me of the importance of gospel study in our lives. The Savior's injunction in Matthew 19:21 to "come and follow me" seems a most appropriate slogan for all members of the Church. A program of gospel study regularly and consistently followed has meant the difference in the life of every missionary and member I have known in developing knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to be effective and to be worthy of the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>I have noticed that every member or missionary who enthusiastically and energetically and systematically pursues studies in the gospel and particularly in the standard works experiences a joy of discovery that is really marvelous to behold. One morning in Brussels while studying the gospel, our family noticed our youngest son, just born there a few months earlier, sitting in his playpen, as he discovered that he had toes. The exhilaration and the excitement of that moment were really a wonderful experience, for he just began to scream and cry out loud because he had found something on his body that moved. And I have thought of that many times as I have seen people in the Church learn a principle of the gospel, practice that principle, and feel the exhilaration that comes from that study and that knowledge.<br><br>Is it not interesting that the Savior constantly referred to and taught from the writings of the prophets even while yet in His youth, even though He was the Son of God? The following scriptures attest to the Savior's concern for knowing the word of God:<br><br>John 5:39: "Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me."<br><br>Doctrine and Covenants 11:21: "Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and then shall your tongue be loosed; then, if ye desire, you shall have my Spirit and my word, yea, the power of God unto the convincing of men."<br><br>Acts 17:11: "These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so."<br><br>And 3 Nephi 23:1: "And now, behold, I say unto you, that ye ought to search these things. Yea, a commandment I give unto you that ye search these things diligently; for great are the words of Isaiah."<br><br>Our prophets have also confirmed the importance of a systematic gospel study. While reflecting upon the constant effort and diligence required to learn great truths, Elder Orson Pratt concluded:<br><br><i>We need not be discouraged upon this subject; for if we do the best we can according to the position in which we are placed, and the opportunities which we have, we do all the Lord requires; and by and by we shall be placed in a condition in which we can learn much faster than we can now. We need not be discouraged. Perhaps the man who, under a sense of discouragement, gives up and does not make the best of his present limited opportunities, will be limited hereafter in the life to come, and will not be allowed to progress very fast because of his laziness and his want of desire, courage and fortitude to pursue certain channels of knowledge that were opened up to him here in this life. But when we see individuals not only willing to receive some few of the simple principles of the gospel of Christ, but are willing to press onward towards perfection as far as opportunities present themselves, we may rest satisfied that they will be honored of the Lord according to their diligence, perseverance, fortitude and patience in striving to understand the laws which he has given to all things.</i>[Orson Pratt,<i>Wonders of the Universe,</i>p. 204]<br><br>President Hugh B. Brown once said,<br><br><i>Sometimes men say, "I have a testimony of the gospel." I believe them. Sometimes I hear them say, "I know the gospel is true," and I believe them. But especially with missionaries I have said time and again in various mission fields:</i><br><br><i>"When I hear you say, 'I know the gospel is true,' I would like to stop you and have you repeat that but say only, 'I know the gospel.'"</i><br><br><i>Of course it is true if it is the gospel, but do you know the gospel?</i>[Alfred L. Zobell, comp.,<i>Speaker's Scrapbook,</i>p. 138]<br><br>I say it is one thing to know the gospel is true and another to know what the gospel is. Mere testimony may be gained with but perfunctory knowledge of the Church and its teachings as evidenced by thousands who are now coming into the Church with but bare acquaintanceship. But to retain testimony and to be of service in building up the Lord's kingdom requires a serious study of the gospel and a knowledge of what it is. Can there be any question as to the importance of knowing these truths as we go about our Father's business? A real understanding of the gospel brings one to the realization that the ability to live and teach eternal principles to others is dependent upon a growing knowledge of these priceless eternal verities. When this growing comprehension is woven into the fabric and character of one's daily experience, it brings a continually greater appreciation for God, for His truths, and for the scriptures; and it creates a more profound intensity and urgency to help others understand. A member thus engaged and motivated is a priceless entity in the eternal scheme of the gospel. He becomes a discriminator of the truth learned out of the scriptures, and almost irrevocably he begins to embody these things in his countenance and deportment and to create in others a desire to hear it also. His life literally becomes what it feeds upon.<br><br>A basic study program can, I believe, form the foundation to which the Savior was referring in the scriptures--the absolute and firm foundation of the gospel. One of the most powerful scriptures attesting to this is found in the book of Helaman, chapter five, verse twelve:<br><br><i>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.</i><br><br>When I was at U.S. Steel, I had a very choice friend--a great young man with a great intellect. He had graduated with an electrical engineering degree when he was 21 years of age. He just had a finite mind. He was an inactive member of the Church, and one time he told me, "Jim, I'm going to prove that the Church is not true." And so he went to the writings of the Prophet Joseph Smith and explored them, and one of the things he read about was the discovery of the golden plates. He took this as his first premise to build his own foundation, and he wrote about his exploration. He showed that the mass--which, according to the Prophet, was six by eight by eight, or approximately 288 cubic inches, and made up of malleable gold--could be assumed, based on the density of malleable gold, to weigh in the neighborhood of 184 pounds. And there would be no way that a young boy, even a farm boy, could bring 184 pounds of gold out of the stone box in the hillside.<br><br>Then he read further, and in order to recreate the case properly he built that body of mass to prove to himself what it looked like and to get a good feel for his subject matter. When he got through he noticed two interesting things: there were voids between the plates, and that accounted for loss of mass and weight; and also, according to the Prophet's description, there were engravings on the plates, and that would account for loss of metal. When my good friend finished, he guessed that the plates probably weighed 94.35 pounds. And it would have indeed been possible for a twenty-year-old farm boy to carry those out of the hills.<br><br>A real understanding of the gospel brings one to the realization that the ability to live and keep these eternal principles is dependent upon a growing knowledge of these priceless eternal verities. Regular scripture study can form and develop a comprehensive understanding of the gospel. Most of our members do not have this comprehensive understanding, and in the lives of most of our members this is not a growing dimension. It is an exhilarating experience to really know the will of God and to become intimately acquainted with the life and the importance of Jesus Christ--to know His thoughts, His joys, His concerns, His compassion, and the love He felt for all mankind. Is it not possible that, in similarly doing those studies and religiously pursuing them, we might also become like Jesus?<br><br>Someone once said that there are two churches, even in the Latter-day Saint Church: a doctrinal church and an institutional church. The goal of the doctrinal church is achieved when the understandings and the commitment and the pattern of life resemble the life of Jesus. The institutional church exists to fellowship and give to man the social fulfillment of his being that is, of course, urgently needed, as well as to administer the ordinances of the gospel. Only the doctrinal church can enter into the heart and life of an individual.<br><br>Imagine, if you will, what can occur if we approach these experiences enthusiastically and energetically throughout all our lives. The lives and testimonies of hundreds of missionaries attest to the irrevocable fact that reading and studying the holy scriptures can fill our minds and souls with knowledge--knowledge sufficient not only to protect us against the ever-increasing encroachments of a material world and the temptations of mediocrity but also to exalt us and, what is equally important to us as members of this Church, exalt others in the kingdom of our Father.<br><br>When I was in Belgium a sister came to our office one day. Her husband had been a district president, a great man responsible for building a beautiful new chapel in Brussels. He was now dying of cancer. I was the brand-new mission president, and she asked, "Brother Paramore, what happened to my husband? He did so much for the Church. He gave his whole life, even his business, and all things we had were dedicated to the work of the Lord. And yet today he lies on his bed without a vibrant testimony of the gospel. What happened?" In examining the case, we learned that this good brother had never really studied the gospel. He never attended a Sunday school class or a priesthood meeting, and when he sat in sacrament meeting he was thinking of the myriad of administrative duties he had as branch president or district president. Consequently, the gospel of Christ, a growing comprehension, never really entered his life. One cannot, throughout all one's life, live on someone else's light. Ultimately, in order to evade temptation and the wind of Satan, each one will have to stand on his own testimony.<br><br>I have noticed an interesting thing about preparation by gospel study in the lives of young people: the more they know the sacred scriptures and gain an understanding of the scriptures' importance in their lives, the more power they have for good. And this power is a very real thing. It literally lifts and exalts mankind out of a mundane existence which sometimes becomes too greatly circumscribed to the material sway of life. My observation in all these practical duties I have held in the Church leads me to believe and know that gospel study is the real basis for all spiritual growth.<br><br>May I share with you an experience about a young man? He left Canada to go on a mission and was assigned to our mission, but on the way to Salt Lake City he kept asking his companion what he was doing; he did not really want to go on a mission. When he got to the mission home he told me very candidly that he really did not want to be there, that pressures had brought him to the mission field. And for the first fifteen months of his mission he proved that what he said he felt was really true, that somehow he could not commit himself. One day, while he was tracting in one of the old cities of Europe, he found a man with the same name as his and later learned in conversation with him that this man was his uncle. His father and this good uncle had both left the eastern countries at the same time, and one had immigrated to Canada and the other to France. After he had given his opening tracting speech: "Nous sommes les missionnaires"--that was about all he could say--his uncle asked, "How long have you been in France?"<br><br>He said, "Fifteen months."<br><br>"You mean you've been here that long and that's all the French you have learned? I am ashamed of you."<br><br>This young man somehow that day met his Waterloo. He went home and from the next day on throughout the remaining fifteen months of his mission he committed himself to 5:30 a.m. arisings and two-and-a-half-hour study periods. Within several weeks he had memorized all the French discussions and begun to know and feel the power of the gospel in his life. Now picture this young man calling his mission president at 10:30 at night, saying, "President, I just left the most beautiful family I've ever known. They're my own. We taught them this tonight. Please tell me if there's anything I need to know to do, because I just cannot lose them. They are so great! This is what I plan to do tomorrow night!" I have never seen such a dramatic change in an individual in my whole life.<br><br>The gospel, even for a missionary, needs to become a regular diet pursued with great urgency. The scriptures answer questions that exist in normal and everyday life. They explain the purpose of this life and the need and value of spiritual relationships in the family. They give us understanding of the forces that operate to perfect and unify man with the infinite. They help us to understand the reasons for evil, contention, judgment, the Restoration, the Resurrection, the need for a Redeemer. They lead us unto all truth, which, when properly understood through the workings of the Holy Ghost, invariably brings peace to the soul and an inner confidence to the person.<br><br>A branch president in one of our larger cities once told me that one of the greatest factors in his conversion to the gospel was that the missionary was able to answer his questions out of the scriptures, thus pointing the way for his own personal study and enlightenment. This outstanding man, now a stake president and a dedicated leader in the Kingdom, is totally committed to the cause of gospel study partly because he learned to find the answers to his problems from the scriptures. And is it any wonder that he would have sought help from the scriptures? For he could not understand why authority would not be in other churches, particularly the Catholic church, because his own brother, whom he loved and admired, was a Catholic priest and his sister a nun--he loved and respected them. To have a young man, aged nineteen, come into his life and tell him that there was another way, a Restoration, required a serious study of the prophecies of God as laid out in the scriptures. Is it any wonder that God counseled us, "Let your time be devoted to the studying of the scriptures" (D&amp;amp;C 26:1)?<br><br>Another wonderful experience occurred when an outstanding brother, a high official in the United States Army in charge of all public relations for all of Europe and a member of our mission, was called upon to preside over one of the branches of the Church. In all humility he replied that he felt incapable of assuming such a great responsibility because he did not have the understanding he needed of the scriptures, and he was afraid that people would approach him for help and he would not be able to respond. He felt this to be a real obstacle in fulfilling his calling.<br><br>Upon reviewing this situation, his feeling of inadequacy, and the feeling we had that he had been called of our Heavenly Father, we recommended that he make a comprehensive study of the scriptures--commencing with the Doctrine and Covenants, because that is the framework for organization in the Church--for fifteen to twenty minutes a day. This good brother, a former all-conference football champion from Utah State, committed himself wholeheartedly. He began to gain more light and understanding, and very soon he found himself being led to the understanding he needed to direct the branch and the work effectively. Study became a very real thing to him, for now he was studying with an intent to know, and was not just reading the passages. Each night prior to retiring, no matter what the hour--ofttimes with his wife--he would follow his program and then contemplate seriously the thoughts he had studied before going to bed.<br><br>An interesting thing occurred one night when he came home very late from an important meeting. Because of the lateness of the hour he went directly to bed; then, as he recalled the story, he tossed and turned for nearly an hour before he realized he had not studied the scriptures. So he got out of bed, read for a few minutes, and then fell fast asleep. It was interesting to note that within a matter of a few short weeks a new confidence and reassurance came into his life, giving him more light and knowledge, more power and authority, and a greater possibility to lead his members--all for just taking a few minutes a day in study of the words of God.<br><br>The Savior, in His instructions to the elders of Israel in the 50th section, verse 24, of the Doctrine and Covenants, has promised that this light and knowledge will grow "brighter and brighter until the perfect day." My observations with missionaries and members alike are the following:<br><br>1. Testimony is in direct proportion to the study of the gospel.<br><br>2. Work and diligence in the Church are in direct proportion to the study of the<br><br>gospel.<br><br>3. The happiness of every member or missionary I have ever known is in direct proportion to his study also. One of my missionaries, a vice-president here at summer school a few years ago, once said that the only difference between a happy and an unhappy missionary is about three inches--the width of the standard works.<br><br>4. Greater success in the mission field and in life is obtained through gospel study. I find that at the conclusion of his mission a missionary almost invariably says that the greatest change he would have made in his mission would have been to have earlier become better acquainted with and more knowledgeable about the scriptures, the life and teachings of the Master, and the doctrines as expounded in the scriptures.<br><br>5. We remain strong, testifying members if we study the scriptures regularly. In the ten thousand or so people that I have known in the Church I personally have never known anyone who studied the scriptures regularly to leave the Church.<br><br>6. The scriptures, like prayer, aid us in placing all things in eternal perspective,<br><br>which enhances our celestial values.<br><br>7. The scriptures are a permanent means by which we can measure our spirituality. In their study we are able to determine if we are obtaining the things that are expected of us. Conversely, if we do not study them we may be led ever so carefully, quietly, but surely to the things of the world.<br><br>8. When we study the scriptures, we begin to understand more clearly the importance of our individual and personal commitments to Christ and to the gospel.<br><br>9. A regular study of the scriptures brings strength against all criticism and actions of others. One is built on a firmer foundation than mere activity in the Church. If we study the scriptures, we gain confidence and we lose our fears. Verse 30 of the 38th section of the Doctrine and Covenants states that if we are prepared we shall not fear. As we really contemplate the responsibility before us of committing the gospel of Jesus Christ into the lives of people, we are struck with the sheer magnitude of that responsibility. Because it is such a great responsibility, we may be rendered ineffective unless systematically and properly prepared.<br><br>Underlying all personal and spiritual growth and testimony is this study of the standard works of the Church. It leads us to prayer. It helps us to understand and have a desire to keep the commandments, to keep the Sabbath day holy, to prepare for missions, to save our kindred dead, and in all ways to serve with an eye single to the glory of God. Investigators who study the scriptures and commit themselves to their principles receive a witness of the truth. Every member of the Kingdom has an invitation from the Savior to know God, His word, His work, His desires. I love the invitation of the Savior wherein He seeks the aid of Peter to feed His sheep: "So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs" (John 21:15).<br><br>The opportunity is ours today, and the soul who senses this great challenge and seeks to prepare to meet it through careful analysis and contemplation of these holy scriptures can then meaningfully and with expectancy pray for guidance, for remembrance of His teachings, and for the Spirit to make the messages of the gospel live in the lives of others as it begins to live and have meaning in his own life. Imagine what fifteen to thirty minutes of study of the scriptures each day can bring.<br><br>Six years ago the Brethren decided that we would no longer have a manual written by x men or the Melchizedek Priesthood quorums of the Church, but that we would begin to build every member of the Melchizedek Priesthood on a sure footing. Beginning four years ago next September, the scriptures became the study manual for all Melchizedek Priesthood brethren, and a little study guide was developed--just a thin guide with about 30 outlines--so that they might understand the doctrines and their duty as they progressed in the Church.<br><br>This preparation went through about three years before it was finalized and before the Council of the Twelve and the Presidency of the Church gave their stamp of approval to this concept. And, my brothers and sisters, a minor miracle has occurred in the Church, for wherever you go people are carrying the scriptures now--not just missionaries, but ordinary priesthood bearers and members. When one goes to a stake conference, as I do every weekend, and a scripture is cited, people in the congregation begin to thumb through those pages to try to track the speaker as he gives a scripture. Do you know that it is the contemplated plan of the Lord that in eight years every member of the Melchizedek Priesthood--every father who has this great responsibility--will have gone through three hundred doctrines of the Church and over two hundred duties that are his as father, brother, son, and member of the Church?<br><br>So, you young people beginning your lives, if you could just follow the programs that our Heavenly Father has given us, this can lead you to a comprehension and a fortification to ward off all the challenges that this life may bring. Some suggestions for your personal study:<br><br>1.<i>Try to establish a regular time every day.</i>President Marion G. Romney, when he was an attorney in Salt Lake City before being called as a General Authority, used to go to his law office one hour early every day, and for that hour, before the business of the world began in his busy practice, he spent time studying the scriptures. I wonder if you can see that power in his life now as he speaks to the membership of the Church.<br><br>President Joseph Fielding Smith, while touring a mission in England, was once asked how he came to know the scriptures so well. He said, "When I was about ten years of age, I began working on a farm and whenever there was a break held I would take a little set of scriptures that I had, a little New Testament or a small copy of the Book of Mormon, and read it." And he acknowledged that day that if you gave him two or three words of a given scripture he could find it for you in the scriptures. Is it any wonder that this great man was able to make the contribution he did to an understanding of the importance of these things in our lives? Establish a regular time every day.<br><br>2.<i>Make the schedule regular,</i>recognizing that on occasion you may have to change. You missionaries are smiling because you are doing this at least an hour every day. But there will come a time in your lives when you will not be compelled, as it were, to study, and then you will be on your own to continue to develop those understandings you will need.<br><br>3.<i>Try to commit someone to study with you.</i>This could be a member of your family, a friend, the others in your apartment. If it were students in the apartment, there would be multiple benefits from having this study.<br><br>4. An important point:<i>Make notations in the scriptures as you proceed.</i>Just little notations in the margins to recall a given story or experience elucidating that particular scripture give it meaning to you.<br><br>5.<i>Set for yourself some realistic objectives</i>in your gospel study. Study with an intent to know. For example: "How can Sections 20 and 107 of the Doctrine and Covenants help me become a better priests quorum adviser? How can the concepts I am studying in 1 John help me to love my family more?"<br><br>6.<i>Review your readings and notations periodically</i>so that you have recall of some of these things that you have studied. Maybe monthly, just leaf through each of your scriptures and read those little notations that you have made. You will find that you have hundreds of talks, witnesses, or testimonies ready to be given.<br><br>7.<i>Pray constantly when you are studying.</i>Brother McConkie said that a true searcher for faith, if he would study the Book of Mormon and at the end of each page would get on his knees and ask God if Joseph Smith could have written it, will get a testimony at the end of the Book of Mormon that Joseph Smith was the translator and that these are the words of God. He would have an absolute testimony burning in his life.<br><br>In resume, let us conceptualize what we are suggesting. Set a time to study with some specific objective in mind, relate it where possible to your own life and experiences, make notations which are meaningful recall patterns to you, pray for the Holy Ghost to help internalize the message, and review periodically to retain the usability of those doctrines and understandings.<br><br>My brothers and sisters, as a practitioner I learned when I was a bishop--when I did not have the facility of the gospel knowledge that I later gained as a missionary the second time around--that the real true way to build testimony is first to build upon this great and fundamentally important understanding of God. In my mind, it is the first principle of Church leadership to have a burning testimony that Jesus lives and to know the doctrines. I labored with President Kimball for four years of my life. I used to watch through the crack in the door as he interviewed people, and every time President Kimball took those large volumes of scripture and opened them and counseled people out of the scriptures. Then, of course, he tied his personal testimony and experiences to those witnesses.<br><br>May God bless us at this University and in the mission field and always to build upon that understanding, that our lives can be safeguarded against the fiery darts of the devil, against temptation, against mediocrity. May we have the faith to really accomplish things in this world and to stay faithful, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>James M.

<h1>es of Sacrifice - Robert D. Hales - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I would like to talk on the subject of sacrifice this evening. I shall talk a little bit about the sacrifice of Joseph Smith, about the sacrifice of Abraham and Isaac, about the Savior and the atoning sacrifice, but also I would like to talk this evening about the sacrifice of you and me and what the obligations are for us. To do this I would like first to review the fact that we are children of God and also to talk of the privilege we have of knowing an eternal plan of salvation that we in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believe in.<br><br>It is a thrill to know this important gospel truth--that we live; that we are in mortal state; that we have an opportunity to gain the riches of eternity, to live in immortality, and to have eternal life. The great truth is contained in the words of the song, "I Am a Child of God," written by Sister Naomi Randall, with music by Sister Mildred Pettit. The fact that each one of us is a child of God is not known by everyone, but I think it very important that we discuss it before we talk of the atoning sacrifice. We can come to understand this and all principles of the gospel by studying the scriptures and listening to our prophets.<br><br>There was a council in heaven. In the Pearl of Great Price we learn that long before we came to this earth we lived as spirits, and as children of God we were with our Father in heaven where a great council was held. We were told then that our Heavenly Father would make it possible for our spirits to come to earth to inhabit physical or mortal bodies. Here we would have experiences and temptations, but because he loves us so much he would make it possible for us to return to live with him again. All our Heavenly Father's children were there, and we were so happy with our Father's plan that we shouted for joy. However, we had to make a decision about which one of the Father's children we should choose to follow to come to earth and carry out this plan.<br><br>Lucifer was one of Heavenly Father's most brilliant spirits, a spirit son just like Jesus. Lucifer asked to be sent to earth, where he would force all of us to return to our Father's presence without choosing for ourselves whether or not we wanted to do right. He would force us back to heaven. There would be no free agency. Lucifer was vain and very selfish, for he desired all the honor and glory for the success of our Heavenly Father's plan. Because his plan was rejected, Lucifer became angry and rebellious. He and one-third of the spirit children who chose to follow him were cast out of heaven. Lucifer, whose name means<i>the shining one,</i>was told that he now would be known as Satan, or the devil.<br><br>Satan and his followers were permitted to come to earth to tempt us and to try to influence us into doing wrong, but none of them have mortal bodies. They are jealous of our mortal bodies and do everything in their power to keep us from returning to our Heavenly Father's presence. It has struck me as I have looked at Lucifer's plan in this day and age how much abortion carries that plan forward today. Every time there is an abortion someplace in the world there is yet another spirit child that cannot come to this mortal existence. To me it is yet an extension of Lucifer's plan and one that we should be mindful of when we come into discussions on this controversial subject.<br><br>Jesus, the eldest son of God the Father, offered to carry out the plan, used in many worlds before ours, that would allow us to have free agency. Free agency is that opportunity to choose for ourselves how we want to live. Because Jesus, our eldest brother, loves us so much, he wanted to take upon himself a mortal body like ours to show us the right way to live. And then he agreed to sacrifice his life so that in some heavenly way we could all be forgiven of our sins if we would repent of them and choose to live righteously while here.<br><br>It is important to understand that Jesus Christ had his free agency as to whether he would complete his act; and, as we know, in the Garden of Gethsemane when he prayed to his Father he asked that, if there was another way, this cup could pass from his lips. And when his Father told him no, that this was the eternal plan, Jesus then went forward and completed his mission. Jesus wisely knew that sometimes temptations would be appealing and that we would choose to do wrong. But under his plan we could recognize our wrongdoings, repent, and be forgiven. To repent means to be truly sorry, to change or turn away from the wrongdoing, to seek forgiveness, and then to try with all our hearts to live better lives.<br><br>As spirits we realized the wonderful blessings of receiving physical bodies and of choosing for ourselves what to do. We also knew that each time we chose to do right we would grow in knowledge and develop in character, and that we would have leadership so that we could become perfect, even as our Heavenly Father. We then started on the road of eternal progression. The phrase "I am a child of God" and the beautiful thoughts contained therein are especially meaningful because we know that each one of us is a child of God. When we truly come to understand the words, that we are children of God, our testimonies grow. Then, hopefully, we become more determined to have the courage to say no when we are tempted to do wrong.<br><br>Our Father in Heaven loves us more deeply than we can understand. He had said that "he numbereth his people" and that each one of us is important to him (see Alma 26:37). He wants us to return to live with him and Jesus again. He wants us to communicate with him in prayer; to tell him of our love, of our devotion, and of our obedience; and to show our love by obeying him. It is interesting that in John 14:15 where he says, "If ye love me, keep my commandments," the great principle of love must include obedience. We show our love to our Heavenly Father by keeping his commandments, and through our obedience we can become more like him, developing those qualities of character that he wants his children to have, developing the characters that our earthly parents want their earthly children to have. "And he has sent me here, / Has given me an earthly home / With parents kind and dear" (<i>Sing With Me,</i>p. B-76). This earthly life is an important step in our progression where, as brothers and sisters, we can know the joy of serving each other and preparing for eternal life together.<br><br>Adam and Eve were the first parents on earth. They used their free agency to decide what laws they would obey. They chose to become parents and to have children to come into their home--children who would be loved and taught the gospel. But even there, Adam and Eve had a son who turned away from the Lord: Cain. He was the first to be an example of those in the Bible that turned from the teachings of their parents.<br><br>Our memories of the preexistence, of living in heaven as spirit children, are forgotten; when we are born physically we cannot remember the great joys of living in the presence of our Heavenly Father. However, the Holy Ghost can bear witness to all that we are truly spiritual children of God as well as earthly children of our fathers and mothers. It makes us happy and gives meaning to our lives to know who we are, what we should do, and where we are going. Heavenly Father planned for "kind and dear" earthly parents to be with us in heaven also, where we will live together as eternal families. Just as we should know and show our love for our Father in heaven by obeying his laws and commandments, we honor our earthly parents by loving and obeying them. They are to lead us, guide us, walk beside us, and help us find the way (see<i>Sing With Me,</i>p. B-76).<br><br>Our objective is to return to the presence of our Heavenly Father, to return with honor after leaving his presence. We must use our free agency in always choosing the right, and only through obedience to his commandments and through truly repenting if we do wrong will this be possible. By listening and accepting the advice and teachings of our parents and of our teachers in Primary and Sunday School, universities, and seminary and institute and of all those who love us, we can be led and guided to do right. Although it is not possible for them to actually walk beside us, for them to actually be with us throughout all our lives, their spirit and memories can be with us that we might feel their love and prayers. Their only desire is for our happiness. They know through experience that this is not possible unless we live the commandments--unless we live righteously.<br><br>We can also receive from the Holy Ghost if we live worthy of the Spirit. Each week we partake of the sacrament to remind us of Jesus Christ and what he did for us. We are told that if we always remember him, if we will take his name upon us, if we will always keep his commandments, we are given the greatest blessing we can have in this life to lead us back into our Heavenly Father's presence: we are promised that we will always have his Spirit to be with us. We can find that way back--we must, because that is why we came here. Therefore we must be able to be taught. "Teach me all that I must do / To live with him someday" (<i>Sing With Me,</i>p. B-76) is what we have to learn.<br><br>When we understand this phrase, it is helpful to know that several years ago, in 1957, before Spencer W. Kimball became President of the Church he was visiting a conference in California, and the Primary children sang the song, "I Am a Child of God." Later he said to a visiting Primary board member, "I love the children's song, but there's one word that bothers me. Would Sister Randall mind if the word<i>know</i>were changed to<i>do?</i>" The change was made, for President Kimball had pointed out the very important truth that, while it is important to<i>know</i>what is right, it is more important to<i>do</i>what is right. Only in this way can we be sure of returning someday back into the presence of our Heavenly Father, to our heavenly home, to live always with our Father and his Son Jesus Christ and our loved ones. What joy comes when we understand the full meaning of being a child of God!<br><br>The atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ is very important to us. Each one of us has to understand that we are free from the bondage of Satan if we will seek freedom by being obedient. In the eternal plan of salvation, the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ is the key which opens the door to eternal life, to those riches of eternity that are spoken of in the scriptures. The law of sacrifice is very important. It is exemplified, as we have just talked about, in the sacramental prayer. There we renew our covenants each Sunday; there we take upon us the name of Jesus Christ; there we say that we will always remember him and remember his atoning sacrifice.<br><br>I want to talk for a moment of this atoning sacrifice. Joseph Smith spoke of it this way in his sixth lecture on faith where he talked of sacrifice. First, he talked about seeking knowledge, for an actual knowledge given to any person that the course of life which he pursues is according to the will of God will be given to him by the Holy Ghost. Second, he said that it was through sacrifice, and only through this way, that God has ordained that men enjoy eternal life. And third, we know that through sacrifice, if all men's earthly doings are pleasing in the sight of God, all will be blessed.<br><br>Our sacrifices must be acceptable to the Lord as Abel's sacrifice was acceptable to the Lord. And today our sacrifices are numerous. We offer for a sacrifice unto him a broken heart and a contrite spirit. It is interesting that when Adam and Even were taught of the sacrament and of sacrifice it was a blood sacrifice, pointing forward and toward the day of the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Then, after Jesus was resurrected, in 3 Nephi 9:17–20 he said, "In me is the law of Moses fulfilled" and then revealed the important truth that it was no longer necessary to have blood sacrifice, but rather to remember him and to keep his commandments and to take his name upon us. In the fifty-ninth section of the Doctrine and Covenants, verses 8 through 10, it clearly states that we "offer a sacrifice unto the Lord [our] God in righteousness, [again,] that of a broken heart and a contrite spirit." And this we do on the Lord's day, and these sacraments are unto the Most High.<br><br>Do we understand, then, the law of sacrifice and its importance? Are we offering sacrifices of convenience at times and not doing what we need to do? Our spiritual covenants require sacrifice and full devotion to the Lord. On the Sabbath day when we go to the house of the Lord we should do so in reverence, for these offerings are a reminder to ourselves and to the Lord of our devotion. We shall be edified by having that spirit to be with us and we shall be able to touch the lives of others.<br><br>When Adam and Eve called upon the name of the Lord "they heard the voice of the Lord ... speaking unto them, and they saw him not; for they were shut out from his presence." Next he gave unto them a commandment to worship the Lord their God and then gave them the law of sacrifice, that of "offer[ing] the firstlings of the flocks, for an offering unto the Lord." Sacrifice, to be successful, requires obedience. "Adam was obedient unto the commandments of the Lord." And when the angel appeared to Adam, he asked, "Why dost thou offer sacrifices unto the Lord?"<br><br>Adam's reply, as we know: "I know not, save the Lord commanded me."<br><br>The angel then replied,<br><br><i>This thing is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father, which is full of grace and truth.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, thou shalt do all that thou doest in the name of the Son, and thou shalt repent and call upon God in the name of the Son forevermore.</i>[Moses 5:4–8]<br><br>Adam and Eve were also given the true order of prayer, to pray to our Father in heaven in the name of Jesus Christ, and this we were all to do forever. Then the blessings came as they were obedient.<br><br>With Abraham and Isaac I would like to break down the story into four basic principles: first, the teaching principle; second, obedience to the law of sacrifice; third, the fact that in every test of sacrifice we must live it; and fourth, the fact that blessings flow. Let us first examine the teaching phase that Abraham went through. He had been taught the law of sacrifice and had obeyed it. But then he was called upon by the Lord. "Behold, here I am," said Abraham, and he was told, "Take now thy son, ... Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the Land of Moriah" (Genesis 22:1–2). Listen to that again: "Take ... thy son, ... whom thou lovest"--the dearest possession, as we know, that Abraham had. Abraham and Sarah had waited many years. Sarah at one point had laughed when the Lord had said she was going to be with child, and had been questioned, "Is there anything too hard for the Lord?" (See Genesis 18:10–15). And so came Isaac.<br><br>Abraham was told to go to a mountain, and he went. We know that he rose early in the morning. Now obedience sets in as the second great principle of the law of sacrifice. Two young men plus Isaac, Abraham's son, also went to the mountain, and they cut wood. Isaac then went with his father, Abraham, with the wood and a torch, and they built an altar. Isaac was bound and placed upon the altar. At this point I sometimes wonder not only what was in Abraham's mind but what Isaac was thinking of. Can you imagine looking around and asking your father, whom you love, where the sacrifice is, hearing your father reply that the Lord would provide, then finding yourself on the altar with your father's hands raised, a torch in one and a knife in the other?<br><br><i>And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.</i><br><br><i>And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.</i><br><br><i>And he said, lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.</i>[see Genesis 22:3–12]<br><br>Is it not interesting that the purpose of all this was twofold? First, that Abraham would have the feelings of God the Father in the sacrificing of his son, that he would know the anguish; also, that through this the Lord might know that Abraham feared God.<br><br>Now the fourth principle, that of blessings from obedience to the law of sacrifice: Abraham lifted his eyes, saw the ram caught in the thicket, and offered it for a sacrifice; and then the Lord said, "Because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son: [I will always be with thee.]" He then went on to bless Abraham with multiplicity of his seed throughout all the earth, among other blessings, "because thou hast obeyed my voice" (see Genesis 22:13–18).<br><br>Let us understand sacrifice in today's terms by what Joseph Fielding Smith said to a group of young people a few years ago. Joseph Fielding Smith, in talking to that group, spoke most impressively about his life and about his father, Joseph F. Smith, and then he spoke of Joseph F. Smith's father Hyrum, who was his own grandfather. He spoke of the fact that we do not need to give our lives, but that our sacrifice and our lives are given to the Lord each day as we serve the Lord. There are many ways we do that; I have jotted down a few.<br><br>Every man's faith is tested. He must develop self-denial either of moral or physical things of this world; he must sacrifice and show the Lord that he will give. These blessings then bring rewards and stronger faith. We do this "with an eye single to the glory of God," as stated in the fourth section, fifth verse, of the Doctrine and Covenants--not for what we want to do, but rather for what the Lord wants us to do, when he wants us to do it, and in the way his work needs to be carried out. There will be times when we shall not understand why. I sometimes think of Job as he was being tested, a perfect man who, in the twenty-first verse of that first chapter of Job exclaims, "Blessed be the name of the Lord," after his family has been wiped out. And then, in the next verse it is recorded that "In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly." How often, when we are tested or must sacrifice, do we charge God foolishly and ask the question, "Why me?" And then our sacrifice comes under question. Do we pay our tithes because we love the Lord? Do we live the Word of Wisdom for its spiritual blessings and not only its physical blessings? Are we truly morally clean? I shall be a mission president in England on July 1, and I would hope that I shall be able to return with honor, knowing that as I was in the field I worked with all of my heart, might, mind, and strength; for that is the sacrifice the Lord would ask of all of us. As parents do we make for our children the sacrifice of teaching them and living the commandments to be an example to them? Consider mothers, as Mother's Day approaches; they have a special sacrifice. They suffer, they love, they forgive; but most of all they teach us. There is a story I would like to give you as the background for a film we are going to see. I hope this will be a teaching moment for all of us.<br><br>"The Sacrifice" is produced by two young men who are returned missionaries, John Wadsworth and Tom Christensen. I would like you to watch for one or two things in this film; they are important. At the close of this film there is a father who has his duty, symbolic of God the Father, and a little boy who has been sent by his mother to tell the father that she is about to have a baby--to tell the father of new life. The father, who has the responsibility of correcting a drawbridge so that the train can come by, discovers a malfunction which keeps the bridge from closing; so he has to go down the gateway to hold the trestle manually with an iron rod for the train to pass. The little boy, in all of his excitement, has forgotten how he should come to see the father and he runs up the tracks. In the closing moments of the film we shall see a railroad train full of passengers who are completely unaware of the drama as the father holds onto the iron rod, much as Lehi and Nephi were told to hold to the gospel of Jesus Christ; and he must hold onto it if he wants to save the people in the train, symbolic of the world, and so he must sacrifice his son.<br><br>The most interesting part of this film to me is the complete disinterest of the people in the train. I think our job, if I were to suggest one assignment from today's discussion, is that we go forth and tell the people of the world of the events this film symbolizes. You will see that even the message that the son is bearing is symbolic, being news of new life, and the great joy of a mother.<br><br>Once again, after Adam and Eve were cast out of the garden of Eden, they were given two commandments:<br><br><i>that they should worship the Lord their God, and should offer the firstlings of their flocks. And Adam was obedient unto the commandments of the Lord.</i><br><br><i>And after many days an angel of the Lord appeared unto Adam, saying: Why dost thou sacrifice? And Adam said unto him: I know not, save the Lord commanded me.</i><br><br><i>And then the angel spake saying: This thing is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father, which is full of grace and truth.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, thou shalt do all that thou doest in the name of the Son, and thou shalt repent and call upon God in the name of the Son forevermore.</i><br><br>So it states in Moses, chapter five, verses five through eight.<br><br>The law of sacrifice is a temporal law. Man was instructed to obey it from the beginning of the earth. It was an ordinance performed by priesthood authority to typify the coming of the Son of God to give his life for the sins of the world. The law of sacrifice was practiced until the coming of the Son. It was always performed in such a way as to give direct attention to the Lord Jesus Christ's atoning sacrifice. The Feast of the Passover is but one example. The killing of the paschal lamb involved the spilling of its blood but no broken bones, as described in Exodus, chapter twelve. The offering of the sacrifice was a generally practiced ordinance of the gospel which ended with the sacrifice of Christ. The sacrament then became the newly established ordinance which served the purpose of the earlier ordinance symbolic of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.<br><br>After the film I should like you to ponder just a few points. (We have arranged to do this in a way so that after I have closed with my testimony you will be able to ponder, and then we shall hear the song, "I Stand All Amazed.") Would you ask yourself this question: Could the people of the train have safely gotten across the deep chasm represented by the bridge without the sacrifice of the young boy by his father? When the people of the train are riding past, do they have any concern? You will see that they do not. Our job as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is to take throughout the world the message that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that through him all mankind is saved. In the words of Charles H. Gabriel:<br><br><i>I stand all amazed at the love Jesus offers me,</i><br><i>Confused at the grace that so fully he proffers me;</i><br><i>I tremble to know that for me he was crucified,</i><br><i>That for me, a sinner, he suffered, he bled and died....</i><br><br><i>I marvel that he would descend from his throne divine</i><br><i>To rescue a soul so rebellious and proud as mine;</i><br><i>That he should extend his great love unto such as I,</i><br><i>Sufficient to own, to redeem, and to justify....</i><br><br><i>I think of his hands pierced and bleeding to pay the debt!</i><br><i>Such mercy, such love, and devotion can I forget?</i><br><i>No, no, I will praise and adore at the mercy seat,</i><br><i>Until at the glorified throne I kneel at his feet.</i><br><br><i>Oh, it is wonderful that he should care for me,</i><br><i>Enough to die for me!</i><br><i>Oh it is wonderful, wonderful to me!</i><br>[<i>Hymns,</i>no. 80]<br><br>I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Robert D. Hales was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 7 May 1978.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>Leaders in 1988 - M. Russell Ballard - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning. It is a privilege for Sister Ballard and me to be here. I would trust that the Lord will enlighten my mind and bless me and bless you also that we might have a learning experience together here this morning. As I contemplated this assignment, the thought has run through my mind that unless, somehow, we all leave this building more determined than when we came in that we are going to become better prepared, I shall not have done what Heavenly Father would have me do.<br><br>I would like to talk to you this morning, my fellow students, about what I think is the most exciting and thrilling thing to contemplate in your lives. I would like to talk to you about the Church as I believe it will be ten years from now. I would like you to go with me and, projecting your vision from sitting here in this beautiful center in 1978, take a look at what the Church will be in 1988. Please bear this thought in mind: What the Church will be in 1988 will largely depend on how you are prepared to assume your rightful role in this glorious gospel of Jesus Christ as it has been restored to the earth.<br><br>It took the Church ninety-eight years, from 1830 to 1928, to organize its first one hundred stakes. During the next twenty-four years the Church worked very hard to organize the second one hundred stakes. Then we start to see a very interesting picture unfold. At the end of the next eight years, by 1960, the three hundredth stake of the Church was organized. I am proud to tell you that it was organized in Toronto, Canada, where Elder Thomas S. Monson was presiding at the time as president of the mission and, of course, where Sister Ballard and I were privileged to preside just recently. Then, after the next four years, we had organized the next one hundred stakes, bringing the Church to a stake population of four hundred by 1964. It took us six years after that to create the next one hundred stakes, bringing the population of the Church to five hundred by 1970. It took three years to create another one hundred stakes, bringing the population to six hundred by 1973; two years for another one hundred stakes for a population of 700 stakes by 1975; and an additional 18 months for the next 100 stakes of the Church, created during 1977. The nine hundredth stake of the Church was organized March 19, 1978.<br><br>I had the great privilege last weekend of being in Atlanta, Georgia, with one of the truly great priesthood leaders of all time as far as I am concerned, Elder LeGrand Richards. You missionaries who are here, how would you like to have as your senior companion LeGrand Richards? That was my experience this last weekend. We were assigned by President Benson and the First Presidency to go to his old mission field, where he presided forty-three years ago, and organize the Atlanta Georgia Stake. Elder Richards is the chairman of the committee that approves the creation of wards and stakes, and he told me on that trip that this year so far that committee had approved the creation of fifty-three new stakes. I think that I can say to you this morning without much fear of contradiction that in 1978 the chance of our organizing another one hundred stakes is very good. This means that in one year--1978--we will do what it took our first ninety-eight years to do.<br><br>Explore with me for a minute or two how this relates to you here this morning. Suppose that the Church creates one hundred stakes a year. (Now I do not believe that will really be the case; I think it will accelerate at a faster rate than that, as indicated in the figures I have already given to you.) But for the sake of my example, I shall estimate that in 1988 we will be a church of approximately 2,500 stakes: I would like you to think in terms of this. Where are the 2,500 stake presidents of 1988? Where are their first counselors, second counselors, executive secretaries, clerks? Where are the 2,500 times twelve, or 30,000, high councilors? And suppose that every stake has an average of ten units--about the average in the stakes today--where are the 25,000 bishops, first counselors, second counselors, executive secretaries, clerks, elders quorum presidents and their counselors, seventies presidents, high priest group leaders and their counselors, Relief Society presidents and counselors, Primary presidents with their counselors, and on and on? Where are they? I would like to suggest to you this morning that you are they, you sitting here in this Marriott Center this morning. And now, the next question that I think should be posed to you is this: Are you ready? Are you ready to assume the role that the Lord, I am sure, has in mind for you in 1988?<br><br>Many of you sitting here, as I look at you, seem to be between the ages of nineteen and twenty-five. I had an interesting experience recently as the area supervisor in the United States Atlantic South area. I have there forty-six stakes of the Church in fourteen regions and nine missions. Recently, one of the Quorum of the Twelve went to one of my stakes to reorganize the stake presidency. When he came back he said, "Russ, you have a great stake president."<br><br>"Tell me about him," I said.<br><br>"He's a bright young man. He speaks Spanish as fluently as he speaks English." (This is in an area that has a lot of Spanish-speaking people.) Then he said, "He's twenty-eight years old."<br><br>Do you brethren sitting here realize how many of our stake presidents are in their early thirties? Do you have any idea how many bishops now presiding in the Church are in their twenties? Far more, perhaps, than you have ever dreamed possible. I would like to suggest to you that we think in terms of this.<br><br>I believe that your birthright and my birthright has been a very special thing as it relates to Heavenly Father and his eternal plan. I do not think for one minute that you on this campus or you who are preparing to go out into the mission field and are now in the Language Training Mission are here by accident. I do not think that Heavenly Father sits in his heaven and flips a coin and says to his spirit children, "You go here and you go to the depths of Africa," or "You go to the depths of China or India or any other country that doesn't enjoy the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ." I think your birthright, the privilege and right you have of being a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is a very sacred privilege. And I do not think that it came by accident. I believe that you made some very important commitments and promises to Heavenly Father before you were ever born.<br><br>As for those of you who were born in the covenant, whose parents were sealed in the temple before your birth, there is no question in my mind that you made some very special promises and commitments to Heavenly Father before you came into the home where you were reared. Thus, I believe that we each ought to have an in-depth, soul-searching evaluation of our lives this morning. Are we living up, in every way, to the promises and the blessings that Heavenly Father has in store for us? Is there anything in our lives, young people, that could be better? Is there any transgression dragging behind us that needs to be cleared up? Are we preparing in every way to fulfill the callings that Heavenly Father has in store for us?<br><br>Let me share with you a personal experience that may be of some interest to you. You know that as General Authorities we are called and assigned by the President of the Quorum of the Twelve to go to stake conferences. If you have been following what has been happening in the Church you know that the First Quorum of Seventy has now been extended the privilege of organizing stakes. I had been with members of the Twelve and experienced reorganizations as I did last weekend with Elder Richards, but just three weeks ago I was sent alone to reorganize a stake presidency--just me and the Lord and a Regional Representative. That is an awesome experience. It is an awesome assignment to find yourself sitting across the desk interviewing all the priesthood leaders in the stake, recognizing that ultimately the man that the Lord has in mind has to be called. Put yourself into my shoes for a moment and you can sense my great concern. I fasted, I prayed, I sought the guidance of the Lord--and then a very interesting thing happened to me. As we were interviewing all of these priesthood leaders, a man came in, about the fifth from the last to be interviewed, and as he walked through the door I stood up, shook his hand, and said "I know you. Where do I know you from?" He was as familiar to me, my dear friends, as anybody that I have ever known.<br><br>And he said, "Brother Ballard, I've only met you once, and that was only for two or three minutes eleven months ago at a regional young adult conference where you spoke." But as he walked through the door, I want to testify to you that the Lord made it manifest to me that he was to be the stake president.<br><br>Now an interesting thing unfolded. After he had been called and sustained in the Sunday morning session we called on him to bear his testimony and this is what he said to the Saints: His father was a patriarch in the neighboring stake, and his mother was president of the stake Relief Society in the neighboring stake. He called his mother and father to talk to them--I had given him permission to do that--and he said, "Hello mother."<br><br>She said, "Son, you don't need to tell me. You've been called to be the stake president."<br><br>"How did you know?" he asked.<br><br>"At 12:30," she said, "I was in the kitchen, and it simply became known to me by the power of the Spirit that my son had just been called to be a stake president. Your father had gone to the store, and when he came home he walked into the kitchen and said, 'You know, mama, I have a strong feeling that our son has been called to be a stake president.'"<br><br>He was a patriarch, and she was a Relief Society president. They had no communication with their son until he called on the phone. That was a great reassurance to me that the Lord's will had been manifested and that the impressions I received were correct.<br><br>This morning I would just like to have you understand this: How do the names of bishops and stake presidents and General Authorities surface in the minds of those who have the responsibility of extending the call? How does a stake president know who the bishop should be? How does a General Authority know who the stake president should be? How does the President of the Church know who a General Authority should be? I shall tell you how I think it is.<br><br>I believe in revelation--and so do you--and I believe that the Lord is getting acquainted with you right now. You missionaries that are preparing to go on your missions, do not let one day go by on your mission when you do not demonstrate to the Lord that you are reliable, that you are trustworthy, that you are dedicated, that you are committed, that you are on his side, for he is getting acquainted with the young men and the young women of this Church today. Here at BYU and every day of your life he gets acquainted. Then, after he has watched you and after you have demonstrated your faithfulness by your service and by your ability to keep your priorities straight in your life, along comes a need for a high councilor, a Primary president, a Relief Society president, a bishop, or a stake president; and the Lord makes it known to the responsible priesthood leader that you are ready because you have lived up to the commitments and promises that you made before you were ever born.<br><br>I would like to encourage you this morning with all the strength of my soul to learn to build a real relationship with the Savior of the world. I do not know of anything that is more important than to know that you are in tune with him. I do not think that it is an easy thing; I think that it takes a great deal of living. It takes fasting, it takes mighty prayer, it takes diligent and committed service, it takes a happy heart in one who is anxiously engaged in a good work.<br><br>As you pray, may I encourage you to think in terms of to whom you are speaking. I have heard missionaries pray; I have heard my own children pray; I have heard others pray; and sometimes I get the feeling that we really do not realize whom we are addressing. I do not believe any of you would go in to an employer here on earth and report to him as we sometimes have a tendency to report to Heavenly Father. Be prepared in every way to build your communication with your Heavenly Father, to be entitled to the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and the promptings of the spirit of Jesus Christ.<br><br>May I tell you of a special experience. I am sure that I can share with you in this story what I am trying to encourage you to understand. Shortly after I was called to the First Quorum of the Seventy I went back to my mission in Canada--that was in April of 1976--and in May, the next month, we held a solemn assembly in eastern Canada for all of the priesthood leaders. The First Presidency, the members of the Twelve, and one of the assistants to the Twelve came at that time to hold that solemn assembly. It was a glorious experience. I was placed as the chairman because I was the presiding priesthood authority in the area.<br><br>At the end of the solemn assembly we had a light dinner for the Brethren and then I drove the First Presidency back to the hotel where they were staying. I might mention as a sidelight that I have never driven more carefully in all my life than when I had the most precious cargo in this world in my car. When we arrived at the hotel, the Brethren bade me good night and went to the ninth floor. Then I noticed that President Kimball's secretary, Arthur Haycock, had been detained at the counter, so I went over and asked him if I could take the key up to President Kimball so that he might get into his room. He appreciated my offering to do that and handed me the key. I took the elevator to the ninth floor and went down the hall. There standing in the doorway I saw President Tanner and President Kimball. As I approached them I said, "President, here is your key. I thought I'd bring it up to you so you could get in and have a good night's rest."<br><br>He thanked me for that in his loving way and then President Tanner took my arm and said, "Russ, how would you like to come in and have prayer with us?" You missionaries that are getting ready to go on your missions and you who have returned, can you imagine closing the day with the First Presidency of the Church? I had never done that before. I had never had that experience, and as I went into President Tanner's room with President Kimball, it was but a moment before President Romney and the other Brethren came in. I was overwhelmed. I have to tell you that tears welled up in my eyes as we knelt down around that bed.<br><br>I was kneeling next to President Tanner when President Kimball said, "Eldon, this is your room. Whom would you like to have pray?" I think President Tanner sensed what was happening to me, for he said, "President, we would like you to pray." And then I heard a prophet pray. I would like you to understand, you wonderful young people, that I learned a great lesson in that prayer. I felt the Spirit as I had never felt it before--you can understand it--for when a prophet talks to God, it is as close friends speaking.<br><br>But in a very short prayer he said this, among other things: "And, Heavenly Father, we pray above everything else that the labors of this day have been acceptable unto thee." That penetrated my heart like nothing else has on the principle of prayer. Oh, that every one of us might always be found closing the day pleading with the Lord that the efforts of that day had been acceptable unto him! There is great power in that. There is great strength in understanding that he is our Father, that we are his sons and daughters, that we are on his errand. May our labors always be acceptable.<br><br>To you missionaries that are about to go out, may I suggest this to you: Make a commitment down in the bottom of your heart right now that you will never spend any day on your mission when you cannot honestly say to the Lord upon retiring, "Today I did the very best I knew how." I promise you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that if you can honestly say that you do not need to worry about baptisms. You will not need to worry about success; you will have it if you can honestly check in with your Heavenly Father every night saying, "Today I have done the very best I know how." I would ask you, then, to be committed from the crown of your head to the soles of your feet, to prepare yourself in every way to be ready when the Lord calls. Whatever that calling might be, be sure you have done today and will do tomorrow and every day all you can to prepare to be a leader of the Church in 1988.<br><br>I believe that you should know that as I move around the Church and as I become more familiar with it, I would be less than honest not to tell you that I have been overwhelmed in the last eleven months at the power and the magnitude of this great Church. I have been in Korea, in the Philippines, in Guam, in Hong Kong, in England, and all over the United States and parts of Canada, and my testimony to you this morning of that short eleven months is that the Lord is moving very rapidly in the saving of those who are honest in heart. The Church moves forward, as I observe it, in almost direct proportion to the dedication, the commitment, and the prayerful guidance that the Lord gives to his priesthood leaders.<br><br>I have had the opportunity to interview many people. Recently I interviewed a young man for a mission. We had a nice visit and then I looked him in the eye and said, "Now, my boy, tell me how you feel about the Lord Jesus Christ." He talked to me about that and I felt he was sincere.<br><br>I then said to him, "Would you do anything in this world that the Lord asked you to do?"<br><br>He said, "Oh, yes."<br><br>"Would you give your life if necessary, if he called upon you to do it? Do you love him that much?"<br><br>"Oh, yes."<br><br>"Now, my boy, tell me how you feel about the Prophet Joseph Smith," I let him testify to me about those feelings.<br><br>Then I asked him a very penetrating question that I would like to ask each of you, and especially you missionaries that are here this morning: "Have you read the Book of Mormon from cover to cover? Have you pondered and prayed about it, and do you know it to be true?"<br><br>This young man's eyes dropped and then he raised them back up and said, "Well, I've read parts of the Book of Mormon; I feel good about Joseph Smith, and I feel good about the Book of Mormon."<br><br>I asked him, "Would you feel terrible if I gave a commitment and a challenge to you today? You can go on your mission the minute you can testify to your stake president that you have read the Book of Mormon from cover to cover, have pondered and prayed about it, and know that it is true. The minute you can do that, then you can go. But I don't think you should go on your mission to testify of this great restoration of the gospel unless you know that."<br><br>I shall tell you why I have that counsel and why I would counsel you this way. As you get out in your mission field and out into life, the winds will blow against you. You will continue to be tested. That is the purpose of all life. That is the reason we have been sent here, to determine just how committed and dedicated we really are. So the test will continue. Some of you who have returned from your mission are still being tested--have you noticed that? It is not all easy, is it? But if you have a foundation built under you, an anchoring testimony of your own that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God and that he looked up through that grove of trees as God the Eternal Father and his Son Jesus Christ appeared to him, if you have a testimony of your own that he translated by the gift and power of God the Book of Mormon, you have nothing to fear. You will be prepared. If you have done that homework, then I would say to you, "Get with it."<br><br>When I spoke to a group of missionaries the other day, I asked the missionaries a question that I am now going to ask you. I want you to be totally honest because I think it is important for the brethren here on the stand and for all of us to see where we really are on this issue. How many of you have read the Book of Mormon from cover to cover and have pondered and prayed about it and know that it is true? Would you raise your hands for me, please? [hands are raised] This is a good response.<br><br>Among the missionaries the other day about sixty percent of the hands went up. That meant that forty percent did not. There were some hands that did not go up here this morning. Will you take the challenge from me to read the Book of Mormon, to study and ponder about it, and to build your own solid testimony based on the mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith, the divine nature of the Book of Mormon, and the mission of the Lord Jesus Christ? If you do those three things, I say to you that you will be ready in 1988, or sooner, when the Lord reaches out and says through a priesthood leader that presides over you, "We need an elders quorum president; come, fulfill that calling. We need a Relief Society president; come, fulfill that calling."<br><br>I would like to share just one quick story that I think might point out to you the importance of what I am trying to say. A student that was going to this University came to my home a few weeks ago with a lovely girl. He had given her a ring and they were to be married in June. They were in my home to ask me what I thought about it. My missionaries often bring their girlfriends for me to interview to be sure they are all right. This girl was certainly all right as far as I was concerned. We set the date. This was on a Friday night. Saturday evening, about nine o'clock at night, I received a telephone call. The dialogue went something like this:<br><br>"President Ballard?"<br><br>"Yes?"<br><br>"This is Brother So-and-so of the bishopric. I have some terrible news."<br><br>"Oh? What is it?"<br><br>"One of your missionaries has been killed."<br><br>"Oh, no! Who?"<br><br>Then he told me that the young man who had been in my home less than twenty-four hours earlier was gone. And so, rather than standing in the temple in a sealing room to seal that lovely girl to that worthy, faithful young man, three days later I, as his mission president, was preaching his funeral sermon. I do not suppose that I shall ever have a more difficult assignment than that, with that lovely girl and the parents and family sitting on the front row. The chapel was filled as if it were stake conference, and all were sitting there with the same question in their mind: "Why? Why did this happen?" I was impressed to say this, which I will say to you:<br><br>"Do not worry about my missionary; he is all right. He, as far as I know, was worthy in every way because he had lived up to all of the commitments, challenges, and blessings that he had taken upon himself in the temple and through the waters of baptism. Do not worry about him; let us worry that we, from this day forward, are preparing ourselves to be as ready when our time comes as he was."<br><br>My dear fellow students, prepare for tomorrow. We need you. Oh, how the Lord needs you in 1988! If we have the Church as vibrant and growing and expanded as I think we will have, in 1988 I would not be a bit surprised if many of you who are sitting here would be serving in stake presidencies, in bishoprics, in stake leadership assignments, and on high councils--and, yes, there may even be one of you or more serving in the general councils of the Church. You will only serve there, you will only receive the call, if you are ready. So my plea to you this morning for prepared leadership has never been more critical in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints than it is today.<br><br>I now understand abundantly why the prophets have said that the Lord reserved for this last day some of his very choice spiritual sons and daughters. I understand why you have been reserved to come forth now: because he needs you. He needs you desperately in the building of his kingdom. And the Kingdom will expand and move to new horizons by 1988 in direct proportion to how well you are prepared to assume your assignment in leading the kingdom of God on to ever greater heights. For this is how we must prepare for that long-awaited day, the day when the Savior of the world will say, "It is enough," and will come and rule and reign as the King of Kings over his own kingdom here upon the earth.<br><br>May God bless each one of you. You are so precious to us. We, the Brethren, are overwhelmed with the goodness of the youth of the Church. Everywhere I go, in every stake, I see faces like yours; what a reassurance that is to me, for I think that we are in good hands. But I ask you in all sincerity, with all the power of my soul, that if there is anything that needs correcting in your life, get to your bishop today. If there are any commitments that you need to make more strongly, write them down in your journal tonight. Resolve what you have to do to be better and leave this great auditorium today with this commitment: "Heavenly Father, I will be ready in every way--spiritually, physically, emotionally--for whatever it is that thou wouldst have me do in the building of the kingdom on the earth."<br><br>May you have peace in your own heart, knowing that all is well. May the Lord bless your families and may he bless the apartments that you live in here on this campus, that his Spirit will be there in abundance. May all these blessings be yours and ours all the days of our lives and through the eternities, I would ask humbly, and I do it all in the sacred and beloved name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>M.

<br>
I have one advantage over President Oaks and his father. The time at which I served as a corporal in the 145th Field Artillery was just before Noah's ark. They have claim to a more modern period.<br><br>Those occasions on which I come to the Y always serve to put me in a position where my heart beats a little longer and a little faster. And I am in trouble--if I put this manuscript on the podium I cannot see it, and if I hold it up I cannot see you. I'll hold it up. [laughter] Your youth, your hopes, your fears, your anticipations, your buoyancy, and, yes, your despairs seem to be so much a part of me that as I look at you I want to laugh with joy, but I want to weep also. You are so young and so fragile--and yet seem to have such abiding confidence that you know what you are about and where you are going.<br><br>The truth is that in a way you do know where you are going--not perhaps during the next fifty years, but during the eons of eternity. By reading a few words in the 76th section of the Doctrine and Covenants each of you may know where, in a larger sense, you are going. You may have the vain hope that by acting in a telestial or a terrestial manner somehow you will become celestial. Or you may decide in the first place to be celestial and then really reach that goal. The fact which you will ultimately face, whether you like it or not, is that the Lord God does not lie. He keeps his word, and by keeping that word he will inevitably place you in the kingdom you have earned. You, perhaps, will be glad to be where you are placed, thankful that it is better than you dared to hope. But if it is not as good as you could have had, as soon as you get used to the particular light in the place, you will realize that some of those you love are in a place much brighter, and that you could have been with them but did not choose to so live, but thought, rather, that the earthiness of the earth was more pleasure than the promise of the glory of that heaven where you cannot go.<br><br>Then you will be faced with the eternal question which constitutes the torture of living hell: "Why did I do the things which forfeited the glory?" No answer will come to you--perhaps that is what hell is like: eternally asking why but never having the satisfactory answer. We all should take warning that the Lord himself said that there be few who find eternal life, and resolve to be one of the few (see Matthew 7:14).<br><br>I have found that it helps me to look back to my beginnings--to know the purpose of my being and of the efforts of certain evil ones to circumvent that purpose. I realize that I cannot see it as it<i>really</i>was, but I can imagine the meaning to me of certain commandments given in the beginning, and see more clearly why I must aim high and be consistent--and not falter.<br><br>May I go back to the time when I surveyed eternity--and I assure you that for the next 150 pages this account is purely imaginary. There is not a bit of it that you can claim as doctrine--unless you want to--and I cannot be accused of plagiarizing anything.<br><br><i>Each star declares the ordered law of heaven,</i><br><i><i>Each rising sun the order of our day.</i><br><i><i>Yet we on earth--</i><br><i><i>A small one of creation,</i><br><i><i>Held in its place by one law, heaven given--</i><br><i><i>Ponder at our terrifying speed through space.</i><br><i><i>We know exactly when the moon arises,</i><br><i><i>And when the comet flashes into view.</i><br><i><i>We look with precise telescopic vision,</i><br><i><i>And endlessly count galaxies,</i><br><i><i>Each one a million stars,</i><br><i><i>Each star so far away that</i><br><i><i>What we see today</i><br><i><i>Took place so many</i><br><i><i>Thousand thousand years ago</i><br><i><i>That where they are</i><br><i><i>Or what they are today</i><br><i><i>We cannot know.</i><br><i><i>Then, bursting through the cosmic</i><br><i><i>Dark, the voice of prophecy is heard.</i><br><i><i>We learn that Kolob is the nearest</i><br><i><i>To the throne of God;</i><br><i><i>Each revolution takes a thousand</i><br><i><i>Of our years to make its day;</i><br><i><i>That this great star</i><br><i><i>Has been assigned by Him who dwells</i><br><i><i>On high</i><br><i><i>To be the measuring rod</i><br><i><i>Of our eternal way.</i>[Abraham 3:3–4]</i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i><br><br><i><i>There was our home!</i><br><i><i>Our spirits given birth</i><br><i><i>By noble parentage;</i><br><i><i>The Father of us all,</i><br><i><i>A dweller in eternal light,</i><br><i><i>Exalted Maker of the universe,</i><br><i><i>Exalted Man.</i><br><i><i>We bowed before him,</i><br><i><i>Calling him by name</i><br><i><i>Our Father, Elohim!</i><br><i><i>And by his side</i><br><i><i>Our heavenly mother sat</i><br><i><i>As was her due,</i><br><i><i>Not making earths</i><br><i><i>Nor giving them law,</i><br><i><i>But doing what a heavenly mother does,</i><br><i><i>Teaching her spirit children to be true.</i><br><i><i>The spirit children ask, as earthlings do,</i><br><i><i>How may</i>we<i>be like Father, filled with light?</i><br><i><i>How do we obtain a body</i><br><i><i>Firm of flesh and bone? How do we gain the right</i><br><i><i>To be exalted?</i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i><br><br><i><i>What do heavenly mothers say</i><br><i><i>To heavenly children?</i><br><i><i>Then faintly to our souls we</i><br><i><i>Hear her sweet reply.</i><br><i><i>Obey! That is the law</i><br><i><i>Hear all of His commands.</i><br><i><i>Obey each one. Listen and</i><br><i><i>Hear the music of the spheres,</i><br><i><i>Of the worlds as they come into being.</i><br><i><i>Learn heaven's rhythm.</i><br><i><i>Your Father gives you freedom</i><br><i><i>To obey or disobey, but you</i><br><i><i>Yourself must make decision</i><br><i><i>If you would learn to live</i><br><i><i>In heaven.</i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i><br><br>I now pick up the words of Abraham (so you will know that I am not plagiarizing):<br><br><i>And there stood one among them</i><br><i><i>That was like unto God,</i><br><i><i>And he said unto those who were</i><br><i><i>With him: We will go down,</i><br><i><i>For there is space there,</i><br><i><i>And we will take of these materials,</i><br><i><i>And we will make an earth whereon</i>these<br><i>May dwell. [Abraham 3:24; emphasis added]</i></i></i></i></i></i></i><br><br>We--you and I--are "these." Some of you here today are among those of whom he spoke when he said he would make some his rulers. But "it doth not yet appear what we shall be," as John said (1 John 3:2), or which of you is designated.<br><br>I like to imagine what took place in that great assembly. In my mind I compare it, in a sense--though it cannot be compared--to this assembly today. We are all of the earth but from this position on the stand, we, your leaders, look over your thousands and, if the building were full, your twenty thousands, your vast assembly, and think of how it could have been then as the Father spoke to his children.<br><br>Let me try to describe it to you as I have imagined it was in that period of our lives--and I do not pretend to know that this is the way it really was, but I like to think that it might have been rather like this:<br><br><i>The vast concourse of heaven</i><br><i><i>Gathered at the Father's call</i><br><i>[as you gather here at President Oaks's call].<br><i><i>In seats of honor sat the noble ones,</i><br><i><i>Those spirits bright.</i><br><i><i>Jehovah sat upon his Father's right</i><br><i><i>Befitting one who is the</i><br><i><i>Firstborn son.</i><br><i><i>Seated next to him, a brilliant son,</i><br><i><i>His face illumed with an inner light,</i><br><i><i>Was Michael, then Gabriel</i><br><i><i>And Raphael strong.</i><br><i><i>These great ones standing out</i><br><i><i>Amid the throng.</i><br><i><i>And there were others, too,</i><br><i><i>Whose names were not revealed, but later,</i><br><i><i>Given earthly names,</i><br><i><i>Would carry forth the Father's will,</i><br><i><i>His every word and plan fulfill.</i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i><br><br><i><i>Then to the left were other brilliant sons</i><br><i><i>Who liked to win their way by argument</i><br><i><i>And skill in use of words,</i><br><i><i>These were the angels of the sharp debate,</i><br><i><i>Who suited sophistry and logic to their gain.</i><br><i><i>They had not conquered hate. They had not</i><br><i><i>Learned that love, that all-inclusive law of heaven,</i><br><i><i>Implements the law that God has given.</i><br><i><i>And here among them Lucifer held sway.</i><br><i><i>No one could say he was not brilliant.</i><br><i><i>He'd earned his name by brilliant thinking power,</i><br><i><i>Not faith in Elohim and his great love,</i><br><i><i>Not being kind,</i><br><i><i>But by the logic and the process of the mind.</i><br><i><i>A great star, a son of the morning.</i>[Isaiah 14:12]</i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i><br><br><i><i>The Father spoke:</i><br><i><i>The multitude of spirit children</i><br><i><i>Silent grew, and listened</i><br><i><i>To this great exalted Man,</i><br><i><i>This Man of Holiness,</i><br><i><i>Their Father, Elohim:</i></i></i></i></i></i></i><br><br><i><i>My children all: You see in me</i><br><i><i>Exalted man, of flesh and bone</i><br><i><i>And spirit pure. One time, long</i><br><i><i>Long ago, I was as you, a spirit son</i><br><i><i>Of an exalted Father.</i>[see<i>HC</i>6:302–17]<br><i><i>You may become as now I have become</i><br><i><i>But you must do as I have done.</i><br><i><i>I'll send one of my sons</i><br><i><i>Out into space</i><br><i><i>Where matter whirls unorganized</i><br><i><i>Where he, by my command and his own faith,</i><br><i><i>Will form this cosmic matter into earth</i><br><i><i>Where each of you may go, and there</i><br><i><i>Enter within a tabernacle made of earth.</i><br><i><i>Each cell within your body will be of the earth.</i><br><i><i>It will respond to earthly stimuli</i><br><i><i>But you must conquer it</i><br><i><i>To your own will</i><br><i><i>Then bend your will to</i><br><i><i>Be obedient to my command.</i><br><i><i>If you obey, you shall be given</i><br><i><i>Life eternal and</i><br><i><i>Return unto this heaven</i><br><i><i>To dwell with me forevermore</i><br><i><i>To be like me, to share my power,</i><br><i><i>Joint heirs</i><br><i><i>With all of my exalted</i><br><i><i>Sons. I give you now</i><br><i><i>Free agency: the right</i><br><i><i>To be obedient, or to</i><br><i><i>Disobey--this right is</i><br><i><i>Heaven-given to each one.</i><br><i><i>If you should choose to</i><br><i><i>Disobey, you lose your</i><br><i><i>Place in my exalted heaven.</i><br><i><i>The heavens rang with</i><br><i><i>Paeons of exalted joy.</i><br><i><i>The morning stars sang</i><br><i><i>Forth their hymns of</i><br><i><i>Praise.</i><br><i><i>The sons of God with one united</i><br><i><i>Voice</i><br><i><i>Shouted hosannas to the</i><br><i><i>Lord of hosts.</i>[Job 38:7]<br><i><i>All heaven stirred</i><br><i><i>In holy jubilee.</i><br><i><i>All nature trembled</i><br><i><i>In its ecstasy.</i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i><br><br><i><i>But there were those</i><br><i><i>Who took no part with</i><br><i><i>The great joyous throng.</i><br><i><i>To one side in proud disdain stood Lucifer:</i><br><i><i>This rabble shouts in ignorance</i><br><i><i>Of what they face.</i><br><i><i>My plan was better.</i><br><i><i>I would give them place</i><br><i><i>Without an effort on their part</i><br><i><i>If they would follow me.</i><br><i><i>If I can gain enough of</i><br><i><i>Following, I may yet</i><br><i><i>Win what I might have won,</i><br><i><i>Take exaltation's throne,</i><br><i><i>Displace that favored One,</i><br><i><i>The Firstborn Son.</i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i><br><br><i><i>We do not know the means</i><br><i><i>That Lucifer employed</i><br><i><i>To gain his ends,</i><br><i><i>Nor do we know just</i><br><i><i>What is "War in Heaven."</i>[Revelation 12:7]<br><i><i>But war it was,</i><br><i><i>Fought with the means</i><br><i><i>At hand.</i><br><i><i>The hosts of Lucifer</i><br><i><i>Made a determined stand</i><br><i><i>But lost. And mighty Michael</i><br><i><i>And his angels won.</i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i><br><br><i><i>Out of heaven and into the earth</i><br><i><i>The hosts of Lucifer were driven.</i><br><i><i>One-third of all the heavenly</i><br><i><i>Hosts thus lost their heaven.</i><br><i><i>No home was theirs among</i><br><i><i>The concourse of the stars.</i><br><i><i>Their place was gone.</i><br><i><i>They had no home</i><br><i><i>Except to roam the earth,</i><br><i><i>Unwitting agents in the</i><br><i><i>Lord's own plan to</i><br><i><i>Test the agency and</i><br><i><i>Freedom granted unto man.</i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i><br><br>Let us consider for a moment what it might have felt like to be the first man. I have often thought of that--like being driven up Rock Creek Canyon with nothing in the canyon except rocks, suddenly pushed out from a self-sustaining Eden into a world where every gain was made by sacrifice and toil.<br><br><i>Adam looked about him</i><br><i><i>And surveyed the world</i><br><i><i>In which he lived.</i><br><i><i>Forgotten was the glory of his past;</i><br><i><i>Lost to him by heavenly decree,</i><br><i><i>His life in Eden lost to memory</i><br><i><i>His greatest worry how to</i><br><i><i>Feed and clothe his progeny.</i><br><i><i>And by him was his Eve,</i><br><i><i>The fairest of the fair</i><br><i><i>Of that far day.</i><br><i><i>A woman filled with loveliness.</i><br><i><i>She'd borne the pain</i><br><i><i>Of many children,</i><br><i><i>Scattered now upon the land,</i><br><i><i>And raising children of their own.</i><br><i><i>She'd stood by Adam's side</i><br><i><i>When first he tilled the land,</i><br><i><i>And planted seed. Then</i><br><i><i>Watched the growing plants</i><br><i><i>And harvested.</i><br><i><i>She'd learned to cook and sew</i><br><i><i>The skins which covered them,</i><br><i><i>To know</i><br><i><i>The times of change of the moon,</i><br><i><i>Of making of a home,</i><br><i><i>And much about a woman's softening</i><br><i><i>Touch upon her man.</i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i><br><br>Let us listen to a prayer that Adam might have offered--I do not think he did, but he might have (see Moses 5:4).<br><h2><b>Adam's Prayer</b></h2><br><i><i>O Lord, we have not heard thy voice</i><br><i><i>These many days.</i><br><i><i>Our sons and daughters grow</i><br><i><i>Without thy word.</i><br><i><i>Their children grow apace</i><br><i><i>In ignorance of thee--except</i><br><i><i>To know that once thou smiled</i><br><i><i>On us, when we began to be.</i><br><i><i>What shall we tell them, Lord?</i><br><i><i>What is our destiny?</i><br><i><i>Shall we ne'er see thee more?</i><br><i><i>Do we but knock in vain</i><br><i><i>Upon thy door?</i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i><br><br>There is always an answer to a righteous prayer, you know.<br><h2><b>The First Visions</b></h2><br><i><i>One day while Adam tilled his field,</i><br><i><i>A wooden hoe he'd fashioned in his hand,</i><br><i><i>He heard a voice from over Eden way.</i>[Moses 5:4]<br><i><i>The voice was one he recognized</i><br><i><i>As of the Lord</i><br><i><i>With sweet accord he kneeled</i><br><i><i>Upon the land and wiped the perspiration</i><br><i><i>From his face. I hear thee, Lord!</i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i><br><br><i><i>He heard the voice say:</i><br><i><i>Adam, offer sacrifice; begin this day!</i><br><i><i>Take the firstborn and the best from out</i><br><i><i>Thy flock or herd, build me an altar, and</i><br><i><i>With a fire consume the beast.</i><br><i><i>Take not the least, but best.</i><br><i><i>No explanation given--</i><br><i><i>Just that voice from over Eden way.</i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i><br><br><i><i>Adam built an altar on</i><br><i><i>The highest hill, a platform</i><br><i><i>Three feet high and ten feet square.</i><br><i><i>There, he said, I think that will</i><br><i><i>Do.</i><br><i><i>He laid the sticks and got the fire</i><br><i><i>Burning fierce and high</i><br><i><i>Then slew the firstborn lamb--the best</i><br><i><i>He had. No scrub was this.</i><br><i><i>It would have won a prize</i><br><i><i>At any fair.</i><br><i><i>The smoke, most black and thick</i><br><i><i>Rose high into the morning sky.</i><br><i><i>The stench of burning flesh</i><br><i><i>Was on the air.</i><br><i><i>His children and his grandchildren</i><br><i><i>Gathered round and asked:</i><br><i><i>Grandfather, why do you</i><br><i><i>Burn up the lamb,</i><br><i><i>The best one you have?</i><br><i><i>And he replied:</i><br><i><i>The Lord commanded me</i><br><i><i>And I obey.</i><br><i><i>I pray you children likewise</i><br><i><i>Will obey.</i><br><i><i>Said one: If you must burn a lamb or calf</i><br><i><i>Why do you take the best?</i><br><i><i>Why not yon scrubby one?</i><br><i><i>Then Adam said:</i><br><i><i>The Lord said take the firstlings</i><br><i><i>And the best.</i><br><i><i>Some of his children hastened to obey</i><br><i><i>And others kept their firstlings from</i><br><i><i>That day.</i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i><br><br><i><i>The days and years passed by.</i><br><i><i>At stated times the</i><br><i><i>Sacrifice was made.</i><br><i><i>The flocks and herds increased</i><br><i><i>And Adam thus obeyed</i><br><i><i>The Lord's command.</i><br><i><i>One day there stood</i><br><i><i>Before this loyal man</i><br><i><i>An angel of the Lord</i><br><i><i>Who said: Adam,</i><br><i><i>Why dost thou offer</i><br><i><i>Sacrifice?</i><br><i><i>I do not know why.</i><br><i><i>I</i><br><i><i>Only know the Lord</i><br><i><i>Called out of Eden:</i><br><i><i>I recognized his voice.</i><br><i><i>I had not heard it</i><br><i><i>For these many years.</i><br><i><i>He said: Adam, offer</i><br><i><i>Sacrifice.</i><br><i><i>I do not question</i><br><i><i>When I hear that voice.</i><br><i><i>I offer sacrifice;</i><br><i><i>The best I have</i><br><i><i>The firstlings of the flock</i>.<br><i><i>Some of my children offer too,</i><br><i><i>Which thing</i><br><i><i>I wish they all would do.</i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i><br><br><i><i>Then spoke the angel.</i><br><i><i>You are accepted of the Lord</i><br><i><i>With all they loyal sons.</i><br><i><i>This act is a similitude</i><br><i><i>Of what the Son of God</i><br><i><i>Will do</i><br><i><i>When time shall</i><br><i><i>Reach meridian.</i><br><i><i>He'll die upon a cross</i><br><i><i>Then resurrected be</i><br><i><i>That you may come</i><br><i><i>Once more into his presence,</i><br><i><i>With all of your posterity,</i><br><i><i>If they will obey as you obey.</i><br><i><i>Each time you sacrifice</i><br><i><i>You will remember him,</i><br><i><i>Have faith in him,</i><br><i><i>Repent of any evil acts</i><br><i><i>You do.</i><br><i><i>And be baptized, be born again,</i><br><i><i>Of water and of spirit.</i><br><i><i>You will then become his son</i><br><i><i>As all must do.</i>[see Moses 5:5–8; 6:64–68]<br><i><i>Now teach your children</i><br><i><i>They, too, must obey the</i><br><i><i>Lord's command</i><br><i><i>And offer sacrifice and</i><br><i><i>Be baptized and worship</i><br><i><i>Constantly the Lord</i><br><i><i>Who is to come.</i><br><i><i>One day those sons of Adam</i><br><i><i>Who were skeptical</i><br><i><i>Received a visitor.</i><br><i><i>An angel came and</i><br><i><i>Spoke to them (that Lucifer,</i><br><i><i>That Satan to the world):</i><br><i><i>Your father had an angel</i><br><i><i>Speak to him and told him</i><br><i><i>How to worship God--to kill</i><br><i><i>A lamb or calf. I laugh at such</i><br><i><i>Foolishness as he has taught.</i><br><i><i>I, too, am a son of God.</i><br><i><i>I say, believe it not!</i><br><i><i>And they believed it not.</i><br><i><i>Then Adam sent his</i><br><i><i>Loyal sons to preach to</i><br><i><i>Those who errant were,</i><br><i><i>And by the spirit of the</i><br><i><i>Holy Ghost to bring them</i><br><i><i>Back, a promise gave</i><br><i><i>That, if they would repent</i><br><i><i>And be baptized, they yet</i><br><i><i>Could gain their paradise.</i><br><i><i>And many heard the</i><br><i><i>Word and came</i><br><i><i>Repenting to their father's</i><br><i><i>Home.</i>[Moses 5:13–15]<br><i><i>But many would not come.</i><br><i><i>Their selfish hearts</i><br><i><i>Were filled with earthly sin.</i><br><i><i>They could not feel the</i><br><i><i>Words of truth within</i><br><i><i>Their minds--but</i><br><i><i>Rather, with sophisticated</i><br><i><i>Thought,</i><br><i><i>Believed it not,</i><br><i><i>And bowed their heads</i><br><i><i>To riches and to</i><br><i><i>Gain.</i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i><br><br><i><i>Our mother Eve, the mother of all flesh</i><br><i><i>Grieved in her heart</i><br><i><i>The loss of these benighted sons</i><br><i><i>And grieving, prayed:</i><br><i><i>O Lord, give me a son</i><br><i><i>Who will a comfort be;</i><br><i><i>Who'll grow to manhood strong;</i><br><i><i>Who'll worship thee, the Lord,</i><br><i><i>And pray;</i><br><i><i>Who'll keep all thy commands</i><br><i><i>Who will not stray.</i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i><br><br><i><i>Then Cain was born.</i><br><i><i>And Eve rejoiced,</i><br><i><i>Believing that the</i><br><i><i>Lord had heard her prayer,</i><br><i><i>And praised his holy name</i><br><i><i>And said: I have gotten a</i><br><i><i>Man from the Lord.</i><br><i><i>But Cain grew up</i><br><i><i>Rebellious as had Lucifer</i><br><i><i>Before:</i><br><i><i>Who is the Lord, he said,</i><br><i><i>That I should worship him?</i>[Moses 5:16]</i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i><br><br><i><i>His mother Eve mourned o'er</i><br><i><i>This errant son.</i><br><i><i>His father Adam sorrowed</i><br><i><i>That this son rebelled.</i></i></i></i></i><br><br><i><i>Another son was born.</i><br><i><i>To them was given Abel</i><br><i><i>To heal their hearts.</i><br><i><i>This son was one</i><br><i><i>To be obedient</i><br><i><i>To be what they had</i><br><i><i>Hoped that Cain would</i><br><i><i>Be, And as he grew in faithfulness</i><br><i><i>He listened to his father</i><br><i><i>Adam speak the truths</i><br><i><i>Of God revealed</i><br><i><i>To him.</i>[Moses 5:17]<br><i><i>Cain, growing tall and strong</i><br><i><i>And handsome, as such</i><br><i><i>Men are handsome,</i><br><i><i>Looked upon a niece with</i><br><i><i>Lustful fervor and married</i><br><i><i>Her. But neither knew the</i><br><i><i>Lord but turned their hearts</i><br><i><i>Away from Adam, and away</i><br><i><i>From all he taught and</i><br><i><i>From the Lord.</i><br><i><i>They could not hear Him</i><br><i><i>Speak, nor feel when he</i><br><i><i>Had spoken.</i><br><i><i>Then Satan</i><br><i><i>Came to Cain</i><br><i><i>And put into his mind</i><br><i><i>The Oath, the Oath</i><br><i><i>Of Hell:</i><br><i><i>Swear by thy throat</i><br><i><i>That thou wilt not</i><br><i><i>Tell this great secret</i><br><i><i>To thy father Adam</i><br><i><i>And I will show</i><br><i><i>Thee how thou</i><br><i><i>May obtain thy brother's</i><br><i><i>Flocks and herds.</i>[Moses 5:28–29]<br><i><i>Then Cain swore by his throat</i><br><i><i>And Satan made it plain</i><br><i><i>To him</i><br><i><i>Just how to murder</i><br><i><i>And get gain.</i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i><br><br><i><i>Adam called his sons</i><br><i><i>Unto his side and said:</i><br><i><i>I heard the voice of him</i><br><i><i>Who is our God</i><br><i><i>From over Eden way,</i><br><i><i>Say:</i><br><i><i>Offer up an offering this day</i><br><i><i>A sacrifice, a burning</i><br><i><i>Sacrifice of firstborn</i><br><i><i>Calf or lamb--an offering</i><br><i><i>In blood.

And not Adam but Joseph Smith presented his relationship to us through revelation so that we could understand. Joseph Smith was a prophet just as Adam was a prophet, and also a seer and a revelator. He was given the keys to open the way for us to reach out and find and know our Father and our elder brother, his Beloved Son, Jesus Christ. Let us not fail to reach, to seek, to find, and above all to obey.<br><br>In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>S.

<h1>e You Going? - Victor L. Brown - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, I am happy to be with you this beautiful Sabbath evening. I pray that my message may be helpful and uplifting to you.<br><br>At some time in everyone's life, these questions arise: "Who am I? Where did I come from? And where am I going?" The answers are found in the gospel of Jesus Christ. The latter question, "Where am I going?" is the one I would wish to address tonight. My prayer is that this may influence each of you to gain a greater desire than you presently have to live worthy of achieving eternal life. For this is where you may go--where you<i>may</i>go. This is the greatest gift of God to His children, for He said, "This is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39?lang=eng#p38">Moses 1:39</a>).<br><br>May I underline further: "For this is where you<i>may</i>go." The decision as to whether you go there is yours and yours alone. Everyone will gain immortality through the sacrifice of the Savior, but eternal life is another matter. What we do with our lives will determine the outcome. Inasmuch as we must individually earn this great reward the only help we may receive from others is the influence they exert in our lives.<br><br>Much of the inspiration that influences my life comes from the lives of others. Let me tell you of one such example; she was a nine-year-old girl. The story was told me by my brother, the presiding judge of the family court. He was sitting on a child custody case in which a father was suing for the custody of his daughter. She did not want to live with him; she was frightened of him. She was being reared by her aunt. After listening to the arguments on the case from the various attorneys, the judge decided he wanted to get a bit better acquainted with this little girl; so he invited her to the privacy of his chambers--just the gray-haired judge in his judicial robes and a little nine-year-old black girl.<br><br>He asked her, "Who do you love more than anyone else in the world?" She did not respond. He tried again. "Do you love your grandmother more than anyone else in the world?"<br><br>She said, "Nope."<br><br>"Your grandfather?"<br><br>"Nope."<br><br>"Your auntie?"<br><br>"Nope."<br><br>"Who do you love more than anyone else in all the world?"<br><br>And this little nine-year-old girl said, "I love Lord Jesus more than anyone else in the world. Would you mind if I speak to Lord Jesus?"<br><br>The judge said, "You go right ahead."<br><br>So she pushed her chair back from his desk and knelt down and said, "Lord Jesus, will you please bless Mr. Judge Brown so he'll know what's best for me." Touched by the faith of this little girl, the judge was more secure in rendering a wise decision.<br><br>When each of us really loves the Savior more than anyone else in the world, and that love is thoroughly tested, we will be able to respond to the petition, "If you love me, keep my commandments" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/14.15?lang=eng#p14">John 14:15</a>).<br><br>Recently I met a young medical doctor who was completing his medical training as an intern in a hospital. He told us of himself as he bore his testimony in a stake conference. He said that as a young athlete he had set his sights very high. At only thirteen years of age he had started swimming competitively, and during his teen years he spent thirty to forty hours a week training during the summer and twenty to thirty hours a week in the winter. He told us that his desire to become a champion swimmer was so great that he would have done anything to accomplish it. His grades were not what they should have been, and the coach cautioned him; whereon he applied himself and brought them to a satisfactory level. During this period of time he excluded himself from Church activity because, in his words, "Swimming would improve my self-image and give me confidence and the Church would not."<br><br>He went on to become a national AAU champion, winner of a bronze medal in the 1968 Olympics, and an All-American in college for three years. Again in his words:<br><br><i>I did well in college and was able to go to medical school. I would tell myself, "You are an Olympian; you have a good mind; you will become a doctor and have 'the good life.'" I would tell myself this as I was contemplating suicide. I was full of false and vain pride.</i><br><br><i>In medical school I dealt with an indigent population. The people were completely different from me; they frustrated me terribly. I dealt with these frustrations first by hating the people, then by pitying them. As a medical student I frequently thought of taking my own life.</i><br><br><i>A country doctor in southeastern Ohio, with whom I lived for six weeks, talked to me about my family, about returning to my religious heritage and honoring my mother and father. He asked that sometime before I left we pray together. We did, and we started reading the Bible together.</i><br><br><i>I went back to Cincinnati, feeling very sure I could understand any work of literature, and started reading the Bible by myself. I was halfway through Genesis and was learning very little when I said to myself, "There must be chapters written in a way that will be easier to understand." I then turned to Numbers and found that I understood even less. I stopped reading and started praying.</i><br><br>He then went on to tell that he fell in love with a lovely young woman, and they were married. This improved the way he felt about himself and gave him time to think about a future family and how to maintain a good family life. Again in his own words: "I knew that the Church helped tremendously in keeping family ties close. I didn't really want to have to spend the time required to be a good Latter-day Saint. I was hoping to find another church whose gospel was easier to live and didn't ask so much."<br><br>He further stated that as they were driving west to take up residence, they were discussing the subject of raising their children; and his wife, though not a member of the Church suggested that the children be raised in the Mormon Church. He had hoped that she would wait for a while, as he was going to start his internship and knew he would be extremely busy.<br><br>By chance they moved next door to an active Latter-day Saint family--and, I might say, they were in a non-LDS community. He then explained,<br><br><i>The first question they asked us was if we would like to go to church with them on Sunday. Not being able to think of a good excuse, we went. Through this experience my testimony started to grow, first by studying and praying and listening to the testimonies of our stake missionaries. But the fastest growth in my testimony came from the opportunities I had to serve other people.</i><br><br>About six months ago, he was ordained an elder in the Melchizedek Priesthood, and he told of an experience that happened shortly after his ordination. His elders quorum president called him at 5:30 a.m., just before he was to begin a thirty-six-hour call day at the hospital, and asked him if he would please go over to the hospital early to give a blessing to a women who was about to give birth to a child. His first reaction was, "Why me? I'll lose an hour and a half of sleep." But he got up and dressed. Realizing that he was not in the proper frame of mind to give a blessing, he knelt and prayed, searching for the proper spirit. Then he said that as he walked to the hospital "the sun was just coming up on a beautiful new day. When I got to the bedside I saw a beautiful mother about to give birth to a beautiful spirit. After the blessing I thanked the Lord for preparing me."<br><br>Do you recognize the miraculous transformation that had taken place in this young man's life? He had finally achieved a relationship with the Savior. His priorities and values had changed so as to turn his life completely around. As he said, he finally recognized his former self as one of the foolish men spoken of in 2 Nephi:<br><br><i>O that cunning plan of the evil one! O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.28?lang=eng#p27">2 Nephi 9:28</a>]<br><br>He finally recognized that in order to achieve eternal life his relationship with his Heavenly Father was of paramount importance.<br><br>A few months ago I was in a distant area of the Church. A fine-looking young man came up to me and said somewhat impatiently, "Bishop Brown, how long does it take, anyway, to process a mission call?" I said that I was not sure but I did not think it would be too long. We had a short, very pleasant visit. Afterward I asked the stake president about him. He seemed so desirous of serving a mission, and yet he appeared to be older than most prospective missionaries; he appeared to be in his mid- or late twenties.<br><br>The stake president informed me that at one time this young man had been acknowledged as one of the top three drummers in the leading rock bands of the United States. He had previously recorded with Columbia Records and had made a lot of money. He had been totally involved in that scene. One day, he put a gun to his mouth and pulled the trigger. It went off but, miraculously, did not kill him. During his convalescence, he learned of the gospel. He was converted and baptized and now was preparing himself to go on a mission.<br><br>He now had an understanding of eternal life. The contrast between his earlier life and now caused many things of the world to seem hollow and meaningless. With this new light and knowledge the things of God were rich and rewarding, and now his whole desire was to achieve eternal life and influence the lives of others so that they would have the same desire.<br><br>The story is told of a very wealthy man who had a lovely family of seven children and who was living a righteous life. Because of adversity, he lost his wealth. His children died. His wife turned against him, and his friends made light of him. His body was racked with illness. His soul was tormented--and yet, because he desired to return to the presence of his Heavenly Father above all else, he kept the faith. After all this, he said:<br><br><i>For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:</i><br><br><i>And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God: ...</i><br><br><i>All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;</i><br><br><i>My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.</i><br><br><i>God forbid that I shall justify you</i>[speaking of his critical friends]<i>: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/job/19.25-26~27?lang=eng#p24">Job 19:25–26;</a> <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/job/27.3-5?lang=eng#2">27:3–5</a>]<br><br>This evidence of what can happen when the desire to achieve eternal life is sufficiently embedded in our souls.<br><br>As you recognize, the story of Job happened centuries ago. Let me tell you of one that happened just a few years ago. I was attending a stake conference; and on Saturday afternoon between meetings, when we normally have a bite to eat, the stake president asked if he might be excused to visit his wife in the hospital. This was the first I knew that she was ill. Upon further inquiry I found that she was critically ill. As a matter of fact, the doctors indicated that she had just a few more hours to live. I, of course, told the stake president that he was excused from any further responsibilities for the conference, whereupon he said his wife had told him that his responsibility at that time was to carry out his priesthood obligation and that she preferred that he attend to his stake conference responsibilities.<br><br>He went to the hospital and then returned to our seven o'clock meeting. At the conclusion of this meeting, he went back to the hospital and stayed all night by her bedside. He arrived promptly at our meeting Sunday morning and delivered an unusually fine address to the members of the stake. The only time his emotions broke--and then just slightly--was when I suggested that for the intermediate song we sing "I Need Thee Every Hour."<br><br>After the conference was over, I went alone to the hospital to meet a woman who so loved the Lord and her husband as to encourage him to honor his priesthood even under the most trying of circumstances. As I came to her room, I was greeted by her returned missionary son who was by her side. She seemed to be sleeping, so I left. As I returned to my car, her son hurried after me and said that she had roused and asked if I would come back to give her a blessing.<br><br>As I walked into her room, I saw lying on the bed a lovely, beautiful young mother. I do not think she had any gray hair. She had a lovely smile on her face, even though she was so sick. When I expressed my admiration for her faith and reminded her of the blessings she had in store in heaven, she smiled and said, "Bishop Brown, it isn't always easy, but the Lord truly blesses us."<br><br>This good woman had gone through all of the anguish and difficulties of a long siege of cancer, including many operations. Her life was ebbing very rapidly; and yet under these circumstances, realizing full well that it would not be very long before she would face the sorrow of leaving a lovely family, she had the faith and the strength to encourage her husband to do his duty--which really means that she was influencing him in an unusual way to order his life so that he, too, would achieve eternal life.<br><br>The next morning early she quietly passed away. As a righteous wife and mother, she had qualified herself to enjoy the blessings of eternal life. She truly loved the Lord and had proven her love after deep trial, as had Job.<br><br>I have often wondered if the challenge of life in ancient times was really much different from that of today. Certainly the relationship of God to his children is unchanging. His work and his glory have not changed. I suppose Satan's influence changes little, except that it seems to become stronger.<br><br>Remember that in the days of King Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon, the king was wont to have dreams. A young Jewish captive was given by the Lord the interpretation of one of the king's dreams, and was thus brought to his attention. King Nebuchadnezzar, in showing his gratitude, "made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/dan/2.48?lang=eng#p47">Daniel 2:48</a>). At Daniel's request, three of his friends were also raised to high positions in the kingdom--Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.<br><br>Others of the powerful men had a graven image made and by the direction of the king a decree went out that at a given hour each day all should bow down and worship this graven image. "And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/dan/3.6?lang=eng#p5">Daniel 3:6</a>). These young men refused to bow down, and their enemies came before the king to accuse them, saying:<br><br><i>There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</i><br><br><i>Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king.</i><br><br><i>Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?</i><br><br><i>Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?</i><br><br><i>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter.</i><br><br><i>If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.</i><br><br><i>But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/dan/3.12-18?lang=eng#p11">Daniel 3:12–18</a>]<br><br>As these last verses indicate, these three men knew that their God could deliver them if it were His will to do so, but there was no guarantee. Even if he chose not to spare their lives, they made it clear to the king that they would suffer death before giving lip service to the golden image.<br><br>Except for details, is the experience of these young men much different from those of today? Not long ago I visited with a young man who had gone through the fiery furnace of hell. He had filled a mission for the Church, had been a leader in the mission field. After returning home he had succumbed to the temptations of Satan. His golden image was lust and passion. He was excommunicated from the Church. Now, after five years of wrestling with Satan for his eternal soul, he was ready to step out of the furnace, perhaps not free of all signs of the heat of the furnace. Nevertheless, because of the love of God for him and through the blessing of the law of repentance and forgiveness, he once again was to be given the opportunity to earn his place in eternal life. Had he not walked into Satan's domain, he would have been spared the anguish and pain of possibly losing his eternal soul.<br><br>Brother Truman Madsen, in a devotional address here on the campus, told of three young men with the pioneers in their trek west who had the same faith as Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego--<br><br><i>Brother Huntington, Brother Grant, Brother Kimball--all only eighteen years of age, who went with the relief party the second thousand miles to help with the Martin company. On this trip they faced a stream that was swollen with ice and snow. ... The pioneers almost hopelessly stood back, unable to go through in their weakened and emaciated condition. Those three boys carried every one of the company across and then crossed back, sometimes in water up to their waists. All three later died from exposure. When Brother Brigham heard this, he wept and then rose in the majesty of his spirit and said, "God will exalt those three young men in the celestial kingdom of God."</i>[Truman G. Madsen, "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/truman-g-madsen_power-abrahamic-tests/">Power from Abrahamic Tests</a>," October 12, 1971, p. 4]<br><br>Let us now return to the story of Daniel. Later in his history, in the days of King Darius, Daniel still held a high position in the kingdom. In fact, "the king thought to set him over the whole realm." The other leaders, jealous of his power, plotted to have a decree signed that for thirty days no one could call upon any god or man save it were the king. If anyone did so, he was to be thrown to the lions. The scriptures clearly state that Daniel knew of this decree, and he knew the king had signed it. Yet he still prayed to the Lord regularly--three times a day. Those who spied upon him and caught him praying brought him before the king and forced the king to fulfill the punishment set out in the decree. Daniel was put into the den of lions. He had refused to compromise principles even though there was tremendous pressure to do so--pressure even to the point of forfeiting his life.<br><br>The next morning, however, as you are aware, "Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God." By remaining steadfast, he brought recognition to himself as well as to his God. The king sent out a decree that all men should recognize the God of Daniel as the living God (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/dan/6.1-26?lang=eng#primary">Daniel 6:1–26</a>). What might have happened had Daniel succumbed just once to the pressures of men?<br><br>Again, is this so different from today's realities? Has there ever been more pressure exerted by evil and designing men on those searching for righteousness than in our day--pressure that would lead mankind from the pathway to eternal life to the pathway of eternal damnation?<br><br>What, then, do we do to inherit eternal life? In Luke we read:<br><br><i>And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</i><br><br><i>And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? None is good, save one, that is God.</i><br><br><i>Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.</i><br><br><i>And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.</i><br><br><i>Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.</i><br><br><i>And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.</i><br><br><i>And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!</i><br><br><i>For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</i>[Luke 18:18–25]<br><br>Further, from the scriptures we read: "Seek not for riches but for wisdom, and behold, the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto you, and then shall you be made rich. Behold, he that hath eternal life is rich" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.7?lang=eng#p6">D&amp;amp;C 6:7</a>).<br><br>And again from Luke:<br><br><i>And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</i><br><br><i>He said unto him, What is written in the law? How readest thou?</i><br><br><i>And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.</i><br><br><i>And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.</i><br><br><i>But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?</i><br><br><i>And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of all his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.</i><br><br><i>And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.</i><br><br><i>And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.</i><br><br><i>But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,</i><br><br><i>And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him,</i><br><br><i>And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.</i><br><br><i>Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among thieves?</i><br><br><i>And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then Jesus said unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/10.25-37?lang=eng#p24">Luke 10:25–37</a>]<br><br>Time will not permit discussion of other laws, the obedience to which is essential to achieve eternal life. It is the responsibility of each of us to study the scriptures and learn the message they carry. In conclusion, let me quote from one of President McKay's general conference sermons:<br><br><i>The responsibility is upon each individual to choose the path of righteousness, of faithfulness, and duty to fellow men. If he choose otherwise and as a result meets failure, misery, and death, he alone is to blame. President Brigham Young, speaking on this thought once said:</i><br><br><i>If Brother Brigham should take a wrong track and be shut out of the kingdom of heaven, no person will be to blame but Brother Brigham. I am the only being in heaven, earth, or hell, that can be blamed. This will equally apply to every Latter-day Saint. Salvation is an individual operation. I am the only person that can possibly save myself. When salvation is sent to me, I can reject or receive it. In receiving it, I yield implicit obedience and submission to its great Author throughout my life, and to those whom he shall appoint to instruct me; in rejecting it, I will follow the dictates of my own will in preference to the will of my Creator.</i>[<i>Conference Report,</i>April 1957, pp. 7–8]<br><br>It is my humble prayer, my brothers and sisters, that each of us will gain a sufficient desire to do what is necessary--each individually--to be worthy of the greatest of all gifts of God to us and to all of His children, that of eternal life. I bear my witness that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that this is His church over which He presides through a living prophet, President Spencer W. Kimball. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Victor L. Brown was the Presiding Bishop of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 4 June 1978.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>Missionary - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My beloved young people, you take my breath away. I have been overseas for three and one-half years, and you have often heard missionaries say that the congregations are not quite this size overseas; I want you to know that you have literally taken my breath away, not only because of your numbers but also because of who you are and what you represent. I recognize the great responsibility that devolves on me, that we might be able to discuss together things that would be edifying. And as I think of that, let me just read verses 8 and 9 from the 43rd section of the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>And now, behold, I give unto you a commandment, that when ye are assembled together ye shall instruct and edify each other, that ye may know how to act and direct my church, how to act upon the points of my law and commandments, which I have given.</i><br><br><i>And thus ye shall become instructed in the law of my church, and be sanctified by that which ye have received, and ye shall bind yourselves to act in all holiness before me.</i><br><br>And so, wonderful young people, we come together tonight to be edified together.<br><br>I am not going to dwell so much on instruction; I would like just to reminisce, if I might, about some of the wonderful experiences that Sister Simpson and I have had during the past three and one-half years. You know, we feel right at home here at BYU--all of our children have attended school here, and I believe very firmly that BYU is the number one showcase of Mormonism throughout the world. I hope that you young people can keep it that way and recognize the great responsibility that you play in that role.<br><br>In the past we looked forward to this assignment about once a year but, of course, being overseas these past three and one-half years has been a long absence. And I must say that there have been some very significant things that have come to our attention:<br><br>First of all, to be laboring in London, that great city of the world, and then just a few weeks later to find ourselves on the island of Haapai in the Tongan Islands--and to find there the same spirit among the people, the same programs of the Church operating, the same dedication in the hearts of the leaders, and, of course, the same problems. People are people; and it does not matter whether one is in Salt Lake City, or in London, England, or on the island of Haapai in Tonga. The Church moves forward, life goes on, and hopefully people can be lifted up and qualified for the presence of our Heavenly Father.<br><br>Yes, my young people, the gospel is universal. It is for every race and for every color. And are you not grateful that in Heavenly Father's admonition, "This is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39) he does not say<i>some men,</i>but says<i>man?</i>And are you not grateful that our prophet has had the courage to listen to the voice of God and make it possible for all men to have the opportunity of eternal life as long as they adhere to the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ? What a great day we live in!<br><br>What a wonderful thing it is to travel around the world and observe the missionaries! I want you to know that Mormon missionaries are great. I want you to know that the greatest impact in this Church and in the world today is the fact that one thousand Mormon missionaries are returning each month. Can you imagine one thousand returned missionaries being plowed into the leadership and into the membership of this Church and into our communities all over the world--Mormon missionaries taking their place and demonstrating to the world those things that they have been able to teach so effectively during the previous two years?<br><br>As a Mormon missionary goes out into the world he seeks to be honest in heart. Let me tell you about a new missionary down in Hawke's Bay, New Zealand. It was his first week in the mission field; he was trembling and unsure--not of his testimony, but of his ability. His companion took him out to teach a couple who were having their fifth discussion. He did not have anything to say during the discussion. He was very timid. But as they were ready to leave, he went up to this man and, offering a pamphlet with a trembling hand, he said in a quivering voice, "Sir, if you will read this pamphlet, I testify to you that you will know it's the truth because I know it's true." And with that trembling hand he gave that pamphlet.<br><br>This man testifies to me today, now living in faraway England--not as an elders quorum president, although he has been; not as a bishop in the Church, although he has been; not as a stake president; but now as a Regional Representative--that that young man, on his very first week in the mission field, offered him a trembling pamphlet from this Church, saying, "Sir, if you will read this I know you will know that it's true." Now that is the spirit of a Mormon missionary who is honest in heart; and what an effect he can have on the heart of someone else who recognizes that sincerity and is willing to let the gift of the Holy Ghost act upon him!<br><br>Let me take you over to the east coast of England to meet a new convert to the Church. We have just finished a sacrament meeting.<br><br>"Oh, Brother Simpson, that was wonderful! I wish this meeting could have gone on for two more hours. I'm a new convert to your church."<br><br>I asked him how long he had been in the Church.<br><br>"Oh, just three months."<br><br>"Tell me about your conversion."<br><br>He tells this story: "I was out doing my gardening on a Saturday morning; I was all by myself. It as a beautiful morning. All of a sudden I heard a voice behind me that said, 'Sir, do you love the Lord?' I turned around, expecting to see an angel. There were two of them standing there. I came to my feet and took them by the hand and said, 'I love the Lord; come into the house and let's talk about it.'" And that was the beginning of his conversion--the honest in heart meeting the honest in heart. We do not have to have these profound approaches out in the mission field; all we have to do is be sincere and strike that responsive chord that lets someone know we come with proper authority and indeed represent the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>While I am over in England, let me tell you about Lady Spenz. Lady Spenz had her title by virtue of her husband having been a member of the House of Parliament in England. She had a rather large home, her husband was deceased, and she decided to let out some of the downstairs apartments so that she might receive additional income. Along came two Mormon missionaries to rent the room, and they decided that Lady Spenz should have a touch of the gospel. They started teaching her; and after about the third discussion, on a night so quiet that you could hear a pin drop, she was reading in her living room and she could hear through the floorboards the two missionaries downstairs praying, never dreaming for a moment that Lady Spenz was listening. The missionaries prayed, "Heavenly Father, please bless Lady Spenz that she might recognize the truth that we are trying to give her, that she might be acted upon by the gift of the Holy Ghost, that she might come into the waters of baptism, that she might be united with her wonderful husband some day." Well, you can guess the effect of that prayer on this lovely lady, who is now a member of this Church and who thanks the Mormon missionaries for coming into her home and bringing that kind of a blessing.<br><br>Let us jump over to Australia, just to relate another story about the spirit of the gospel in this great continent of the southern hemisphere. Sister Simpson and I were traveling from north to south in Australia and our next stop was Mount Isa. If you have not been to Mount Isa, you have not lived. Mount Isa is tucked away--and I really mean tucked away--and as this airplane came in for its landing to pick up some passengers the pilot said, "We'll have about a twenty-minute stop here." And so, wanting to stretch our legs, we stepped off the airplane. We do not know how the word got there, but here were all the Primary children and a band of forty or fifty members of the Church, and they rallied around us. We were just overwhelmed, and they embraced us and tears were in their eyes.<br><br>They said, "Let's have a meeting," so we had a ten-minute meeting, and the children sang "I Am a Child of God," and we bore a few testimonies right there at the airport, right there in front on the grass. People were watching and listening and we were glad that they were. Then, as we finished our little meeting and went back to our airplane, we had that feeling--where else in all the world can you have that feeling?--of heart meeting heart. We had never seen these people before in all our lives, but automatically and instantly we had everything in common. We were members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and everything that is worth anything was in common and we were one.<br><br>On this same trip I had the privilege of going up into New Guinea. We only have about six or eight members of the Church up there; and we went up to see how this little dependent branch was doing, to reorganize them, and to bless some children. And then we went traveling out in the outskirts of Port Morsby in New Guinea, and we saw the New Guinea people living in their native state. The further we went the more we realized that we were in a very primitive setting, and we were told by our guide that in New Guinea there are seven hundred languages spoken. Can you imagine seven hundred languages on this little island of New Guinea? These people just have to go across the valley to the next little mountainside and there is a whole new group of people--maybe not more than four or five hundred, but a different tribe with a different language, just as different as English is from French or Spanish. And so the thought came to my mind: "The gospel of Jesus Christ must go to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. How are we going to do it? How can we get the Book of Mormon translated into seven hundred different languages? How can we teach these people? And even if we printed the Book of Mormon they couldn't read it--they are illiterate."<br><br>Then and there the thought came to my mind: "How many people are there in this Church who don't read the Book of Mormon even though they have the ability to read it?" And then the question followed: "Does anyone who doesn't read the Book of Mormon have any advantage over someone who cannot read the Book of Mormon? He has no advantage whatsoever." So those of us who have the ability and the blessing of being able to read, let us read this precious document that the Lord has given us in this day. May we take from its precious pages. Then can we think in terms of praying for these people in New Guinea, that one day the gospel will reach them through the vision of a living prophet of God. For President Spencer W. Kimball has visualized the day when all of these native people will have transistor radios--and they have them already; you see them in their hands, in their pockets, hanging in their little villages, on the shop wall, playing the music of the day or the voice of someone talking. All of these people could be available instantly to the miracle of modern-day electronic communication. President Kimball has already had that vision, and in your lifetime you will see many great and wonderful things happening as thousands and hundreds of thousands come into the gospel even though literacy has not been their privilege.<br><br>Now may I take you down to Melbourne, Australia (I hate to bump you around so much). In Melbourne, as in many of our missions in Australia and New Zealand, we were using a technique called "Harvesting the Field"--here again this little heart-to-heart feeling that I was talking about a moment ago. In this "Harvesting the Field" program the missionaries approach the head of the home with something like, "Good evening, sir; we are representatives of the Lord Jesus Christ. May we come in and leave a blessing in your home?" It is as simple as that--representatives of the Lord Jesus Christ offering to leave a blessing in that home. And so, as the missionaries step in, they request the privilege of meeting all the members of the family. Every father is anxious to have the missionaries meet his two daughters and his son, and down comes the mother. Then the missionaries go to their knees--and this is kind of new to these people, but they kneel because the missionaries are kneeling--and then the missionary blesses the home, using terms they can understand. He blesses the children in school; he blesses Dad at work; he blesses the family that they might have peace in their home, that they will always espouse truth, and that the gospel of Jesus Christ might be the light of their home.<br><br>Then, as the missionary finished praying on this one occasion we heard about, the wife was the first one to speak; she said, "I like the way you pray." She had never heard a prayer like that before.<br><br>The father of the home, as he was lighting a cigarette, said, "I feel better already." (He had not heard the Word of Wisdom. But he heard about it the next day, and that was probably one of the last cigarettes he smoked.) But it is beautiful and it is wonderful to see how it is happening in a simple way, and how people respond to missionaries who are honest in heart and who have prepared themselves in every way to represent the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>You know, this church is being felt in high places. May I take you for just a moment down to Wellington, the capital of New Zealand? I was ushered into the office of Mr. Walker, a member of Parliament and the minister of social welfare in charge of all the family problems of New Zealand, and there is a large sign on his wall, the only prominent thing you can see as you step into his great big office. Do you know what it says? "'No other success can compensate for failure in the home.'--David O. McKay, President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints." And this good man, who is a member of the Church of England, says,<br><br>"That is one of the great statements of our day. I never give a talk without quoting President McKay, because I believe what he has said."<br><br>Just a few moments later we were in the office of Mr. Thomson, the minister of justice for New Zealand. We had to talk about some temple marriage matters; and as we were talking about our problem and about the turmoil of the world and about the problems of the world, he acknowledged that about one out of every three marriages was ending in divorce worldwide and that New Zealand statistics were not too different. He also knew--I do not know from what source--that only about one out of twenty temple marriages is destined for divorce. He said, "That is the kind of marriage we need in New Zealand. We need more one-out-of-twenty-type marriages rather than one-out-of-three-type marriages." These men in high places recognize the value of the Church, know what is going on among our young people, and like what we have to offer.<br><br>I cannot leave New Zealand without telling you about this great New Zealand pageant that we had, the first pageant outside of the United States. This pageant, in its size and scope, is probably more like the Manti pageant than any of the others. It was beautiful; it ran for only three nights, but it was thrilling production. We want to thank BYU for the help we had--great help from Brother Robert Manookin and the Music Department. Also, Brother Charles Metten came down and helped us tremendously with our production as our adviser.<br><br>On those three nights we catered to twenty thousand people, more than six thousand of whom were nonmembers of the Church--everybody brought a nonmember. You would also like to know, probably, that out of all these nonmembers not one went away without a personalized copy of the Book of Mormon, because all of the members supplied copies with their personal testimony written in the front of the book, a picture of their family, and an invitation for them to write back and express their own feelings about the Book of Mormon.<br><br>It was a great thrill to see on the side of the temple hill, as it grew dark, the portrayal of the prophets of old foretelling of the Lord Jesus Christ. It was thrilling to see reenacted the Savior's appearance before the people and his teachings to them. It was thrilling to see the Savior as he ascended. He was shown on the top of the New Zealand temple, and of course everything was dark; it looked as though he were suspended in the sky. Then we heard of the "other sheep I have, which are not of this fold" (John 10:16). Father Lehi was depicted coming to the New World. Then, of course, the Polynesians came to the South Pacific through Hagoth (see Alma 63). Then came the restoration of the gospel through the Prophet Joseph, and then, finally, the coming of the restored gospel to these Polynesians and the story of how it was foretold that Mormon missionaries would come among the Maori people declaring that they had the book of their forebears, sleeping in the beds of the people, speaking their language, and partaking of their hospitality.<br><br>At the conclusion of the performance, over the brow of the hill came marching, shoulder to shoulder, dozens and dozens of Mormon missionaries (these were returned missionaries, young men in dark suits and white shirts), with copies of the Book of Mormon; and coming from the other direction were people dressed in all the costumes of the world--all the Scandinavian countries, Holland, Germany, Switzerland, and so on. They met together in the center and quickly assembled into teaching groups--the Mormon missionaries teaching the world--and then the finale came as they turned their backs to the audience and made their way up the hill to the house of the Lord. The floodlights of the temple were then turned on for the first time as these families ascended to the house of the Lord to be sealed together for time and all eternity. It was touching; it was beautiful! I do not know of anything that has touched me quite like seeing all of these Mormon missionaries coming, row after row, to teach the world and to bring light and salvation to the children of men.<br><br>Well, I suppose I might take just another minute to tell you about Dean Rymer. I was on a flight from Australia to New Zealand, and I noticed that my seat companion was a minister from the Anglican Church, the Church of England. I introduced myself and told him what I was doing in New Zealand, and he asked me, "How does it feel to be a member of one of the fastest-growing churches in the world? " He had been hearing things.<br><br>I said, "It's a wonderful feeling, and I'd like to tell you about it."<br><br>"Well, we have some problems in our church with the youth," he said. "What do you do about the youth in your Church? We hardly have any young people coming, and we'd like to do something to stimulate them."<br><br>I spent the next half-hour telling him about young men coming to pass the sacrament as deacons, groomed appropriately and representing the Lord as they should, and about how they had to be worthy to act in the name of the Lord. I told him about the older brothers of these deacons, young men sitting at the priest's table, and about how they came properly groomed and administered the sacrament for the congregation. He was impressed; he was taking notes during all of this.<br><br>Then he said, "You know, I have another problem. I can't get around to all my congregation. And not only that, but they're mostly women--very few men in my congregation." I told him about the Melchizedek Priesthood, and about home teaching. I told him about this army of men going out, hopefully into each home every month. "Oh," he said, "that would be great help! I wish I had something like that. I wish I had some home teachers." Then I told him about visiting teaching and the Relief Society, and he was almost over-whelmed.<br><br>Then he went on to ask me about our buildings; he was concerned about some buildings that they were having to close because they were losing members of the congregation. And I told him that we had approximately six hundred buildings under construction, that we had another five hundred buildings on the drawing board for next year, and that there were another five or six hundred buildings for the year after that. Then I told him about the law of tithing, and told him that every one of these buildings would be dedicated on the day that it was finished and used; that we did not have one penny of debt--not one commercial loan on any piece of physical property in this Church--and he could not believe what he was hearing. And again he was taking notes and writing very rapidly.<br><br>Then we talked about tithing. That is how we do it: because we believe what Malachi said--"Will a man rob God?"--and we believe that the windows of heaven will be opened for those who do what the Lord has asked them to do (see Malachi 3:8–10). Then we talked about welfare, and again he could not believe it when I told him about fast offerings and about the way our people fast two meals and give the equivalent cash to the bishop on the fast and testimony Sunday, and still he was writing.<br><br>After two hours and twenty minutes of flying we finally landed at Auckland Airport. He was writing all the time, and his final comment to me was, "Elder Simpson, these have been two of the most fruitful hours of my life. We're going to have a seminar of all the ministers of the Church of England in Auckland in just a few months' time, and I'm hopeful that you will be able to come and tell them exactly what you have told me." Well, unfortunately, I have been released in the meantime; but Elder Loren C. Dunn is waiting. I have made arrangements for him to meet Dean Rymer, and Dean Rymer is anxious to extend that invitation to Elder Dunn. And I can promise you that Elder Dunn will finish the job and Dean Rymer will never be the same again.<br><br>I should also tell you this: The Sunday following this conversation on the airplane, I heard from one of our good Church members converted from the Church of England that one of her good friends from the Anglican Church came over and said, "You can't guess what happened in church today. I was at the cathedral and Dean Rymer spent the whole hour talking about the Mormon Church. He told us this and that, and then he concluded his comments by saying, 'Now, brothers and sisters, I don't intend to convert you all to the Mormon Church; all I'm doing here today is letting you know that if you live more like the Mormons you're going to be better people.'" Now, that is a pretty good endorsement, and we accept that! I know that Dean Rymer is a good man and I know that the Lord works in mysterious ways his wonders to perform.<br><br>Now, young people, three words of advice as we conclude--four, I guess. Number one (and this really has nothing to do with what I have been talking about except that maybe I have been able to stimulate you to be excited about your membership in this Church): Here you are members of this great University, where you have the privilege of attending religion classes and devotional assemblies; here is this great host of young men and young women headed for the mission field--may I challenge you to be<i>informed</i>. Be informed not only about things of the world, but become informed especially about things of the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>Number two: Will you be willing to<i>do something about it?</i>Will you be willing to answer the call when the call comes? I think we should all follow the admonition of President Spencer W. Kimball; it is brief and you can never forget it. He says very simply: "Do it." And I think we need to do it.<br><br>The third thing I would like to say is this<i>: Be available.</i>It is not enough to be willing. Be available, and by that I mean be available to the gift and spirit of the Lord that you might be among the honest in heart. Whether you are working in the circle of Church membership, talking to a neighbor over the fence, or being called into full-time missionary service, be available to the gift and spirit of the Lord that the Lord might be able to whisper through you, that you might be able to remember that great admonition given by John in the fifteenth chapter, fifth verse, when the Lord says, "For without me ye can do nothing." In all of these stories I have been telling you--about young men going into the home to pray, about two missionaries downstairs praying and Lady Spenz overhearing them, about a young man with trembling hand giving a tract to a potential member of this Church--they succeeded because the spirit of the Lord was with them and because they were doing things the way Heavenly Father would have us do them. "For without me ye can do nothing."<br><br>And the final point:<i>Be thankful.</i>Be grateful that you are living in this time, in this great day when momentous things are happening. Be grateful that you are a member of this Church and that you have the opportunity of enjoying every priesthood blessing that Heavenly Father has for his children. Whether you be male or female, every priesthood blessing can be yours, in total, without reservation, through your conforming to those things that the Lord has given us to do.<br><br>I bear you my solemn witness that I know that God lives. There are a lot of things that I do not know in this world, but these things I know above all else: that God lives, that Jesus Christ is his Son, that he is the head of this Church, and that we are directed today by a living prophet of God whose name is Spencer W. Kimball. May God grant us the ability to appreciate that and to live worthily of it, I pray humbly in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Robert L. Simpson was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 6 August 1978.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>Alike unto God - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I would like to say something about the new revelation relative to the priesthood going to those of all nations and races. "He [meaning Christ, who is the Lord God] inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile" (2 Nephi 26:33).<br><br>These words have now taken on a new meaning. We have caught a new vision of their true significance. This also applies to a great number of other passages in the revelations. Since the Lord gave this revelation on the priesthood, our understanding of many passages has expanded. Many of us never imagined or supposed that they had the extensive and broad meaning that they do have.<br><br>I shall give you a few impressions relative to what has happened, and then attempt--if properly guided by the Spirit--to indicate to you the great significance that this event has in the Church, in the world, and where the rolling forth of the great gospel is concerned.<br><br>The gospel goes to various peoples and nations on a priority basis. We were commanded in the early days of this dispensation to preach the gospel to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. Our revelations talk about its going to every creature. There was, of course, no possible way for us to do all of this in the beginning days of our dispensation, nor can we now, in the full sense.<br><br>And so, guided by inspiration, we began to go from one nation and one culture to another. Someday, in the providences of the Lord, we shall get into Red China and Russia and the Middle East, and so on, until eventually the gospel will have been preached everywhere, to all people; and this will occur before the Second Coming of the Son of Man.<br><br>Not only is the gospel to go, on a priority basis and harmonious to a divine timetable, to one nation after another, but the whole history of God's dealings with men on earth indicates that such has been the case in the past; it has been restricted and limited where many people are concerned. For instance, in the days between Moses and Christ, the gospel went to the house of Israel, almost exclusively. By the time of Jesus, the legal administrators and prophetic associates that he had were so fully indoctrinated with the concept of having the gospel go only to the house of Israel, that they were totally unable to envision the true significance of his proclamation that after the Resurrection they should then go to all the world. They did not go to the gentile nations initially. In his own ministration, Jesus preached only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and had so commanded the Apostles (see Matthew 10:6).<br><br>It is true that he made few minor exceptions because of the faith and devotion of some Gentile people. There was one woman who wanted to eat the crumbs that fell from the table of the children, causing him to say, "O woman, great is thy faith" (Matthew 15:28; see also Mark 7:27–28). With some minor exceptions, the gospel in that day went exclusively to Israel. The Lord had to give Peter the vision and revelation of the sheet coming down from heaven with the unclean meat on it, following which Cornelius sent the messenger to Peter to learn what he, Cornelius, and his gentile associates should do. The Lord commanded them that the gospel go to the Gentiles; and so it was. There was about a quarter of a century, then, in New Testament times, when there were extreme difficulties among the Saints. They were weighing and evaluating, struggling with the problem of whether the gospel was to go only to the house of Israel or whether it now went to all men. Could all men come to him on an equal basis with the seed of Abraham?<br><br>There have been these problems, and the Lord has permitted them to arise. There isn't any question about that. We do not envision the whole reason and purpose behind all of it; we can only suppose and reason that it is on the basis of our premortal devotion and faith.<br><br>You know this principle: God "hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him" (Acts 17:26–27)--meaning that there is an appointed time for successive nations and peoples and races and cultures to be offered the saving truths of the gospel. There are nations today to whom we have not gone--notably Red China and Russia. But you can rest assured that we will fulfill the requirement of taking the gospel to those nations before the Second Coming of the Son of Man.<br><br>And I have no hesitancy whatever in saying that before the Lord comes, in all those nations we will have congregations that are stable, secure, devoted, and sound. We will have stakes of Zion. We will have people who have progressed in spiritual things to the point where they have received all of the blessings of the house of the Lord. That is the destiny.<br><br>We have revelations that tell us that the gospel is to go to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people before the Second Coming of the Son of Man. And we have revelations which recite that when the Lord comes he will find those who speak every tongue and are members of every nation and kindred, who will be kings and priests, who will live and reign on earth with him a thousand years. That means, as you know, that people from all nations will have the blessings of the house of the Lord before the Second Coming.<br><br>We have read these passages and their associated passages for many years. We have seen what the words say and have said to ourselves, "Yes, it says that, but we must read out of it the taking of the gospel and the blessings of the temple to the Negro people, because they are denied certain things." There are statements in our literature by the early Brethren which we have interpreted to mean that the Negroes would not receive the priesthood in mortality. I have said the same things, and people write me letters and say, "You said such and such, and how is it now that we do such and such?" And all I can say to that is that it is time disbelieving people repented and got in line and believed in a living, modern prophet. Forget everything that I have said, or what President Brigham Young or President George Q. Cannon or whomsoever has said in days past that is contrary to the present revelation. We spoke with a limited understanding and without the light and knowledge that now has come into the world.<br><br>We get our truth and our light line upon line and precept upon precept. We have now had added a new flood of intelligence and light on this particular subject, and it erases all the darkness and all the views and all the thoughts of the past. They don't matter any more.<br><br>It doesn't make a particle of difference what anybody ever said about the Negro matter before the first day of June of this year, 1978. It is a new day and a new arrangement, and the Lord has now given the revelation that sheds light out into the world on this subject. As to any slivers of light or any particles of darkness of the past, we forget about them. We now do what meridian Israel did when the Lord said the gospel should go to the Gentiles. We forget all the statements that limited the gospel to the house of Israel, and we start going to the Gentiles.<br><br>Obviously, the Brethren have had a great anxiety and concern about this problem for a long period of time, and President Spencer W. Kimball has been exercised and has sought the Lord in faith. When we seek the Lord on a matter, with sufficient faith and devotion, he gives us an answer. You will recall that the Book of Mormon teaches that if the Apostles in Jerusalem had asked the Lord, he would have told them about the Nephites. But they didn't ask, and they didn't manifest that faith; and they didn't get an answer. One underlying reason for what happened to us is that the Brethren asked in faith; they petitioned and desired and wanted an answer--President Kimball in particular. And the other underlying principle is that in the eternal providences of the Lord, the time had come for extending the gospel to a race and a culture to whom it had previously been denied, at least as far as all of its blessings are concerned. So it was a matter of faith and righteousness and seeking on the one hand, and it was a matter of the divine timetable on the other hand. The time had arrived when the gospel, with all its blessings and obligations, should go to the Negro.<br><br>Well, in that setting, on the first day of June in this year, 1978, the First Presidency and the Twelve, after full discussion of the proposition and all the premises and principles that are involved, importuned the Lord for a revelation. President Kimball was mouth, and he prayed with great faith and great fervor; this was one of those occasions when an inspired prayer was offered. You know the Doctrine and Covenants statement, that if we pray by the power of the Spirit we will receive answers to our prayers and it will be given us what we shall ask (see D&amp;amp;C 50:30). It was given President Kimball what he should ask. He prayed by the power of the Spirit, and there was perfect unity, total and complete harmony, between the Presidency and the Twelve on the issue involved.<br><br>And when President Kimball finished his prayer, the Lord gave a revelation by the power of the Holy Ghost. Revelation primarily comes by the power of the Holy Ghost. Always that member of the Godhead is involved. But most revelations, from the beginning to now, have come in that way. There have been revelations given in various ways on other occasions. The Father and the Son appeared in the Sacred Grove. Moroni, an angel from heaven, came relative to instructing the Prophet in the affairs that were destined to occur in this dispensation. There have been visions, notably the vision of the degrees of glory. There may be an infinite number of ways that God can ordain that revelations come. But, primarily, revelation comes by the power of the Holy Ghost. The principle is set forth in the Doctrine and Covenants, section 68, that whatever the elders of the Church speak, when moved upon by the power of the Holy Ghost, shall be scripture, shall be the mind and will and voice of the Lord.<br><br>On this occasion, because of the importuning and the faith, and because the hour and the time had arrived, the Lord in his providences poured out the Holy Ghost upon the First Presidency and the Twelve in a miraculous and marvelous manner, beyond anything that any then present had ever experienced. The revelation came to the president of the Church; it also came to each individual present. There were ten members of the Council of the Twelve and three of the First Presidency there assembled. The result was that President Kimball knew, and each one of us knew, independent of any other person, by direct and personal revelation to us, that the time had now come to extend the gospel and all its blessings and all its obligations, including the priesthood and the blessings of the house of the Lord, to those of every nation, culture, and race, including the black race. There was no question whatsoever as to what happened or as to the word and message that came.<br><br>The revelation came to the president of the Church and, in harmony with Church government, was announced by him; the announcement was made eight days later over the signature of the First Presidency. But in this instance, in addition to the revelation coming to the man who would announce it to the Church and to the world, and who was sustained as the mouthpiece of God on earth, the revelation came to every member of the body that I have named. They all knew it in the temple.<br><br>In my judgment this was done by the Lord in this way because it was a revelation of such tremendous significance and import; one which would reverse the whole direction of the Church, procedurally and administratively; one which would affect the living and the dead; one which would affect the total relationship that we have with the world; one, I say, of such significance that the Lord wanted independent witnesses who could bear record that the thing had happened.<br><br>Now if President Kimball had received the revelation and had asked for a sustaining vote, obviously he would have received it and the revelation would have been announced. But the Lord chose this other course, in my judgment, because of the tremendous import and the eternal significance of what was being revealed. This affects our missionary work and all of our preaching to the world. This affects our genealogical research and all of our temple ordinances. This affects what is going on in the spirit world, because the gospel is preached in the spirit world preparatory to men's receiving the vicarious ordinances which make them heirs to salvation and exaltation. This is a revelation of tremendous significance.<br><br>The vision of the degrees of glory begins by saying, "Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth" (D&amp;amp;C 76:1). In other words, in that revelation the Lord was announcing truth to heaven and to earth because those principles of salvation operate on both sides of the veil; and salvation is administered to an extent here to men, and it is administered to another extent in the spirit world. We correlate and combine our activities and do certain things for the salvation of men while we are in mortality, and then certain things are done for the salvation of men while they are in the spirit world awaiting the day of the Resurrection.<br><br>Well, once again a revelation was given that affects this sphere of activity and the sphere that is to come. And so it had tremendous significance; the eternal import was such that it came in the way it did. The Lord could have sent messengers from the other side to deliver it, but he did not. He gave the revelation by the power of the Holy Ghost. Latter-day Saints have a complex: many of them desire to magnify and build upon what has occurred, and they delight to think of miraculous things. And maybe some of them would like to believe that the Lord himself was there, or that the Prophet Joseph Smith came to deliver the revelation (see<i>Time,</i>7 August 1978, p. 55), which was one of the possibilities. Well, these things did not happen. The stories that go around to the contrary are not factual or realistic or true, and you as teachers in the Church Educational System will be in a position to explain and to tell your students that this thing came by the power of the Holy Ghost, and that all the Brethren involved, the thirteen who were present, are independent personal witnesses of the truth and divinity of what occurred.<br><br>There is no way to describe in language what is involved. This cannot be done. You are familiar with Book of Mormon references where the account says that no tongue could tell and no pen could write what was involved in the experience and that it had to be felt by the power of the Spirit. This was one of those occasions. To carnal people who do not understand the operating of the Holy Spirit of God upon the souls of man, this may sound like gibberish or jargon or uncertainty or ambiguity; but to those who are enlightened by the power of the Spirit and who have themselves felt its power, it will have a ring of veracity and truth, and they will know of its verity. I cannot describe in words what happened; I can only say that it happened and that it can be known and understood only by the feeling that can come into the heart of man. You cannot describe a testimony to someone. No one can really know what a testimony is--the feeling and the joy and the rejoicing and the happiness that comes into the heart of man when he gets one--except another person who has received a testimony. Some things can be known only by revelation, "The things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God" (1 Corinthians 2:11).<br><br>This is a brief explanation of what was involved in this new revelation. I think I can add that it is one of the signs of the times. It is something that had to occur before the Second Coming. It was something that was mandatory and imperative in order to enable us to fulfill all of the revelations that are involved, in order to spread the gospel in the way that the scriptures say it must spread before the Lord comes, in order for all of the blessings to come to all of the people, according to the promises. It is one of the signs of the times. This revelation which came on the first day of June was reaffirmed by the spirit of inspiration one week later on June 8, when the Brethren approved the document that was to be announced to the world. And then it was reaffirmed the next day, on Friday, June 9, with all of the General Authorities present in the temple, that is, all who were available. All received the assurance and witness and confirmation by the power of the Spirit that what had occurred was the mind, the will, the intent, and the purpose of the Lord.<br><br>Well, this is a glorious day. This is a wondrous thing; the veil is thin. The Lord is not far distant from his church. He is not far removed.<br><br>President Kimball is a man of almost infinite spiritual capacity--a tremendous spiritual giant. The Lord has magnified him beyond any understanding or expression and has given him His mind and His will on a great number of vital matters which have altered the course of the past--one of which is the organization of the First Quorum of the Seventy. As you know, the Church is being guided and led by the power of the Holy Ghost, and the Lord's hand is in it. There is no question whatever about that. And we are doing the right thing where this matter is concerned.<br><br>There has been a tremendous feeling of gratitude and thanksgiving in the hearts of members of the Church everywhere, with isolated exceptions. There are individuals who are out of harmony on this and on plural marriage and on other doctrines, but for all general purposes there has been universal acceptance; and everyone who has been in tune with the Spirit has known that the Lord spoke, and that his mind and his purposes are being manifest to the course the Church is pursuing. We have already called our first Negro elder. He has been assigned to serve in the Florida Fort Lauderdale Mission. We have already called our first Negro sister, assigned to the Brazil Rio de Janeiro Mission. This race and culture now is going to be one with us in bearing the burdens of the kingdom.<br><br>We talk about the scriptures being unfolded--read over again the parable of the laborers in the vineyard (see Matthew 20) and remind yourselves that those who labor through the heat of the day for twelve hours are going to be rewarded the same as those who came in at the third and the sixth and the eleventh hours. Well, it is the eleventh hour; it is the Saturday night of time. In this eleventh hour the Lord has given the blessings of the gospel to the last group of laborers in the vineyard. And when he metes out his rewards, when he makes his payments, according to the accounts and the scriptural statements, he will give the penny to all, whether it is for one hour or twelve hours of work. All are alike unto God, black and white, bond and free, male and female.<br><br><i><i>Bruce R.

<h1>mith: A Revealer of Christ - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I devoutly and sincerely hope that we may have a rich outpouring of the Holy Spirit, for two reasons: first, so that I may say what the Lord wants said and what he would say if he personally were here; and secondly, so that those words will sink into your hearts and you will know of a surety that they are true. I shall take as a subject, "Joseph Smith: A Revealer of Christ."<br><br>I have chosen as a text statement these words, prepared and published by the First Presidency of the Church in 1935 on the occasion of the one hundredth anniversary of the organization of the first Quorum of Twelve Apostles in our dispensation:<br><br><i>Two great truths must be accepted by mankind if they shall save themselves: first, that Jesus is the Christ, the Messiah, the Only Begotten, the very Son of God, whose atoning blood and resurrection save us from the physical and spiritual death brought to us by the fall; and next, that God has restored to the earth, in these last days, through the Prophet Joseph Smith, His holy Priesthood with the fulness of the everlasting Gospel, for the salvation of all men on the earth. Without these truths man may not hope for the riches of the life hereafter.</i>[<i>The Improvement Era,</i>April 1935, pp. 204–5]<br><br>We have a great pattern, a revealed pattern interwoven in all of the revelations that have been given in all ages, that indicates how salvation is made available to men on earth. As we are all aware, we are here on earth as the spirit children of God, our Heavenly Father. We are here inhabiting bodies--tabernacles made of clay--to be tried and examined and tested to see if we will do all things that the Lord directs and commands for his children generally and for each of us in particular. We are here to see if we will believe eternal truth and if we will conform to the principles so accepted and so learned. And if we believe and obey, we manage to do the things that will enable us, first, to have peace and joy and happiness in this life, and secondly, to go on to eternal reward in our Father's kingdom.<br><br>For every age in which the gospel is given, for every gospel dispensation, for every time that a gracious God dispenses the plan of salvation to his children on earth, he follows an identical pattern: he reveals two great truths which apply to the dispensation involved. One of these truths applies to all dispensations and the other to the specific dispensation. The truth of universal application for all men in all ages from father Adam to the last man is that salvation is in Christ; that he is the Redeemer and Savior of men; that in and through his atoning sacrifice, by the blood that he shed and the redemption that he wrought, salvation is available for all men. Because of Christ, all men will be raised in immortality, and those who believe and obey will then be raised unto eternal life in our Father's kingdom.<br><br>Immortality, by definition and in its nature, is to live everlastingly with a body of flesh and bones; it is to be resurrected; it is to have body and spirit inseparably connected. Eternal life, on the other hand, is, for one thing, to live eternally in the family unit and, for another thing, to inherit, possess, and receive the dignity, honor, power, and glory of God himself. Anyone for whom the family unit continues in eternity will have eternal life, and in process of time he will acquire all the dignity, honor, glory, power, might, and omnipotence that the Eternal Father possesses.<br><br>Immortality comes because of the Lord Jesus Christ; it is a free gift for all men. Eternal life is made available through the same atoning sacrifice, and it is a gift to all who obey the law upon which its receipt is predicated. The laws of salvation are the same for every age. They have never varied, and they will never vary. Every man from Adam to the last soul to inhabit this earth must do precisely and exactly the same things and obey the same laws in order to inherit, receive, and possess the same glory in eternity.<br><br>Salvation is in Christ, and in order for men to believe and obey, the laws of Christ and the doctrine of Christ--which comprise his everlasting gospel--must be revealed in whatever age is involved. That is a universal, unvarying requirement. The gospel did not originate in the meridian of time--it did not start when the Lord Jesus was upon earth. It is an everlasting gospel. It commenced in the beginning, it has come down in successive periods or dispensations from the days of Adam to the present, and it will continue as long as men are on earth; and always and everlastingly salvation will be in Christ.<br><br>But we need a revealer of the knowledge of salvation for whatever dispensation is involved. Our revelation says, "Salvation was, and is, and is to come, in and through the atoning blood of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent" (Mosiah 3:18). We need make no mistake about that. Our affection, our interest, our concern, our love, our devotion--all that we have and all that we possess is centered in the Lord Jesus; but, having said that affirmatively and unequivocally and positively, we come to the fact that a revealer of the knowledge of Christ and of salvation is needed for every age of the earth. Thus we find such a thing in our revelations as this: "Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it" (D&amp;amp;C 135:3). And so, for our dispensation, we link the names of Christ and of Joseph Smith.<br><br>Now I read you these words of Brigham Young:<br><br><i>Who can justly say aught against Joseph Smith? I was as well acquainted with him, as any man. I do not believe that his father and mother knew him any better than I did. I do not think that a man lives on the earth that knew him any better than I did; and I am bold to say that, Jesus Christ excepted, no better man ever lived or does live upon this earth. I am his witness. He was persecuted for the same reason that any other righteous person has been or is persecuted at the present day.</i>[John A. Widtsoe, comp<i>., Discourses of Brigham Young,</i>2d ed., pp. 702–3]<br><br>Let us gain a true vision; let us reason together and figure out how the Lord operates with reference to his children. First of all, we read in the visions of Abraham about the noble and great in the premortal life who were foreordained. Abraham is told that he is one of them. They are identified as the offspring of the Father, as spirits, as souls; and then the account says, "And there stood one among them that was like unto God." This is the Lord Jesus, the Lord Jehovah. This is the firstborn in the spirit who, through righteousness and zealousness and obedience, became "like unto God," meaning unto the Father.<br><br><i>And he</i>[that is, Christ]<i>said unto those who were with him</i>[the host of noble and great ones, the ones Abraham had seen]:<i>We will go down</i>[not I, Jehovah, alone, but we, the noble and great, the mighty and valiant sons of our Father; we will go down]<i>for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these</i>[that is, the spirit hosts of heaven]<i>may dwell;</i><br><br><i>And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.</i>[Abraham 3:24–25]<br><br>Who is listed and counted in that great council of eternity, that assemblage of the noble and great seen by Abraham? There is not much question in our minds; they were the people who were foreordained to minister to men in this world.<br><br>We know a little bit about the order of priority, the precedence, and the rank that is involved. We know that the Lord Jesus was number one: mighty, superior, valiant, intelligent above all others. We know that a spirit named Michael was number two, and that he was born into this world as Adam, the first man. We know that a spirit named Gabriel stood third in preeminence, might, and power, and that he came among us as Noah.<br><br>After that we cannot specifically and definitely categorize the various spirits; but we do know that the noblest and the greatest and the mightiest among them were ordained to be heads of dispensations--to be the individuals who, for their era and age and dispensation, would commence the spread of eternal truth on earth. We know, for instance, with reference to Moses, who was the head of one of these dispensations, that "there arose not another prophet . . . in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face" (Deuteronomy 34:10). That sets us a pattern. We know of men like Enoch, who so lived that he perfected his whole city and his whole people, and they were translated and taken up into heaven. We look back at Abraham and consider him to be the Father of the Faithful and rejoice that we are born as his seed.<br><br>There is a limited number of mighty, noble spirits who headed the respective dispensations. How many we do not know; perhaps there were eight or ten or twenty, but the number does not matter. At any rate, we soon have a small group of select individuals who stand in intelligence and power and might next to the Lord Jehovah. In the same sense that he was like unto God, these chosen and select individuals who were destined to head his work for these long ages were like unto Christ.<br><br>When sifting out the relative importance of individuals, without knowing the details, we can conclude that a man born in modern times to head this dispensation was like unto Adam, like unto Moses, like unto Abraham, like unto Christ--in other words, was one of the ten or twenty noblest and greatest spirits who, up to this time, have been born into mortality. He and hosts with him performed their labors and their work in the creative enterprises that brought this earth rolling into existence, and he and his associates headed the periods of time when eternal truth went out to the sons of men.<br><br>That is how we rank and place the prophet Joseph Smith: he is one of the great dispensation heads, and a dispensation head is a revealer for his age and his period of the knowledge of Christ and of salvation. Thus, the other prophets of the dispensation who are associated with him and who come after him, who sustain his work and bear record of him, become witnesses that he--the chief prophet of their age--revealed the Lord Jesus and hence made salvation available.<br><br>This means that in a testimony meeting in our day we link the name of Joseph Smith with that of Jesus Christ. We stand up and say, "I know that Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God and that he was crucified for the sins of the world." And in the next breath we say, "I know that Joseph Smith, Junior, was chosen, appointed, anointed, and called as God's prophet for this age in order to reveal Christ and to reveal salvation." We bear witness of Christ, and we bear witness of Joseph Smith.<br><br>That is the way it has been from the beginning. There have always been testimony meetings. If we had lived in the days of Adam and had assembled to worship the Lord, the Spirit would have rested mightily upon us on occasions and we would have said, "I know that salvation is in Christ who shall come, and I know that Adam, our father, is a legal administrator who holds keys and powers and authority, and that he is the revealer of the knowledge of Christ and of salvation for men on earth."<br><br>If we had lived in the days of Enoch, we would have arisen in our testimony meetings and said, "I testify of Christ, and I testify of Enoch who revealed Christ, and automatically I believe also in Adam who went before." That pattern would also have been followed in Noah's day, in Abraham's day, in Melchizedek's day, and in every age when eternal truth has been revealed. Always we would have linked the name of Christ and the name of the dispensation head, and automatically we would have believed in every prophet that went before.<br><br>We cannot suppose for one minute that it would be possible for someone who lived in the days of the Lord Jesus to believe that he was the son of God and yet to reject the witness of Peter, James, and John. That is a philosophical impossibility. Had we lived in that day it would not have been possible to say, "Well, I'll believe in Christ; but I won't believe in Peter, James, and John, his apostles, who have revealed him to me and who have borne witness of his divine Sonship." The Lord and his prophets always go together. With that in mind let me read these words of Brigham Young:<br><br><i>Whosoever confesseth that Joseph Smith was sent of God to reveal the holy Gospel to the children of men, and lay the foundation for gathering Israel, and building up the kingdom of God on the earth, that spirit is of God; and every spirit that does not confess that God has sent Joseph Smith, and revealed the everlasting Gospel to and through him, is of Antichrist, no matter whether it is found in a pulpit or on a throne</i>. [<i>JD</i>8:176–77]<br><br>Having these concepts and these expressions in mind, I am going to read to you some passages given and spoken by the Lord Jesus, in which he associates himself with John the Baptist. Out of these passages we shall have an affirmation and a reaffirmation of the truth and concept that Christ and his prophets go together, that it is not possible to believe in one without believing in the other, and that by rejecting the prophets we reject Christ himself. Jesus said this:<br><br><i>If I bear witness of myself, yet my witness is true.</i><br><br><i>For I am not alone, there is another who beareth witness of me, and I know that the testimony which he giveth of me is true.</i><br><br><i>Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness also unto the truth.</i><br><br><i>And he received not his testimony of man, but of God, and ye yourselves say that he is a prophet, therefore ye ought to receive his testimony.</i>[John 5:32–35; Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible, hereafter cited as JST; all biblical references without this notation come from the King James Version]<br><br>John bore as persuasive and powerful a testimony as we know of or find in any written record. On those occasions of Christ's visits to him near Bethabara, as he baptized in Jordan, he said, "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world" (John 1:29, 36). That was simply a text statement or a subject head for long discourses that he obviously preached about the divine Sonship. On one occasion John said this--and it is as blunt and as plain as any witness--"He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him" (John 3:36). John said, in effect, "Here is Jesus; he is the Son of God." There was no possible way to believe that John was a prophet and reject the Lord<br><br>Jesus. To accept one was to accept the other. Jesus said,<br><br><i>John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and bore record of me, and ye believed him not; but the publicans and the harlots believed him; and ye, afterward, when ye had seen me, repented not, that ye might believe him.</i><br><br><i>For he that believed not John concerning me, cannot believe me, except he first repent.</i><br><br><i>And except ye repent, the preaching of John shall condemn you in the day of judgment.</i>[Matthew 21:32–34; JST]<br><br>We could recite that over again, paraphrasing the language, and apply it to Joseph Smith and his situation in our day.<br><br>Here is another passage:<br><br><i>Then said the Pharisees unto him, Why will ye not receive us with our baptism, seeing we keep the whole law?</i><br><br><i>But Jesus said unto them, Ye keep not the law. If ye had kept the law, ye would have received me, for I am he who gave the law.</i><br><br><i>I receive not you with your baptism, because it profiteth you nothing.</i><br><br><i>For when that which is new is come, the old is ready to be put away.</i>[Matthew 9:18–21; JST]<br><br>Following those expressions came the ones with which we are so familiar, about putting new wine in old bottles. In other words, we have new revelation in our day in a new church, just as the case was in the meridian dispensation.<br><br><i>Then certain of them came to him, saying, Good Master, we have Moses and the prophets, and whosoever shall live by them, shall he not have life?</i><br><br><i>And Jesus answered, saying, Ye know not Moses, neither the prophets; for if ye had known them, ye would have believed on me; for to this intent they were written. For I am sent that ye might have life.</i>[Luke 14:35–36; JST]<br><br>The principle that the Lord and his prophets go together is a glorious one. Here are some words I wrote on this subject on one occasion.<br><br><i>LIVING ORACLES</i><br><i>We be Abraham's children, the Jews said to Jove;</i><br><i>We shall follow our Father, inherit his trove.</i><br><i>But from Jesus our Lord, came the stinging rebuke:</i><br><i>Ye are children of him, whom ye list to obey;</i><br><i>Were ye Abraham's seed, ye would walk in his path,</i><br><i>And escape the strong chains of the father of wrath.</i><br><br><i>We have Moses the seer, and the prophets of old;</i><br><i>All their words we shall treasure as silver and gold.</i><br><i>But from Jesus our Lord, came the sobering voice;</i><br><i>If to Moses ye turn, then give heed to his word;</i><br><i>Only then can ye hope for rewards of great worth,</i><br><i>For he spake of my coming and labors on earth.</i><br><br><i>We have Peter and Paul, in their steps let us trod;</i><br><i>So religionists say, as they worship their God.</i><br><i>But speaks He who is Lord of the living and dead:</i><br><i>In the hands of those prophets, those teachers and seers,</i><br><i>Who abide in your day have I given the keys;</i><br><i>Unto them ye must turn, the Eternal to please.</i><br><br>With those principles in mind, let us be vividly and acutely aware of their application to Joseph Smith. One of our revelations says--in the words of the Lord Jesus, speaking to Joseph Smith--"This generation shall have my word through you" (D&amp;amp;C 5:10). I think He made that statement, either in those verbatim words or in thought content, to every dispensation head there has been. I think he said it to Enoch, Moses, Abraham, and in principle to all: "This generation shall have my word through you." Someone has to reveal eternal truth, and these brethren whom I have mentioned are the ones to whom the Lord gave that obligation.<br><br>Therefore, we find such directives as this, spoken by the Lord to the Church immediately following its organization on the sixth day of April in 1830. He is talking about Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>Thou</i>[the church]<i>shalt give heed unto all his words and commandments which he shall give unto you as he receiveth them, walking in all holiness before me.</i><br><br>[Now note:]<i>For his word ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth, in all patience and faith.</i>[This sets a dispensation head apart from all other prophets. Here is the subsequent statement about him:]<br><br><i>Behold, I will bless all those who labor in my vineyard with a mighty blessing, and they shall believe on his words, which are given him through me by the Comforter, which manifesteth that Jesus was crucified by sinful men for the sins of the world, yea, for the remission of sins unto the contrite heart.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 21:4–5, 9]<br><br>What is the measure of our discipleship? How do we measure and test how firmly we are rooted in the restored faith? I think one of the great tests is the degree and the extent, the fervor and sincerity, the devotion and true belief that we give to the words that came from the Prophet Joseph Smith. Here is a man that, first of all, gave us the Book of Mormon--the Book of Mormon, which is an account of God's dealings with a people who had the fullness of the gospel, which bears record of Christ, which recounts in plainness and in simplicity the basic and fundamental truths that men must believe to be saved. Here is a man who gave a book of incomparable value--his words, as it were to us, at least, because it was through his instrumentality that they came. Here is a man who gave us the revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants--revelations which speak in the first person, with the Lord Jesus himself being mouth and voice but the lips being the lips of Joseph Smith--a volume of revealed truth where God Almighty speaks through his prophet.<br><br>Here are words that the Prophet gave us in the Pearl of Great Price, the Book of Moses being taken from the Joseph Smith translation of the scriptures and the Book of Abraham being translated from the papyrus. Here are words in many places in the Joseph Smith Translation itself, revealed words that come from God by prophetic power. Here are sermons--majestic, wondrous, marvelous sermons which recount the mind and will and plan and purposes of the Lord to men on earth--for instance, the King Follet sermon from which President Kimball quoted copiously at the funeral sermon of Brother Stapley recently.<br><br>We speak about judging a man by his fruits, and among the great fruits of Joseph Smith are the words that he spoke, the words that he wrote, the inspired message that he gave. I suggest that a measure of discipleship, a standard of judgment whereby we can tell how firmly we are anchored in the faith of the Lord, is how sincerely and completely we believe the words that have come from the Prophet Joseph Smith. Obviously incident to this, we have an obligation and a need to treasure up these words, to search out these truths, to learn what they are, and then to make them a living part of us.<br><br>We bear testimony of Christ, and we do it with all the fervor and conviction and power of our whole soul, striving and laboring to do it by the power of the Holy Ghost; and as our voices echo and reecho the eternal verity that Christ is the Lord, we say also that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God, a legal administrator who had power from God--keys and authority--so that he could bind on earth and have it sealed eternally in the heavens. Here, we say, is Joseph Smith, a revealer of the knowledge of Christ and of salvation for our day. We link the words together in one great testimony of eternal truth; and the reason we have power to bear witness of Christ, through whom salvation comes, is that Joseph Smith, the prophet and seer of the Lord for our day and in our day, has received eternal truth, has borne witness, has given revelation, has laid the foundation.<br><br>Brigham Young once said, "I feel like shouting Hallelujah, all the time, when I think that I ever knew Joseph Smith" (<i>Discourses of Brigham Young</i>, p. 458); and that is as it ought to be, because salvation is in Christ and salvation is available because Joseph Smith revealed Christ to the world. The world either accepts that witness and believes in the Lord's prophets or goes its way and at its peril loses the hope of eternal salvation. One must believe in Adam and Christ, if living in that day; or in Abraham and Christ, if living in that day; or in Moses and Christ if living then; or, in our day, in Joseph Smith and Jesus Christ, crying "Hosanna" and "Hallelujah" and "Praise the Lord" whenever their names are mentioned by the power of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>I am grateful beyond any measure of expression I have that in my soul there rests the absolute, certain conviction that Jesus is the Lord. I know that as well as I know anything in this world. In that same sense--with unshaken certainty and absolute, pure, revealed knowledge--I know that Joseph Smith, Junior, who headed this dispensation, was the Lord's prophet for our day and our time; and that, as he certified, he saw in the spring of 1820 the Father and the Son; and that, as he certified, the revelations and the truths that fell from his lips are the voice and mind and will and purposes of the Lord for me and for all men in our day.<br><br>I pray God our Father that we may be valiant and true, that we may stand affirmatively and courageously in bearing witness of Christ--because salvation is in Christ and in none other--and that we will have the same fervor and the same devotion in linking the mighty and noble name of the head of our dispensation with the name of the Savior himself.<br><br>This I do by way of doctrine and by way of testimony on this occasion in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Bruce R.

<h1>ch is Given, Much is Expected - Dallin H. Oaks - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
This is the eighth time I have addressed the student body of Brigham Young University at the beginning of the Fall Semester. It is always a humbling experience for me. You have a right to expect a significant and useful message, and that poses a great challenge for the President of the University. In trying to meet that challenge I usually reemphasize some things I have said before. I do this because each year I face a new group; only about half of you were here last year, and less than that the year before. Part of my responsibility is, therefore, to stress the same ideals, to reaffirm the same truths, and to give the same advice. Hopefully, my message will be enriched by new experience and new insights that will offer an element of interest to the faculty and others who have heard it before. But my most important objective is to encourage you to do your part to keep BYU and its students on the same steady course we have pursued for over a century, reaffirming the unchanging ideals and truths and the advice that has proven its worth for generations.<br><br>Each of us knows the law of the harvest: "Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap" (Galatians 6:7), and "He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully" (2 Corinthians 9:6). There are a few areas of human activity where the law of the harvest applies more directly than in the pursuit of the knowledge. Those of you who sow sparingly will reap sparingly in the acquisition of knowledge and intellectual accomplishment. The same is true of spirituality. Oh, there will be examples where a person who has sown sparingly may reap a higher grade or be called to a more significant and apparently more desirable church position than one who has sown diligently. But there are things more important than grades or positions; those are only means to an end. In terms of real progress toward our final goals, which are knowledge and eternal life, the law of the harvest is inexorable.<br><br>There is another aspect of the law of the harvest, also of eternal significance. It is expressed in the familiar saying, "Where much is given, much is expected." When the Lord of the harvest has lavished great attention on a particular portion of his vineyard, he expects it to bear fruit, at least in proportion to the attention he has lavished. The prophet Isaiah illustrated this expectation when he described the Lord of the vineyard who "fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine," and "looked that it should bring forth grapes. . . ." When it brought forth wild grapes instead, the Lord of the vineyard cried out in anguish, "What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it?" Why, he asked, when he looked for it to bring forth good fruit, did it fail? Then he called his servants to take away the hedge, break down the wall, and lay waste to the vineyard. "The vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel," Isaiah explains, and when the Lord, considering all the advantages he had bestowed upon this chosen people, "looked for judgment, but [beheld] oppression; [looked] for righteousness, but [beheld] a cry," he decreed that the vineyard should be made desolate (Isaiah 5:1–7). Where much is given, much is expected.<br><br>The Savior reemphasized the same thought in the parable of the barren fig tree:<br><br><i>A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.</i><br><br><i>Then he said unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?</i>[Luke 13:6–7]<br><br>Where much is given, much is expected.<br><br>How does all of this apply to students of BYU? What have you been given? You have recently paid your tuition, $420 for one semester if you are an LDS undergraduate, and more than that for others. It is a large sum, and you and your parents probably sacrificed to pay it. But notwithstanding that sacrifice, do you really think you are paying your own way at Brigham Young University?<br><br>For every dollar you pay in tuition, the leadership of the Church appropriates more than two dollars additional, which is provided by the tithepayers of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. And beyond that, generous donors contribute other important dollars to increase the facilities of this campus, to support its work, and to provide scholarship and loan funds so that some of your number with very special qualifications do not even have to pay all of the $420 tuition.<br><br>Every dollar given to support this institution is given as a freewill offering, often at great sacrifice. I suppose I do not need to tell all of you, though some of you may need to be reminded, that there are sacrifices entailed in paying ten percent of your salary or wages before taxes. That is the practice of the full tithepayers of this Church. For the most part, tithing is not paid out of abundance. Many who pay tithing around the world would look on your housing, food, and clothing--to say nothing of your automobiles--as luxuries beyond what they and their children could ever expect in this life. Many have had no opportunities for higher education in their lives and little more for their children. But they pay tithing, for the Lord has commanded it; and a large proportion of the money they pay is appropriated by the Lord's servants to pay for your education.<br><br>Is it any wonder that every tithepayer in the Church looks on Brigham Young University as his or her university, supported by his or her own sacrifices? Is it any wonder that the leadership and membership of our Church have a very special interest in how BYU students and faculty and other workers accomplish their work and how the University and its students look to the world?<br><br>There is another group whose existence reminds you of something you have been given. They are students who wanted to study at BYU whom we have not been able to admit, and the parents of these applicants. Every year there are more applicants on the outside looking in. Some are not yet qualified for study at BYU, but many of them are. They are forced to wait or go elsewhere because we do not have room to admit them. The completion of your studies will make space for them, and many wait. In a very real sense they are also contributing to the opportunities you now enjoy.<br><br>If any student at Brigham Young University, man or woman, is ever inclined to think that what he does in his studies or with his life while at BYU is of no concern to anyone but himself--that "it's my life and I am not hurting anyone but myself," as we sometimes hear--I hope that student will remember the tithepayers and other donors who are paying for his education, and the eager and worthy students who are praying for the opportunity to take his place. Where much is given, much is expected.<br><br>And now I move to a second theme, closely related to the first. As I do so I invite you to participate in an informal quiz--surely an appropriate exercise on the first day of school. Unlike the quizzes on the last day of school, this one will not be graded; but like every other quiz, it should be interesting and challenging and should serve an educational purpose.<br><br>I invite you to look through my eyes at six events I have observed on campus or things I have read or heard on campus. Each has something in common. Your challenge is to visualize the circumstances and identify the common element. Then we will relate it back to our first theme, "Where much is given, much is expected."<br><br>1. A week ago this morning I stepped out of the Smoot Building at 8:30 in the morning to walk to the Wilkinson Center. It was a glorious day. The rays of the sun bathed the campus in early-morning splendor. The dew glistened on the neatly groomed lawns. The flowers along the west side of the Harris Fine Arts Center provided a rich color contrast. The flag stood out proudly against a blue sky. And someone had put detergent in the fountain. The suds foamed, and some members of our maintenance staff--called away from other needed tasks--were preparing a cleanup operation.<br><br>2. We have an extraordinarily beautiful campus at BYU. It is beautiful because we spend a great deal of time and money on landscaping and cleaning--caring for lawns, shrubs, flowers, and floors. We do this to provide an atmosphere of beauty for our students. We think that learning, which we believe is promoted by the Spirit of the Lord, goes forward most effectively in an atmosphere of order and beauty. We are also concerned with the appearance of the campus, since thousands of visitors come here to see the University of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. These visitors are tithepayers, persons investigating the Church, and prominent people who wish to see Mormonism in action. In order to keep the campus beautiful, we ask that persons dispose of litter in waste containers and not walk across the grass. Sit on it, stand on it, use it for lounging, but do not put feet on it to cut corners and make a path. We have concrete walkways for that. Ever year I make that request at this opening assembly. And every year, when we leave the Marriott Center, scores of students walk across the grass on their way back to class. Most of our students--thousands in number--watch them from the sidewalks.<br><br>3. A student is in academic trouble. Parents who have sent him to BYU with great sacrifice are heartbroken because he is not succeeding. Academic probation has been imposed, and academic suspension is the next step unless there is a speedy change. He is remorseful. His teachers regret the circumstances. Everyone wishes it were otherwise. "What went wrong?" I ask.<br><br>"Well," he says, "I have a hard time studying in the dorm. It's noisy. The fellows there are always horsing around, and I just have to be involved with them. I can't study in the dorm. I guess I could go to the library, but . . . well, I just like to study in my dorm room, but I can't because of my roommate and what's going on in the hall outside."<br><br>4. Every day my office gets hundreds of letters. After they have been examined to remove the routine and the matters that can be handled by others, I still have from fifteen to fifty pieces of mail for my personal attention. Here is one that came a few months ago from Donald K. Nelson, the director of the Harold B. Lee Library. He suggested two library problems I might mention in this talk; they fit in well with my theme. I quote:<br><br><i>Two problems exist; one is total theft where a patron will take either an entire book or entire magazine from the library without checking it out through the proper procedures. The second problem, more difficult to curtail, involves mutilation. Patrons will cut a picture or an entire article out of a magazine or an art print from a book, or even sections from microfilm. Once the book or magazine has been mutilated, we try to replace the item or secure Xerox copies from another library and have them reinserted into the magazine or book. When these efforts fail, the University permanently loses the use of these materials.</i><br><br>5. Here is another example of a letter from my mail. Try to read it through my eyes. It comes again and again, primarily from BYU students, but also from parents, from visitors to the campus, from tithepayers. Aside from letters praising the University, which comprise the largest single category in my mail, this kind of letter is probably the most frequent. It says something like this: "In our class there is a fellow who wears his hair so long that it is clearly in violation of BYU Dress and Grooming Standards. It isn't that he is just a little too late in getting a haircut. He isn't anywhere near the standard." Or the other version tells of the young woman who comes to class in blue jeans. I am not speaking here of nicely tailored denim pantsuits; I am describing jeans that are men's trousers or women's trousers suitable for hiking or slopping the pigs, perhaps modish for some high school somewhere, but not acceptable at Brigham Young University. "Why can't they keep the dress and grooming standards?" the letters ask. "They have promised! Please do something, President Oaks!" Another letter of this type reads like this:<br><br><i>I brought some friends of ours who were investigating the Church to see Brigham Young University, where my husband and I graduated ten years ago. We brought them to the campus because we are so proud of it. We had told them about the standards of the University. But when we walked through the Wilkinson Center and across the campus we saw someone walking in bare feet, and some girls in blue jeans, and some fellows with long hair, and some couples necking on the lawn, and we were just humiliated. Doesn't BYU have its standards any more?</i><br><br>6. Last example: Every day I read the<i>Universe.</i>It is an excellent campus paper, and I hope you read it too. You need to know what is there. Read it now for a moment through my eyes.<br><br>It does not happen often, but sometimes I see something in the<i>Universe</i>that I know to be untrue or at least seriously misleading. It may be in a headline, in an article, or in an editorial; but, more likely, it is in a letter to the editor. One of the stated justifications for letters to the editor is that they give campus people a place to let off steam. Here we read every variety of communication, from brilliant constructive criticism to the most inane and juvenile prattlings. My usual reaction on reading these letters is to marvel at the diversity of opinion we have on the campus. This diversity is valuable--even essential--in a university community, since we learn and grow as we confront a variety of ideas and points of view. But some letters are seriously misleading. One may undertake to describe a University policy, but do so incorrectly. Another may state as a fact something that is not a fact. I am not referring to personal perceptions, ideas, or experiences; I speak of published material that describes policy or makes other representations of fact on matters where the truth is readily available to the writer but was not obtained or used. The erroneous impression created by such a letter to the editor is either careless or malicious--usually just careless, probably nothing more than the exaggeration we are all inclined to employ at times. Most readers laugh and shrug it off, and so do I. But not always.<br><br>Sometimes these careless misrepresentations concern something newsworthy, an important matter in which the public is interested. The results are predictable. We have reporters for each of the major wire services on campus, and one of their primary sources is news copy from the<i>Universe.</i>Whatever appears there, if it has general public interest, is almost certain to appear on the following day in a wire service story to satisfy the curiosity of a coast-to-coast readership. For example, last year one flamboyant letter to the editor in the<i>Universe</i>was immediately seized and used as the sole basis for a wire service story about a "dissenting movement on campus," representing the campus as being divided on an important issue where I judge that the campus--perhaps including even the writer of the letter--was remarkably united. It is sad but true that Brigham Young University is often represented to a national audience by a third-hand process which begins with an individual student's representation of facts in the<i>Universe,</i>and which is then filtered through the always selective and sometimes sensational intake of a wire service stringer and editor. I sigh.<br><br>And so I have spoken of suds in the fountain, paths on the lawn, noise in the dorm, mutilation in the library, jeans on the women, long hair on the men, and distortions in the paper. What do they have in common? And what do they have to do with my theme?<br><br>We find the answer in a letter the apostle Paul wrote to the saints in Corinth over nineteen hundred years ago. Professor C. Terry Warner made the point in a devotional talk over eight years ago on this campus. With his help I now enlarge on the insight he offered.<br><br>Paul wrote to answer some members' questions about whether it was wicked to eat the meat of an animal that had been sacrificed to an idol. I have been in Corinth and seen the sites of those ancient pagan temples. With the aid of the scriptures I can visualize the circumstance. As part of the service of worship of a pagan god, an animal is killed and sacrificed to the idol. Afterwards there is a feast, and the flesh that had been part of the sacrifice is served to those who come to eat. The meal is relatively open. Some who are there are devout idol worshippers. Others are Christians, some accompanying their pagan friends--just there to observe--and others perhaps wavering in their Christian faith, wondering whether they should resume the idol worship from which they had been converted. One Christian partakes of the meat, and another criticizes him. A controversy arises in the church in Corinth, and Paul is asked if it is sin to partake of meat that has been sacrificed to an idol.<br><br>Paul's response is a mixture of reason, faith, and Christian charity, a suitable model for us in every respect. First he reasons with the congregation. "We know," he tells them, "that an idol is nothing"--a lump of brass or a mound of clay (1 Corinthians 8:4). Consequently, the fact that an animal was slaughtered in connection with a ceremony involving an idol does not affect the meat in any way. Nor is the eating of meat of any special significance to God. Consequently, Paul writes, "neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse" (1 Corinthians 8:8). Knowledge of gospel principles liberates us. We are not bound to honor superstition or to revere inanimate objects. That was the reasonable answer, and if Paul had been solely concerned with reason or knowledge in their narrowest sense, that would have been the end of the matter.<br><br>But there is more to the gospel than just knowing the truth and by that means being liberated from the chains of false beliefs. We are also responsible to conduct ourselves so that we edify and help others and do them no harm. Paul had alerted his readers to that fact when he began his letter with these words:<br><br><i>Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.</i><br><br><i>And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.</i>[1 Corinthians 8:1–2]<br><br>So "knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth." And when we are puffed up and think we understand something by our superior knowledge--so called--we should not act before we pause and ponder the possibility of an additional, spiritual insight and gospel obligation. Was there one in this case?<br><br>Paul reminded the saints at Corinth that not every brother who took meat in the house of the idol knew that the idol was nothing, that the ritual of sacrifice was empty and the meat unaffected. Some wavering Christians may have thought that they would show respect to the idol by partaking, thus making their act of eating a form of idolatry. To others, former idolators, the eating of meat in an idol's temple may have been looked upon as a temptation to return to their old ways. Thus, there were those who, though mistaken, felt in their hearts that eating this meat was wrong, because if they were to eat it they would "eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak [would be] defiled" (1 Corinthians 8:7).<br><br>Paul was reminding the Corinthian saints that the knowledge they had about the harmlessness of the meat should not be their only consideration in deciding whether to eat it. They should also consider the impact they would have on others. Listen to the way he explains it:<br><br><i>For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;</i><br><br><i>And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?</i>[1 Corinthians 8:10–11]<br><br><i>Take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours became a stumblingblock to them that are weak.</i>[1 Corinthians 8:9]<br><br>The gospel requires us to act with concern for others, whom we love. And what if we do not? Paul concluded with this sobering reminder: "But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ." His resolve, then, was to be the model for the Corinthians, and for all of us: "Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend" (1 Corinthians 8:12–13).<br><br>The gospel obviously provides a loftier vision of our responsibilities than is suggested by the comment that "it's my life and I don't care what others think." "Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth." Because of all that we have been given, we at Brigham Young University need to be especially concerned about how things look to others--about our effect on others--lest our behavior become a stumbling block to our weak brother. When we sin against our weak brother--for whom Christ also died--and weaken his conscience, we sin against Christ. Therefore, if any of our actions offend our brother we should avoid them. Can you see the bearing of that principle on suds and distraction, on jeans and long hair, on vandalism in the library and distortions in the media? Surely you can relate that to the principle, "Where much is given, much is expected"? Paul's charge to young Timothy will serve as an appropriate summary and conclusion of this point: "Be thou an example of the believers in words, in conversation [i.e., in conduct], in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity" (1 Timothy 4:12).<br><br>Having given some negative examples, I will close with a positive one, of BYU students to whom much was given, from whom much was expected, and who were a worthy "example of the believers." This group met the challenge and represented BYU and our Church and nation in a way that can make us all proud. I refer to the Young Ambassadors who performed this summer in Poland and the Soviet Union. Three other great BYU groups were performing abroad this summer, the A Cappella Choir, the Lamanite Generation, and the American Folk Dancers. All made us proud. I describe the Young Ambassadors because theirs was the special challenge of being the first organized group ever to represent the Church or the University in the Soviet Union. My wife, June, and I were blessed to travel with them.<br><br>The group consisted of twenty-eight BYU students, including five dancers, ten singers, nine orchestra members, and four technicians for sound and lights. The tour director and spiritual leader was Professor Gray Browning of our Russian faculty. The creative director was Randy Boothe of the Entertainment Division. Our objective in sending the group was to provide a living example of Americanism and Mormonism to the people of the Soviet Union.<br><br>The Soviet agency responsible for the tour had agreed to four performances. When they saw the quality of the BYU group, they kept adding performances until the Young Ambassadors finally had nine full shows in Rostov Veliky, north of Moscow, in Kiev (the capital of the Ukraine), and in Moscow itself.<br><br>The Russian people were extremely curious about Americans and Mormons, and very warm and loving in their response to our students' performances. The applause was usually tentative at first, but progressively warmer until the last three or four numbers, when the audience clapped in unison and kept the group for several encores and several of those choice occasions when the performers came down into the audience to distribute BYU buttons, postcards, and autographs, to grasp the outstretched hands, and to exchange words of friendship. By then, the look in the eyes of the people in the audience, which I saw clearly because I always seated myself among them, could only be described as shining. During some of the numbers I saw tears in their eyes and a positive look of rapture. You could see their growing understanding of the message of friendliness and love communicated by our BYU students.<br><br>Before leaving on this trip, most of the twenty-eight students had taken a semester-long course in Russian language and culture from Dr. Gary Browning, so each had enough phrases to carry on a simple conversation with the people they met. After the performances many of the people would remain in the hall, embracing our students and telling them how much they loved the program and how good it had made them feel. After one show in Kiev, a handsome young man of about thirty-five, accompanied by his six-year-old son, introduced himself to us as the Communist Party secretary in charge of culture in that district of the city. He told us through Dr. Browning how impressed he was with the program and especially commented "on how good it made him feel--what a beautiful feeling it communicated." That comment told us we were accomplishing our objective in the Soviet Union.<br><br>Our students were responsible, as the Psalmist said, to "sing the Lord's song in a strange land" (Psalms 137:4). But that could only be accomplished--that beautiful feeling could only be communicated--by those who had spent many months of grueling work to bring their program to a professional level, and who were then willing, unselfishly and cheerfully, to give many, many days in the exhausting routine of performance after performance. More than that, they had to work together harmoniously and live in tune with the Spirit so that they could be instruments in the hands of our Heavenly Father in communicating his Spirit. In all this they succeeded, and the results were beautiful to behold.<br><br>My wife and I also witnessed what I have called "The Miracle of Montana." Early this summer, during a mini-tour to Montana, the Young Ambassadors appeared on the Montana Television Network on the program<i>Today in Montana.</i>While they were working with the producer of this program, Norma Ashby, a tourist who had just returned from the Soviet Union came into the studio. She brought a gift to Norma Ashby from a Soviet television executive whom Norma had hosted in Montana during the executive's tour of the United States several months earlier. When the Soviet executive, Svetlana Starodomskaya, chanced to meet this American tourist in Moscow some time later and learned that the American would be traveling through Montana, Svetlana asked her to take a gift to her friend in Montana. The gift arrived during the forty-five minutes our students were in her studio. This was the beginning of the "Miracle of Montana."<br><br>When Norma Ashby received the gift, she promptly asked our group to take a return gift to Svetlana. So it was that when the Young Ambassadors arrived in Moscow their leaders sought out Svetlana Starodomskaya, who turned out to be a senior executive of Soviet Central TV. This great state network, housed in an immense building in Moscow, programs for thirteen time zones in the Soviet Union. After seeing one of the group's performances in Moscow, Svetlana invited the Young Ambassadors to come to the studio and tape their show for Soviet Central TV.<br><br>June and I were present for the videotaping, and we felt that we were present at history in the making. In that giant Soviet studio, with every modern electronic advantage in cameras, scenery, lighting, and sound, the Young Ambassadors videotaped an hour-and-a-half program. Through their diligence and faithfulness, and through the very evident help of our Heavenly Father, a schedule that originally contemplated a scant four performances had miraculously escalated to a nation-wide television program, which has now been telecast to a viewing audience of approximately 150 million people in the Soviet Union. That is the audience to which the Young Ambassadors were blessed to extend the message of brotherhood and friendliness in the American songs, "You Gotta Have Friends," and "He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother," and in the popular Russian folk song, "Let There Always Be Sunshine." The quality of their show was so high that Svetlana told us as we left the studio, "Whenever you return to Moscow, we want you back on Soviet Central TV." BYU has more standing with the media in Moscow today than it has in New York City.<br><br>I call all of this "The Miracle of Montana." Imagine, taking a small group of students for four performances in Russia, and winding up with a performance before a television audience of 150 million! Can that be a coincidence? It is a testimony to me that when we are ready the Lord will use us for his purposes.<br><br>I could tell you much more about this trip, including the church services we held, the testimonies borne, the rapt attention of the Russian women who slipped into the meeting to feel its spirit, our experiences performing on the street in Kiev, passing out literature in an unprecedented informal tracting exercise, and much more. But I must close by sharing only one more experience, which relates directly to the examples with which I began, the question of how we appear to others.<br><br>After the Young Ambassadors had taped the television show, Svetlana told how much she admired our students, especially the young women. "Your students are not sexual like most young people nowadays," she said. "They are modest in all of their gestures, even when they are expressing very deep feelings." Then she asked: "What does it mean to be a Mormon; how are Mormons different?" At that point it was easy to share what we wanted to share, and we made a friend.<br><br>I was proud as I felt the impact of our students' appearance and performance and as I felt what they had been able to communicate, spirit to spirit. They had been scrupulous in observing BYU standards, and they had been willing to make the effort and the sacrifices necessary to qualify themselves to present the kind of entertainment we wished to have representing the University and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I hope every student in this University will remember the impact that group had on the Soviet audiences and a Soviet television executive. "It made me feel good," he said. "Modest," she said. And then she asked, "What does it mean to be a Mormon?"<br><br>And so we come to a new year. Many of you are new at BYU. This is the first day of classes. You can write on a clean slate in the records of this school year, for good or for ill. The same is true of your personal lives, in the important matters covered in the BYU Code of Honor, which you have promised to observe.<br><br>As you confront the inevitable temptations in your personal lives and the pressures toward mediocrity in your studies, I hope you will remember the responsibilities I have reviewed with you today. Remember also that where much is given much is expected. That our Heavenly Father may help each of us to measure up to this challenge is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Dallin H. Oaks was president of Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 5 September 1978.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1> My Honor&quot; - Spencer W. Kimball - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My beloved brothers and sisters, I express to you my affection and my love for each of you and I appreciate the love you extend in return. I would like to express thanks to Dr. Lee for that beautiful prayer, and I hope that it can extend to me from all the hearts that are gathered here this morning.<br><br>We are delighted to greet you this morning, to welcome you to Brigham Young University, and to wish you well in this exciting new academic year.<br><br>This is a wonderful time in your life. As Victor Hugo once wrote: "Youth, even in its sorrows, always has a brilliancy of its own."<br><br>That brilliance always sparkles in the eyes of students on this campus, and that is one of the reasons I love to come to BYU. But of course we<i>ought</i>to be happy here. We ought to sparkle and shine and radiate with brilliance. We have everything! When a prominent Eastern man who was visiting our offices asked me, "Why are you, the Mormon people such happy folks?" My answer was: "It is because we have everything--the gospel of Jesus Christ, the light, the priesthood, the power, the promises, the covenants, the temples, our families, the truth." Latter-day Saints, especially Latter-day Saint youth, surely should have a brilliance of their own. You should have that sparkle here today.<br><br>I have entitled my remarks this morning, "On My Honor," and I intentionally included in my list of things that make us happy our "promises" and our "covenants." May I concentrate there for just a moment. To do so, I wish to refer to two other greetings you have recently received--one from President Dallin H. Oaks and one from Commissioner Jeffrey R. Holland.<br><br>I quote from President Oak's personal letter to you dated July 6, 1978. It was a most important letter and, having so recently received it, you surely have it still fresh in your minds and in your hearts. It contained a message that must be remembered. It said in part:<br><br><i>We look forward to having you as students at BYU this fall semester.</i><br><br><i>We are proud of high standards of scholarship,</i>personal conduct,<i>and</i>appearance<i>at Brigham Young University. We hope that all students and their parents will join in our determination to maintain these</i>high standards.<br><br>Each student who enrolls at BYU promises to observe all of the requirements of our Code of Honor, including our dress and grooming standards. We expect each student to keep his or her promise. Please examine the enclosed card and brochure so you will be thoroughly familiar with those requirements. . . .<i>Sincerely, Dallin H. Oaks</i>[emphasis added]<br><br>And from that brochure to which President Oaks has referred, I quote these remarks from Commissioner Holland:<br><br><i>Those who come to a church college or university within the Church Educational System enter a</i>special<i>environment of scholarship and student activity. That environment uniquely reflects the</i>standards and moral commitments<i>of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and every student makes his or her own contribution to that spirit on the campus. . . .</i><br><br><i>To facilitate your understanding of our Church Educational System dress and grooming standards,</i>with which you will be expected to comply,<i>this brochure has been prepared for you in advance of your arrival on campus.</i>Your presence will be felt as you honor these commitments. . . .<br><br><i>I wish you well in an educational adventure which will be as important to your spirit as it will be to your mind. May God bless you with a wonderful</i>fact-finding and faith-promoting experience.<i>May he also enable you to bless your own lives as well as the lives of others by</i>following the teaching of his Only Begotten Son<i>who gives each LDS campus its unique light and life. With best wishes, Jeffrey R. Holland</i>[emphasis added]<br><br>Those statements by your school administrators reflect the direction they have received from the Church Board of Education and the Brigham Young University Board of Trustees. They did not manufacture these ideas on their own and no amount of "lobbying" will force them to change. In these instructions to you their own loyalty and integrity are at stake, for they are acting on behalf of the presiding authorities of the Church who direct them. Your loyalty and integrity are at stake in your willingness to abide by that counsel. You have come here "on your honor." Included in this material received from your school administrators, you may have been a little surprised to find a greeting from me on this same subject. May I repeat that expression of love and interest this morning? It is introduced by a phrase I suggested to your older brothers and sisters (and in some cases maybe your parents) who attended this University more than twenty-five years ago. I suggested then and I suggest again to you this morning that Latter-day Saints should have a "style of their own."<br><br>In that written greeting to you this summer I said:<br><br><i>We can create a style of our own. The world has drifted a long way from the standards of cleanliness of body and soul, but we have such faith in our young people that we are certain that if they are properly advised they will always be well dressed and well groomed and free from the sins of the world. They will thus avoid the pitfalls of the adversary and retain their virtue and worthiness: 'Forewarned is forearmed.'</i><br><br><i>One factor contributing to immodesty and a breakdown of moral values is the modern standard of dress and grooming. We must be different. We need not do anything we do not wish to do. We can create our own style and standards. We can influence the patterns among our own people, and we can also help to develop proper community patterns.</i><br><br><i>Some young people have prided themselves in wearing the most tattered, soiled, and grubby attire. If we dress in a shabby or sloppy manner, we tend to think and act the same way. I am positive that personal grooming and cleanliness, as well as the clothes we wear, can be tremendous factors in the standards we set and follow on the pathway to immortality and eternal life.</i><br><br><i>It is my understanding that each student who enrolls in this great institution and its sister Church institutions understands before coming here what the rules and regulations are, and he or she signs the enrollment sheet with a firm promise to obey those rules and regulations. For a young woman to wear short skirts or other immodest wear when she has covenanted otherwise would not be a matter of cleverness in escaping detection but a definite blot on her character. Should any young man promise to observe certain standards of dress or hair length or behavior and then evade those restrictions, certainly his error is deep-seated and is not just a difference of opinion. It is nothing to joke about, but a black mark on his character.</i><br><br><i>'He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.'</i><br><br>Over the recent Labor Day weekend, President and Sister N. Eldon Tanner and their family had a family reunion up at Bear Lake. There were sixty-one family members present. Sunday evening one of the members in the area came up to President Tanner and asked to shake his hand and say a word to him. She said that earlier in the day she and her husband had been discussing the proper observance of the Sabbath day. They decided to watch the Tanner clan during that day. They saw all the men and boys get ready and go to priesthood meeting in the morning, and the whole group went to Sunday School and later to testimony meeting. She said that after seeing this, her husband remarked, "Well, I think I had better go in the house and put on my suit and tie." You see, my young brothers and sisters, the powerful influence of a good example. At all of the meetings during the day, all sixty-one members of the Tanner family had been well groomed, well dressed, and in their Sunday best.<br><br>Please note that I have used the word "covenant" regarding the promises you made when registering at the University. That is a sacred word, and I used it with all of its special spiritual force. I realize that you may not agree fully with our code for dress and behavior. Perhaps you do not agree with it all. You may think it old-fashioned or unnecessary or bothersome, but the simple fact of the matter is that the code exists under the direction of those responsible for the University and you have promised "on your honor" to abide by that standard.<br><br>Please do not misunderstand. We have provided this school so that it may be enjoyed. We are delighted that you are here. We love you and are grateful that of the hundreds of thousands of college-age youth in the Church you are able to attend BYU. But please remember that there is no compulsion for you to come and that you have done so voluntarily. The terms under which you have registered are definite and firm. There is no forum for argument or appeal about the personal standards we expect you to maintain; those have been stated, and you have agreed "on your honor" to abide by them. We have every confidence that you will.<br><br>We realize that there are many other universities in the land, some of which are far less stringent about their regulations. It may be that their location, their faculty, their courses, their leadership are more agreeable to you and that you would be happier there--but we hope not. In any case, since you have pledged on your honor to attend this school under the standards we have predetermined, then it would be most untrue of you to accept the Church's heavy financial support of more than two-thirds of your education and then default through unfaithfulness.<br><br>If I could not agree with the rules, I would hand back my registration slip and say, "No, thank you. Since I cannot agree and since I do not intend to live the rules, therefore I will not pledge something that I will not do." Or I would say, "I have decided to dress immodestly or wear my hair inappropriately; therefore, I will find a school which does not require me to so pledge. I will not enroll. I will not sign to do one thing and then do another." That is what my integrity would make me say if those were my feelings.<br><br>Sister Kimball and I have eaten at many restaurants where it was required of the men to wear a coat and tie. And in those circumstances I say to myself, "If we wish to eat in this restaurant, I will keep my end of the bargain; I will wear a coat and tie." If I were uncomfortable with the rule, I could go to another restaurant where there is no such restriction or I could even go without a meal altogether. But I promise you I would not bolt through the door tieless and demand to be served. Furthermore, and far more seriously, I would not put on a tie at the door, find myself pleasantly and courteously seated, only then tear off my tie and coat and defy the waiter to eject me. Why would I not do such a thing? Because my honor and my dignity and my integrity are more important to me than any meal, however splendid the banquet. If they ask me to wear a tie, I will wear a tie, or refuse--on my honor--to enter.<br><br>I invite you to exercise your integrity in the same way on this campus. I assure you that you do not need to wear a tie at the "Cougareat." But some things we do require in dress, in dignity, in manners and morals. These have been clearly stated and by these you are honor-bound to abide. Your integrity and my integrity require it.<br><br>Obviously, what we say to you here applies to Latter-day Saint students wherever they are, at home and abroad, as well as to our faculty, staff, and administrators. I know one man who nearly moved heaven and earth to get a position on this faculty at BYU, and then--having accepted the position, the salary, the requirements--he began at once fighting the rules, complaining at the salary, and criticizing the leadership of the program and its philosophy. To me he was not only unfair, but he was immoral--and we are opposed to immorality at this school and in its sponsoring institution, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I ask you to keep your promises, to be faithful to your covenants, to live by your standards, and to represent what the sacred tithing dollars invested in this school must always represent. I ask you to do so "on your honor."<br><br>After a message like this, I hope that none of you students hands back your registration slip and that none of the faculty resigns. We want you not only to stay but to love every minute of your experience here. We would like you to feel comfortable about these rules and regulations, these codes of honor, and this discipline. They are part of what we hope to teach at the University. We would like you to see these standards as tools with which you can build a better self. But, of course, they must be respected as tools and care should be exercised so that you do not inflict unnecessary self-injury by abusing yourself against them.<br><br>Many of you know the feeling of missing a nail and hitting your thumb with a hammer. Hammers were designed to drive nails, not to damage thumbs. These standards at BYU are designed to build character, to teach discipline, to symbolize propriety and restraint and honor among the students, the faculty, and the institution as a whole. We would hope that you would not spend your time "banging your heads" against these regulations. They were not designed to create dissension or to make you unhappy or angry. Please respect them as you would any tool and use them for their intended purposes. We would be disappointed to think that they would cause you undue difficulty. As the Lord said of the Word of Wisdom, these regulations, too, are "adapted to the capacity of the weak and the weakest of all saints, who are or can be called saints" (D&amp;amp;C 89:3). We believe everyone can live them without anxiety or hardship.<br><br>Some of you will recall that in almost every general conference, I have encouraged our Latter-day Saints to mend their fences; to fix up and paint up, or else tear down, their old barns; to trim their hedges; and to repair the garage. In many places throughout the world we have had reports of those who have repaired and repainted, restored and improved. We are greatly heartened by these responses. As the Lord said, it does indeed "please the eye and . . . gladden the heart" (D&amp;amp;C 59:18).<br><br>My father always expected neatness around our farm. As a boy, I had as one of my jobs that of soaping and oiling the harness and hanging up the collars and bridles on the pegs in the harness shop. The surrey had to be washed, greased, and painted regularly--too frequently to suit me. I asked my father, "Why wash the buggy? It'll just get dirty and dusty again after the first mile or two." But I made no impression on him and had to do it anyway. And when I painted the buggy, it had to be perfect--no smudges or crooked lines.<br><br>I had to whitewash the fence and paint the rose trellis green. Then I had to paint the barn, the granary, and the harness shed. He insisted that everything be neat and clean and in good repair around the house and the farm.<br><br>One of the great spiritual uplifts I get in visiting this campus is from its immaculate appearance and beautiful grounds. I commend the groundskeepers, the maintenance crew, and all including the faculty, the staff, the administrators, and the students who share in this pride and make this surely one of the most beautiful campuses in the world. I frequently am visited by people from far and near who have been to the campus here and have nothing but praise. It pleases me to no end.<br><br>As I drive down into the valley and see the temple against the hill and this great campus, including the Missionary Training Center, I think of the Lord's promise to us that "ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid (Matthew 5:14). Surely this campus is in its own way a small city set on the hill which<i>should not</i>be hid. It is beautiful--the walks are clean, the windows are shining, the hedges are trimmed, the grass is carefully cut, the walls are not defaced, and care is given to every detail of appearance. Visitors from all over the world come here and comment on its beauty; and that, of course, makes us very proud. But more important to me than the appearance of our buildings is the appearance of our students and our people--our Latter-day Saints.<br><br>By here speaking so directly and emphatically about something like our dress and grooming code, I hope you sense our far more important concern for people's appearance. Barns and gardens and woodsheds matter, but people matter more. Each person bears a great eternal spirit as well as a God-given body, and the two unite to form the soul of an eternal man or woman. The appearance of that eternal soul with all of its outward manifestations surely takes precedence with us over the important matter of newly painted homes and barns and carefully repaired fences.<br><br>As important as they are and as clean as we must keep them, those homes and fences will someday be gone. But you will<i>never</i>be gone. You will always matter; and how you appear, what you represent, and with what integrity you keep your covenants will always matter. For all that we believe about gardens and grassland, about painting and barns and cleaning ditches, we say anew and more vigorously to all of you: Trim your hair appropriately. Wear modest, clean clothing. Your clothes do not need to be new and in the latest fashion, but they should be clean, modest, and neat. Be dignified in your outward appearance and in your manners and in your inward morality. Take pride in your principles. Tear down, as it were, any of the old sheds of the past. Repent of old transgressions and start this school year with clean hands and a pure heart, reflected by good grooming, acceptable apparel, and personally integrity.<br><br>Let me confess one of the sad disappointments I sometimes feel. I want you to know that it is hard for me to be disappointed, and I rejoice in the blessings of the Lord daily. But a few things disappoint me occasionally and one of them is the returned missionary who, after two years of taking great pride in how he looks and what he represents, returns to this campus or some similar place to see how quickly he can let his hair grow, how fully he can develop a mustache and long side-burns and push to the very margins of appropriate grooming, how clumsy his shoes can get, how tattered his clothes can be, how close to being grubby he can get without being refused admittance to school. That, my young returned missionary brethren, is one of the great disappointments in my life. I mention it to the missionaries when I see them in their missions, that they should retain their pride and their honor all the rest of their lives, wherever they go.<br><br>I meet with prime ministers and presidents, with sovereigns and rulers, with political and public figures all over the world; and one of the things they inevitably say about us (and always with warmth and appreciation) is this: "We have seen your missionaries. We have seen them all over the globe, in every state of the union and in most countries of the world. Without exception, they look like young men ought took. They are clean cut, neatly dressed, well groomed, and most dignified." My, that makes me proud! I am trying to do my own little part in missionary work, and that kind of comment makes me so very proud of our 26,000 missionaries. Then sometimes these great leaders say, "Your missionaries look like just the kind of young man I would want to take into my business, or into my government, or into my embassy, or into my law firm." Sometimes they even say, "They look just like the young man I would like to have for a son or a son-in-law." That makes me proudest of all.<br><br>Please, you returned missionaries and all young men who can understand my concern in this matter, please do not abandon in appearance or principle or habit the great experiences of the mission field, when you were like Alma and the sons of Mosiah, as the very angels of God to the people you met and taught and baptized. We do not expect you to wear a tie every moment after you get home, or a white shirt and a dark blue suit every day now that you are back in school. But surely it is not too much to ask that your good grooming be maintained, that your personal habits reflect cleanliness and dignity and pride in the principles you taught. We ask you, for the good of the kingdom and for all those who have done and yet do take pride in you, to live both the letter and the spirit of our dress and grooming and conduct codes. In the spirit of your mission commitments, I ask you to do it "on your honor."<br><br>There is a story told of President Brigham Young who, having urged the people of certain communities to properly clean and dress their premises, refused to go back to preach to them, saying something like this:<br><br><i>You didn't listen to me last time when I urged you to fix up your premises. The same doors are off their hinges; the same barns are still unpainted; the same fences are partly fallen. I will return when you are ready for the next sermon but you haven't done anything about the first one yet.</i><br><br>Now I do not intend to refuse President Oaks's annual invitation to speak to this delightful audience, but this story does tickle the imagination. I suppose next year at this time I could ask President Oaks to give me a report on hair length and skirt length--if the former is still too long and the latter still too short, I guess by President Young's standards I should not return. And after all, we do know whose name this University bears. Can you see President Oaks frantically trying to trim a young man's mustache or attach sequins and patterns to a girl's pair of faded and worn blue jeans?<br><br>Well, I am sure it will not come to that and I would like to be invited to speak again. But even though we smile, it is a very serious matter to me. It<i>would</i>be nice to think that Sermon Number One is being lived before we start Sermon Number Two. Let the words of the Lord linger in your memory as I leave President Young's story with you. "And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?" (Luke 6:46). We sincerely hope every student, faculty and staff member, and administrator will give heed.<br><br>Long years ago one great man, Karl G. Maeser, first president of Brigham Young University, wrote this:<br><br><i>My young friends, I have been asked what I mean by word of honor. I will tell you. Place me behind prison walls--walls of stone ever so high, ever so thick, reaching ever so far into the ground--there is a possibility that in some way or another I may be able to escape; but stand me on the floor and draw a chalk line around me and have me give my word of honor never to cross it. Can I get out of that circle? No, never! I'd die first!</i>[Emerson Roy West, comp.,<i>Vital Quotations,</i>p. 167]<br><br>Like some of the very sophisticated recording equipment I hear in your rooms, we need not only fidelity at this University, but we need high fidelity. We need great faith on your part, for we live in a time of temptation and opposition. Allegiance to the straight and narrow path of Christ is crucial, and it has implications for you far beyond a dress and grooming code or a stated paragraph of moral behavior. We live in a day when our allegiance is being sorely tested. Satan is succeeding too well in many places, and he succeeds when he entices any person to excuse himself in wrongdoing. Almost all dishonesty owes its existence and growth to that inward distortion we call self-justification. It is the first and worst and most insidious form of cheating: We are cheating ourselves.<br><br>When Jesus appeared to Paul on the road to Damascus as he fought against the truth, the resurrected Savior made this telling observation. To Paul he said: "It is hard for<i>thee</i>to kick against the pricks." Note who is hurt: not the principles, not the truth, not the church, not even the Christians who were his opposition. Finally, ultimately, it was Paul being hurt. "[This] is hard for thee [,Paul,] to kick against the pricks" (Acts 9:1–5; emphasis added).<br><br>In a latter-day revelation the Lord explains that the same thing is true of us whenever we "undertake to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, [or] our vain ambition." Then the "heavens withdraw themselves; and the Spirit of the Lord is grieved." Before we are aware, we, too, are left "to kick against the pricks, to persecute the saints, and to fight against God"; and, like Paul, unless we repent, it will be we who are left damaged and bruised by our failure to conform. It will be hard on any of us when we do battle against the truth (D&amp;amp;C 121: 37–38).<br><br>It is a glorious privilege to be attending this, the greatest university in all the world. The other day I had a book handed to me by a very important businessman who was writing his journal, and when he came to a certain place he said, "I went one year to the Brigham Young University, the greatest university in all the world." And he said, "It is a wonderful Church and it has great people in it and great standards." It pleased me very much to know that this man, who was not especially faithful to his activities in the Church, still remembers his years at Brigham Young University. It<i>is</i>a glorious privilege to be attending this, the greatest university in all the world. There is nothing else like it. Have you ever traveled? If you have, take a good look and analyze carefully, and when you take the important points and sum them up, you come out with this final thought: that Brigham Young University is the greatest university in the world. There are universities with larger faculties and more extensive facilities. There are institutions which specialize in more specific areas of the arts and the sciences. But Brigham Young University is designed to enlarge and develop the powers of the spirit, and to educate you for eternity. Here you have the privilege of preparing yourself for life's vocations and at the same time combining theory and practice in preparation for eternal life. Here you prepare to make a living, but more important still you prepare to live toward perfection, toward exaltation and godhood.<br><br>This institution has no justification for its existence unless it builds character, creates and develops faith, and makes men and women of strength and courage, fortitude, and service--men and women who will become stalwarts in the Kingdom and bear witness of the Restoration and the divinity of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is not justified on an academic basis only, for your parents pay taxes to support state institutions, to which you are eligible, in every state of the Union, and most foreign states also have some opportunities. This institution has been established by a prophet of God for a very specific purpose: to combine strong spiritual and moral values with secular education.<br><br>Keep your promises, my young people. Maintain your integrity. Abide by your covenants. Give the Lord, this year and every year, your high fidelity and fullest expression of faith. Do it "on your honor," and you will be blessed now and forever. God bless you--it is a joy to be with you. Peace be with you, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Spencer W. Kimball was President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 12 September 1978.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<br>
My brothers and sisters, I appreciate very much this great privilege of having some part with you and with the activity of this wonderful University. Not only do I always get a thrill when I come on this campus, but I get a thrill when I even think about the great numbers of you who have this wonderful privilege of coming here and spending part of your lives in studying, thinking, and enjoying the association of each other and the leadership of the wise teachers that you have here. This is a place where you can come to pray and live and enjoy the wonders that have been provided for you in this most important dispensation.<br><br>I would just like to say to you that you live in the greatest age that has ever been known in the world. Your forefather's lived on a flat, stationary earth and plowed their ground with a wooden stick, whereas you live on an earth of power steering and jet propulsion where all kinds of knowledge explosions are constantly taking place. We need to develop a character and a personality to match the times.<br><br>You live in the greatest nation that has ever been known since creation. How grateful we ought to be that we did not have in our Founding Fathers the kind of leadership that used Stalin blood purges, Hitler gas ovens, and Castro indignities as the instruments of government! Just think what a different kind of people we might be and what a different nation this would be if we had had the leadership of men other than those that God raised up to write our Constitution and to establish this nation upon Christian principles.<br><br>You live in a time when the knowledge of medicine gives us strong bodies and clear minds. If you had lived in Jerusalem nineteen hundred years ago, your life expectancy at birth would have been nineteen years. This means that of the people who lived and died in that period some lived to be ninety, I suppose, and a great many died at birth; but the average span of life then was nineteen years. If you had been born in George Washington's day in America you would have had an expectation of life of thirty-five years. When I was born it was forty-eight years, but the baby that was born in the Provo hospital today has a life expectation of seventy-five years. That is a very long period of time, and I know because that is just the period that I have been here. (Somebody once asked a man, "Have you lived here all your life?" And he said, "Not yet.") But I am very grateful for those twenty-seven years of life that have already been given to me above the promise that life made to me when I was born. How grateful we ought to be that God and our civilization are adding to our life expectation to give us more time to make more out of this allimportant period of our second estate!<br><br>If any of you plan to remember anything that I am going to say to you tonight, I would just like to have you write in your notebook that--and I am sure of this--<i>the one business of life is to succeed.</i><br><br>I am absolutely certain in my own mind that God did not go to all the trouble of creating this beautiful earth, with all of its utilities and beauties and opportunities, without something very important in mind for those he expected to live here upon it. And I am even more sure that he did not create us in his own image and endow us with these potentially magnificent brains, miraculous personalities, and fantastic physical bodies and then expect us to waste our lives in failure.<br><br>Yet I am also sure of this: that the greatest waste there is in the world is not the devastation that goes with war, nor the cost of crime. It is not the erosion of our soils, nor the depletion of our raw materials, nor the loss of our gold supply. The greatest waste there is in the world is that human beings--you and I--live so far below the level of our possibility. Compared with what we might be, we are just partly alive. That is, we sometimes become guilty of the great sins of fractional devotion and marginal morals, and we turn our lives into a minimum performance. What good does it do to live in this great nation and possess this magnificent earth on which we live if we do not live our lives at the top of our condition? What good does it do for us to come here and accomplish things that might just as well have been done at other, less abundantly blessed times?<br><br>We have these longer lives, and medicine gives us the clearer minds and stronger bodies. The gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored in a fullness never before known in the world. The pathway to eternal life is now brilliantly lighted and perfectly marked so that no one need get off that straight and narrow way except by his own choice. But none of this helps us very much unless we make something out of it above what was made out of it in other times. We live in a very important period; and you have the extra favorable opportunity of coming to this great University where you may have those possessing the greatest intelligence as your teachers and where you may have the most profitable information that has ever been developed in all of the world for your benefit.<br><br>One of the problems that I would like to talk over with you tonight is that great power of evil in our lives that we sometimes call inertia. There is a tendency in nature for things to remain inert; for example, the stone rests on the mountainside for a thousand years, having no power within itself to move. But this is a power that influences nature. A bullet fired from the most powerful rifle, as soon as it uses up its momentum derived from its source of power, soon stops and comes to a complete rest. An automobile being driven comes to a complete rest. An automobile being driven down the highway, unless constantly receiving new fuel from the gas tank, will run out of power, wear out its momentum, and stop.<br><br>Human beings also tend to be like that; we have a natural instinct within us to be inert, to be inactive. We have a powerful appetite to come to rest. Like the stone on the mountainside, we have a tendency to remain where we are rather than doing the things that we ought to do or being as active as we ought to be. Given a push over the cliff, the stone on the mountainside will roll down the hill, but as soon as it wears out its momentum it will come to a stop. Somebody wrote a poem about this as it applies in human life. I do not know who the author was, but this is what he says:<br><br><i>I wish I was a little rock,<br>A-sittin' on the hill,<br>A-doin' nothin' all day long<br>Except just sittin' still.</i><br><br><em>I wouldn't eat, I wouldn't sleep,</em><br><em> I wouldn't even wash.</em><br><em> I'd sit and sit a thousand years</em><br><em> And rest myself, by gosh.</em><br><br>Now, isn't that an inspiring poem? Doesn't that just get you all excited so that you want to go out and turn the world over, do a lot of wonderful things, and be helpful in the community?<br><br>While we are on the subject of great poems, some time ago I was down in Louisville, Kentucky, when the Kentucky Derby was being run; and because I like to investigate success I thought I would like to find out why it was that one of the jockeys in this race could get his horse to run around the track faster than anybody else could get his horse to do it. Aristotle once said that one never knows a thing until he knows it by its causes--that is, every success has a cause, and every failure has a cause. Indigestion has a cause; overweight has a cause. If one can find out what causes failure, the cause can usually be eliminated. In the same way, if one can find out what causes success that cause can be reproduced.<br><br>Since I knew that someday you would invite me to come down here and talk to you, I thought you would like to have me bring some success facts along to help you with, so I checked up and discovered an interesting thing. This jockey won the race by reciting poetry to his horse! I had never heard of anybody doing that before, so I checked into it a little further, since I knew that you would want to know what the poem was; and I am prepared to leave a copy of it here with you if you would like to have it. This is what the jockey said to his horse as they went around the race track--these are the words which inspired the horse to do his best. The jockey kept repeating this poem over and over again so that the horse would be sure to understand it. He said:<br><br><i>Roses are red and violets are blue</i><br><i>And horses that lose are made into glue.</i><br><br>And that so inspired the horse that he won the race.<br><br>But life has also written some glue poems for us. We think of the Master as a very kind-hearted, gentle, fine person, and I am sure he was; but the Lord sometimes said some rather severe things to certain people who did certain things. I checked through all the works of the Bible and a few other places to find out what seemed to me to upset the Lord the most. The Lord was kind to the repentant adulteress, and he had a sympathetic interest with the thief on the cross who wanted to do better; but to the lazy man who said, "I was afraid so I hid my talent in the ground and have brought forth nothing," the Lord said: "Thou wicked and slothful servant." Now, he was a servant--not an enemy, not a traitor, but a servant. I suppose he was a member of the Church, but he was inactive and did not do his job. Then the Lord said to those who were with him,<br><br><i>Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents. . . .</i><i> And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</i>[see Matthew 25:14–30]<br><br>But this devastating inactivity is a common fault.<br><br>I heard a member of the genealogical committee say recently that all the genealogical work of the Church is done by two percent of the members. Two percent do the work; and under that two percent are eight percent who do the praying and bear their testimonies about genealogical work but do not do any. Then there are ninety percent that do not even bear their testimonies or say prayers about it. There is too small a percentage that do all of the things the Lord asks--such as pay the tithing, do the missionary work, and provide the leadership.<br><br>Do you remember the vine dresser who said to his sons, "Go work today in my vineyard," and one said, "I will not go," and the other said, "I go, sir," but went not? In other words, one of the sons was disobedient and the other was irresponsible. To those who are in the class of the one who promised to go and did not go, Christ said, "The publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you" (see Matthew 20:28–31). That is, he put the publicans and harlots in line ahead of those who promised to do the work of the Lord and did not get it done.<br><br>Finally, you remember his promise for our own day, that when he comes he will divide the people into two great groups. In one group will be those who have done as he asked us to do. They are the doers of the word, the ones who live these great principles that we came here to understand and know something about, and to them he is going to say: "Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world." It would be wonderful to be in that group. And then he will say to those on his left hand, "Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire. . . . I never knew you" (see Matthew 25:31–46, 7:21–23). I cannot find anything that was written by Jesus in the Bible or anyplace else where he takes such a harsh attitude as with somebody who merely talks about religion and does not live it, or is not a doer of the word.<br><br>For the most part, we are not bad people. As one great sales manager said about his salesman, "There are no lazy salesmen; there are just salesmen who lack motives." All of us have this power of inertia fastening itself upon us to keep us at rest. But the Lord has given us other powers to fight against inertia--that we might call initiative or motivation--by which we can overcome it and become doers of his word and sharers of his excellence. The thing that pleases him most is living righteous principles and obeying the word of the Lord. The greatest success formula that has ever been given in the world, no matter what one is trying to accomplish, is simply to keep the commandments and to do what the Lord says we ought to do. There is nobody in any business organization that would rather have somebody who violated the Word of Wisdom or broke the Ten Commandments or did not understand the beatitudes or did not know the Articles of Faith. Everyone who gets married wants the same kind of person as the Lord wants in the Church--someone who will keep the commandments.<br><br>I would like to talk to you about this idea of motivation, of overcoming the pull of this destructive dead weight that we call inertia or lack of initiative. There might be many instruments of motivation, but I am just going to mention six here. First, however, I would like to give you an illustration of what I am going to try to say; and although this illustration actually comes from an evil source, the principle itself is still a good one.<br><br>In 1929, Adolf Hitler, a young army corporal, sat in his prison cell in Germany writing in his book,<i>Mein Kampf,</i>his plan to make Germany the greatest nation in the world. The fact that, starting out singlehanded, he almost upset the world indicated that he had something. How did he do it? The answer is in his book. In effect he said that the question of Germany regaining her power was not how to manufacture or distribute arms, but how to produce in people that will to win, that spirit of determination which produces a thousand different methods, each of which ends with arms. Wars are not won with tanks or guns or airplanes or oil, but with that spirit of determination inside of people. That is also how souls are saved, great universities are built, and great scholars and scientists come into being--by the overcoming of this inertia that tends to hold us down and keep us inactive.<br><br>Many people know what is right but just do not always follow through. Let me mention some of the means by which we might get ourselves in motion. Socrates said at one time that he who would move the world must first move himself. Here are six motivating factors--and you might have a lot of others, but I hope that some of you will remember these.<br><br>Motive factor number one: We motivate people, including ourselves, with<i>ideas.</i>There are multitudes of ideas in books and minds and situations. Victor Hugo once said that the most powerful influence in the world is an idea whose time has come, and an idea's time comes when we get a harness on it so that it can be made to do work for us. Where do we get ideas? I would like to suggest to you that the best ideas you will probably ever have in your life are those that you yourself think and for which you work out the details. But we do not need to limit our ideas to our own manufacture; we have a lot of wonderful sources of ideas--for example, the scriptures. I get a little chill up and down my backbone every time I think that Ican open the holy scriptures and read the word of the Lord. I know from them what he would have me do. I can go back and relive the antemortal council in heaven; I can go ahead and prelive the celestial kingdom. In the 76th section of the Doctrine and Covenants I can find out who is going to be there and why, and I can do the same with all the other kingdoms, almost as though I were having a conversation with the Lord. What a thrilling opportunity!<br><br>Another source of ideas is found in the work of the great poets. Somebody has said that the poets stand next to the prophets in their ability to lift us up. One of my heroes many years ago used to be Grantland Rice, the great sportswriter who used to go around the country following the champions of sport. He tried to isolate those traits that made athletes champions, and then he wrote some seven hundred poems about them. One of them is entitled "Courage." He said:<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br><i>I'd like to think that I can look at death and smile and say,<br>All I have left now is my final breath; take that away,<br>And you must either leave me dust, or dreams, or in far flight,<br>The soul that wanders where the stardust streams through endless night.</i><br><br><i>But I'd rather think that I can look at life with this to say:<br>Send what you will of struggle or strife, blue skies or gray,<br>I'll stand against the final charge of hate by peak and pit,<br>And nothing in the steel-clad fist of fate can make me quit.</i><br><br>He was no dropout--he was not about to get weary of some good course he was following.<br><br>Ernest Henley was a hopeless cripple when he wrote "Invictus" and said:<br><br><i>Out of the night that covers me,<br>Black as the Pit from pole to pole,<br>I thank whatever gods may be<br>For my unconquerable soul.</i><br><br>In the fell clutch of circumstance,<br>I have not winced nor cried aloud:<br>Under the bludgeonings of chance<br>My head is bloody, but unbowed.<br><br>Beyond this veil of wrath and tears<br>Looms but the horror of the shade,<br>And yet the menace of the years<br>Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.<br><br>It matters not how strait the gate,<br>How charged with punishment the scroll,<br>I am the master of my fate:<br>I am the captain of my soul.<br><br>Just think of the great philosophies, the great ambitions, the great enthusiasms that we can get into our mind as we try to become a master of a few more ideas! We ought to memorize a lot more. We sometimes read so lightly that our brain skates over the surface and the ideas evaporate almost before they are acquired.<br><br>Out in the mission field the other day I heard a mission president say that when any missionaries over forty years of age came on a mission he never asked them to memorize, because people over forty are too old to memorize. I am about twice that age and I can memorize three times as fast as I could when I was nineteen--not that my brain is more retentive, but that my interest is greater. And I would like to let you in on a secret, because I know a little bit about this: if you have an inch of brain and a foot of interest, you can memorize a lot more quickly than if you have a foot of brain and only an inch of interest. I only have an inch of brain, but it is tremendously exciting to me that I can get just as interested as I want to be in even those greatest ideas that God himself is interested in--and then I can learn very rapidly.<br><br>I once heard of a woman who, when asked what her age was, did not want to be too specific, so she said that she was around forty. Then her friend said, "It must have gone around a second time." My age has nearly completed that circle twice; and I would like to have you know, if it is of any value to you, that it is an easy thing, if we practice just a bit, to get these great ideas into our mind. What do you think you could accomplish if you had in your mind this idea that someone wrote and entitled "The Champion"?<br><br><i>The average runner sprints until the breath in him is gone<br>But the champion has the iron will that makes him carry on.<br>For rest the average runner begs when limp his muscles grow,<br>But the champion runs on leaden legs; his spirit makes them go.<br>The average man's complacent when he's done his best to score,<br>But the champion does his best and then he does a little more.</i>[author unknown]<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>We live in a great age of wonders and enlightenment, and if we can have a mind that goes along with it and responds to the abundance of opportunity around us and the very fortunate situation in which we find ourselves, we are well on our way toward making our lives as successful in the sight of the Lord as they ought to be.<br><br>Motive factor number two: We are highly motivated by<i>people.</i><br><br>We are motivated by great ideas, but we can motivate ourselves and others by concern for other people. We work harder for the approval of others than we do for money or for almost any other consideration. Edgar A. Guest put this idea down in writing under the title, "The Purpose."<br><br><i>"Why do you pedal the fruit?" said I<br>To a huckster of melons passing by.<br>"Why do you shout from the dawn till gloam?"<br>Said he, "For the wife and the kids at home."</i><br><br>"Why do you dig in the ditch?" I asked<br>Of a grimy laborer sorely tasked.<br>And this is the reason such work he did:<br>"I gotta da wife, I gotta da kid."<br><br>On they go down that busy street,<br>Eager toilers with hurrying feet,<br>Butcher, baker, and banker grave.<br>Why do they work? Why do they slave?<br><br>What is it that moves them to work and plan?<br>What is the motive of every man?<br>Stop him and ask him what holds him fast,<br>Dreaming and striving to serve at last.<br><br>With polished speech and accent queer,<br>This is the purpose that you will hear:<br>Each will say as the digger did,<br>"I gotta da wife, I gotta da kid."<br><br>And that is the purpose that moves us all:<br>A home and a wife and children small.<br><br>You have come to this great Church University where you are taught that all of the most important parts of life have to do with ourselves, our families, and our friends here and across the seas and around the world. It is our job and our privilege to help them to qualify for ultimate success in their eternal life--try to think of something more exciting than that, if you can.<br><br>Some years ago I heard a story about a young high school football quarterback. Just before the final game of the year his father died, and the coach said to him, "Now, Bill, we don't expect you to be at the game Friday. You be with your family and we will get along all right. You don't need to come to the rehearsals."<br><br>But the boy said, "No, I want to play; and I will be able to play."<br><br>The coach did not understand it, but he thought the boy seemed to know what he was doing, so he said, "Okay, if that's the way you feel, we'll let you start and see how you get along."<br><br>The boy went into the game and threw the passes, ran the ends, kicked the punts, blocked the tackles, and generaled his team like Superman. The coach could not understand it; he had never played so well before. They won an overwhelming victory; and after the game was over, as they walked off the field, the coach put his arm around this boy and said, "Bill, would you like to tell me about it? How is it that you could do these things under these circumstances?"<br><br>This boy replied, "Coach, what you may not know about this situation is that my father was blind, and this is the first game that he has ever seen me play."<br><br>All of us would be more concerned with our lives if we thought our Father in heaven was watching or that our spouses or our children were going to see us make a touchdown or act honorably in some other outstanding way. We are very interested by what others think of us. Think what we can do for so many other people if we work for them in the mission, the temples, and so on.<br><br>Motive number three:<i>The consciousness of a great skill</i>has high motivational qualities. Learning to do something better than anybody else gives high motivational power. Think for a moment about those things that you can do, that you are expected to do better than anybody else. Douglas Mallack wrote a poem about this entitled, "Be the Best of Whatever You Are."<br><br><i>If you can't be a pine on the top of the hill<br>Be a scrub in the valley, but be<br>The best little scrub by the side of the rill.<br>Be a bush if you can't be a tree.</i><br><br>If you can't be a bush, be a bit of the grass,<br>And some highway the happier make.<br>If you can't be a muskie then just be a bass,<br>But the liveliest bass in the lake.<br><br>We can't all be captains; there's got to be crew.<br>There is something for all of us here.<br>There are great things to do, there are small things to do,<br>And the thing you must do is the near.<br><br>If you can't be a highway, then just be a trail.<br>If you can't be a sun, be a star.<br>For success is not measured by how large or how small;<br>Just be the best of whatever you are.<br><br>I would like to suggest to you students, particularly considering these wonderful opportunities we have, that we ought to go out and practice the things that we do and be able to do something well. It may be that we can be more punctual than anyone else. Abraham Lincoln excelled in honesty. There are many areas in which one can excel where there is really not very much competition, and the consciousness of a high skill has great motivational power.<br><br>Motivation factor number four is the<i>awareness of the reward.</i>I was down in California some time ago and found a missionary there preaching some false doctrine. I heard him say to a contact, "Missionaries don't get paid; we work for nothing."<br><br>When the contact had gone I said to the missionary, "Now, that's the most ridiculous statement I have ever heard anybody make in my life. How did you ever figure out that missionaries didn't get paid? I thought the Lord said that if you labor all your days and bring just one soul unto him your reward is going to be very great."<br><br>I asked him if he remembered what the Lord has said about the worth of the soul being greater than the wealth of all of the earth, and he did. I asked him if he knew what the earth was worth, and he did not. I had a newspaper clipping that said the assessed valuation of just one little section of the United States alone--California, Arizona, and Nevada--was over a trillion dollars. I got this elder a piece of paper and a pencil and had him write a trillion dollars down on the paper--it has twelve zeros, in case you have never seen it written. He had brought in a convert each month for the past twelve months, which was all the time he had been out; so I had him figure out that if he worked thirty days a month and ten hours a day, that would be three hundred hours' work to save a trillion-dollar soul. Then I had him divide a trillion by three hundred and he figured he was getting three billion three hundred thirty-three million dollars per hour.<br><br>I asked him, "What is the most that anybody ever paid you when you were at home?"<br><br>He said, "Seventy-five cents."<br><br>I said, "All right, now what were you trying to get those poor people to believe when you said that a missionary doesn't get paid?"<br><br>Some people think that parents do not get paid or that bishops do not get paid, or scoutmasters or teachers or great people who are trying to do the other important work of the world; but that is ridiculous. Some of them get the highest pay. People who do God's work get God's pay. Somebody has compared the scripture to a great collection of promissory notes. Every command has a promise attached: pay tithing and receive a reward so great that it cannot be contained; honor father and mother "that thy days may be long upon the land" (Exodus 20:12); keep the Word of Wisdom and other blessings will come. There is no commandment that does not have a promise attached.<br><br>Review the rewards for doing the work of the Lord and then think about the part you may have in it. The Lord has said,<br><br><i>He that receiveth my servants receiveth me;</i><i> And he that receiveth me receiveth my Father;</i><i> And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father's kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:36–38]<br><br>We all like to inherit from a wealthy parent, but try to imagine what it would be like to inherit from God, to get everything that God has. Somebody has said that thrift is a great virtue, especially in an ancestor. God has been very thrifty and very wise, and he has promised that if we do a few little easy, simple things he will give us everything that he has, including eternal life in his presence. He has already given us his physical form and his mental potentialities and all of his wonderful potential personality traits, and he is trying to give to us as fast as he can develop us to the point where we will take advantage of what he gives us.<br><br>Motive number five: You must<i>have fun</i>at whatever you do or it will not succeed to its maximum. Shakespeare said, "No profit comes where there is no pleasure taken." If one does not enjoy his work, in the Church or outside of the Church, he had better repent because in either case he is doing it wrong--that is, he is not doing it right if he is not enjoying what he is doing. And anyone who puts his whole heart into his work will not only do it well but will enjoy what he does.<br><br>Number six is to<i>have a great conviction</i>about something. I have been going around the world for quite a little while, and I find it a joy to see somebody who believes in himself, in his job, in his university, and in the work that life has given him to do. What a thrilling thing it ought to be, to be a good farmer or a good schoolteacher or a good plumber or a good electrician! Whatever one does he is helping to carry on the work of the world.<br><br>Let me tell you about a man who had a conviction about his work. On May 10, 1940, Winston Churchill was made prime minister of England. At that time the German air force was making round-the-clock trips across the Channel, dumping planeload after planeload of bombs on England, and nobody knew whether the British would be able to hang on for another week or a month; but everybody knew that if they were going to have any chance to win they had to have some new leadership in the government, because the present leaders had failed. So, on May 10, 1940, they dropped the burden of this great, groggy empire on the shoulders of this one man and said to him, "Okay, Winston, you go ahead and win the war with your bare hands."<br><br>He had nothing more to win it with than the others had had, except that he had some convictions and some courage inside him that some of them did not have. He went on the radio and started to make some of those great motivating speeches-dev. He himself believed in what he was doing. In one of his speeches he said,<br><br><i>We shall not flag nor fail. We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender. And if, which I do not for a moment believe, this empire or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our empires beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British fleet, will carry on the fight until in God's own time the new world in its power and might steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.</i>[speech on Dunkirk, House of Commons, June 4, 1940]<br><br>What would you think if you were given an assignment comparable to this? Usually all the assignments we get are little easy, simple, pleasant things like teaching school, practicing medicine, practicing law, or something where we are well paid and comfortable; and Winston Churchill was told to go out, kill a lot of people, and probably destroy half the world. This is what he said about that day of May 10, 1940:<br><br><i>As I went to bed at about three a.m., I was conscious of a profound feeling of relief. At last I had authority to give direction over this whole sea, and I felt as though I were walking with destiny, that my past life had been but a preparation for this hour, for this trial. I could not be reproached, either for having made the war or for lack of preparation for it, and yet I felt I knew a good deal about it and I was sure I would not fail.</i><br><br>Fail to do what? Fail to save the world, with his bare hands, from the greatest mechanized might ever known in the world. Somebody once said that one man can, if he will, change the morale of a whole community. It was not very long before these people on both sides realized that this old man did not have the slightest intention of surrendering. He was not about to give up; he was not about to quit. As he talked to other people about the war, they all began to stand up a little straighter and to take a little greater pride in their country and in their work. Production began to go up, everybody got into the performance a little more wholeheartedly, and soon the Allies won the war. But probably the center of the victory was this rugged old Englishman who had some convictions about right and about his country and about himself and about those with whom he was associated.<br><br>I would like to tell you just two more short stories. Each year at general conference time the President of the Church invites the General Authorities to meet with him and the other members of the First Presidency in the upper room of the temple. There he talks to us about the conference and other things, bears us again his magnificent testimony, and calls on some other people to speak to the group, and we have a delightful period of worship and association there together. At the last of these meetings attended by President McKay, we were all dressed and waiting in the room when they wheeled in two wheel chairs; one had in it Thorpe Isaacson, and the other had in it David O. McKay.<br><br>I had known Brother Isaacson for a long time, and he was a good friend of mine. I tried to shake hands with him, but he was paralyzed on the right side, so he shook with his left hand; and then, in response to my greeting, he made some sounds which sounded like "Ah" or "Uh" which were not understandable to me.<br><br>I sat about six feet away from President McKay. He did not attempt to rise out of his chair as he usually did, with all of his vigor and power; instead, he sat in his chair, and everything was deathly silent. Though I was only a short distance away, I could hear probably only one word out of every five or six spoken, but I knew from past association with him what he was trying to say.<br><br>I thought of these two great men, who had in their day both been powerful athletes; now, neither one of them could stand up and neither one of them could speak. What a thrill it would be for them to run up and down the street, jump over fences, knock on doors, bear their testimonies, do home teaching, and do the genealogical work and missionary work and all the other things the Lord would like to have us do! But in their cases, the time for that had passed.<br><br>That may be a little more impressive to me than it is for you because I have been around a little longer and may be a little closer to the end of the journey. Jeremiah pointed out that for each of us the summer would someday be past and the harvest ended, and maybe we would not have done all the things that we should have done (see Jeremiah 8:20). Because I have so many things left that I would like to get done, I feel a greater sense of urgency than most people do. I am in something of a hurry because there are so many things left to be done that I would like to do. I am not ready to be informed that this glorious second estate of mine has come to an end. There are a great number of things that I must get done before that time arrives. However, I would like to leave the idea with you that even though some of you are much younger, the time will surely arrive when you are at the end of your life. The time is going to come in every person's case when this magnificent experience of a second estate will reach the finish mark.<br><br>The other story that I would like to tell you in conclusion came out of Arabia many years ago. A horseman was riding across the desert at night, and as he went through a dried-up riverbed a voice out of the darkness commanded him to halt and dismount, which he did. Then the voice commanded him to fill his pockets with the pebbles at his feet, which he did. And then the voice commanded him remount and ride on, which he did. And as he rode out through the darkness the voice said to him, "At sunrise you will be both sad and glad." At sunrise he looked in his pockets and found that the pebbles he had picked up were diamonds, rubies, emeralds, sapphires, and pearls. He was very glad and very sad. He was very glad that he had taken as many as he had, and he was very sad that he had not taken a lot more.<br><br>I would suggest that to all of us there will someday come a time when we will be delighted. We are going to be so pleased that we have lived in this magnificent latter day when the gospel has been restored, a time when there is no question about what the Lord wants us to do and what would make our lives successful. And when we have a great university like Brigham Young University, we can have as much education as we desire in any field.<br><br>We associate with some of the greatest men that ever lived upon the earth. I read a newspaper item the other day that said that eighty percent of all the scientists who have ever lived upon the earth are alive now. And certainly the Lord did not save his greatest scientists to come forth in this magnificent day only to bring forth religious leaders that were second-rate. Those who lead us in the Church are among the greatest spirits who have ever lived upon this earth. Iam sure of this, for as the Prophet Joseph Smith said, "Every man who has a calling to minister to the inhabitants of the world was ordained to that very purpose in the Grand Council of heaven before this world was" (Joseph Fielding Smith, comp.,<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</i>p. 365).<br><br>That means that Spencer W. Kimball was presented by the Lord in the council of heaven and was voted upon by all of us to come here to be the prophet of this last dispensation and this particular period, to increase the missionary work and the effectiveness of the Church in other areas. I am sure that all of us were there and that all of us voted for him; and then we ourselves were voted upon and approved to come here and be assistants to him, because he is only one man. After all, he is the head, the director, but he needs a lot of hands and feet and minds and spirits to go and do the missionary work, do the genealogical work, run the financial affairs of Church and government and nation, and do all the other work. The Lord has said that to him everything is spiritual, and I am sure that it is true.<br><br>We have come here in this great day, and someday we are going to be tickled to pieces--simply delighted that we have had the opportunity of living in this great period. Yet probably all of us are going to be awfully sad as well--sad that we did not take greater advantage of our opportunities to live up at the top of our condition and be the kind of people that the Lord would be proud of. You remember that on four different occasions he introduced one of his sons by saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." I am sure he would be just as pleased to say that about any of his sons or any of his daughters if we would just give him the opportunity.<br><br>May the Lord bless you, my brothers and sisters; and again I commend you and thank you and glory with you in the great privilege that you have of being alive in this great age and being in attendance at this great University. I ask the Lord's blessings upon each and every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Sterling W.

<h1>ve Up! Defeating the &quot;Blahs&quot;- Paul H. Dunn - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
This is always a wonderful sight, my young brothers and sisters, and I am delighted to have this opportunity to come back. I extend my appreciation to Bishop Vern Law for his thoughtful and spiritual invocation. I have had the opportunity many times to travel the world in the sports environment, and I have found that Bishop Law had done this Church and this University proud. I am honored to be here with him and with you.<br><br>I always feel comfortable here. You are my friends, and I appreciate that. You ought to know in all sincerity that it does not always exist around the Church, although people mean well. Not long ago I was assigned to a stake conference--and I shall not mention where because an uncle or grandfather of someone here probably presides there. The stake president's home where I was to stay--as we General Authorities normally do on weekends--was a very modest home. The family consisted of seven children and, of course, the two parents; the house had three bedrooms and one bath; then here came a General Authority visitor. In order to make room and a little privacy for the visitor, they evicted three children out of the one bedroom adjacent to the only bath. In the group of three there was a little seven-year-old boy; he went along with the arrangement, but you could tell that he was not all that excited. He did not say a whole lot on Saturday. Recognizing, with my military training, that it would take a little organization the next morning, I got up extra early and slipped across the hall into the only bath. There standing in the hallway was my little seven-year-old friend. He did not say a word, but just looked at me--then he put his hands on his hips and said, "Boy, I'll sure be glad when you go."<br><br>I guess we do challenge some people in interesting ways. As I arrived here this morning, I came through one of the corridors and a little sophomore did a double-take when I went by; I guess she did not think we used those lower corridors. Then I heard her whisper to her friend nearby, "He doesn't look like his picture." Well, just wait until your children pull out your high school annual--you will not be able to help it either. It reminds me of an experience I had some months back when I was recuperating from surgery. I was feeling better, it was my first day back at Church headquarters, my attitude was good and my enthusiasm great. I walked on an elevator, and a lady got on with me; we were all alone. The doors closed and the elevator started to go up. She looked at me, looked harder, and then said, "Oh my goodness!"<br><br>I asked, "What's the matter?"<br><br>She said, "I thought you were the General Authority that died." You never know how you appear to somebody else.<br><br>The other day, when I came down here for another assignment I saw my daughter Kellie, who is a student here; and in great excitement she ran over to me and said, "Dad, you'll be proud of me; I just passed a real hard test."<br><br>I said, "That's great honey. I guess you know you get your intelligence from your father."<br><br>My wife, who was standing by, said, "That's right Kellie--I still have mine."<br><br>I have another friend who has a son here, and he said to his son recently, "Why is it, my boy, that you are always at the bottom of your class?"<br><br>The boy answered, "It doesn't make any difference Dad, they teach the same thing at both ends."<br><br>President Kimball has given us a remarkable challenge over the years. He has said, in his own delightful way: "Lengthen your stride"--and you have heard that repeated hundreds of times. I smile a little bit when I hear that now, because there is a fellow about my age that works up at the Church office near me, and he is trying to keep himself physically as well as spiritually fit. So every day he slips over to the Deseret Gym and the other day while he was working out by playing handball--and he is a very vigorous competitor--he reached for a ball that bounced out of the court, trying so hard to recover it that he snapped a hamstring muscle in his right leg. You know that that smarts a little bit.<br><br>Grabbing his leg, he hobbled back to the dressing room, showered, and then limped back to Church headquarters in excruciating pain. An elevator arrived, and who but President Kimball should get off? Seeing my friend nursing his limpy leg, he asked, "What's the matter?"<br><br>My friend is kind of quick on the draw, and he replied, "President, I just snapped my hamstring muscle trying to lengthen my stride." There is a lot to that.<br><br>I am personally proud to know you--who you are and what you represent. You make it very easy for General Authorities around the world because people identify us with you at this great university. That brings great pride to us as a body of Church leaders and to us personally. I commend you on your image, on your stick-to-it-iveness, on your great contribution as a university. We are expecting great things of you. Quite often in my position I have an opportunity to meet with many students; they are often very candid, very frank, very much to the point. They seek counsel and direction in altering their lives. I wonder if in that setting I could just visit with you momentarily--even though there are a number of us here--with three little sermons. They will not be long, but hopefully they will be fitting.<br><h2>Reach Out</h2><br>I would like to begin with sermonette number one. Could I suggest, regardless of who you are and what you are, that you reach out--not only to those near you, but to the world. We have in this interesting old globe of ours some very lonesome, worrisome people, even here at Brigham Young University, or at Ricks College. Wherever you go there are lonely people. One of the greatest challenges facing the Church today is the single adult. Did you know that one-third of all Latter-day Saints in the whole Church fall into the category of single adult? And we have many lonesome people among them, even here at Brigham Young University.<br><br>If we Latter-day Saints are not careful, we will have a tendency to be a little cliquish. We do not do that on purpose--that is not part of our scheme--and I would challenge you, of all people, to extend your area of influence. You know what the gospel teaches about your neighbor and about your friends. Reach out to those who are a little less fortunate, who do not fit into the social circle, who sometimes are forgotten.<br><br>Let me share a little experience that happened a few years ago. President Oaks mentioned that I had the privilege of teaching in the seminary and institute program at one time; that was a great training ground for me. The particular class involved in this story numbered forty-four. They were excited, early-morning students that used to get up at five in the morning to meet me at six and have class. There was one little girl--let us call her Marlene--who was very lonesome, the typical wallflower that you have seen depicted in many ways. She used to arrive about one or two minutes before the class started, or even a minute or two after, so that she would not have to mix socially. She always used to sit alone close to the back of the class. It was very obvious to me, the teacher, that she could not mix socially. And I pondered. What could be done? It was all right for me to talk to her on a one-to-one basis, but what she was reaching out for was the peer group, and no one seemed to respond. Everybody was caught up in his or her own world--and that is understandable with young people.<br><br>One day, while we were studying from the book of John about the miracles of Jesus, it seemed to strike me, in a spiritual way, that miracles were all right in the time of the Savior, but how about now? I also knew that in the class was Gail. Gail was an exciting, refreshing girl who just seemed to attract everybody. Everybody wanted to sit next to Gail. She was the typical extrovert, and yet not too selfish; but it was obvious that in the size of the group she had not noticed Marlene either.<br><br>One day I kept Gail after class for a minute. I said, "Gail, we have been studying about the miracle of Jesus. Would you like to perform a miracle?"<br><br>Thinking that maybe she could turn the water to wine or walk on the water, she said, "Oh, that would be wonderful! Let's do it."<br><br>And I said, "Well, it's a different kind of a miracle. Would you like to transform a girl who doesn't belong into somebody that does? Have you noticed Marlene in the back of the class?"<br><br>She said, "Yes."<br><br>"Have you noticed that she has no friends?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>I said, "I've checked it out and I find that you are both in the same high school. Would it be too hard at lunchtime to seek her out and include her in your circle? I'll promise you that if your girlfriends see what you do with her, they'll take an interest too, because they love and respect you and your popularity."<br><br>She said, "Oh, that would be fun!"<br><br>And I said, "Now, extend that to this class every day. I don't know how you are going to do it, but you find a way to sit next to her. Would you do that? And I'll watch you very carefully, but I won't make it obvious."<br><br>The next day at seminary Marlene came about two minutes before the class was to start, and Gail quickly maneuvered herself to the chair next to her. Several of the other girls in the class did a double-take. "What's she doing that for?" That persisted for the next three or four days, and the other girls began to say, "Well, what's Marlene got that would attract Gail?" And within two weeks a little wallflower who did not belong, even in the Church, commenced to unfold, and we found a spirit and a talent that was unbelievable. Even her teacher was surprised at the difference. I challenge you, young people, to reach out. If the gospel is really true--and it is--you and I of all people can help those that somehow do not seem to belong. Would that not seem to you to be consistent in the gospel of Jesus Christ? It certainly does to me.<br><h2>Reach Up: Beat the "Blahs"</h2><br>Sermonette number two: In addition to reaching out, will you reach up? That is very important. Stretch your minds, your imagination; learn, seek, knock, find. You will never again in your whole life have three or four or five years to concentrate on the wisdom of the world quite like you have now. Be alert and smart enough to capitalize on it. I appreciate that for many of us October and November are what I suppose you would call in the vernacular a downer. September is over, and the excitement of a new school year has passed. Your budgets are being stretched, the classes are a little tougher and sometimes not what you thought they ought to be, the winter is approaching (and to some of us raised in warmer climates that is a real challenge). It can be a time, as some of you would say, of the blahs: dull, insipid, long, dark. I think it is easy to blame low moods on the month, the weather, your job, or your last test score. Why do you and I always try to find a scapegoat? This year let us decide, you and me, that the blahs will not take over, that you and I will not be beat by the blahs.<br><h3>Ups and Downs Are Part ofLife</h3><br>Could I, just as your friend, give you four ways to beat the blahs? I went to school as a university student for twelve years. I understand. I am an authority on the blahs, and it is normal for you to feel this way. First, realize that ups and downs are part of nature's way. You have days when life seems to hum along very merrily. Then you have days when you wonder why you even got up. Everybody does. It would not shake your faith if I were to suggest that even General Authorities get the blahs. And we have to work on ourselves like you do at school sometimes to overcome these negative feelings and attitudes.<br><br>Just remember this--and I hope my daughter will not mind a little personal experience. One day I came home a little earlier than usual, and my wife and she were having a little confrontation in the hall. It had something to do with straightening rooms and doing some other remedial chores. The minute I walked on the scene my wife said, "Your daughter needs help."<br><br>I stepped in as the priesthood bearer and started to talk to my daughter, and she snapped back. It was a day of the blahs. She said, "I finally figured out why I was born in this house."<br><br>I inquired, "Why were you born in this house?"<br><br>She said, "To do your dishes."<br><br>So I said very quickly, "Now, hold on before you get too frisky. Let me remind you of a very important principle. I don't know how you and I ended up in this house together--although I'm delighted with the arrangement--but before you came here, and before I came here, you and I sat in a great council and we heard two plans presented. And you voted for the Savior's plan. Don't blame me; you're here because you voted to come. I'm glad with the arrangement, but I ended up being your father. And I'm here to enforce your vote."<br><br>Do you know what she said? "Let's put it to another vote."<br><br>"We can't; you're here. I already know how you voted. You're telling me by your personal appearance here that you voted for the Savior." That is a marvelous thing to know, is it not? You were sent here to succeed in whatever you were called upon to do, and succeed you will--but occasionally you have to overcome the blahs.<br><br>I understand from a bit of reading I was doing recently from Lesley Conger (and think about this, you great university students) that a clam has some kind of inner biological clock so that even if it were transported alive to a laboratory in the prairie it would still know exactly when the tide was coming in on the beach back home. Think about that--a clam. And if it stays on the prairie long enough that inner clock will gradually adjust itself and the clam will begin responding to the rhythm of what tides there would be if there were tides in the prairie. Amazing. Your body rises and falls on a twenty-four hour cycle. Your stomach contracts roughly ninety to one hundred times every minute. Does it seem so surprising that your emotions also run up and down? They may not be regular, but they are real. And understand that this is a part of the natural process. You are not alone; you are not different. We are all made that way.<br><h3>Put Your Problems in Perspective</h3><br>The second way to beat the blahs is to put your problems in perspective. Think about this: Put your problems in perspective. The traffic jam--could I be this bold?--the boring class, the argument, the setback that seems so all-important may not really merit your worry and dismay. Your inner harmony and sense of peace is the most important thing in the world. Do not be so willing to give it up.<br><br>I like the story that tells of naturalist William Beebe's visits to Theodore Roosevelt's home on occasions.<br><br><i>Often after an evening's talk, the two men would walk over the spreading lawn and look up into the night sky. They would vie with each other to see who could first identify the pale bit of light-mist near the upper left-hand corner of the</i>[heavens],<i>and then either Roosevelt, or Beebe, would recite:</i><br><br><i>"That is the spiral galaxy. . . . It is as large as our Milky Way. It is one of a hundred million galaxies. It is two million five hundred thousand light years away. It consists of one hundred billion suns, many larger than our own sun."</i><br><br><i>Then, after a moment of silence, Theodore Roosevelt would grin and say, "Now, I think we are small enough. Let's go to bed."</i>[Quoted from Wendell Noble, "The Listener's Digest," KABC, November 20, 1959]<br><br>You are certainly not small, but your problems are. Keep your problems in a proper perspective. There is not a student or missionary here that can afford a low mood or mentality.<br><h3>Learn Something New</h3><br>The third way to beat the blahs is to learn something new. Develop a skill, a hobby. Make a new friend. Reach out, as I suggested earlier. "Curiosity," says editor Frederick Bonfils, "is one of the most permanent and certain characteristics of a vigorous mind. There is no hope for the satisfied man"--or woman (quoted by Wendell Noble, "The Listener's Digest," KABC, August 1956). Has your world become boring because you are just too self-satisfied? Find out that you are not really a know-it-all. Expose your ignorance. Learn something new. I challenge you to do that.<br><br>I have always liked the wise counsel the magician Merlin gave to King Arthur, remember? When the king was feeling low, he said,<br><br><i>The best thing for being sad . . . is to learn something. That is the only thing that never fails. You may grow old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake at night listening to the disorder of your veins, you may miss your only love, you may see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know your honor trampled in the sewers of baser minds. There is only one thing for it then--to learn. Learn why the world wags and what wags it. That is the only thing which the mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by, never fear or distrust, and never dream of regretting. Learning is the thing for you. Look at what a lot of things there are to learn--pure science, the only purity there is. You can learn astronomy in a lifetime, natural history in three, literature in six. And then, after you have exhausted a milliard lifetimes in biology and medicine and theocriticism and geography and history and economics--why, you can start to make a cartwheel out of the appropriate wood, or spend fifty years learning to begin to learn to beat your adversary at fencing. After that you can start again on mathematics until it is time to learn to plough.</i>[T. H. White,<i>The Sword in the Stone,</i>p. 183]<br><br>How little any of us knows, even if we spend every working hour of our lives expanding our own minds! Who can fathom the reaches of the universe? Who understands the instinct of a salmon propelling itself to swim thousands of miles back to its birthplace to spawn? Who comprehends how a fertilized egg divides and differentiates and becomes a human being? Do you know that there is a shrub in the forest that will not germinate--that will grow for hundreds, even thousands of years without producing a seed--until a fire comes to the woods? Did you know that Leonardo da Vinci wrote in his notebook from right to left and backwards so that it could be read only in a mirror?<br><br>Do you know that male bees, the drones, were mysteriously pushed out of the beehives early last year on the East Coast, in prediction of a hard winter? Do you know that monarch butterflies have been observed within two hundred miles of the coast of England, although not native to Europe? You live in a world where dogs are colorblind and where the average honeybee has to visit one thousand florets of clover just to fill its honey sack once. If you have the blahs, you need to find out more about this fascinating world in which you live.<br><h3>Never Give Up</h3><br>The fourth way to beat the blahs involves some reexamination of your life. Let me illustrate with just a little story. One day a young lady was walking across campus and she bumped into one of her favorite professors. He was a surprising little man who would kneel down with his face next to the grass to see the world from a new point of view, or jump out of grand pianos to greet his new students before class. But this day the professor's interest was on the coed. "What's wrong with you?" he said. His eyes were looking at her very closely. "You're not yourself."<br><br>"Oh, nothing really," said the girl. "I've just got the blahs."<br><br>"I knew it," said the professor, "and I know why. You've worked hard lately but you have not done one thing all quarter that really matters to you, have you? You haven't done one thing that has made bare your heart. Think about it," he said, and without another word scurried off.<br><br>Let me ask you what the professor asked the young coed. Have you done anything lately that really matters to you? Is college life just a mechanical daily routine, or are you searching underneath? You may have been busy--even frantically so--but have any of you been touched in your own soul? Can you say at this point, "Yes, my life has purpose; yes, my life has direction, and it means something to me"? Are you really sure why you are here? I hope so, because you are preparing now to meet the world and its many challenges, to say nothing of a great future that lies ahead.<br><br>In this setting, could I just suggest tenderly to you wonderful teachers whom I love and respect: Will you also remember that these students are literally the offspring of God? At the risk of perhaps being misunderstood, let me make an observation. I have been through this educational process a little bit. You and I, professor or teacher, differ from the rest of the world in that we believe that our students are literally the offspring of God. If that is so, then every one of these spirits in this congregation and others like it can go back perfect into God's presence one day. Then can there possibly be a student that is a failure? I worry just a little bit sometimes.<br><br>I appreciate that we cannot always control class size, and yet I would challenge each teacher here to find a way to know their students, to reach out in return. I worry a little bit about grading on curves because that suggests that one-fourth of a class cannot make it, and I do not believe that. I believe that every student was meant to succeed. And succeed he or she must, particularly in this great University. And maybe the challenge works both ways. You students can work harder; you know that. And you teachers can in like manner reach out a little further. I challenge both groups to do so, and in the process you will eliminate the blahs. And that, after all, is a great thing.<br><br>Finally, sermonette number three: Reach, young people, a little further. As President Kimball said, "Try a little harder." Do any of you remember--I guess you would not; you are too young and tender and innocent--the old Kaiser-Frazer cars? They go back to my teenage era; that was an interesting time to be alive. If you do not remember those old cars, you have really missed something. I hope that someday you will look them up. Back then they were probably well ahead of their time--at least I thought so. But the car went defunct shortly after it appeared in the showroom floor. Kaiser, one of the gentlemen who helped produce it, was a great American who did much for the benefit and welfare of this country.<br><br>Did you know that Henry J. Kaiser, industrialist, failed at seventy-five percent of the things he did? Are you aware of that? As some of you may know, I have often taken as examples for my life people who have had to struggle and yet overcame, and Henry J. Kaiser has always been an industrial hero of mine. Let me quickly give you an accounting of some of the things he did; remember that this man is a seventy-five percent failure in the world.<br><br>He built fifteen hundred merchant ships in World War II--I floated on a couple of them. His mills produced over one million tons of steel during the war. And during the same time he produced twenty million pounds of magnesium. He became the world's largest producer of cement. He was the third largest producer of aluminum. He helped build the Hoover and Grand Coulee dams. He had a major role in the San Francisco-Oakland bridge. The list goes on and on. That is not bad for a seventy-five percent failure, is it? I have often thought, "What if people like Henry J. Kaiser, sitting in some distant classroom, had thought, 'I can't do it'?" He had the ability to reach a little further and his story is now history. He was persistent, and that becomes very important.<br><br>Last year, as some of you baseball fans may recall, we almost had another .400 hitter in Rod Carew of the Minnesota Twins; he was there for most of the season and tailed off near the end. Do you know that the last .400 hitter the Major League has produced was Ted Williams in 1941? At the beginning of the final week of that season--and I remember it well because I followed it very carefully--Ted's batting average was over .400, as it had been for several weeks. His manager asked if he wanted to be excused from playing ball the last week in order to protect the .400 average, and Ted replied--and I have always appreciated that great champion--"If I am going to be a .400 hitter, I am going to earn the honor fair and square."<br><br>Ted's batting average that last week went down. Then came the final afternoon of play, and Ted's average stood at .399955 on the last day of the season--not quite .400, but the statistics rounded out would show him as a .400 hitter. Sportswriters, baseball fans, and the manager of the team advised him not to play that afternoon. They did not want Ted to take a chance of missing out on becoming the ninth member of that wonderful club. He replied--and I remember it well--"If I'm going to be a .400 hitter, I want more than my toenails on the line."<br><br>The baseball park in Philadelphia was jammed. Each time Ted Williams came to bat the huge crowd sat in tense silence, almost afraid to breathe for fear of upsetting him. At each hit he made, the crowd roared its approval. The noise almost rocked Philadelphia when the final game ended and Ted's batting average registered .406. How is that for stretching a little bit further? What a great quality!<br><br>Now, you young people, in conclusion, I challenge you again to reach out a little further. You and I can do this by developing that positive mental attitude. Do you recall the experience of Field Marshal Foch of France during World War I? You were not there, but you may have read about it. He was totally surrounded by one of the great German armies; and then, in the midst of an obvious defeat, the command came down from headquarters: "Take the offensive." He sent back this reply:<br><br>"My center is giving way, my right is pushed back, my left is wavering. The situation is excellent; I shall attack."<br><br>Or remember Napoleon at Waterloo who was very intrigued upon hearing a Highland bagpiper. He told the piper to play a tune, which he did, to the delight of Napoleon.<br><br>"Now play a march." The boy responded.<br><br>"Now play retreat."<br><br>And the young man replied, "I can't. I don't know how."<br><br>And finally, do you remember the story that Bob Richards tells? It is a favorite of mine. He tells of the time when Winston Churchill was being honored in his final days in a meeting with Parliament. Anybody who was anybody in Great Britain was assembled there and they called upon this magnificent statesman to give his final speech. Winston Churchill's final speech was just seven words long, and I commend it to you. With the gallery quiet and tense and leaning forward in their seats, this great, grand old bulldog of the British Empire--cane between his legs, two hands clasped on the top, jaw protruding, looking at that auspicious crowd--said the first three words of his last sermon. "NEVER GIVE UP." Then he paused, looked again, and said the last four words. "NEVER, NEVER GIVE UP." God bless us so to do, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Paul H.

<h1>nation for the Challenges of Today - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you very much, President Oaks; and thank you, sisters, for that lovely music. This is always a great experience for any of us to have.<br><br>Often, when speaking to student leaders in higher education, I have used the analogy that--in a university--the faculty, staff, and administration are like the natives, and the students are like the tourists. In many ways, a recurring devotional speaker is more like one of the natives. Even so, I thank President Oaks for once again extending this precious privilege to me. You may conclude today, however, that I am becoming more like a tourist, since I shall try to cover two topics in order to make the most of these fleeting moments.<br><br>Discipleship includes good citizenship; and in this connection, if you are careful students of the statements of the modern prophets, you will have noticed that with rare exceptions--especially when the First Presidency has spoken out--the concerns expressed have been over moral issues, not issues between political parties. The declarations are about principles, not people, and causes, not candidates. On occasions, at other levels in the Church, a few have not been so discreet, so wise, or so inspired.<br><br>But make no mistake about it, brothers and sisters; in the months and years ahead, events will require of each member that he or she decide whether or not he or she will follow the First Presidency. Members will find it more difficult to halt longer between two opinions (see<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/18.21?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 1 Kings 18:21</a></span>).<br><br>President Marion G. Romney said, many years ago, that he had "never hesitated to follow the counsel of the Authorities of the Church even though it crossed my social, professional, or political life" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://archive.org/details/conferencereport1941sa" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>CR,</i>April 1941, p. 123</a></span>). This is a hard doctrine, but it is a particularly vital doctrine in a society which is becoming more wicked. In short, brothers and sisters, not being ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ includes not being ashamed of the prophets of Jesus Christ.<br><br>We are now entering a period of incredible ironies. Let us cite but one of these ironies which is yet in its subtle stages: we shall see in our time a maximum if indirect effort made to establish irreligion as the state religion. It is actually a new form of paganism that uses the carefully preserved and cultivated freedoms of Western civilization to shrink freedom even as it rejects the value essence of our rich Judeo-Christian heritage.<br><br>M. J. Sobran wrote recently:<br><br><i>The Framers of the Constitution . . . forbade the Congress to make any law "respecting" the establishment of religion, thus leaving the states free to do so (as several of them did); and they explicitly forbade the Congress to abridge "the free exercise" of religion, thus giving actual religious observance a rhetorical emphasis that fully accords with the special concern we know they had for religion. It takes a special ingenuity to wring out of this a governmental indifference to religion, let alone an aggressive secularism. Yet there are those who insist that the First Amendment actually proscribes governmental partiality not only to any single religion, but to religion as such; so that tax exemption for churches is now thought to be unconstitutional. It is startling</i>[she continues]<i>to consider that a clause clearly protecting religion can be construed as requiring that it be denied a status routinely granted to educational and charitable enterprises, which have no overt constitutional protection. Far from</i>equalizing<i>unbelief, secularism has succeeded in virtually</i>establishing<i>it.</i><br><br>[She continues:]<i>What the secularists are increasingly demanding, in their disingenuous way, is that religious people, when they act politically, act only on secularist grounds. They are trying to equate</i>acting<i>on religion with</i>establishing<i>religion. And--I repeat--the consequence of such logic is really to establish secularism. It is in fact, to force the religious to internalize the major premise of secularism: that religion has no proper bearing on public affairs.</i>[<i>Human Life Review,</i>Summer 1978, pp. 51–52, 60–61]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, irreligion as the state religion would be the worst of all combinations. Its orthodoxy would be insistent and its inquisitors inevitable. Its paid ministry would be numerous beyond belief. Its Caesars would be insufferably condescending. Its majorities--when faced with clear alternatives--would make the Barabbas choice, as did a mob centuries ago when Pilate confronted them with the need to decide.<br><br>Your discipleship may see the time come when religious convictions are heavily discounted. M. J. Sobran also observed, "A religious conviction is now a second-class conviction, expected to step deferentially to the back of the secular bus, and not to get uppity about it" (<i>Human Life Review,</i>Summer 1978, p. 58). This new irreligious imperialism seeks to disallow certain of people's opinions simply because those opinions grow out of religious convictions. Resistance to abortion will soon be seen as primitive. Concern over the institution of the family will be viewed as untrendy and unenlightened.<br><br>In its mildest form, irreligion will merely be condescending toward those who hold to traditional Judeo-Christian values. In its more harsh forms, as is always the case with those whose dogmatism is blinding, the secular church will do what it can to reduce the influence of those who still worry over standards such as those in the Ten Commandments. It is always such an easy step from dogmatism to unfair play--especially so when the dogmatists believe themselves to be dealing with primitive people who do not know what is best for them. It is the secular bureaucrat's burden, you see.<br><br>Am I saying that the voting rights of the people of religion are in danger? Of course not! Am I saying, "It's back to the catacombs?" No! But there is occurring a discounting of religiously-based opinions. There may even be a covert and subtle disqualification of some for certain offices in some situations, in an ironic "irreligious test" for office.<br><br>However, if people are not permitted to advocate, to assert, and to bring to bear, in every legitimate way, the opinions and views they hold that grow out of their religious convictions, what manner of men and women would they be, anyway? Our founding fathers did not wish to have a state church established nor to have a particular religion favored by government. They wanted religion to be free to make its own way. But neither did they intend to have irreligion made into a favored state church. Notice the terrible irony if this trend were to continue. When the secular church goes after its heretics, where are the sanctuaries? To what landfalls and Plymouth Rocks can future pilgrims go?<br><br>If we let come into being a secular church shorn of traditional and divine values, where shall we go for inspiration in the crises of tomorrow? Can we appeal to the rightness of a specific regulation to sustain us in our hours of need? Will we be able to seek shelter under a First Amendment which by then may have been twisted to favor irreligion? Will we be able to rely for counterforce on value education in school systems that are increasingly secularized? And if our governments and schools were to fail us, would we be able to fall back upon the institution of the family, when so many secular movements seek to shred it?<br><br>It may well be, as our time comes to "suffer shame for his name" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/5.41?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acts 5:41</a></span>), that some of this special stress will grow out of that portion of discipleship which involves citizenship. Remember that, as Nephi and Jacob said, we must learn to endure "the crosses of the world" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.18?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 Nephi 9:18</a></span>) and yet to despise "the shame of [it]" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/jacob/1.8?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jacob 1:8</a></span>). To go on clinging to the iron rod in spite of the mockery and scorn that flow at us from the multitudes in that great and spacious building seen by Father Lehi, which is the "pride of the world," is to disregard the shame of the world (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.26-27?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 Nephi 8:26–27</a></span>, <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.33?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">33</a></span>; <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.35-36?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11:35–36</a></span>). Parenthetically, why--really why--do the disbelievers who line that spacious building watch so intently what the believers are doing? Surely there must be other things for the scorners to do--unless, deep within their seeming disinterest, there is interest.<br><br>If the challenge of the secular church becomes very real, let us, as in all other human relationships, be principled but pleasant. Let us be perceptive without being pompous. Let us have integrity and not write checks with our tongues which our conduct cannot cash.<br><br>Before the ultimate victory of the forces of righteousness, some skirmishes will be lost. Even these, however, must leave a record so that the choices before the people are clear and let others do as they will in the face of prophetic counsel. There will also be times, happily, when a minor defeat seems probable, that others will step forward, having been rallied to righteousness by what we do. We will know the joy, on occasion, of having awakened a slumbering majority of the decent people of all races and creeds--a majority which was, till then, unconscious of itself.<br><br>Jesus said that when the fig trees put forth their leaves "summer is nigh" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/24.32?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 24:32</a></span>). Thus warned that summer is upon us, let us not then complain of the heat.<br><br>Have I come today only to add one more to the already long list of special challenges faced by you and me? Not really. I have also come to say to you that God, who foresaw all challenges, has given to us a precious doctrine which can encourage us in meeting this and all other challenges.<br><br>The combined doctrine of God's foreknowledge and of foreordination is one of the doctrinal roads least traveled by, yet these clearly underline how very long and how perfectly God has loved us and known us with our individual needs and capacities. Isolated from other doctrines or mishandled, though, these truths can stoke the fires of fatalism, impact adversely upon our agency, cause us to focus on status rather than service, and carry us over into predestination. President Joseph Fielding Smith once warned:<br><br><i>It is very evident from a thorough study of the gospel and the plan of salvation that a conclusion that those who accepted the Savior were predestined to be saved no matter what the nature of their lives must be an error. . . . Surely Paul never intended to convey such a thought.</i>[<i>The Improvement Era,</i>May 1963, pp. 350–51]<br><br>Paul, you will recall, brothers and sisters, stressed running the life's race the full distance; he did<i>not</i>intend a casual Christianity in which some had won the race even before the race had started.<br><br>Yet, though foreordination is a difficult doctrine, it has been given to us by the living God, through living prophets, for a purpose. It can actually increase our understanding of how crucial this mortal estate is and it can encourage us in further good works. This precious doctrine can also help us to go the second mile because we are doubly called.<br><br>In some ways, our second estate, in relationship to our first estate, is like agreeing in advance to surgery. Then the anesthetic of forgetfulness settles in upon us. Just as doctors do not de-anesthetize a patient in the midst of authorized surgery to ask him again if the surgery should be continued, so, after divine tutoring, we agreed once to come here and to submit ourselves to certain experiences and have no occasion to revoke that decision.<br><br>Of course, when we mortals try to comprehend, rather than merely accept, foreordination, the result is one in which finite minds futilely try to comprehend omniscience. A full understanding is impossible; we simply have to trust in what the Lord has told us, knowing enough, however, to realize that we are not dealing with<i>guarantees</i>from God but extra<i>opportunities</i>--and heavier responsibilities. If those responsibilities are in some ways linked to past performance or to past capabilities, it should not surprise us.<br><br>The Lord has said,<br><br><i>There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated--</i><br><br><i>And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.</i>[<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.20-21?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D&amp;amp;C 130: 20–21</a></span>]<br><br>This is an eternal law, brothers and sisters--it prevailed in the first estate as well as in the second. It should not disconcert us, therefore, that the Lord has indicated that he chose some individuals before they came here to carry out certain assignments and, hence, these individuals have been foreordained to those assignments. "Every man who has a calling to minister to the inhabitants of the world was ordained to that very purpose in the Grand Council of Heaven before the world was. I suppose that I was ordained to this very office in that Grand Council" (Joseph Fielding Smith, comp.,<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</i>p. 365).<br><br>Foreordination is like any other blessing--it is a conditional bestowal subject to our faithfulness. Prophesies foreshadow events without determining the outcomes, because of a divine foreseeing of outcomes. So foreordination is a conditional bestowal of a role, a responsibility, or a blessing which, likewise, foresees but does not fix the outcome.<br><br>There have been those who have failed or who have been treasonous to their trust such as David, Solomon, Judas. God foresaw the fall of David, but was not the cause of it. It was David who saw Bathsheba from the balcony and sent for her. But neither was God surprised by such a sad development. God foresaw, but did not cause, Martin Harris's loss of certain pages of the translated Book of Mormon; God made plans to cope with that failure over fifteen hundred years before it was to occur (see <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.20-21?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">D&amp;amp;C 10</span></a></span> and <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/w-of-m/1?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Words of Mormon</a></span>).<br><br>Thus foreordination is clearly no excuse for fatalism or arrogance or the abuse of agency. It is not, however, a doctrine that can simply be ignored because it is difficult. Indeed, deep inside the hardest doctrines are some of the pearls of greatest price. The doctrine pertains not only to the foreordination of the prophets, but to each of us. God--in his precise assessment, beforehand, as to those who will respond to the words of the Savior and the prophets--is a part of the plan. From the Savior's own lips came these words: "I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/10.14?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John 10:14</a></span>). Similarly the Savior said, "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/10.27?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John 10:27</a></span>). And further in this dispensation, he declared, "And ye are called to bring to pass the gathering of mine elect; for mine elect hear my voice and harden not their hearts" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29.7?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D&amp;amp;C 29:7</a></span>).<br><br>This responsiveness could not have been gauged without divine foreknowledge concerning all of us mortals and our response, one way or another, to the gospel. God's foreknowledge is so perfect it leaves the realm of prediction and enters the realm of prophecy.<br><br>The foreseeing of those who would accept the gospel in mortality, gladly and with alacrity, is based upon their parallel responsiveness in the premortal world. No wonder the Lord could say as he did to Jeremiah, "Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; . . . and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/jer/1.5?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">Jeremiah 1:5</span></a></span>). Paul, when writing to the saints in Rome, said, "God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rom/11.2?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romans 11:2</a></span>). Paul also said of God that "he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world" (Ephesians 1:4).<br><br>The Lord, who was able to say to his disciples, "Cast the net on the right side of the ship," knew beforehand there was a multitude of fishes there (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/21.6?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John 21:6</a></span>). If he knew beforehand the movements and whereabout of fishes in the little Sea of Tiberias, should it offend us that he knows beforehand which mortals will come into the gospel net?<br><br>It does no violence even to our frail human logic to observe that there cannot be a grand plan of salvation for all mankind, unless there is also a plan for each individual. The salvational sum will reflect all its parts. Once the believer acknowledges that the past, present, and future are before God simultaneously--even though we do not understand how--then the doctrine of foreordination may be seen somewhat more clearly. For instance, it was necessary for God to know how the economic difficulties and crop failures of the Joseph Smith, Senior, family in New England would move this special family to Cumorah country where the Book of Mormon plates were buried. God's plans could scarcely have so unfolded if--willy-nilly--the Smiths had been born Manchurians and if, meanwhile, the plates had been buried in Belgium!<br><br>The Lord would need to have perfect comprehension of all the military and political developments, including those now underway in the Middle East--which, when they unfold, will combine to bring to pass a latter-day condition in which "all nations" will be gathered against Jerusalem to battle (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/zech/14.2-4?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zechariah 14:2–4</a></span>). It should not surprise us that the Lord who notices the fall of each sparrow and the hair from every head would know centuries before how much money Judas would receive--thirty pieces of silver--at the time he betrayed the Savior (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/26.15?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 26:15</a></span>; <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/27.3?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">27:3</a></span>; <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/zech/11.12?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zechariah 11:12</a></span>).<br><br>Quite understandably, the manner in which things unfold seems to us mortals to be so natural. Our not knowing what is to come (in the perfect way that God knows) thus preserves our free agency completely. When, through a process we call inspiration and revelation, we are permitted at times to tap that divine databank, we are accessing, for the narrow purposes at hand, the knowledge of God. No wonder that experience is so unforgettable!<br><br>There are clearly special cases of individuals in mortality who have special limitations in life, which conditions we mortals cannot now fully fathom. For all we now know, the seeming limitations may have been an agreed-upon spur to achievement--a "thorn in the flesh." Like him who was blind from birth, some come to bring glory to God (John 9:1–3). We must be exceedingly careful about imputing either wrong causes or wrong rewards to all in such circumstances. They are in the Lord's hands, and he loves them perfectly. Indeed, some of those who have required much waiting upon in this life may be waited upon again by the rest of us in the next world--but for the highest of reasons.<br><br>Thus, when we are elected to certain mortal chores, we are elected "according to the foreknowledge of God the Father" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-pet/1.2?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">1 Peter 1:2</span></a></span>). When Abraham was advised that he "was chosen before he was born," and that he was among the "noble and great ones" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.22-23?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">Abraham</span> <span style="color: #33cccc;">3:22–23</span></a>), we received a marvelous insight. Through the revelation given to us by the prophet Joseph F. Smith we read that "The Prophet Joseph Smith, . . . Hyrum Smith, Brigham Young, John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, and other choice spirits" were also reserved by God "to come forth in the fullness of times to take part in laying the foundations of the great latter-day work" (JFS Vision 53). These individuals are among the rulers whom Abraham had described to him centuries earlier by God. They were to be "rulers in the Church of God" (JFS Vision 55), not necessarily rulers in secular kingdoms. Thus those seen by Abraham were the Pauls, not the Caesars; the Spencer W. Kimballs, not the Churchills. Wise secular leaders do much lasting and commendable good; but as Paul observed to the saints in Corinth, as the world measured greatness and wisdom "not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1.26?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 Corinthians 1:26</a></span>).<br><br>President Joseph Fielding Smith wrote: "In regard to the holding of the priesthood in preexistence, I will say that there was an organization there just as well as an organization here, and men there held authority. Men chosen to positions of trust in the spirit world held priesthood" (<i>Doctrines of Salvation</i>3:81). Alma speaks about foreordination with great effectiveness and links it to the foreknowledge of God and, perhaps, even to our previous performance (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/13.3-5?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alma 13:3–5</a></span>). The omniscience of God made it possible, therefore, for him to determine the boundaries and times of nations (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/17.26?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acts 17:26</a></span>; <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/deut/32.8?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deuteronomy 32:8</a></span>).<br><br>Elder Orson Hyde said of our life in the premortal world, "We understood things better there than we do in this lower world." Elder Hyde also surmised as to the agreements we made there as follows: "It is not impossible that we signed the articles thereof with our own hands,--which articles may be retained in the archives above, to be presented to us when we rise from the dead, and be judged out of our own mouths, according to that which is written in the books." Just because we have forgotten, said Elder Hyde, "our forgetfulness cannot alter the facts" (Brigham Young,<i>Journal of Discourses</i>7:314–15). Brothers and sisters, the degree of detail involved in the covenants and promises we participated in at that time may be a much more highly customized thing than many of us surmise. Yet, on occasion even with our forgetting, there may be inklings. President Joseph F. Smith wrote:<br><br><i>But in coming here, we forget all, that our agency might be free indeed, to choose good or evil, that we might merit the reward of our own choice and conduct. But by the power of the Spirit, in the redemption of Christ</i>through obedience, we often catch a spark from the awakened memories of the immortal soul,<i>which lights up our whole being as with the glory of our former home.</i>[<i>Gospel Doctrines,</i>pp. 13–14; emphasis added]<br><br>As indicated earlier, this powerful teaching of foreordination is bound to be a puzzlement in some respects, especially if we do not have faith and trust in the Lord. Yet if we think about it, even within our finite framework of experience, it should not startle us. Mortal parents are reasonably good at predicting the behavior of their children in certain circumstances. Of this Elder James E. Talmage wrote:<br><br><i>Our Heavenly Father has a full knowledge of the nature and disposition of each of His children, a knowledge gained by long observation and experience in the past eternity of our primeval childhood; a knowledge compared with which that gained by earthly parents through mortal experience with their children is infinitesimally small. By reason of that surpassing knowledge, God reads the future of child and children, of men individually and of men collectively as communities and nations; He knows what each will do under given conditions, and sees the end from the beginning. His foreknowledge is based on intelligence and reason. He foresees the future as a state which naturally and surely will be; not as one which must be because He has arbitrarily willed that it shall be.--From the author's</i>Great Apostasy,<i>pp. 19, 20.</i>[<i>Jesus the Christ,</i>p. 29]<br><br>Another helpful analogy for students is the reality that universities, including this one, can and do predict with a high degree of accuracy the grades entering students will receive in their college careers based upon certain tests, past performances, and so forth. If mortals can do this with reasonable accuracy (and even with a short span of familiarity and finite data), God, the Father, who knows us perfectly, surely can foresee how we will respond to various challenges. While we often do not rise to our opportunities, God is neither pleased nor surprised. But we cannot say to him later on that we could have achieved if we had just been given the chance! This is all part of the justice of God.<br><br>One of the most helpful--indeed very necessary--parallel truths to be pondered when studying this powerful doctrine of foreordination is given in the revelation of the Lord to Moses in which the Lord says, "And all things are present with me, for I know them all" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.6?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moses1:6</a></span>). God does not live in the dimension of time as do we. Moreover, since "all things are present with" God, his is not simply a predicting based solely upon the past. In ways which are not clear to us, he actually<i>sees</i>, rather than<i>foresees</i>, the future--because all things are, at once, present before him.<br><br>In a revelation given to the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord described himself as "The same which knoweth all things, for all things are present before mine eyes" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.2?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D&amp;amp;C 38:2</a></span>). From the prophet Nephi we receive the same basic insight in which we, likewise, must trust: "But the Lord knoweth all things from the beginning; wherefore, he prepareth a way to accomplish all his works among the children of men" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/9.6?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 Nephi 9:6</a></span>). It was by divine design that Mary became the mother of Jesus. Further, Lucy Mack Smith, who played such a crucial role in the rearing of Joseph Smith, did not come to that assignment by chance.<br><br>One of the dimensions of worshipping a living God is to know that he is alive and living in the sense of seeing and acting. He is not a retired God whose best years are past, to whom we should pay a retroactive obeisance, worshipping him for what he has already done. He is the living God who is, at once, in all the dimensions of time--the past and present and future--while we labor constrained by the limitations of time itself.<br><br>It is imperative, brothers and sisters, that we always keep in mind the caveats noted earlier, so that we do not indulge ourselves or our whims, simply because of the presence of this powerful doctrine of foreordination, for with special opportunities come special responsibilities and much greater risks. But the doctrine of foreordination properly understood and humbly pursued can help us immensely in coping with the vicissitudes of life. Otherwise, time can tug at us and play so many tricks upon us. We should always understand that while God is never surprised, we often are.<br><br>Life episodes can take on a new meaning. For instance, Simon, the Cyrenian, wandered into Jerusalem that very day and was pressed into service by Roman soldiers to help carry the cross of Christ (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/mark/15.21?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see Mark 15:21</a></span>). Simon's son, Rufus, joined the Church, and was so well thought of by the apostle Paul that the latter mentioned Rufus in his epistle to the Romans, describing him as "chosen in the Lord" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rom/16.13?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romans 16:13</a></span>). Was it, therefore, a mere accident that Simon "who passed by, coming out of the country" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/mark/15.21?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark 15:21</a></span>), was asked to bear the cross of Jesus?<br><br>Properly humbled and instructed concerning the great privileges that are ours, we can cope with what seem to be very dark days and difficult developments, because we will have a true perspective about "things as they really are," and we can see in them a great chance to contribute. Churchill, in trying to rally his countrymen in an address at Harrow School in October of 1941, said to them:<br><br><i>Do not let us speak of darker days; let us speak rather of sterner days. These are not dark days: these are great days--the greatest days our country has ever lived; and we must all thank God that we have been allowed, each of us according to our stations, to play a part in making these days memorable in the history of our race.</i>[<i>Bartlett's Familiar Quotations,</i>p. 923]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, so we should regard the dispensation of the fullness of times--even when we face stern challenges and circumstances, "these are great days"! Our hearts need not fail us. We can be equal to our challenges, including the aforementioned challenge of the secular church.<br><br>The truth about foreordination also helps us to taste the deep wisdom of Alma, when he said we ought to be content with things that God hath allotted to each of us (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/29.3-4?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alma 29:3, 4</a></span>). If, indeed, the things allotted to each of us have been divinely customized according to our ability and capacity, then for us to seek to wrench ourselves free of our schooling circumstances could be to tear ourselves away from carefully matched opportunities. To rant and to rail could be to go against divine wisdom, wisdom in which we may have once concurred before we came here. God knew beforehand each of our coefficients for coping and contributing and has so ordered our lives.<br><br>The late President Henry D. Moyle said,<br><br><i>I believe that we, as fellow workers in the priesthood, might well take to heart the admonition of Alma and be content with that which God hath allotted us. We might well be assured that we had something to do with our "allotment" in our preexistent state. This would be an additional reason for us to accept our present condition and make the best of it. It is what we agreed to do.</i>[<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://archive.org/details/conferencereport1952a" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>CR,</i>October 1952, p. 71</a></span>]<br><br>By the way, brothers and sisters, I hasten to add that among the things "allotted" are not included things like a bad temper. The deficiencies of a developmental variety are those we are expected to overcome.<br><br>Now, as I prepare to conclude, may I point out what a vastly different view of life the doctrine of foreordination gives to us. Shorn of this perspective, others are puzzled or bitter about life. Without gospel perspective life would be a punishment, not a joy--like trying to play a game of billiards on a table with a rumpled cloth, with a crooked cue and an elliptical billiard ball (from Sir William S. Gilbert's libretto of<i>The Mikado</i>). (Perhaps the moral of that analogy is that we should stay out of pool halls.) In any event, pessimism does not really reckon with life and the universe as these things "really are." The disciple will be puzzled at times, too. But he persists. Later he rejoices over how wonderfully things fit together, realizing only then that, with God, things never were apart.<br><br>Jacob said that the Spirit teaches us the truth "of things as they really are, and of things as they really will be" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4.13?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jacob 4:13</a></span>). Centuries later Paul said that the "Spirit searcheth . . . the deep things of God" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2.10?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 Corinthians 2:10</a></span>). Of some of these deep things we have spoken today, and of how things really are. Brothers and sisters, in some of those precious and personal moments of deep discovery, there will be a sudden surge of recognition of an immortal insight, a doctrinal déjà vu. We will sometimes experience a flash from the mirror of memory that beckons us forward toward a far horizon.<br><br>When in situations of stress we wonder if there is any more in us to give, we can be comforted to know that God, who knows our capacity perfectly, placed us here to succeed. No one was foreordained to fail or to be wicked. When we have been weighed and found wanting, let us remember that we were measured before and we were found equal to our tasks; and, therefore, let us continue, but with a more determined discipleship. When we feel overwhelmed, let us recall the assurance that God will not overprogram us; he will not press upon us more than we can bear (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50.40?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D&amp;amp;C 50:40</a></span>).<br><br>The doctrine of foreordination, therefore, is not a doctrine of repose; it is a doctrine for the second-milers; it can draw out of us the last full measure of devotion. It is a doctrine of perspiration, not aspiration. Moreover, it discourages aspiring, lest we covet, like two early disciples, that which has already been given to another (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/20.20-23?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 20:20–23</a></span>). Foreordination is a doctrine for the deep believer and will only bring scorn from the skeptic.<br><br>When, as Joseph F. Smith said, we "catch a spark from the awakened memories of the immortal soul," let us be quietly grateful. And when of great truths we can come to say "I know," that powerful spiritual witness may also carry with it the sense of our having known before. With rediscovery, what we are really saying is, "I know--again!" No wonder that, so often, real teaching is mere reminding.<br><br>God bless you and keep you, my special friends, to the end that you will each carry out all of the assignments given to you so very long ago. You have been measured and found adequate for the challenges that will face you as citizens of the kingdom of God; of that you should have a deep inner assurance. Be true to that trust, as all of us must, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Neal A.

<h1>sion to “The Uttermost Part of the Earth&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a great honor and privilege for me to be here tonight, and I particularly want to welcome President Dallin Oaks, who is a Regional Representative; other Regional Representatives who are here; and other key school and church officials. We are all proud of the achievements and goals of this University, and of the devotion of the leaders of these fourteen stakes and 137 wards. We acknowledge that this assembly tonight is unique; and in this present academic world, to say it is unique is a major understatement. I pray that I might have the spirit of the Lord with me, so that I might say things that would be appropriate for you to hear; but I pray also that you may be able to hear and witness and understand the thoughts I hope will be appropriate for you this Sunday night.<br><br>The choir sang "O Divine Redeemer." You may not have listened carefully to the words; let me repeat a few. "O Divine Redeemer--turn<i>me</i>not away--receive me tho' unworthy. Hear my cry--behold<i>my</i>distress--have mercy, Lord, on thy servant. Hear me, crying out for mercy--please, Lord, protect my soul." I would say to you, is this not pleading to the Lord to overlook some failures, perhaps? Would comparable statements be: "I didn't quite understand--I'll do better if I have another chance--my heart wanted to follow you, so please give me another chance"--or perhaps, "Now, I understand, O Lord--hear my cry"? I do not know the author of those words, but he gives us a rather dramatic view of an encounter we must all face--when we are judged and assigned to our appropriately earned kingdom beyond.<br><br>We learn from divine statements and truths contained in the scriptures of two great missions of the Master. The first was to atone and ransom mankind from the effects of the fall of Adam, as part of the plan accepted in the Grand Council in Heaven.<i>He is our Redeemer.</i>And he is also our Savior, for the Father sent his Son to be the Savior of the world and to bring salvation to all--to "all who believe in his name." "To save that which was lost"--to save people from their sins--this is his second mission. The Savior taught mankind how to live, how to serve, how to worship; and he taught the principles of the gospel--this gospel which will bring men back into the presence of our Heavenly Father.<br><br>A few weeks ago President Kimball spoke to our Regional Representatives, who had assembled from all parts of the world. All of the General Authorities were also in attendance at this very solemn but historic assembly to receive instruction and counsel, "to be built up in faith and testimony" (quoted from President Kimball, Regional Representatives Seminar, September 29, 1978), and to reaffirm to these Church leaders our mission: to assist in saving the souls of mankind and to focus on the things that matter most.<br><br>In this comprehensive review of the Church's progress, we could sense again his--that is, the president's--anxiety and concern for this work. We who are near our prophet sense his restlessness--because time is moving swiftly, and the world population is growing. But the keys of the kingdom and salvation are here and available to all. We--all of us here tonight--are His disciples.<br><br>Of the Regional Representatives, President Kimball asked, "What did the Lord mean when he stood atop the Mount of Olives and said to the Twelve, '... and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto<i>the uttermost part of the earth</i>' (Acts 1:8; emphasis added)?" "The uttermost part of the earth"? Everywhere? Our prophet then remarked, "We have hardly scratched the surface."<br><br>It was the Lord himself who directed that the "gospel must be preached unto every creature" (D&amp;amp;C 58:64). It was President Kimball, our living prophet, who has said to you and to me that we must find the way to proclaim the gospel and declare its restoration to all mankind. Does President Kimball mean that you are involved? Of course!<br><br>"Why me?" you might ask. "Others can do it--I'm so busy." May I remind you that when you accepted baptism, you made a covenant: (a) to come into the fold of God; (b) to take upon you the name of Christ; (c) to bear one another's burdens; (d) to stand as a witness to God at all times, in all places, and in all things, and to serve God and keep his commandments. And if you do these things, the Lord has promised that he will: (a) pour out his spirit upon you, and (b) grant unto you redemption and eternal life (see Mosiah 18:8–10, 13).<br><br>Need I ask, after reminding you of your baptismal covenant--are you part of this heaven-inspired and heaven-directed obligation to teach all mankind? Does the Lord or any of His prophets force you to do His will? Of course not! But the promised rewards are almost beyond our conception. Listen carefully to His promise: "All thrones and dominions, principalities and powers, shall be revealed and set forth upon all who have endured valiantly for the gospel of Jesus Christ" (D&amp;amp;C 121:29).<br><br>The apostle Peter, senior apostle and head of the Church after the Savior had left the earth, in a teaching opportunity asked, "What manner of persons ought ye to be ... ?" (2 Peter 3:11). He counseled--<br><br><i>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; ... the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.</i><br><br>[Peter continued:]<i>Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved,</i>[that is, the elements and materials rearranged or reorganized,] what manner of persons ought ye to be...?<br><br>[And then he said,]<i>... Be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.</i><br><br><i>... Seeing ye know these things ..., beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own steadfastness.</i><br><br><i>... Grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</i>[2 Peter 3:10–11, 14, 17–18; emphasis added]<br><br>The apostle Peter encouraged and strengthened the saints anciently so they could spread the gospel and save the souls of mankind. Now, in a similar manner, President Kimball, the Lord's prophet, is sounding the trumpet for us today to do what?--(a) to live lives of perfection; and (b) to acquire all the knowledge possible--communication skills and language ability--so that we can move with greater speed in reaching the millions of people in strange-sounding places with strange-sounding names who have been prepared and will receive the gospel.<br><br>What does the Lord expect of you? What is your role in this divine drama? Consider--has the Lord not brought the Church out of obscurity? Are not the temples dotting the landscape? Are not the satellites stationed in the heavens ready to beam the message? Are not needed facilities and technical skills available, new developments in radio and television communication being unfolded?<br><br>We have, I suppose, nearly 20,000 people in this audience tonight. Would ten people on the front row please stand? This is about the proportion of Mormons in the world in relation to the total world population, if we have twenty thousand people here tonight. Now would five of you please sit down? May I remind you that the five standing represent the active participating members of the Church. You five must convert the other 19,990 in this building--but I say unto you, you must hurry. In a few years the world population will double to eight billion.<br><br>Our prophet reminds us that "the uttermost part of the earth" not only means the millions in America, but all of Central and South America, all of the Far East, all of Europe, all of Africa. (More than one-tenth of the world's four billion souls live on the African continent.) China, the third largest country, has nearly one billion people--over half speak Mandarin. Will you be prepared to teach them? And as the prophet asks, will you be prepared to take the gospel to India's three-quarter billion, to Burma, to Saudi Arabia, or to the 41 million Moslems in Turkey? We are promised that when we are ready--properly prepared as people--barriers will gradually be penetrated and political hard lines will soften. Today, Poland is an example of what will take place. We understand that many people are now going to church in Russia.<br><br>In a few years, will we not feel as comfortable and be as familiar speaking of cities in Bangladesh, Iraq, Malaysia, Yugoslavia, and the Ukraine as we now are of speaking of Sydney, Tokyo, Geneva, Walla Walla, and Mexico City? President Kimball reminds us that there is no reason why the Lord would open doors or break down iron or bamboo curtains if we are unprepared to enter.<br><br>How can we, he says, be satisfied with two hundred thousand converts a year out of a world of four billion who need the gospel? We are often reminded of Sarah, the wife of Abraham, laughing when told that at her age of ninety years she would have a son. How could she bear children? Yet she did have a son as promised by the Lord. Abraham was to become the father of nations. Is anything too hard for the Lord? Is there anything impossible to Him? If He commands His gospel to be taken to "the uttermost part of the earth," will he not open the way--if the carriers of the message are ready and prepared?<br><br>If each of you was asked to outline what qualities messengers--those authorized to carry Christ's gospel of salvation unto the expanding proselyting world--must have if they were to succeed, your outline would probably include a personal, growing faith in and knowledge of God the Father and Jesus Christ--a knowledge that would be sufficient for one's salvation and a faith such that His saving principles would have become part of one's life. In addition, this outline would include good works and a desire to serve mankind as evidenced by positive actions. Did not the Lord teach as fundamental "... Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them..." (Matthew 7:12)?<br><br>Would your outline not also include the love of people? Love, but with the measuring rod He built in--one must love people to the same degree that he loves himself or it really does not matter. One must be considerate of others and, in addition, not steal, not lie, not cheat, not bear false witness, not plan to take another's life. And then you would include the keeping of God's commandments--all of them. One cannot just pick and choose. "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15).<br><br>When President Kimball indicates an uneasiness about our present pace in converting the world, his concern is not limited to missionaries and baptisms, important though they are, but extends to the development of our teaching and training skills to strengthen and build up the millions of people who will eventually "come unto Christ." Many of you have been on missions, and you say, "I served my two years." Did not President Kimball explain <a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/spencer-w-kimball_honor-2/"><span style="color: #33cccc;">a few months ago on this campus</span> </a>that your mission has no time limit, but could last one hundred years, two hundred years, or whatever might be needed? If you see your role clearly, your two-year mission was a prep school preparing you for further involvement, somewhere in the world, in assisting new members to understand and live the Savior's teachings. You may serve a number of calls as you respond to the needs of an expanding Church reaching out to "the uttermost part of the earth."<br><br>Plan your professional and family goals so that you will have a part in this vision of our prophet. Prepare to reach out and to bless more people--keep your life in harmony. What a blessing to have a living prophet in our midst! You can see him, you can hear his voice, you can read his messages to the world, you can shake his hand and look into his piercing eyes. We sing "Come, listen to a prophet's voice, and hear the words of God"--do you get that feeling when you talk about him? To us he is so human and gentle and spiritual, and yet so forceful. We understand what he means.<br><br>Our civilization is entering into troubling times--times that are fed and nourished by people who scoff at divine truths, who scoff at Bible references or at such terms as "under God" or "in God we trust" or at references made to the framers of the Constitution being wise men raised up for that very purpose (see D&amp;amp;C 101: 80).<br><br>The part you will play in the coming years is critical. It is meant that all of you be strong--not weaklings tossed to and fro, but valiant leaders who enter the fray as defenders of truth and right. Troubled times require valiant men and women like you--products of this great University and of these student stakes who, in a spirit of love and hope, will teach the world correct moral principles and high ethical standards. Who else will, if you do not?<br><br>Some polls indicate that a congressman from New York State, an admitted contributor to the delinquency of a 16-year-old boy, will likely be reelected to Congress. Moral standards? Who cares? I guess some might think that way. A congressman from Michigan convicted a few days ago of 29 counts of mail fraud and embezzling money will likely be reelected ("How Morality Declines in the U.S. Congress,"<i>Deseret News</i>, October 31, 1978). Perhaps others will be elected on this coming Tuesday who have demonstrated dishonesty, immorality, and disregard for traditional moral standards. A highly respected political writer wrote:<br><br><i>The critical weakness of our society is that ... our people do not have great purposes which they are united in wanting to achieve. The public mood of the country is defensive, to hold on and to conserve, not to push forward and to create. We talk about ourselves these days as if we were a completed society, one which has achieved its purposes, and has no further great business to transact.</i>[John J. Jessup,<i>The National Purpose,</i>Walter Lippman, quoted on p. 1]<br><br>Sometimes we hear people say, "The world has changed--the Church is out of step with modern times. The old religious laws don't apply any more." Similar voices were heard by the apostle Paul, who wrote:<br><br><i>In the last days perilous times shall come.</i><br><br><i>For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous ..., blasphemers, disobedient to parents, ... lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.</i>[2 Timothy 3:1–4]<br><br>Who will be the strong, powerful voice and influence to stem such a tide?<i>It must be you</i>. You are in training, but you must believe and live Christ's teachings if you are to fill your hoped-for destiny in this world.<br><br>Your outline of qualifications to become one of the messengers for the Savior would include that one must be morally and sexually pure. I recall the testimony of a young lady at a stake conference in which she told of her dating years. Her mother had helped her to understand the pitfalls. Now a young wife living in an army base, she could look at her husband sitting on the stand at church--a member of the Sunday School presidency--and be proud of him, remembering their wonderful courtship and relationship: married in the temple, nothing to hide, no regrets. She told how they were tempted. But their goal was the temple. They knew the difference between a pure kiss and necking. They knew that virtue is lost by degrees. Their plans were carefully thought out, avoiding the parked car on a lonely road and the late hours alone and the steady dating. She wore a single pearl necklace throughout her courtship as a reminder to remain virtuous.<br><br>You can avoid the tragedy, the heartbreak, the suffering of sexual impropriety. You control your circumstances. You know the pitfalls--why not use time together constructively in wholesome activities or uplifting discussions? Study together. Do you really know each other? Do you really? Take time to expand your minds. Have gospel discussions. Can you read or speak Russian? Mandarin Chinese? Why not try it? My wife is taking Spanish 101 at the University of Utah now. There is so much to learn.<br><br>Can you imagine a greater waste of your parents' money, saved for your education, than going to filthy movies or buying porno-type magazines? Man's reproductive ability was divinely created for family development but today is cheapened and degraded to some animal behavior. Never, never permit yourself to compromise God's instructions. "Thou shalt not," he said. "... Whoremongers and adulterers God will judge," he has recorded (Hebrews 13:4). "Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? Or who shall stand in his holy place? He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart." (Psalm 24:3–4).<br><br>Have pride in your personal being, your appearance, your clothes, your manners. Learn to say thank you. Learn to speak well, pronouncing correctly and clearly. You need not look like some television character, and I hope you will not, because you are different--you have a divine obligation.<br><br>I hope that your personal outline for true messengers of the Lord will include the Savior's instruction that his disciples be family oriented. Men and women marry--they marry forever--not as an experiment or a trial. They love each other and none other, forever. They raise eternal families and fulfill God's law to multiply and replenish the earth.<br><br>Dr. Elliot Landau wrote recently of a survey taken over fifty years ago of some fifteen hundred children in public schools in California with IQs well over 135--all of a genius caliber. They have been located and interviewed now that fifty years have gone by and they were asked what had given them the most satisfaction in life. The majority of these individuals, now in their late sixties, said that their family had given them the most satisfaction and came first--came before their profession or friends or the making of money.<br><br>Is it not interesting how the centuries-old basics of true happiness and fulfillment keep returning--because they are true, solid, never-changing? After a lifetime of study, the world-famous historian and philosopher, Will Durrant, now 92--a man who had never been considered religious--recently wrote, "My final lesson of history after all my study is the same as that of Jesus, 'Love one another.'"<br><br>The Savior time and time again has stressed the commandment to love one another. It is the golden thread woven into His gospel. As the result of a recent revelation to our prophet, all the people of the world must hear Christ's teachings--<i>all</i>the people of the world. In this brief period that we have been together hopefully your vision has been broadened as you reflect on your personal obligation.<br><br>This University advertises that "The World is Our Campus." May I also add that the world is yours to convert. Many of the needed new techniques and communications approaches will develop on this campus--but most important will be your heart and your desire. Cultivate Christlike qualities and you will be "anxiously engaged," as you have been instructed to be, in this great cause. You, my dear young friends, can and will be such an influence for good. The Lord needs your imprint on the world. Someone has written:<br><br><i>Nothing touches the soul but leaves its impress, and thus, little by little, we are fashioned into the image of all we have seen and heard, known and meditated; and if we learn to live with all that is fairest and purest and best, the love of it all will, in the end, become our very life.</i><br><br>President Harold B. Lee, who so much loved this great University and all that it represents, taught us:<br><br><i>You cannot lift another soul until you are standing on higher ground than he is. You must be sure, if you would rescue the man, that you yourself are setting the example of what you would have him be. You cannot light a fire in another soul unless it is burning in your own soul.</i>[<i>Conference Report,</i>April 1973, p. 178]<br><br>Now as I leave you with my witness and my testimony and my blessings, I want all of you to know that I<i>know</i>--that I do not just hope or anticipate, but that sacred experiences have been mine, one only a few weeks ago in the temple--that God lives, that He is real, that He is our Father, that He loves us, and that Jesus Christ is His Son, the Only Begotten of the Father in the flesh. I know this to be true.<br><br>I know that President Kimball is a prophet of God. I know that the temple is the house of the Lord. I leave you with my witness and my blessing that your own vision might be broadened, that you too will<i>know,</i>that someday, somewhere, somehow you will desire to go with others to "the uttermost part of the earth." May you be so blessed, I pray in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>David B. Haight was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 5 November 1978.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>het—Our North Star - J. Thomas Fyans - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The other evening as I was anticipating this most humbling and challenging moment for me, I imagined I heard the exquisite music of this hour. These thoughts, perhaps inadequately expressed, came to my mind, and I penned them in tribute to your selfless sharing of your talents. So, a tribute to you who have shared your talent with us.<br><h2><b><i>Tribute to the Arts</i></b></h2><br><i>The arts are like a rainbow's hue,</i><br><i>As heaven paints an exquisite view.</i><br><i>We are quickened and see in the air</i><br><i>A beauty that a moment before wasn't there.</i><br><br><i>The echo of distant yesterdays,</i><br><i>Moves us to express heartfelt praise.</i><br><i>The promise of the unborn tomorrow,</i><br><i>Restless stirs as we from your talents borrow.</i><br><br><i>Lifted to this higher plane,</i><br><i>Remembrance of you we will sustain.</i><br><i>We pray blessings will you attend,</i><br><i>As your talents--from life's cares--us defend.</i><br><br>Thank you--thank you for your beautiful rendition of those uplifting presentations and representations of your talent.<br><br>Life is a journey. To get our bearings in the northern hemisphere, we look to the North Star. (In the southern hemisphere, we look to the Southern Cross.) The North Star is always there. Sometimes it is dimmed by the light of day or the haze of clouds at night, but it is still there. It is but the vision to see that we lack.<br><br>There are few sights as beautiful as a starry, clear night. We look at the handiwork of the Creator of the universe and are lifted and thrilled by the view. It seems that our sight penetrates the forever--that is, our physical sight.<br><br>There is another sight that is vital. It is insight--spiritual in<i>sight</i>. How do we utilize this to overcome the dimness of the day and the haze and clouds of the night--to see the insightful star, the handiwork of the Creator? It helps us to look in the right direction--to brush aside the dimness, the haze, the clouds--and see the spiritual directing handiwork of the Creator. A prophet of God is like the North Star. We get our collective bearings from him.<br><br>Let us journey through time. What will we be doing November 7, 2078? What are we learning that we will use in 2078? 3078? 4078? What must we know a millennium from now--two millennia from now--three millennia from now--unnumbered millennia from now? We must know that the star is there. We must reckon our position by that star. Those directional rays of light will lead our journey to safety.<br><br>In the Doctrine and Covenants, chapter 1, verses 37 and 38, we learn this:<br><br><i>Search these commandments, for they are true and faithful, and the</i>prophecies<i>and promises which are in them shall all be fulfilled.</i><br><br><i>What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken; ... my word shall not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.</i>[emphasis added]<br><br>The apparent source of a prophecy is from a prophet, but when a prophet speaks, in one sense it is not he speaking. He is a carefully prepared channel for a communication that springs from the headwaters and flows down into the valley to feed thirsty souls. This is the Lord speaking, using and inspiring the mind of his servant, the prophet. So the prophet is the chosen enunciator of the inspiration that rises up within him from that omnipotent and omniscient being, our loving Heavenly Father.<br><br>It is like the crystalline water that courses down from the heights of the majestic mountain, flowing from the white, pure snow that has come down from the heavens. The snow does not originate from the mountain peak. It is placed there by a divine providence to flow into the valley and green the crops--to give us the succulent red apples of harvest time, the orange pumpkins, the sweetness of crisp, tender celery--to produce the bounties of nature, or a symmetrical tree, or a colorful, radiant flower. This is a visual and physical effect that we can observe.<br><br>From the prophet flows the living water to quench our spiritual thirst.<br><br>Let us listen to a heaven–sent truth as revealed in Old Testament times. "Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets" (Amos 3:7). There arise in our minds, then, these questions: What is a prophet? How certain are his admonitions? What is the penalty for not giving heed to them? What are the promises given for believing in his words? Let us look at latter-day scripture for guidance in our quest for answers. First,<i>what is a prophet?</i><br><br><i>And again, the duty of the President of the office of the High Priesthood is to preside over the whole church, and to be like unto Moses--</i><br><br><i>Behold, here is wisdom; yea, to be a seer, a revelator, a translator, and a prophet, having</i>all<i>the gifts of God which he bestows upon the head of the church.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 107:91–92; emphasis added]<br><br>What is a prophet? He has<i>all</i>the gifts of God.<br><br>1 Corinthians 12 begins, "Now concerning spiritual gifts ..." --and there follows in this chapter an expression of many gifts. The same theme continues in the next two chapters. We are admonished to "desire spiritual gifts" (1 Corinthians 14:1). Many gifts are also spoken of in the 46th section of the Doctrine and Covenants. In verse 29 we read: "That unto some it may be given to have all those gifts, that there may be a head, in order that every member may be profited thereby."<br><br>What a North Star to guide us!<br><br>Question number two:<i>How certain are his admonitions?</i>"And ... the earth may know that the mouths of the prophets shall not fail." We find this in sacred scripture (D&amp;amp;C 58:8).<br><br>Now, number three:<i>What is the penalty for not giving heed to them?</i>"And the arm of the Lord shall be revealed; and the day cometh that they who will not hear the voice of the Lord, neither the voice of his servants, neither give heed to the words of the prophets and apostles, shall be cut off from among the people" (D&amp;amp;C 1:14).<br><br>And now to question number four:<i>What are the promises given for believing in his words?</i><br><br><i>Not only those who believed after he came in the meridian of time, in the flesh, but all those from the beginning, even as many as were before he came, who</i>believed<i>in the</i>words of the holy prophets,<i>who spake as they were inspired by the gift of the Holy Ghost, who truly testified of him in all things, should have eternal life.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 20:26; emphasis added]<br><br>Let us observe the Lord's anointed of today: President Spencer W. Kimball. May we first move back in time thirty years when, touched by the promise to the Lamanites in the Book of Mormon and other scriptures, he was lifted to a prophetic vantage point and pierced the future. He said in 1947, "The Lamanites must rise in majesty and power" (<i>Conference Report</i>[hereinafter referred to as<i>CR</i>], October 1947, p. 22).<br><br>In that day, in Central America, there were fewer than one hundred members of the Church, and in Mexico less than five thousand, about half of whom were up in the Mormon colonies. Now, after thirty years have passed, what is the situation? Central America has moved from less than one hundred members to over forty thousand. Mexico now has in excess of two hundred thousand members of the Church. Convert baptisms in Mexico and Central America in 1974 were 16,500; in 1975 they increased to 21,500. In 1976, there were 38,500 convert baptisms in one year. With those 38,500 came over twelve thousand children of record composing 7,521 families. Another way to state it is that in the year 1976 over fifty thousand eternal spirits came into the Kingdom. "The Lamanites must rise in majesty and power."<br><br>"We must look forward to the day [continues President Kimball,] ... when they shall have economic security, culture, refinement, and education; when they shall be operating farms and businesses and industries and shall be occupied in the professions and in teaching" (<i>CR,</i>October 1947, p. 22). And at that time there were very few professional people among the members of the Church in Mexico and Central America.<br><br>Listen to this list describing stake presidencies, high councilors, and bishops in the Mexico City area: Engineers in all areas--agronomy, biochemistry, mechanics, aeronautics, petroleum research, topography, civil construction, and electrical power--doctors of medicine (including surgeons), dentists, nurses, business managers, tailors, carpenters, building contractors, teachers, school administrators, pediatricians, C.P.A.s, auto mechanics, business machine repairmen, blacksmiths, insurance agents--and the list goes on. And I was informed just a few moments ago that on this Friday in Mexico City there will be sixteen master's degrees conferred upon Mexican nationals by Brigham Young University. They are responding, as you see, to the promptings that have come to them as described in this statement of the prophet.<br><br>President Kimball continues, "... when they shall be organized into wards and stakes of Zion" (<i>CR,</i>October 1047, p.22). In that day there was one stake in Mexico and Central America, in the Mormon colonies. As we look at Mexico today its stakes are like stakes in Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego as we move down the coast--except that the names down there would be Tijuana, Mexicali, Ciudad Obregón, Hermosillo, and Culiacán. As we would move inland to Salt Lake and Denver, in Mexico we would move to Ciudad Juarez, to Chihuahua, to Torreón. And moving farther east to the Chicago area would be like moving to Piedras Negras and Monclova and Monterrey, where there are four stakes.<br><br>Moving farther east, we would be in Valle Hermoso; and then, moving south to Mexico as if on the eastern border of the United States, we come to Tampico. Just up from Tampico we have Ciudad Victoria; and then, continuing on down the coast line, there is Poza Rica with two stakes, Veracruz with two stakes, and just inland in Orizaba another stake. Continuing on south we find Minatitlán, and up in the toe of the Yucatan Peninsula Merida, with two stakes. Moving closer to Mexico City, we find a stake in Guadalajara, another stake on the other side of Mexico City, three stakes in Puebla, and fifteen stakes close to Mexico City itself. All told, we find over fifty stakes in that part of the vineyard, approaching five hundred wards. "The Lamanites must rise in majesty and power."<br><br>Yet another sentence of yesterday with future promise from President Kimball reads, "When they shall build and occupy and fill the temples, and serve in them ..." (<i>CR,</i>October 1947, p. 22). Within the past few days, a temple has been dedicated by the prophet of the Lord in Saõ Paulo, Brazil, and a temple in Mexico is in the final preparations for construction. We now look somewhat to the past to see the fulfillment of this prophecy.<br><br>The prophet has the vision to see the welfare of every living soul now on the face of the earth. Let us listen to a current, modern, far-reaching revelation--I now refer to the revelation of which you are all aware, but let me repeat it for emphasis.<br><br><i>As we have witnessed the expansion of the work of the Lord over the earth, we have been grateful that people of many nations have responded to the message of the restored gospel, and have joined the Church in ever-increasing numbers. This, in turn, has inspired us with a desire to extend to every worthy member of the Church all of the privileges and blessings which the gospel affords.</i><br><br><i>Aware of the promises made by the prophets and presidents of the Church who have preceded us that at some time, in God's eternal plan, all of our brethren who are worthy may receive the priesthood, and witnessing the faithfulness of those from whom the priesthood has been withheld, we have pleaded long and earnestly in behalf of these, our faithful brethren, spending many hours in the Upper Room of the Temple supplicating the Lord for divine guidance.</i><br><br><i>He has heard our prayers, and by revelation has confirmed that the long-promised day has come when every faithful, worthy man in the Church may receive the holy priesthood, with power to exercise its divine authority, and enjoy with his loved ones every blessing that flows therefrom, including the blessings of the temple. Accordingly, all worthy male members of the Church may be ordained to the priesthood without regard for race or color. Priesthood leaders are instructed to follow the policy of carefully interviewing all candidates for ordination to either the Aaronic or the Melchizedek Priesthood to insure that they meet the established standards for worthiness.</i><br><br><i>We declare with soberness that the Lord has now made known His will for the blessing of all His children throughout the earth who will hearken to the voice of His authorized servants, and prepare themselves to receive every blessing of the gospel.</i>[<i>Ensign,</i>July 1978, p. 75]<br><br>President Kimball looks to the future--the billions who await the blessings of the gospel. And I quote from President Kimball now:<br><br><i>The day is coming, and not too far ahead of us, when all temples on this earth will be going night and day. There will be shifts, of course, and people will be coming in morning hours of the day and throughout the day and we will have no vacations for the temples. But there will be a core of workers, night and day, almost to exhaustion because of the importance of the work and the great number of people who lie asleep in the eternity and who are craving, needing the blessings that come to them.</i><br><br>This expression is made in a day when many temples in the world are not operating at capacity, and on schedules considerably less than around the clock. We will watch the fulfillment of this prophecy.<br><br>Now continuing with President Kimball:<br><br><i>We are all familiar with the prediction of the Prophet Brigham Young, who saw the day when there would be hundreds of temples. It has even been spoken, thousands of temples. Of course, that will take time, but we can promise you many additional temples which will someday dot this land and the other lands of our world, of Europe, Asia, South America, the Islands of the Sea. Before temples are built in greater numbers we must, of course, prepare for them.</i><br><br>Temple building is at a higher level of activity than at any time in this dispensation. We are being moved toward the realization of the truths in this prophecy.<br><br>Now an expression of urgency from him whom we revere.<br><br><i>Most members of the Church are aware of our intense interest in the missionary work in the Church and the appeals we have made in many lands for the rededication to preaching the gospel and preparing missionaries to carry the good news of the restoration to people everywhere. I feel the same sense of urgency about temple work for the dead as I do about the missionary work since they are basically one and the same. I have told my brethren of the General Authorities that this work for the dead is constantly on my mind.</i>[Genealogical Seminar, Brigham Young University, August 1977]<br><br>As President Kimball expresses his intense interest in missionary work, we are brought to the realization of the tremendous growth in the Church. It is anticipated that one thousand stakes will be approved for organization before the end of this year, and, if time permits, may even be organized. His urgency expressed toward temple work and the preparations for it will see fulfillment in the implementation of the records extraction program in genealogy where literally millions of names are now being made available from around the world.<br><br>To respond to the challenges of this great growth and expansion of the Church, he has reached into the implications of the revelations of the past. In Doctrine and Covenants 107:34, we read: "The Seventy are to act in the name of the Lord, under the direction of the Twelve or the traveling high council, in building up the church and regulating all the affairs of the same in all nations, first unto the Gentiles and then to the Jews." In October 1976 general conference, President Kimball made the following inspired utterance.<br><br><i>Since the accelerated, worldwide growth of the Church requires a consolidation of its administrative functions at the general level, the First Presidency and the Quorum of Twelve, with the concurrence of the Assistants to the Twelve and the First Quorum of the Seventy, have felt inspired to call all of the Assistants to the Twelve into the First Quorum of the Seventy, to call four new members into the Quorum, and to restructure the First Council of Seventy.</i><br><br><i>With this move, the three governing quorums of the Church defined by the revelations--the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, and the First Quorum of the Seventy--have been set in their places as revealed by the Lord. This will make it possible to handle efficiently the present heavy workload and to prepare for the increasing expansion and acceleration of the work, anticipating the day when the Lord will return to take direct charge of His Church and kingdom.</i>[<i>Ensign,</i>November 1976, p. 9]<br><br>Let us look at the organization of the Church. In the 107th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, we are enlightened concerning the principles of the power and authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood.<br><br>Verse 18 says: "The power and authority of the higher, or Melchizedek Priesthood, is to hold the keys of all the spiritual blessings of the Church. The twenty-second verse says: "Of the Melchizedek Priesthood, three presiding high priests, chosen by the body, appointed and ordained to that office, and upheld by the confidence, faith, and prayer of the church, form a quorum of the Presidency of the Church."<br><br>Twenty-third verse--the Twelve Apostles: "The twelve traveling councilors are called to be the Twelve Apostles, or special witnesses of the name of Christ in all the world." And the Seventy--verse 25: "The Seventy are also called to preach the gospel, and to be especial witnesses unto the Gentiles and in all the world."<br><br>The formation of the First Quorum of the Seventy has now prepared the way to deploy Area Supervisors out in the world--Elder Kikuchi in Japan, who supervises Japan and Korea; Elder de Jager in Hong Kong to move the work forward in Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand; Elder Didier in Belgium, having the responsibility for many nations. These Brethren and others from the First Quorum of Seventy can give close, firsthand attention to the progress of the Church throughout the world where the Church is now established. The kingdom of God is rolling forth to prepare for the kingdom of heaven that will come (see D&amp;amp;C 65:6).<br><br>Now what of 2078? 3078? 4078? Where is your North Star for millennia from now? Will you heed his counsel of today to prepare you for tomorrow?<br><br>Here is a servant of the Lord who has the spiritual sensitivity to await the promptings of the Spirit and, when distilled upon from the heavens, has the courage to move forward fearlessly. There is a living prophet today. He is a reflector of the will of our Heavenly Father.<br><br>This is the Church of Jesus Christ. Jesus is our Redeemer. I bear you solemn witness that he lives. I witness unto you that God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ appeared in our day and reestablished the authority so that the gospel could be here. I pray humbly that the blessings of heaven will descend upon every one of you individually, that you will know there is a North Star; and that North Star, a prophet of God, receives its inspiration and direction from heaven. May we be blessed to watch, understand, and obey the prophet of God, I pray humbly in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>J.

<h1>ve in Prophecy - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
After an introduction like that and the beautiful song we just heard, I ought to be able to say something even if I am nearly a hundred years old. I greet you all this morning; I feel highly honored in having been invited to come and occupy this place to speak to you, particularly since I have learned that you have two thousand Mormon missionaries sitting over here on the right-hand side. I greet all of you and tell you how happy I am and how much I love this institution and its officers and its faculty and you students who are here today.<br><br>During the past week we have celebrated Thanksgiving Day, and I suppose all of you have counted your blessings. I counted mine, and after doing so I figured that I was about the most blessed man in the world--but I shall not take time to tell you why, because it would take too long. Then I thought of having to speak to you here this morning. I assume that all of you have reasons to be grateful, and one of them is that you are privileged to be students at this great institution. Not all of our youth have the privilege of attending a Church institution like this, where you sit in classes with men of God who have faith and testimony and who not only teach you the words of your lessons but inspire you to want to live to be something worthwhile in the world. There are those who have opposite opportunities. I thought, as I tried to decide what to talk about today, that I would use for a text a couple of little experiences that are opposite to your experience here.<br><br>A few years ago I attended a conference in Ogden. One of the presidents of the Young Men's organization of the entire Church also attended that meeting, and I had him speak. In his talk he said that a professor in one of our non-Mormon universities threw out a question like this in his class: "Is there anyone in this class who believes that there is any way in the world that one can know a thing is going to happen before it happens?" Nobody answered. Then he said, "I am glad to know that none of you believes in that silly idea of your parents that one can know a thing by prophecy."<br><br>The speaker did not say any more about it, but when my turn came to speak I said, "If one of my children had been in that class they might not have said anything but they would have thought, 'The poor man; I feel sorry for him. He did not get his training out of the right books, or he would have known better than that.'"<br><br>Then I had another experience. One of our secretaries in the Church office building had a daughter attending a non-Mormon university. She had been in charge of the Junior Sunday School in her ward and had prayed with our people and so forth, but her professor had so destroyed her faith that she resigned from the Sunday School and refused even to kneel in prayer with her own family. Her mother came to me broken-hearted to see if she could get some help, and I said, "Well, I can't help her because I'm not a college graduate, but I know how I can get you some help. I can make an appointment with a man who can get her back on the track, I'm sure, if she is willing to fill the appointment." She was, so I made the appointment with Brother Henry Eyring, and he got her back to her place in the Church. A few years after that I was down in Los Angeles attending a conference; after the conference I ordained a young man a bishop, and I learned that he was the husband of this girl that I mentioned to you who had lost her faith temporarily in that university.<br><br>The teacher in the first story said that there is no way we can know a thing before it has transpired, but I like the statement of Isaiah that tells of the Lord "declaring the end from the beginning" (Isaiah 46:10). That is prophecy. The Lord had a definite program and he was able to declare it, and the way he declared it was through his holy prophets. Isaiah said, "The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever" (Isaiah 40:8). Peter said,<br><br><i>We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:</i><br><br><i>Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.</i><br><br><i>For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</i>[2 Peter 1:19–21]<br><br>That makes prophecy the word of the Lord, and we have many prophecies to that effect.<br><br>Jesus said, "Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me" (John 5:39). And truly the prophets did testify of him and his coming. They outlined his life and ministry almost in detail--how he should be born of a virgin, how he should be persecuted, how he should finally be betrayed for thirty pieces of silver, and how men would cast lots for his clothing at the time of his crucifixion.<br><br>Not only did the prophets foretell his coming in the meridian of times, but when he would come again in the latter days. Following his resurrection, as he walked along the way by two of his disciples on the way to Emmaus--and we are told that "their eyes were holden" that they did not recognize him--and as he heard what they had to say about him and his life, his ministry, his crucifixion, and his resurrection, he realized that they did not understand what he had been trying to teach them. So he said, "O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken," and commencing with Moses and the prophets, he showed them how in all things the prophets had testified of him (see Luke 24:13–27). Luke tells us that he "opened [the apostles'] understanding that they might understand the scriptures" (Luke 24:45). That is what the Lord has done in this, the dispensation of the fullness of times: he has opened the understanding of his prophets so that they understand the holy scriptures as no other people in the world really do.<br><br>In the Book of Mormon we are told in three places that we should study the prophecies of Isaiah, because they would all be fulfilled. I like to study the prophecies of Isaiah. It seems to me that he lived almost more in our day than when he was actually here upon the earth, for he saw so much of what would transpire in our day.<br><br>One of the prophecies of Isaiah that has impressed me ever since I was a boy was his prediction of the destruction of the great city of Babylon. At that time, Babylon was the greatest city in the entire world; yet Isaiah said that it would be destroyed, that it should become the abode of reptiles and wild animals, that the Arab would no more pitch his tent there, and he added that it shall never be rebuilt (see Isaiah 13:19–22). Can you imagine anyone today speaking of one of our great cities and saying that it would be destroyed and never be rebuilt? A few years ago President Kimball and Brother Hunter of the Twelve spent their holiday time over in the Holy Land, and when they returned I asked Brother Hunter, "Did you see Babylon?"<br><br>He said, "We saw what there was left of it." It has never been rebuilt to this day, and that is what the word of prophecy is when it comes inspired of the Lord.<br><br>As I said, we are told in three places to study Isaiah's prophecies because they would all be fulfilled. Then the Lord, when he taught the Nephites, said that in the day of their fulfillment it would be given to the people to understand them. There is no time to go into a lot of detail, but I would like to mention briefly a few of Isaiah's prophecies.<br><br>He saw the desert made to blossom as the rose; he saw us Mormons settle here in these valleys of the mountains and make it like a garden place; he saw the rivers flow in the desert where we have built these great irrigation canals, some of them larger than rivers, in order to water this arid land; he saw the rivers flow down from high places, where we have reservoired it in these mountain lakes to take care of our summer needs.<br><br>He saw the daughters of Zion come up and sing in the heights of Zion; and where in the history of the world can you find anything to fulfill that prophecy like the singing of the Tabernacle Choir, broadcast for over fifty years now without a break? And now, with the telstar, they sing to the entire world.<br><br>He saw the house of the God of Jacob established in the top of the mountains in the latter days, that all nations would flow unto it; and they would say, "Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths" (see Isaiah 2:2–3). I think that the temple in Salt Lake is the very house of the God of Jacob. When I think of the Saints attempting to build an edifice like that with nothing but their hands to build it with, a thousand miles from transportation, I feel that nobody except those who are inspired to righteous desires, such as our pioneer fathers and mothers were, could have undertaken a work like that.<br><br>Isaiah saw that people in all nations would say, "Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob." I fulfilled my first mission over in Holland before there were temples anywhere but here in the west, and when our people joined the Church the first thing they wanted to do was to come to America. They were willing to sacrifice everything--leave their homes and sell their furniture and give up their employment--just to come to Zion; and it was that temple that drew them here.<br><br>I had a very earnest investigator, a businessman, who said, "I'll never join your church."<br><br>I asked, "Why?"<br><br>He said, "I don't want to go to America."<br><br>"Good for you!" I said. "You just join the Church and stay right here and help to take care of these branches."<br><br>He had only been a member a few months when he came into my office one day and said, "Brother Richards, I have a chance to sell my business."<br><br>I asked, "What do you want to sell your business for?"<br><br>"Oh, I want to go to Zion," he said--and he came to that temple that Isaiah saw over three thousand years ago that would be built in the tops of the mountains and unto which all nations would flow, saying, "Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord," that they might walk in his ways and learn of his paths.<br><br>Isaiah saw the gathering of latter-day Israel. He saw the railroad train and the airplane. He said, "Who are these that fly . . . as the doves to their windows?" (Isaiah 60:80). He was not talking about birds, but about people. He told how their means of transportation would roar like the lion and would pick them up and bring them swiftly that they would not even have time to loosen the latchets of their shoes or to slumber or sleep.<br><br>This was illustrated when President McKay went to Europe a few years ago for the dedication of a chapel in the little town where his mother had been raised. Upon his return, he reported to us Brethren of the Twelve that he left London at two o'clock in the afternoon, spent a little time with the brethren in Chicago, and was in his own bed that night in Salt Lake. He did not have time to slumber or sleep, just as Isaiah saw all those thousands of years ago when the only means of travel were camels, oxen, donkeys, and so forth. President McKay then compared it with his parents' journey to Zion in the early days; they spent forty-three days on the water in a sailing vessel and then weeks getting across the plains. See what has happened just in this day when the Lord was to bring forth his work upon the earth!<br><br>These are just some of the visions of prophecy that Isaiah saw. He saw also the day when people would draw near him with their mouths and with their lips would honor him, yet their hearts would be far removed from him and they would teach for doctrine the precepts of men. Therefore, he said that the Lord would "proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid" (Isaiah 29:14). We have that "marvelous work and a wonder." It is a great thing the Lord has done in opening the heavens and sending holy messengers back to this earth to restore the keys of his gospel and the various responsibilities in his Church to prepare the way for his Second Coming.<br><br>There are many more prophecies, such as those of John when he was banished upon the Isle of Patmos. He saw the power that would be given to Satan to make war with the saints and to overcome them and to reign over every nation; then he "saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people" (see Revelation 13:7; 14:6). The everlasting gospel is the only gospel that can save us, and that we learn through revelation; for John told us that the Lord would bring it forth to be preached to every nation.<br><br>Then we have the testimony of Jesus himself of the signs of his Second Coming. There is no time to go into the details, but he told about the wars, the rumors of wars, the pestilence, the earthquakes, the famine, and so forth; then he said, "This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come" (Matthew 24:14; see also Joseph Smith 1:31).<br><br>We honor not only the dead prophets today, but we honor the living prophets. Before I close I would like to read you one statement uttered by President Wilford Woodruff in the general conference back in 1898. He told about the time he first met the Prophet Joseph Smith in a testimony meeting of the priesthood where many of the brethren bore testimony of the Restoration. When they were through, the Prophet said,<br><br><i>Brethren, I have been very much edified and instructed in your testimonies here tonight, but I want to say to you before the Lord that you know no more about the future destiny of this Church and kingdom than a babe upon its mother's lap. You don't comprehend it; it is only a little handful of priesthood you see here tonight, but this Church will fill North and South America, it will fill the world, it will fill the Rocky Mountains,</i>[and this was fourteen years before our first pioneer group came here to the Rocky Mountains,]<i>and there they will open the door for the establishment of the gospel among the Lamanites.</i>[<i>Relief Society Magazine,</i>50, no. 8 (August 1963): 619]<br><br>If you could realize just how much the Lamanites are responding to the Church today--they are converting by the thousands. He said that it would "fill North and South America"; if he were not a prophet, how could he make such a statement as that? We believe in the living prophets.<br><br>I want to read to you just one little excerpt from the<i>Time</i>magazine of August 1978, discussing "Mormonism: A Kingdom Apart."<br><br><i>Just as the saints once made the desert bloom through honeybee-like enterprise, so have they made their church into the biggest, richest, strongest faith ever born on U.S. soil. It has grown fourfold since World War II to 4 million members including one million outside the United States.</i>[<i>Time,</i>7 August 1978, p. 54]<br><br>Is it not wonderful to talk about this marvelous work and wonder? (I've got to quit.)<br><br>I hope that you believe in living prophets today and that you will keep close to the Church. When Marion G. Romney was called to be an Assistant to the Twelve, President Grant said, "Marion, you keep your eye on the President of this Church and you'll never go astray." I say that to each of you today. He is a great leader; and if we will follow him with all our hearts and souls and give him the strength of our abilities and our prayers, this kingdom will continue to roll forward and, as the Prophet Joseph said, it will fill not only North and South America but it will fill the world. That is my testimony to you, and I pray God to bless you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>LeGrand Richares was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 28 November 1978.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.
